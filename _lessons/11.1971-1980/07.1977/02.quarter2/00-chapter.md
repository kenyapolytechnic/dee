                                hungry child. But Jesus
                                asked for it and the little
                                boy gave it gladly.
                                Suddenly he was part of a
                                miracle as thousands

                                to feed them all.

                                God is still multiplying gifts
                                today. This Sabbath, when

                                something to work with.

         2nd Quarter, 1977


  Dear Fellow Sabbath School Members,

  Once again the attention of the world church is focused on Southern Asia. The
  world missions report this quarter, will thrill your heart as you listen to
  the progress of the church in the various countries of the Southern Asia
  Division. Three projects will be blessed as a result of your generous Thirteen-
  th Sabbath Offering.

  1. The Ranchi Seventh-day Adventist Hospital was established a little over
  twenty-five years ago. Although situated in an industrial area, the hospital's
  major service is to rural patients. New additions this year will increase the
  bed capacity from fifty-six to ninety. At present the Division has only one
  full-fledged school of nursing. With the growth of the church the constituency
  feels the need for additional nurses training facilities. We, therefore, re-
  quest you to help us establish a nurses training program at Ranchi.

  2. Political barriers make it impossible for the Oriental Watchman Publish-
  ing Houe in Poona, India to supply the literature needs of the church in
  Pakistan. The church there is literally starving for the printed page. The
  Qasid Publishing House, Lahore has been established by Pakistan Union. Your
  gifts this thirteenth Sabbath will make it possible for them to begin this
  important function of the church in Pakistan.

   3. We present to you once again the need for further developing our only
   senior college in Southern Asia. The growing desire for further education and
   the increasingly difficult hurdles placed in the way of our young people in
   securing a higher education in government universities, makes it imperative
   for Spicer Memorial College to seek an autonomous status which will enable
   us to grant recognized degrees to graduates. Our greatest need is the develop-
   ment of the college library and science facilities.

   We have been recipients of your faithful stewardship in the past. You have
   helped us solve many of our growing pains and once again we want to thank you
   for those gifts and for what your assistance will help us accomplish in the
   future.

                                        Introduction

    This quarter's lessons will focus on Jesus, God become man. As the "Word" of
God, Jesus was concerned about making the mind and heart of God clear to man; as
the "Son of man," His chief goal was to convince the universe that the happiest,
safest, and healthiest way to live is God's way. Any theological subject worth consid-
ering should be some aspect of what Jesus made clear regarding God in His relation
to sin and the sinner.
   Over the centuries great biblical themes have become isolated from their connec-
tion with Jesus. The major reason for this misunderstanding is that Christian thinkers
became confused about Jesus. The misunderstanding by Christian thinkers of Jesus'
identity, origin, mission, and intercession seems automatically to warp and distort
their view of every other biblical topic.
   This quarter we shall study Jesus as man's model in every respect. There is nothing
that God asks of men and women for which He has not already provided a living
demonstration in Jesus Christ. "We are to look to the man Christ Jesus, who is
complete in the perfection of righteousness and holiness. He is the author and
finisher of our faith. He is the pattern man. His experience is the measure of the
experience that we are to gain. His character is our model. Let us, then, take our
minds off the perplexities and the difficulties of this life, and fix them on Him, that by
beholding we may be changed into His likeness. We may behold Christ to good
purpose. We may safely look to Him; for He is all-wise. As we look to Him and think of
Him, He will be formed within, the hope of glory."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 970.
   We should understand the great issues at stake in the universe, the original
purpose of God in creating this world, how the great controversy arose, and why sin
 was permitted. The plan of redemption, God's part and man's part, should be clear in
our minds. We must see the very personal aspect of sin, that it is more than ignorance
or poor performance; that it is essentially the rebellious thought and act that asserts
self over against the love and holiness of God. Uppermost in our minds must be the
 central role that Jesus has played in resolving the great controversy.
   Jesus, the Carpenter of Nazareth, came to this earth accepting "the results of the
 working of the great law of heredity." He was "subject to the weakness of humanity."
 He had "to fight the battle as every child of humanity must fight it, at the risk of failure
 and eternal loss."—The Desire of Ages, p. 49. He came "as one of us . .. to give an
 example of obedience. . . . He endured every trial to which we are subject. And He
 exercised in His own behalf no power that is not freely offered to us. . . . His life
 testifies that it is possible for us also to obey the law of God."—The Desire of Ages,
 p. 24.
   His life of obedience was also a life of dignity, joy, integrity, and winsomeness. Men,
 women, and children from all ranks of life were happy in His presence—unless they
 were uncomfortable with His unselfish purity. He was the example of what His
 followers should become. "Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the
 divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary
 and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His church.
    " ... The Saviour came to glorify the Father by the demonstration of His love; so the
 Spirit was to glorify Christ by revealing His grace to the world. The very image of God
 is to be reproduced in humanity."—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.
    Let us open our minds and hearts this quarter, imploring the Spirit to help us
 become more like our Lord, the model for man.
LESSON 1 March 27 - April 2




God With Us
  "They shall call his name Emmanuel,
which being interpreted is, God with
us" (Matt. 1:23).

    God is at the center of
everything—that is the supreme fact.
Life's meaning is either clarified by
that conviction or obscured by its
denial. The first question to ask about
God is not what man thinks about
God, but what God thinks about man.
It is what God thinks, does, and
reveals that gives meaning and
purpose to life. Without that

       JESUS, GOD IN
      EVERY RESPECT        "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
                         and the Word was God."
                           "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" (John
                         1:1, 14).

                        John clearly states that, before Creation, Jesus was already
                        there. In fact, before anything that had a beginning began,
                        Jesus already "was." Genesis 1:1 refers to the beginning of this
                        planet, and John declares that Jesus was already there as the
                        Creator. (See John 1:3.) In other words, the second member of
                        the Godhead, the Word of God, always "was." He, as God, never
                        "became." There was no time when the Word was not! He was
                        not created; He was God, this One whom we on earth have
                        known for the last 2000 years as Jesus.
                          Yet, in a special sense, a member of the Godhead "became"
                        Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus always was God in the fullest sense. He
                        "became" man. He was called "Jesus" when He "became"
                        man, an event often referred to as the incarnation.
                          John here grapples with almost impossible thoughts—the
                        eternal God became flesh, cabined within His own creation,
                        subject to time and space that He Himself had made! Wonder, 0
                        heavens! Be astonished, 0 earth!
                          Although the Word was and is everlasting, without beginning
                        or end, He is not a solitary God. The Word was with God before
                        the beginning of all things. The Godhead is a fellowship of three
                        Persons, unified in purpose and spirit. (See Matt. 28:19.)
                          "If Christ made all things, He existed before all things. The
                        words spoken in regard to this are so decisive that no one need
                        be left in doubt. Christ was God essentially, and in the highest
                        sense. He was with God from all eternity, God over all, blessed
                        forevermore."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

THINK IT THROUGH            What difficulties would you see in the biblical plan of salva-
                         tion if Jesus of Nazareth were not God in every respect?

                           "Only by love is love awakened. To know God is to love Him;
                         His character must be manifested in contrast to the character of
                         Satan. This work only one Being in all the universe could do.
                         Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could
                         make it known."—The Desire of Ages, p. 22.

God With Us        LESSON 1                                            ❑ Monday
                                                                        March 28
         Part 2       Why did John call Jesus, the Word?
     JESUS, THE
   WORD OF GOD        "The Word was made flesh."
                      "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,
                    which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him"
                    (John 1:14, 18).

                      Just as speech conveys thought and words give exactness to
                    communication, so Jesus, as the Word of God, declared what
                    God is like. As man and for man, Jesus was God's thought and
                    character made visible and audible.
                      Simply put, Jesus came to show us what God is like. The
                    unseen God did not choose to reveal Himself in the voice of
                    thunder. Neither did He choose to write His message in
                    heavenly penmanship across the blue sky; He knew that
                    dreams, visions, and even angels were not adequate. No matter
                    how much attention He received during Old Testament times
                    through such methods, He was still limited by intermediaries
                    and partial revelations. A person can be truly known to human
                    beings only in a physical self-revelation. Through God alone
                    could God be known. God became man so that man could have
                    a fair chance to know Him.
                      Almost everyone has been introduced to new friends through
                    intermediaries. Such go-betweens describe the person's physi-
                    cal features, hobbies, interests, disposition, dislikes, etc. If the
                    intermediary were a son, a daughter, a spouse, or a parent, the
                    description would be more accurate. But rarely does this mental
                    picture correspond with the information gained through a per-
                    sonal meeting. The self-revelation in a personal appearance is
                    the only fair way for a person to make himself known.
                       Only the personal appearance of God Himself could eliminate
                    questions and fill in the blank spots in man's mind regarding His
                    Creator. As the "Word" of God declaring the truth about God,
                    what Jesus did was as revealing as what He said.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it that nature, or even a prophet's transmission of
                    divine messages, could not adequately convey what God is
                    like?

                      "God saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to
                    portray both His personality and His character. He sent His Son
                    into the world to manifest, so far as could be endured by human
                    sight, the nature and the attributes of the invisible God."—The

God With Us          LESSON 1                                           ❑ Tuesday
                                                                           March 29
               Part 3   What awesome, incomparable capability did John ascribe
              JESUS, to Jesus?
        THE CREATOR
                        "All things were made by him; and without him was not
                      anything made that was made" (John 1:3).

                        Jesus is the Creator of the universe. He was before all things
                      and was indebted to no one for His own existence. Further, He
                      was the creative Power that organized this marvelous universe
                      in thought and spoke it into existence by command.
                         "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
                           and all their host by the breath of his mouth."
                         "For he spoke, and it came to be;
                           he commanded, and it stood forth."
                                                                     Ps. 33:6, 9, RSV.

                         What do we learn about Jesus when we look at His crea-
                      tion? Rom. 1:20.

                         We learn much about people by the things they do. Charac-
                      teristics of the designer, maker, or creator are expressed by his
                      or her handiwork. So with Jesus and His handiwork.
                         Though marred by the deterioration caused by sin, the world
                      still reflects an awesome order, an enthralling beauty, a remark-
                      able interdependency. Only a Creator who is orderly, not ca-
                      pricious; artistic, not offensive; loving, not self-seeking, could
                      have made a world such as our own. Whenever we see, hear, or
                      feel harmony, order, beauty, goodness, and purpose, we can
                      safely say, "Jesus is like that, and more."

THINK IT THROUGH       We are counseled to "be imitators of God" (Eph. 5:1, RSV).
                     How can I better reflect harmony, order, predictability, beauty,
                     goodness, and sense of purpose in my life?

                       "Like our Saviour, we are in this world to do service for God.
                     We are here to become like God in character, and by a life of
                     service to reveal Him to the world. In order to be co-workers with
                     God, in order to become like Him and to reveal His character, we
                     must know Him aright. We must know Him as He reveals
                     Himself."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 409.
                       More often than not we think of God's creation in terms of
                     stars, planets, trees, flowers, animals, etc. But men and women
                     are also God's handiwork, His highest form of earthly creation.
                     Therefore, we can learn much about God by studying man
                     together with the Bible; thus we perceive characteristics about
                     God that we could never discover by analyzing a tree or a bird.

God With Us        LESSON 1                                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      March 30
          Part 4      What connection exists between our Lord's eternal nature
     JESUS, LIFE    and our dependent, helpless nature?
      AND LIGHT
                      "In him was life; and the life was the light of men" (John 1:4).

                        Life is completely dependent upon light. Without light there
                    could not have been life on this planet, or anywhere else in the
                    universe, as far as we know. The first day of Creation Week
                    brought light to this earth, making possible the creation of plant
                    and animal life (Gen. 1:3-5).
                        Light is a visible form of energy as any lover of houseplants
                    soon discovers; no farmer or orchardist could grow his grain or
                    trees without ample light. Light converts inorganic elements
                    and compounds into food which is necessary for life as we know
                    it.
                        Light is powerful. Think of the laser beam that can hit at a
                    precise spot on the moon and return in two and one half sec-
                    onds, or make clean cuts through hard materials in fractions of
                    a second.
                        Jesus said of Himself, "I am the light of the world" (John 8:12).
                    He did not choose this symbolism without design. Whatever
                    power and life-sustaining characteristics we discover about
                    physical light are merely a fingertip understanding of our
                    Creator who is eternal energy, eternal light, eternal life.
                        Wherever Jesus is, whether present through His personal
                    representative, the Holy Spirit, or through His Written Word,
                    there is life and power. Spiritual darkness, that strange element
                    in the universe that either obscures or falsifies truth, always
                    leads to confusion and death.

                      Does every person have an opportunity to see through the
                    moral darkness of sin and the mental darkness of spiritual
                    ignorance? John 1:9.

                      "As through Christ every human being has life, so also
                    through Him every soul receives some ray of divine light. Not
                    only intellectual but spiritual power, a perception of right, a
                    desire for goodness, exists in every heart."—Education, p. 29.

                                                                           March 31
             Part 5   How did Paul describe the continuing creative power of
         JESUS, THE Jesus?
         SUSTAINER
            OF LIFE   "All things were created through him and for him. He is
                    before all things, and in him all things hold together" (Col.
                    1:16, 17).

                        Paul adds his witness to John's—Jesus of Nazareth is not only
                      the Creator of the universe but also its continuing Sustainer.
                      The words "hold together" emphasize the continuing mainte-
                      nance of our Lord's creative power as He keeps both the amaz-
                      ing particles within the atom and the awesome stellar bodies in
                      their pinpoint precision orbits.

THINK IT THROUGH       What does the continuing, sustaining power of the Creator
                      mean to me?

                        God is not an absentee landlord. He is very involved in every-
                     day events. We don't have to wonder if the sun will appear
                     tomorrow, if the birds will return in the spring, if water will boil at
                     100° Celsius, if the laws of aerodynamics will operate today as
                     they did yesterday. There is no end to the list of remarkable
                     events in the world about us that must function precisely as we
                     have observed them in the past if life on this planet is to be
                     sustained. This universe is so reliable that we take it for granted.
                     But without the holding power of our Lord, it could all blow up in
                     a spectacular explosion.
                       Furthermore, even the results of sin are predictable. Satan
                     and his followers cannot escape the consequences of their
                     cruel and selfish choices. Whether obeying or violating the laws
                     of the universe, the results are predictable. "Do not be de-
                     ceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will
                     also reap" (Gal. 6:7, RSV).
                       There is something profoundly comforting about the fact that
                     a Father's heart is at the center of the universe, that a loving
                     Saviour sustains its operation. Nothing can catch Them by
                     surprise. Nothing is too hard for Them. They can order for each
                     of us that which seems best for our present welfare and for the
                     world to come.
                        "The hand that sustains the worlds in space, the hand that
                     holds in their orderly arrangement and tireless activity all things
                     throughout the universe of God, is the hand that was nailed to
                     the cross for us."—Education, p. 132.

                                                                           April 1
          Part 6      "We have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the
      JESUS, THE    Father" (John 1:14, RSV).
   GLORY OF GOD
                      The glory of God is His character, the outward manifestation
                    of His inward attributes. One of the chief reasons for God to
                    incarnate Himself as Jesus was to reveal to this sin-darkened
                    world what God is like. He came to make God known, to reveal
                    His glory to earthbound men and women.
                      When we look at Jesus, studying His words, observing His
                    actions, we are getting a picture of the glory of God. Although
                    there are many wonderful aspects of our Lord's character,
                    perhaps the all-inclusive description is "that the glory shining in
                    the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love."—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 20.
                      Although the humanity of Jesus of Nazareth veiled the un-
                    speakable glory of God, yet He revealed what God thinks and
                    how He feels about men and women on planet Earth. Whenever
                    we are in doubt about what God thinks of us, we should recall
                    how Jesus dealt with men and women in His day. Just as the
                    starry heavens reveal the glory of God's power and order (Ps.
                    19:1) so Jesus reveals the glory of God's paternal love, sym-
                    pathy, and grace, especially toward sinners.

THINK IT THROUGH      As a child of God, do I reveal the glory, the characteristics,

                    symbolized the glory of God's character revealed through His
                    people. This will make possible the last demonstration of truth
                    before probation closes. "By implanting in their hearts the prin-
                    ciples of His word, the Holy Spirit develops in men the attributes
                    of God. The light of His glory—His character—is to shine forth in
                    His followers."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 414.
                       The gospel that stirred the world 2000 years ago was "the
                    knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ"
                    (2 Cor. 4:6). It produced men and women who "in mind and
                    character ... had become like their Master."—Education, p. 95.
                       Just such a demonstration will be seen the world over before
                    Jesus returns. It will be seen through men and women who are
                    described as those who "keep the commandments of God, and
                    the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12).

             Part 1      What is John's description of the magnificent open mystery
         THE WORD      of the incarnation?
      BECAME FLESH
                         "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us" (John 1:14).
                       Jesus, the eternal Word, became man. This thought staggers
                       anyone who even dimly understands what it means. Why should
                       God do that? What kind of man did He become? Did He only
                       appear to be a man? Did He have power over sin that is not
                       available to all other men as they contend with sin? What differ-
                       ence has His coming meant to the human race?
                         To some extent these questions will be answered in this
                       week's lesson as well as in the lessons to follow. To understand
                       these questions is the greatest subject to which a person can
                       devote his mind. "The humanity of the Son of God is everything
                       to us. . . . This is to be our study. Christ was a real man."—

                         What is Paul's description of the humanity of Jesus? Rom.
                       1:3.

                         "Christ did not make believe take human nature; He did verily
                       take it. He did in reality possess human nature.... He was the
                       son of Mary; He was of the seed of David according to human
                       descent. He is declared to be a man, even the Man Christ
                       Jesus."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 247.

THINK IT THROUGH          What difference would it have made to me if Jesus had not
                       become man, fully and truly? Do you think that it would have
                       altered the idea that God is mankind's friend and comforter?

                        God did not come halfway to earth in His attempt to redeem
                      men and women; He did not come as a sympathetic angel, or
                      even as a superman, impregnable to all of humanity's troubles
                      and weaknesses. The ladder from heaven to earth reached all
                      the way down to where sinners are. "If that ladder had failed by a
                      single step of reaching the earth, we should have been lost. But
                      Christ reaches us where we are. He took our nature and over-
                      came, that we through taking His nature might overcome."—

                        Since Jesus came to dwell with us, we know that God is
                      acquainted with our trials, and sympathizes with our griefs.
                      Every son and daughter of Adam may understand that our
                      Creator is the friend of sinners.

                                                                            April 4
          Part 2   How much like man did Paul say Jesus became?
     PARTOOK OF
       THE SAME    "Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he
         NATURE himself likewise partook of the same nature.... For surely It is
                 not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants
                 of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in
                 every respect" (Heb. 2:14-17, RSV).

                       Jesus entered the human family, taking the same nature as all
                    other "descendants of Abraham."
                       "Jesus accepted humanity when the race had been weakened
                    by four thousand years of sin. Like every child of Adam He
                    accepted the results of the working of the great law of heredity.
                    What these results ware is shown in the history of His earthly
                    ancestors. He came with such a heredity to share our sorrows
                    and temptations, and to give us the example of a sinless
                    life."—The Desire of Ages, p. 49.
                       In order to come close to sinful men and women, Jesus per-
                    mitted Himself to enter the human family. In order to be man's
                    example He lived a sinless life though beset by the same tempta-
                    tions other human beings face. "If we have in any sense a more
                    trying conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to
                    succor us. But our Saviour took humanity, with all its
                    liabilities."—The Desire of Ages, p. 117.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do I make excuses for my sins, mistakes, or shortcomings
                    by appealing to my heredity or the unfavorable conditions that
                    I grew up with? In what danger do I place myself if I relax,
                    believing that no one could keep the commandments except
                    Jesus, the Son of God?

                      "If Christ had a special power which it is not the privilege of
                    man to have, Satan would have made capital of this matter. The
                    work of Christ was to take from the claims of Satan his control of
                    man, and He could do this only in the way that He came—a man,
                    tempted as a man, rendering the obedience of a man."—Ellen

            Part 3   What special qualification made Jesus a perfect and trusted
        TEMPTED AS high priest on man's behalf?
           WE ARE
                     "For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize
                   with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been
                   tempted as we are, yet without sinning" (Heb. 4:15, RSV).

                        Jesus became a real man when He entered the human race
                     2000 years ago. He was given no divine insulation that would
                     exempt Him from temptation.
                        This is a crucial point: Biblical writers and Ellen White have
                     made it very clear that Jesus faced those temptations common
                     to man. He did not playact, only appearing to be tempted.
                        There has been confusion within the Christian church over
                     the centuries regarding the person and work of Jesus. Ellen
                     White forthrightly endorsed the idea of our Lord's full humanity.
                     In early 1890, when some church members were troubled by the
                     mind-stretching, heart-melting thought that Jesus really did live
                     victoriously in spite of temptation as a human being, Ellen White
                     wrote: "Letters have been coming in to me, affirming that Christ
                     could not have had the same nature as man, for if He had, He
                     would have fallen under similar temptations. If He did not have
                     man's nature, He could not be our example. If He was not a
                     partaker of our nature, He could not have been tempted as man
                     has been. If it were not possible for Him to yield to temptation,
                     He could not be our helper. It was a solemn reality that Christ
                     came to fight the battles as man, in man's behalf. His temptation
                     and victory tell us that humanity must copy the Pattern; man
                     must become a partaker of the divine nature."—Selected Mes-
                     sages, bk. 1, p. 408.

THINK IT THROUGH       What kind of confidence would I have in Jesus If He com-
                     manded me to resist temptation without showing me first that
                     overcoming was possible?

          Part 4   How real were our Lord's temptations? Did He, as man, have
     EXAMPLE OF anything to learn?
      OBEDIENCE
                   "In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and
                 supplications, with loud cries and tears.... Although he was a
                 Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered" (Heb.
                 5:7, 8, RSV).

                      Jesus developed His character through grace, resisting temp-
                    tation and obeying the law of God. A new breath of hope and
                    reality sweeps into a person's soul when he grasps for the first
                    time the realization that Jesus "knows by experience what are
                    the weaknesses of humanity."—The Desire of Ages, p. 329. He
                    knows this because He "took upon himself fallen, suffering
                    human nature, degraded and defiled by sin."—Ellen G. White,
                    The Youth's Instructor, Dec. 20, 1900.

                      When God asks men and women to obey Hini and to live
                    above sinning, He is not asking the impossible or merely tan-
                    talizing them. Jesus proved what a man or a woman can do.
                      Jesus not only gave mankind "an example of obedience"; He
                    also settled the question once and for all that "it is possible for
                    us also to obey the law of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 24.

THINK IT THROUGH      Must a person withdraw from normal human relationships
                    and generally accepted responsibilities in order to become
                    safe from temptation and more like Jesus?

                       The real Jesus was a real Man, except He did not sin. He was
                    hungry, weary, and pressed by friends and foes, as are all men
                    and women. He knew the routine of work. He knew the pressure
                    of business in order to provide for His mother. He knew what
                    slivers and bruised knuckles were.
                       He was no weakling. Both men and women were drawn to
                    Him. He enjoyed the fellowship of Martha and Mary as much as
                    He did that of Lazarus. Rough fishermen, calloused soldiers,
                    and grateful women were counted among His followers. He
                    could be firm as well as gentle.

                    "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
                  judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will
                  of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:19, 30).

                       When Jesus became flesh, He divested Himself of the powers
                    of deity and became absolutely dependent upon the Father and
                    the Holy Spirit. The Father promised to assist Jesus in every
                    human situation where grace was needed. What an awesome
                    thought! Truly Jesus was "a gift" whose value we dimly com-
                    prehend. (See John 3:16 and Phil. 2:6, 7.)
                       Although Jesus could have retained the same nature He had
                    possessed throughout eternity, He "became" dependent on
                    God as all other human beings are.
                       One of the reasons why God became man was to give men
                    and women a picture of what it means to be truly human. By His
                    life on earth He has shown us what the shadow of sin had
                    covered; He pulled back the curtain and showed us the way God
                    had meant for men and women to live. To be truly human is to be
                    completely dependent upon God for truth, and for the strength
                    to do the truth. Such a gloriously free yet dependent person was
                    our Lord Jesus Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH      Does the thought of complete and eternal subordination by
                    one Member of the Godhead to another Member cause an
                    unspeakable response of gratitude to well up in my heart?
                    What does this towering act of love suggest to me regarding
                    my relationship to God?

                      "The Son of God was surrendered to the Father's will, and
                    dependent upon His power. So utterly was Christ emptied of self
                    that He made no plans for Himself. He accepted God's plans for
                    Him, and day by day the Father unfolded His plans. So should
                    we depend upon God, that our lives may be the simple outwork-
                    ing of His will."—The Desire of Ages, p. 208.

                                                                           April 8

   CONTROVERSY where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having
       SETTLED become a high priest for ever" (Heb. 6:19, 20, RSV).

                      In becoming mankind's High Priest, how did Jesus settle the
                    crucial questions in the great controversy between good and
                    evil? God became man in order to silence forever Satan's
                    charge that He has been unfair with rebels, whether they were
                    fallen angels or sinners on earth. "Christ came to the earth ... to
                    vindicate the character of God before the universe."—
                    Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 68.
                      Several aspects of Satan's charge and lies were exposed by
                    the life of Jesus. "In the opening of the great controversy, Satan
                    had declared that the law of God could not be obeyed, that
                    justice was inconsistent with mercy, and that, should the law be
                    broken, it would be impossible for the sinner to be pardoned....
                       "By His life and His death, Christ proved that God's justice did
                    not destroy His mercy, but that sin could be forgiven, and that
                    the law is righteous, and can be perfectly obeyed."—The Desire
                    of Ages, pp. 761, 762.
                       If God had come to earth and only appeared to be a man, His
                    performance would not have answered Satan's charges; the
                    issue was not what God could do. The issue was whether man
                    could keep the law and resist sin. Jesus met Satan head on to
                    prove that men and women, beset with all the liabilities "of the
                    working of the great law of heredity" (The Desire of Ages, p. 49),
                    can keep the law of God through grace.
                       "Christ's humanity would demonstrate for eternal ages the
                    question which settled the controversy."—Selected Messages,

                    did for Jesus of Nazareth?

                      "Christ's overcoming and obedience is that of a true human
                    being. In our conclusions, we make many mistakes because of
                    our erroneous views of the human nature of our Lord. When we
                    give to His human nature a power that it is not possible for man
                    to have in his conflicts with Satan, we destroy the completeness
                    of His humanity."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

                      "And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom;
                    and the favor of God was upon him."
                      "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor
                    with God and man" (Luke 2:40, 52, RSV).

                        Because Jesus "was made flesh" (John 1:14) and was "made
                     like his brethren in every respect" (Heb. 2:17, RSV), He was
                     subject to the limitations and susceptibilities of a child and a
                     teen-ager. Even though we most often think of Jesus as a per-
                     fect Man, we must also remember that He developed from in-
                     fancy, "in keeping with the laws of childhood."—The Desire of

                       Did our Lord's sinless life exempt Him from the trials of a
                     growing boy?

                        God did not "rig" the "great controversy" by sheltering Jesus
                     from the temptations that would come to a growing boy or girl.
                     Although "no trace of sin marred the image of God within Him"
                     yet "He was subject to all the conflicts which we have to meet,
                     that He might be an example to us in childhood, youth, and
                     manhood."—The Desire of Ages, p. 71.
                        "Christ was a child; he had the experience of a child; he felt
                     the disappointments and trials that children feel; he knew the

                        "Let children bear in mind that the child Jesus had taken
                     upon himself human nature, and was in the likeness of sinful
                     flesh, and was tempted of Satan as all children are

        INCREASED
       IN WISDOM       How do we know that Jesus was not supernaturally en-
                     dowed with wisdom, insight, and all knowledge?

                        Wisdom is more than knowledge; wisdom is mental excel-
                     lence in its highest form whereby knowledge is properly under-
                     stood and applied. Before He became man, Jesus was omni-
                     scient (that is, all-knowing); when He became man He "did not
                     cling to his privileges as God's equal, but stripped himself of
                     every advantage" (Phil. 2:6, 7, Phillips).

                       The wonderful manifestation of wisdom reflected in the
                     words and acts of Jesus was the result of utilizing the
                     capabilities available to all children. Very sobering is the
                     thought that "every child may gain knowlege as Jesus did."—
                     The Desire of Ages, p. 70.
                       How did He do it? What were His habits? Mary and Joseph
                     were His first teachers, and they followed the Lord's direction
                     "that even from babyhood the children should be taught of His
                     goodness and His greatness, especially as revealed in His law,
                     and shown in the history of Israel. Song and prayer and lessons
                     from the Scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind.
                     Fathers and mothers were to instruct their children that the law
                     of God is an expression of His character, and that as they
                     received the principles of the law into the heart, the image of

                     John 7:15.

                       The scholars were astounded at our Lord's breadth of knowl-
                     edge, especially when they knew He had not attended their
                     schools. His mental development however was in contrast to
                     what was generally regarded as superior education. He did not
                     study the opinions of men; He sought the truth made known
                     through revelation and the Spirit speaking to His own heart.
                     Instead of a cramped, narrow, worldly-wise spirit, Jesus could
                     think creatively and see truth in its beauty and harmony.

              Part 3  What new phase of our Lord's development was marked by
       INCREASED IN His visit to the temple when He was 12 years of age?
           SENSE OF
       LIFE MISSION   "How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about
                     my Father's business? And they understood not the saying
                     which he spake unto them" (Luke 2:49, 50).

                       This was the first time Jesus saw the temple in Jerusalem, the
                     bleeding sacrificial animals, the cloud of incense, and all the
                     other solemn and impressive rites of the Passover service. "Day
                     by day He saw their meaning more clearly. Every act seemed to
                     be bound up with His own life. New impulses were awakening
                     within Him. Silent and absorbed, He seemed to be studying out
                     a great problem. The mystery of His mission was opening to the
                     Saviour." —The Desire of Ages, p. 78.
                       Our Lord's reply to His parents "showed for the first time that
                     He understood His relation to God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 81.

                       Since Jesus gained knowledge as does every human being,
                     how did He make it possible for God to reveal more fully His
                     Messianic role?
                       "As He walked among men, He was guided, step by step, by
                     the Father's will. He did not hesitate to act at the appointed time.
                     With the same submission He waited until the time had
                     come."—The Desire of Ages, p. 147.
                       As man, He was as dependent upon the normal laws of acquir-
                     ing information as all other men. Furthermore, as man He was
                     as dependent upon God for special insight and strength to fulfill
                     God's plan for Him as every man or woman of faith must be.
                     "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the
                     Father do" (John 5:19)—this is the open secret of victorious
                     Christian living.

THINK IT THROUGH        How can I know my role in life as surely as Jesus knew His?

                        "As the human was upon Him, He felt His need of strength
                     from His Father. . . . In this exercise [prayer] His holy, human
                     soul was strengthened for the duties and trials of the day. Our
                     Saviour identifies Himself with our needs and weaknesses, in
                     that He became a suppliant, a nightly petitioner, seeking from
                     His Father fresh supplies of strength, to come forth invigorated
                     and refreshed, braced for duty and trial. He is our example in all
                     things."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 201, 202.

                                                                      April 13
         Part 4   What kind of example did Jesus leave all sons and
       OBEDIENT daughters?
          SON
                  "And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and
                was obedient to them" (Luke 2:51, RSV).

                       Even though Jesus was recognized by experts as wise beyond
                    His years, He did not assume self-importance or premature
                    independence. He did not ignore His responsibilities to His
                    earthly parents. He learned well the lessons Joseph taught Him
                    in the carpenter's shop; for 18 years He pondered the mystery of
                    His mission while He contributed to the financial security of His
                    family. In so doing He left an example to all sons and daughters
                    that they should share home expenses as long as they live under
                    their parents' roof.
                       Apparently sometime after the Jerusalem visit Joseph died,
                    adding further responsibilities to Jesus. Besides the burden of
                    making a living, Jesus filled out His days and nights studying
                    and meditating. His deep perception of the law of God and its
                    application to every facet of the daily life set Him apart from His
                    brothers and sisters as well as from His contemporaries.
                       Because He placed a high premium on time, natural ability,
                    and opportunities, He brought forth resentment in those who
                    wanted an easier program. The misunderstandings were em-
                    phasized when the rabbis joined with relatives in urging Mary to
                    control Jesus with a firmer hand. Her troubled heart would be
                    reassured when He quietly presented Scripture to uphold His
                    practices.

                      What tender indication of a son's devotion was expressed in
                    Jesus' concern for His mother when He was dying on the
                    cross? John 19:26, 27.

                      Many sons and daughters forget their parents even when all is
                    well with them. They have spare rooms, extra cash, health, and
                    ability to make the last few years of their parents easier to bear.
                    Yet, a commercial greeting card on a birthday and possibly a
                    rare phone call is the measure of gratitude that many today can
                    offer weary, lonely parents.

           IN FAVOR
          WITH MEN      "Jesus Increased ... In favour with God and man" (Luke
                      2:52).

                        As a youth, Jesus so lived that no one could find fault with His
                     high standard of living; He was a credit to His family and
                     neighborhood. For this He was approved.
                        "Through all those secluded years at Nazareth, His life flowed
                     out in currents of sympathy and tenderness. The aged, the
                     sorrowing, and the sin-burdened, the children at play in their
                     innocent joy, the little creatures of the groves, the patient beasts
                     of burden,—all were happier for His presence....
                        " ... He drew the sympathy of all hearts by showing Himself
                     capable of sympathizing with all. The atmosphere of hope and
                     courage that surrounded Him made Him a blessing in every
                     home." —The Desire of Ages, p. 74.
                        Nonbelievers react in different ways when men and women of
                     faith become known for their standard of right living. The be-
                     lievers are commended if they keep to themselves and fail to
                     evangelize actively. Or the believers are openly resented by
                     those whose consciences are condemned.
                        Yet godly living from the time of Abel has always been re-
                     sented by uncommitted people even though they can find no
                     fault with the believer's life habits. The life of faith annoys the
                     commandment breaker.
                        Because He was not exclusive, and because He labored ear-
                     nestly for the well-being of all humanity regardless of one's
                     religious connections, He aroused the enmity of the Pharisees:
                     "He inculcated the principle that Bible religion does not consist
                     in the mortification of the body.... At all times and in all places
                     he manifested a loving interest in men, and shed about Him the
                     light of a cheerful piety. All this was a rebuke to the
                     Pharisees."—The Desire of Ages, p. 86.

                       Jesus was approved in one sense and greatly resented in
                     another. Jealousy, envy, and the competitive spirit are often
                     aroused by the life of faith. "Because the life of Jesus con-
                     demned evil, He was opposed, both at home and abroad. His
                     unselfishness and integrity were commented on with a sneer.

          Part 6     How did the Father express His approval of Jesus' 30 years
       YEARS OF    of human development?
    PREPARATION
                     "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased"
                   (Matt. 3:17, RSV).

                      The Bible is silent in regard to those 18 years between the
                   Passover visit and Jesus' baptism by John. But we would be
                   making a tragic mistake if we overlooked them. During these
                   teen-age and young manhood years, Jesus was getting basic
                   training for His public ministry. There would be no Jesus, as the
                   Gospel writers knew Him, without the towering record of sin-
                   lessness and character development during these difficult
                   years.
                      Those 30 years prepared Jesus for the life record we know so
                   well—no one can be a leader overnight whatever His calling. For
                   this reason, the home education and general schooling
                   throughout a person's "silent years" is important beyond
                   words. "Jesus is our example. There are many who dwell with
                   interest upon the period of His public ministry, while they pass
                   unnoticed the teaching of His early years. But it is in His home
                   life that He is the pattern for all children and youth.... He was
                   doing God's service just as much when laboring at the carpen-
                   ter's bench as when working miracles for the multitude. And
                   every youth who follows Christ's example of faithfulness and
                   obedience in His lowly home may claim those words spoken of
                   Him by the Father through the Holy Spirit, 'Behold My Servant,
                   whom I uphold; Mine Elect, in whom My soul delighteth.' Isa.
                   42:1." —The Desire of Ages, p. 74.

                   of Jesus.
                      "It is in the early years that we have the best opportunity for
                   sowing good seed in their [children's] hearts. If we neglect to do
                   this work in their childhood, we shall find that Satan will preoc-

                       We need never tire repeating the good news: Jesus was met

                     never sinned.
                       We hasten to add, however, that Jesus was indeed tempted.
                     He experienced the reality of temptation. "For we have not a
                     high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
                     but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet
                     without sinning" (Heb. 4:15, RSV).

                       At what point does sin occur: with enticement or consent?
                     James 1:14, 15.

                        God has placed natural and legitimate desires within man,
                     such as the desire for food, for physical comfort, self-
                     preservation, for parenthood, and for social acceptance. Sin
                     occurs when a person chooses to satisfy these natural drives
                     outside of and contrary to the will of God. "No man can be
                     forced to transgress. His own consent must be first gained; the
                     soul,must purpose the sinful act before passion can dominate
                     over reason or iniquity triumph over conscience. Temptation,
                     however strong, is never an excuse for sin.. . . The Lord . . .
                     knows how strong are the inclinations of the natural heart, and
                     He will help in every time of temptation."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p.
                     177.
                       "Satan showed his knowledge of the weak points of the
                     human heart, and put forth his utmost power to take advantage
                     of the weakness of the humanity which Christ had assumed in
                     order to overcome his temptations on man's account."—Ellen
                     G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 930.
                       Jesus, as truly man, knew from experience how subtle the
                     appeal is to satisfy legitimate desires by means that appear
                     reasonable to the human mind, yet contrary to the will of God.
                     "Though He had all the strength of passion of humanity, never
                     did He yield to temptation to do one single act which was not
                     pure and elevating and ennobling."—In Heavenly Places, p.

                                                                         April 18
           Part 2   What basic human need did Satan try to take advantage of
     INDULGENCE when he tempted Christ in the wilderness?
     OF APPETITE
                    "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to be-
                  come loaves of bread" (Matt. 4:3, RSV).

                     There surely is nothing evil about desiring food, physical
                   comfort, and whatever else contributes to self-preservation. But
                   these drives, based on physical needs, can be satisfied in ways
                   that ultimately destroy the keenness and usefulness of a per-
                   son's mental, physical, moral, and spiritual powers.
                     Eve's sin consisted of indulging her appetite in a way that
                   manifested distrust in God. Ever since the Fall, indulging the
                   appetite for physical satisfaction alone has been one of man's
                   basic sins and one of the chief reasons for his deteriorated
                   state. "Christ knew that the world was given up to gluttony and
                   that this indulgence would pervert the moral powers. If the
                   indulgence of appetite was so strong upon the race that, in
                   orderto break its power, the divine Son of God, in behalf of man,
                   was required to fast nearly six weeks, what a work is before the
                   Christian in order that he may overcome even as Christ over-
                   came! ...
                     "     In order to impress upon man his obligations to obey the
                   law of God, Christ began His work of redemption by reforming
                   the physical habits of man. The declension in virtue and the
                   degeneracy of the race are chiefly attributable to the indulgence
                   of perverted appetite."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 486.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways do I concede to the indulgences of physical
                   appetite and comfort? What does victory over appetite In-
                   clude?

                     We cannot answer these questions for someone else. We
                   alone know when we pamper our physical desires to that point
                   where our mental and moral efficiencies are affected.
                   Headaches, upset stomachs, sluggish willpower, irritated and
                   impatient attitudes—each may indicate a need to reconsider
                   our personal habits of indulging our physical desires.
                     Jesus could withstand the temptations of Satan because He
                   was master of His physical inclinations; His mind was not be-
                   clouded, nor was His body overworked by physical excess, from
                   food, or any other form of physical indulgence.
                      "The Spirit of God cannot come to our help, and assist us in
                   perfecting Christian characters, while we are indulging our
                   appetites to the injury of health, and while the pride of life
                   controls."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 57.

            Part 3   How did Satan meet Jesus on our Lord's own ground when
     PRESUMPTUOUS he appealed to Him to prove how much He trusted God?
        VENTURING
                     "Then the devil ...said to him, `If you are the Son of God,
                   throw yourself down; for it is written, "He will give his angels
                   charge of you." ' " (Matt. 4:5, 6, RSV).

                        Still appearing as an angel of light, with no observable indica-
                     tions that he indeed was the evil one, Satan tried to invite trust
                      by quoting well-known scripture. He tempted Jesus to reach
                     desirable ends through improper means.
                        For the second time Satan tempted Jesus to doubt His
                     identity—"If you are the Son of God." The devil followed this up
                     with the temptation for Jesus to jump from the highest point in
                     the temple area and to trust in God to preserve His life. Note how
                     Satan reversed reality. He tempted Him to doubt God in what
                     God had declared true—that Jesus was God's Son. On the other
                     hand, Satan tempted Him to believe God in something God had
                     never said—that He would protect a person who willfully risked
                     his life to no purpose but to accept a challenge. Jesus saw
                     through both parts of the temptation. He would believe what
                     God said, and He would not act in a way that was unsupported
                     by God's word.
                        How subtle the appeal! Not food for His hungry body nor
                     wealth and fame to satisfy the lust for power, but simply a way to
                     prove His divine appointment and great faith.
                        Many human beings have fallen for this temptation—we call it
                     spiritual pride, even vanity. But Jesus saw clearly what kind of
                     example He would be presenting to those who were seeking the
                     righteous life if He should try by dazzling feats to prove His
                     identity and faith.

THINK IT THROUGH        What is the clear difference between faith and presump-
                     tion?

                         "Faith is in no sense allied to presumption. Only he who has
                     true faith is secure against presumption. For presumption is
                     Satan's counterfeit of faith. Faith claims God's promises, and
                     brings forth fruit in obedience. Presumption also claims the
                     promises, but uses them as Satan did, to excuse transgression.
                     ... It is not faith that claims the favor of Heaven without comply-
                     ing with the conditions on which mercy is to be granted."—The

Model Overcomer        LESSON 4                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     April 20
         Part 4 What marvelously subtle temptation did Satan present that
   AMBITION AND would suggest how Jesus could achieve His goal as the
     PLEASURES world's Redeemer?

                     "And the devil ... showed him all the kingdoms of the world
                   in a moment of time, and said to him, `To you I will give all this
                   authority and their glory' " (Luke 4:5, 6, RSV).

                     Jesus was a poor man without equity or bank account to
                   subsidize His new movement. How could He ever get the confi-
                   dence of men and women that serving Him would be a prudent
                   decision? The Jews thought of the Messiah as the leader of a
                   temporal kingdom; they also knew that great happiness and
                   health would follow the reign of their Messiah. How best could
                   Jesus satisfy the deep wish of His countrymen and appear
                   credible?
                     What a subtle temptation! To be given the kingdoms of the
                   world immediately would eliminate Calvary. It was a dazzling
                   opportunity and an almost overpowering temptation to anyone
                   with the best of motives.
                     Christ's rejection of Satan's scheme pointed to the nature of
                   the kingdom He was setting up. The kingdom of God was not to
                   be advanced by external means; not by d azzl e or force was He to
                   intimidate the decision of men and women. Jesus knew that to
                   yield to Satan, even though in exchange Satan was giving Him
                   the world, would be cooperating with Satan, whose chief
                   weapons were intrigue, force, and violence.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does Satan present this same temptation to us today?

                       The allure of the shortcut to reach desirable, legitimate ends
                    is perhaps the most successful of all temptations to sin. But the
                    end does not justify the means. By using Satan's methods we
                    cannot reach those values and goals that God can bless. In an
                    age of bribery, common cheating, and ill-conceived pity for the
                    criminal, the person who tries to live a holy life will often find
                    that it will be a life much like his Saviour's—hardship, conflict,
                    and loneliness. "His sensitive nature was tortured, His motives
                    were misunderstood, His work was uncomprehended."—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 326.
                       Any appeal that promises honor, success, or fortune without
                   •struggle, routine obedience to rules, and self-denial is this third
                    great temptation in modern dress.
                       "To men he [Satan] offers the kingdom of this world on
                    condition that they will acknowledge his supremacy. He re-
                    quires that they sacrifice integrity, disregard conscience, in-
                    dulge selfishness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 130.

          SPIRITUAL tions of Satan?
          WEAPONS
                       "Jesus answered him, 'It is written' " Luke 4:4, RSV).

                        The temptations presented to Jesus were not academic de-
                     bates. There was nothing in the first two temptations about the
                     physical presence of the angel of light that indicated the pres-
                     ence of Satan. This was genuine temptation; if He knew by just
                     observation that it was Satan confronting Him, there would
                     have been no real temptation, any more than if Eve had known
                     that the beautiful serpent was the devil himself.
                        The physical presence, the beguiling words, the appeal to
                     legitimate human wants—all created genuine temptation that
                     men and women have wrestled with since sin darkened Eden.
                        The first and only line of defense against Satan's most allur-
                     ing temptations is the Bible. Satan wanted Christ to perform
                     miracles to satisfy physical hunger and to prove that He was
                     indeed the Messiah. But the greatest miracle of all was for a
                     human being to thwart Satan by simple trust in the power of the
                     Bible.
                        There is awesome power in the Bible. Jesus proved it during
                     those fearful days in the wilderness. " 'Man shall not live by
                     bread alone, but by every word of God.' Often the follower of
                     Christ is brought where he cannot serve God and carry forward
                     his worldly enterprises. Perhaps it appears that obedience to
                     some plain requirement of God will cut off his means of support.
                     Satan would make him believe that he must sacrifice his con-
                     scientious convictions. But the only thing in our world upon
                     which we can rely is the word of God ... . When we learn the
                     power of His word, we shall not follow the suggestions of Satan
                     in order to obtain food or to save our lives."—The Desire of

THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways should I be using the spiritual weapons of the
                     Bible more consistently?

                       "Temptations often appear irresistible because, through ne-
                     glect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one
                     cannot readily remember God's promises and meet Satan with the
                     Scripture weapons. But angels are round about those who are
                     willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of great
                     necessity they will bring to their remembrance the very truths

           Part 6   Are Christ's temptations to be considered in a different
        TEMPTED category from ours?
       AS WE ARE
                    "We have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with
                  our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been
                  tempted as we are, yet without sinning" (Heb. 4:15, RSV).

                      "Christ was tempted by Satan in a hundredfold severer man-
                   ner than was Adam, and under circumstances in every way more
                   trying. The deceiver presented himself as an angel of light, but
                   Christ withstood his temptations. He redeemed Adam's dis-

                      "Christ's victory was as complete as had been Adam's failure.
                   So we may resist temptation, and force Satan to depart from
                   us."—My Life Today, p. 323.
                      We can never say it often enough—Jesus never sinned in
                   thought or deed. But a song of the ages will be that Jesus never
                   sinned while facing and thwarting the temptations common to
                   fallen man. "I present before you the great Exemplar. . . . As
                   really did He meet and resist the temptations of Satan as any of

                   perfect example for man. He subjected Himself to humanity to
                   become acquainted with all the temptations wherewith man is
                   beset. He took upon Him the infirmities and bore the sorrows of
                   the sons of Adam."—Our High Calling, p. 57.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does Christ's victorious human experience make Him
                   the perfect High Priest?

                      Jesus as man's High Priest is our guarantee that all Heaven
                   knows the weight of our temptations. And He is also a standing
                   witness that temptations can and must be overcome. " 'Verily,
                   verily, I say unto you, ... He that beiieveth on Me, the works that I
                   do shall he do also.' The Saviour was deeply anxious for His
                   disciples to understand for what purpose His d ivinity was united
                   to humanity. He came to the world to display the glory of God,
                   that man might be uplifted by its restoring power. God was
                   manifested in Him that He might be manifested in them. Jesus
                   revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that men may
                   not have through faith in Him. His perfect humanity is that which
                   all His followers may possess, if they will be in subjection to God
                   as He was."—The Desire of Ages, p. 664.

                          "And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he
                        went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
                        prayed" (Mark 1:35).

                           Our Lord's enemies were forced to confess, "Never man
                        spake like this man" (John 7:46). Why? Because never did a
                        man pray like this man! His example of prayer was not to show
                        us how God would pray but how men and women must pray.
                           "Prayer in secret, prayer while the hands are engaged in

                        bestowed without measure, constantly acknowledged his de-
                        pendence upon God, and sought fresh supplies from the

                           " ... We must look to Christ; we must resist as he resisted; we
                        must pray as he prayed; we must agonize as he agonized, if we
                        would conquer as he conquered."—Ellen G. White, Review and

                           Man that He was, Jesus needed continual supplies of strength
                        from His heavenly Father in order to remain untainted and an
                        overcomer. He needed physical strength to cope with the in-
                        creasing demands upon His time and energy; He needed mental
                        clearness to see without distortion the will of God for Him daily;
                        He needed spiritual strength to remain perceptive and fresh as
                        He shared the insight, hope, and courage with sin-weary con-
                        temporaries.
                           "He was unsullied with corruption, a stranger to sin; yet He
                        prayed, and that often with strong crying and tears. He prayed
                        for His disciples and for Himself, thus identifying Himself with
                        our needs, our weaknesses, and our failings, which are so
                        common with humanity."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 508, 509.

          "COME YE      necessary to sustain spiritual activity for others?
       . . . APART"
                          "He said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
                        place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and
                        going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. And they
                        departed into a desert place by ship privately" (Mark 6:31, 32).

                          The disciples had just returned from one of their first mis-
                        sionary journeys apart from Christ. They had devoted them-
                        selves to their labors and were now exhausted. Jesus knew that
                        many dangers arise when men and women try to do personal
                        work for others when they are physically and mentally tired; the
                        will is weaker and temptations more subtle and overpowering.
                          "It is not wise to be always under the strain of work and
                        excitement, even in ministering to men's spiritual needs; for in
                        this way personal piety is neglected, and the powers of mind
                        and soul and body are overtaxed. Self-denial is required of the
                        disciples of Christ, and sacrifices must be made; but care must
                        also be exercised lest through their overzeal Satan take advan-
                        tage of the weakness of humanity, and the work of God be
                        marred."—The Desire of Ages, p. 362.
                          Besides, Jesus knew that without constant spiritual refresh-
                        ment it is very easy for men and women to feel, almost uncon-
                        sciously, that their success is the result of their own skills and
                        perseverance only. Spiritual pride is almost incurable.
                           Special seasons for prayer, in addition to daily devotions,
                        seemed to be as necessary for the disciples as they are for us
                        today; we need special time "to commune with Christ, with
                        nature, and with their [our] own hearts."—The Desire of Ages, p.
                        360.
                          The church needs occasions to come apart and study what
                        God expects from His people, listening as He speaks personally
                        to the heart and not through human intermediaries.

                          What kind of "rest" is most conducive to spiritual renewal?

                          "The rest which Christ and His disciples took was not self-
                        indulgent rest. The time they spent in retirement was not de-

          POWER OF prayer?
            PRAYER
                       "When Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the
                     heaven was opened, ... and a voice came from heaven, 'Thou
                     art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased' " (Luke 3:21,
                     22, RSV).

                         Christ's prayer at this time was a tremendous demonstration
                      of how near Heaven may come to a person when he prays.
                      Instead of an angel's answering the prayer, the Father Himself
                      sent an acknowledgement—"a dovelike form of purest
                      light."—The Desire of Ages, p. 112.
                         This incident in the life of Christ is only one of many that tell us
                      "of the power of prayer,—how the human voice may reach the
                      ear of God, and our petitions find acceptance in the courts of
                      heaven.... The light which fell from the open portals upon the
                      head of our Saviour will fall upon us as we pray for help to resist
                      temptation."—The Desire of Ages, p. 113.
                         Our Lord's prayer life is an example of how we should be
                      praying amidst our earthly difficulties. "As one with us, a sharer
                      in our needs and weaknesses, He was wholly dependent upon
                      God, and in the secret place of prayer He sought divine strength,
                      that He might go forth braced for duty and trial. In a world of sin
                      Jesus endured struggles and torture of soul. In communion with
                      God He would unburden the sorrows that were crushing Him.
                      Here He found comfort and joy.
                         "In Christ the cry of humanity reached the Father of infinite
                      pity. Asa man He supplicated the throne of God till His humanity
                      was charged with a heavenly current that should connect hu-
                      manity with divinity. Through continual communion He re-
                      ceived life from God, that He might impart life to the world. His
                      experience is to be ours."—The Desire of Ages, p. 363.

THINK IT THROUGH       What opportunity do I give God to speak His will clearly to
                      me? What changes should I make in my life that will permit
                      God to speak directly, unmistakably to my soul?

                       None of us can be overcomers at last or enjoy spiritual peace
                     now if we live on secondhand information about God or if our
                     faith is rented from someone else. We must discover for our-

                      "0 my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
                    nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matt. 26:39).

                      Gethsemane was no sham affair. All Jesus had with which to
                    fend off satanic doubt was the truths of Scripture, prayer, and
                    His own experience.
                      The outlook, humanly speaking, was desperately bleak. It
                    seemed, from all outward evidence, that Jesus had failed His
                    mission. Guilty and ungrateful men and women seemed beyond
                    redemption.
                      His humanity cried out three times those chilling, bitter
                    words: "If it be possible, let this cup pass." But always He
                    added. "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as though wilt." "Terrible
                    was the temptation to let the human race bear the conse-

                      He prayed "for His own tempted, agonized soul. . . . Three
                    times has humanity shrunk from the last crowning
                    sacrifice."—The Desire of Ages, p. 690. But always He breathed
                    submission—the last stretch of trust when all else seemed lost.
                      In answer to His prayers help came—not that He should be
                    taken from that terrible ordeal but that He would be
                    strengthened to drink this last cup of self-denial on behalf of
                    others.
                      After hours of anguish such as no man has ever yet endured,
                    bloodied in the duel with Satan, we find Jesus not prostrate,
                    conceding the field to Satan and pliable in the hands of His
                    adversaries. Hardly. We find Him in command of the situation,
                    awakening His disciples. Then He faced up to the murderous
                    mob coming from the city, led byJudas. He stood in dignity and
                    glory before the hardened soldiers and calloused priests—the
                    product of prayer.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I give God a chance to do for me what He did for
                    Jesus when I face the crushing, almost insoluble problems of
                    life?

                      For Jesus, prayer was not a procedure whereby God would
                    give Him whatever He asked, if He prayed long enough. Neither
                    was prayer a mere mental reflex. Jesus did not merely talk to
                    Himself in Gethsemane and transform Himself into the Man who
                    faced the world as He did at His trial and crucifixion. All through
                    His life prayer was communion with His heavenly Father and the
                    avenue for receiving heavenly strength.

Model Man of Prayer            LESSON 5                                  ❑ Thursday
                                                                            April 28
             Part 5     What remarkable command did Jesus give to His followers
          PRAY FOR    regarding their attitude toward their enemies?
      YOUR ENEMIES
                        "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
                      them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
                      you, and persecute you" (Matt. 5:44).

                         Loving one's enemies, extending the hand of forgiveness to
                      an offender, is uncommon behavior anywhere, any time. Even
                      to the Jews, God's people, this was a strange admonition; for
                      they cultivated a spirit of retaliation, especially to the Romans.
                         Jesus is not suggesting, however, that by praying for one's
                      enemies, His followers are to accept wrongs done to others
                      without appropriate response. "When they [God's followers]
                      see that God is dishonored, and His service brought into disre-
                      pute, when they see the innocent oppressed, a righteous indig-
                      nation stirs the soul. Such anger, born of sensitive morals, is not
                      a sin. But those who at any supposed provocation feel at liberty
                      to indulge anger or resentment are opening the heart to Satan.
                      Bitterness and animosity must be banished from the soul if we
                      would be in harmony with heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 310.
                         To pray for one's enemies requires the Spirit of God; it is
                      almost a reflex action for non-Christians to hate and to seek
                      revenge. But the Spirit of God will help create the character of
                      God; His followers will see others as God does, pitying us all,
                      even when we rebel in the face of His love. "It is only the Spirit of
                      God that gives love for hatred. To be kind to the unthankful and
                      to the evil, to do good hoping for nothing again, is the insignia of
                      the royalty of heaven, the sure token by which the children of the
                      Highest reveal their high estate."—Thoughts From the Mount of
                      Blessing, p. 75.

                        In what experience do we see most clearly Jesus practicing
                      the principles He taught in Matthew 5:44? Luke 23:33, 34.

THINK IT THROUGH        How can I make a difference between opposing sin and
                      opposing the sinner?

                         "When trials arise that seem unexplainable, we should not
                      allow our peace to be spoiled. However unjustly we may be
                      treated, let not passion arise. By indulging a spirit of retaliation
                      we injure ourselves. We destroy our own confidence in God,
                      and grieve the Holy Spirit."— Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 171,

Model Man of Prayer        LESSON 5                                    ❑ Friday
                                                                        April 29
           Part 6    What practical counsel did Jesus give His disciples when
         A DIVINE they asked Him to teach them how to pray?
         SCIENCE
                    "For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
                  findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened" (Luke
                  11:10).

                      After Jesus outlined a model prayer for His disciples, He
                   illustrated His lesson with a parable. The story described a man
                   who, when suddenly visited by guests, went to a neighbor and
                   implored some bread in order to feed his hungry friends.
                       By contrast Jesus taught that if a selfish man would grant a
                   request to a troublesome neighbor, how much more would God
                   answer our requests when we ask in order to serve others.
                      The instruction given regarding prayer in Luke 11 is really a
                   mirror of our Lord's way of life. He sought help daily in order to
                   serve better His fellowmen. But His instruction is not to be
                   passed over quickly. "There is a divine science in prayer, and
                   His illustration brings to view principles that all need to under-
                   stand. He shows what is the true spirit of prayer, He teaches the
                   necessity of perseverance in presenting our requests to God,
                   and assures us of His willingness to hear and answer
                   prayer."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 142.

                     What is the true spirit of prayer that is taught in this parable
                   of the host without bread? Luke 11:5-8.

                     "We are to ask that we may give. The principle of Christ's life
                   must be the principle of our lives.... The same devotion, the
                   same self-sacrifice, the same subjection to the claims of the
                   word of God, that were manifest in Christ, must be seen in His
                   servants. Our mission to the world is not to serve or please
                   ourselves; we are to glorify God by co-operating with Him to
                   save sinners. We are to ask blessings from God that we may
                   communicate to others."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 142,
                   143.

THINK IT THROUGH     In analyzing my private and public prayers, for what do I ask
                   and seek? Do I endeavor to change God's mind, or do I ask for
                   that which would bring me into harmony with His mind?

                     Are we asking for those specific blessingi that will make us
                   more like Jesus? Do we ask for blessings when there are areas
                   in our lives that are not reflecting God's will as we know it? Do
                   we use prayer to take the place of duty? Do we know the
                   difference between genuine prayer and the impulse of the mo-
                   ment?

          Part 1  What particular experience in our Lord's life helps us to
 TO THE EDUCATED understand how to present the gospel to the educated mind?

                       "Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of
                     Israel, and knowest not these things?" (John 3:10).

                         Read verses 1-10.
                         Nicodemus represents a vast number of men and women who
                      have attained a noble, moral character in an immoral society.
                      They have reached this achievement by education, self-
                      discipline, and high religious ideals. Such persons have at-
                      tained life at its best, as this world knows it, and enjoyed its
                      satisfactions and privileges. Nevertheless, Nicodemus, a distin-
                      guished teacher, a leader of respected integrity, a member of
                      the Sanhedrin, was strangely moved by the young Teacher from
                      Nazareth, who aroused serious doubts about what was missing
                      in "the good life."
                         Nicodemus arranged for an uninterrupted inverview at night.
                     He shrank from the scorn that would come if he showed defer-
                     ence to a traveling teacher without proper university degrees.
                     His complimentary address was met by a kind statement that
                      went directly to the point. Nicodemus was looking forward to a
                      keen discussion about truth, but Jesus did not waste his time
                      parrying theory. Although Nicodemus wanted a teacher, Jesus
                      knew that he needed a Saviour. (See John 3:3.)
                         Though a skillful persuader, Jesus did not try to meet argu-
                     ment with argument or force submission. He led Nicodemus
                     from the known to the unknown. He appealed to a great moment
                     in Jewish history (John 3:14) that the learned ruler knew well
                     and led him to ask from his heart, How and Why?
                        Then with expert handling of the human heart, Jesus, appeal-
                     ing to life's highest motivation, answered these questions with
                     "Because—God so loved." Even the brightest minds need more
                     than indoctrination and argument; they must be introduced to
                     the loving, bleeding heart of the Saviour.
                        Although Jesus did not press for a decision in that first inter-
                     view, He did what He could to meet Nicodemus man to man,
                     mind to mind, and heart to heart. Our Lord's confidence was not
                     misplaced. His methods were effective, for Nicodemus became
                     a bulwark of the infant Christian church, confessing freely that
                     life at its best is not good enough without a transforming faith in
                     Jesus.

                     wisdom must be grasped, appreciated, and assimilated by the
                     educated and uneducated alike.
                        One of the reasons why more educated people did not follow
                     Jesus isthat the truths of Christianity can be understood only by
                     those who distrust themselves and crush pride of opinion, re-
                     nouncing every sin that the Spirit of God reveals. (See The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 455.)
                        But one of the reasons why more uneducated people did not
                     follow Jesus is that truth cannot grow in the heart of an inatten-
                     tive hearer.
                        Jesus did not belittle manual labor. His body showed the
                     ruggedness of a hard-working carpenter. He was able to appeal
                     to the toiling farmer, artisan, or fisherman. From experience He
                     knew the thoughts that cross the mind of those who labor daily
                     for life's necessities. He could speak to their humble concerns,
                     using "the simplest terms and the plainest symbols."—The
                     Ministry of Healing, p. 443.
                        One of the secrets of Christ's effectiveness with the un-
                     schooled is that He could see great potential when others saw
                     nothing special. "In the common walks of life there is many a
                     man patiently treading the round of daily toil, unconscious that
                     he possesses powers which, if called into action, would raise
                     him to an equality with the world's most honored men. The
                     touch of a skillful hand is needed to arouse those dormant
                     faculties."—The Desire of Ages, p. 250.
                        This keen appreciation of unseen qualities, especially in the
                     uneducated, is one of the strongest ties that a soul-winner can
                     develop. Trust begets trust. When a nonbeliever sees that it is
                     the spirit of Jesus that leads church members to spend time and
                     effort in their behalf, the attraction to Jesus as Lord will be deep
                      indeed.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do I see the unseen qualities in others? How can I assist
                     them in reaching out for opportunities to grow under the
                     Lord's guidance?

                       "It is the highest work of education ... to impart that vitalizing
                     energy which is received through the contact of mind with
                     mind, and soul with soul. It is only life that can beget life."—The

            Part 3     In what experience did Jesus show His disciples how they
    TO SINNERS AT    ought to relate to those whom they might consider "hopeless
   THE BOTTOM OF     cases"?
 THE SOCIAL SCALE
                       "The Samaritan woman said to him, 'How is it that you, a
                     Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?' " (John 4:9,
                     RSV).

                        Because fellow countrymen were making His ministry dif-
                     ficult, Jesus took the opportunity to show His disciples that the
                     gospel of the kingdom could be appreciated by those of whom
                     the least might be expected—society's apparently hopeless
                     cases. With the Samaritan woman Jesus showed that His saving
                     power could leap over any social, racial, or moral barrier.
                        Jesus was always alert to another's need. "With matchless
                     skill, he arrested her attention by asking for a drink of water;
                     then he aroused her curiosity by making some striking state-
                     ments; and by a process of self-revelation he led her to an
                     intense desire for soul-satisfaction which she had thus far
                     missed."—Gaines S. Dobbins, Evangelism According to Christ,
                     (New York: Harper and Bros., 1949), p. 55.
                        Kindly but firmly Jesus helped the woman to see herself
                     realistically. He did not cover up her sin by offering forgiveness
                     before she saw the depths of her problem and was willing to
                     repent. Although she tried to divert Him, He held to His course.
                     He appealed to those motivations that pull at the deepest wants
                     of men and women: love, worship, truth, fulfillment, salvation.
                     The stirring of her deepest human needs helped her to realize
                     that this Friend of the nonbeliever had something for her.
                        The Samaritan woman reminds us that, though a person may
                     have lived in the mire of sin, there may yet be much that can be
                     salvaged. In that noonday conversation she perceived more
                     about our lord's message than Nicodemus, or the leaders in
                     Jerusalem, or even the disciples had at that point. Somehow the
                     master disciple winner had helped her to take an honest look at
                     herself. He gave her a hope of recovery, believed that she was
                     redeemable, and talked to her, not with scorn, but firmly and
                     compassionately.

THINK IT THROUGH       Whom have I considered scarcely worth saving because he
                     has been living at the bottom of the social scale?

                       "The gospel invitation is not to be narrowed down, and pre-
                     sented only to a select few, who, we suppose, will do us honor if
                     they accept it. The message is to be given to all."— The Desire of

Model Witness       LESSON 6                                    ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      May 4
           Part 4    What outstanding New Testament incident shows how in-
   TO SINNERS AT terested God is in the salvation of the wealthy?
  THE TOP OF THE
    SOCIAL SCALE     "At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, . . . a
                  devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms
                  liberally to the people, and prayed constantly to God. About
                  the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of
                  God" (Acts 10:1-3, RSV).

                      "So today God is seeking for souls among the high as well as
                   the low. There are many like Cornelius, men whom He desires to
                   connect with His church. Their sympathies are with the Lord's
                   people. But the ties that bind them to the world hold them firmly.
                   It requires moral courage for these men to take their position
                   with the lowly ones."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 209.
                      Jesus understood the needs and desires of the upper classes
                   equally as well as He understood those of the lower. He adapted
                   His approach to the rich with no less masterful skill. "He sought
                   the acquaintance of the wealthy and cultured Pharisee, the
                   Jewish nobleman, and the Roman ruler. He accepted their invi-
                   tations, attended their feasts, made Himself familiar with their
                   interests and occupations, that He might gain access to their
                   hearts, and reveal to them the imperishable riches." —The
                   Ministry of Healing, pp. 24, 25.
                       The wealthy are more often neglected than the poor because
                   their riches seem to indicate that they lack nothing.
                       The instruction to the church is clear: "Those who belong to
                   the higher ranks of society are to be sought out with tender
                   affection and brotherly regard. Men in business life, in high
                   positions of trust, men with large inventive faculties and scien-
                   tific insight, men of genius, teachers of the gospel whose minds
                   have not been called to the special truths for this time—these
                    should be the first to hear the call."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                    p. 230.

THINK IT THROUGH      What special characteristics should mark those who work
                    for the wealthy and upper classes?

                       Although the disciple winners who seek out those higher up
                    in the social scale need not embellish themselves with the
                    trappings of wealth, "they will have to sharpen up, and be armed
                    and equipped in order to present the truth intelligently and to
                    reach the higher classes. Their minds must rise higher, and
                    show greater strength and clearness."—Evangelism, p. 556.

              Part 5    "If ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
          TO CRASS not even the publicans the same?" (Matt. 5:46).
       MATERIALISTS
                        The publican was the local collector of taxes for Rome—a
                     member of the class of society most offensive to the Jews. The
                     Roman government auctioned off the privilege of collecting
                     taxes within a city or province to the highest bidder. He then
                     collected the payment either directly or through his agents. To
                     the Jews, the payment of taxes was especially offensive, be-
                     cause it represented the tyranny of Rome; and the tax collector
                     was usually an extortionist who demanded as much as the
                     traffic would bear. "A Jew who accepted this office at the hands
                     of the Romans was looked upon as betraying the honor of his
                     nation. He was despised as an apostate, and was classed with
                     the vilest of society."—The Desire of Ages, p. 272.

                       What remarkable invitation by Jesus gives hope to crass
                      materialists everywhere? Matt. 9:9.

                        Matthew was the fifth man to hear our Lord's call to join His
                      service. Although almost everyone else judged Matthew ac-
                      cording to his occupation, Jesus saw that Matthew recognized
                      his need for spiritual help.

                        What further act, though infuriating the sanctimonious
                      church members, indicates how wide the outreach of the
                      Christian church must be? Matt. 9:10-13.

                        "Jesus sat as an honored guest at the table of the publicans,
                      by His sympathy and social kindliness showing that He recog-
                      nized the dignity of humanity; and men longed to become
                      worthy of His confidence. Upon their thirsty hearts His words
                      fell with blessed, life-giving power. New impulses were
                      awakened, and the possibility of a new life opened to these
                      outcasts of society."—The Desire of Ages, p. 274.

THINK IT THROUGH         How can I follow Christ's example in extending the hand of
                      friendship to highly visible worldlings? Should the Christian
                      assume the life-style of the worldling in order to be more
                      effective?

                        "The Pharisees would not consider thatJesus was eating with
                      publicans and sinners in order to bring the light of heaven to
                      those who sat in darkness. They would not see that every word
                      dropped by the divine Teacher was a living seed that would
                      germinate and bear fruit to the glory of God."—The Desire of

                                                                          May 6
         Part 6   What words of Jesus throw open the door of the church to all
          WITH classes of society?
     SOMETHING
           FOR    "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those
     EVERYBODY who are sick; I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners
                to repentance" (Luke 5:31, 32, RSV).

                     Jesus broke through many social and religious barriers by His
                   behavior as well as by His teachings. When He sat at the hon-
                   ored seat in Matthew's home, surrounded by the scorned and
                   despised of His day, He was signaling that God's heart is big
                   enough to receive anyone who senses his need for spiritual
                   help, regardless of his social circumstances.
                     Jesus never refused an opportunity to sow the seed of truth.
                   Through the art of winning conversation, the gracious consid-
                   eration for every person He met, He drew hearts to Himself—no
                   one was excluded from fellowship with God.

                     What approach did Jesus use in "telling the truth"?

                     "He did not make a direct attack on the errors of the people.
                   He saw the misery of the world on account of sin, yet He did not
                   present before them a vivid delineation of their wretchedness.
                   He taught them of something infinitely better than they had
                   known. Without combating their ideas of the kingdom of God,
                   He told them the conditions of entrance therein, leaving them to
                   draw their own conclusions as to its nature."—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 299.

THINK IT THROUGH     What value is there to me in studying the words and acts of
                   Jesus, especially in regard to meeting nonbelievers?

                      "In the training of the disciples the example of the Saviour's
                   life was far more effective than any mere doctrinal instruction.
                   When they were separated from Him, every look and tone and
                   word came back to them. Often when in conflict with the
                   enemies of the gospel, they repeated His words, and as they saw
                   their effect upon the people, they rejoiced greatly."—The Desire
                   of Ages, pp. 349, 350.
                      One of the first principles that Jesus made clear is that no one
                   is to be considered worthless. "In whatever company He found
                   Himself He presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the
                   circumstances. Every neglect or insult shown by men to their
                   fellow men only made Him more conscious of their need of His
                   divine-human sympathy. He sought to inspire with hope the
                   roughest and most unpromising."—The Ministry of Healing, pp.

                                          The integrity of Jesus was based on
                                          a life in proper perspective; He kept

             Part 1 What fundamental principle of mental and spiritual health
         HE TAUGHT did Jesus state clearly?
           LOYALTY
                    "No man can serve two masters" (Matt. 6:24).

                       The English word "integrity" is derived from the Latin word
                     for "wholeness." We maintain integrity when there is an undi-
                     vided loyalty; integrity exists when there is nothing missing,
                     when all is together and complete. When part of a person's life
                     seems devoted to one set of principles and another phase to
                     conflicting principles, we say that such a person has lost his
                     integrity; he lives a divided life.

                       What did James say about a person who has lost integrity?
                     James 1:8.

                         "We cannot serve God with a divided heart. Bible religion is
                     not one influence among many others; its influence is to be
                     supreme, pervading and controlling every other. It is not to be
                     like a dash of color brushed here and there upon the canvas, but
                     it is to pervade the whole life, as if the canvas were dipped into
                     the color, until every thread of the fabric were dyed a deep,
                     unfading hue."—The Desire of Ages, p. 312.
                         There are many ways to be a rebel, but only one way to be
                     loyal. Jesus, from His earliest experiences where He had to
                     make choices, set the pattern for human integrity. "At a very
                     early age, Jesus had begun to act for Himself in the formation of
                     His character, and not even respect and love for His parents
                     could turn Him from obedience to God's word. 'It is written' was
                     His reason for every act that varied from the family customs. But
                     the influence of the rabbis made His life a bitter one. Even in His
                     youth He had to learn the hard lesson of silence and patient
                     endurance."—The Desire of Ages, p. 86.

THINK IT THROUGH        When others are misunderstood and accused unfairly, what
                     is my response?

                        "Worldly policy and the undeviating principles of righteous-
                     ness do not blend into each other imperceptibly, like the colors
                     of the rainbow. Between the two a broad, clear line is drawn by
                     the eternal God. The likeness of Christ stands out as distinct
                     from that of Satan as midday in contrast with midnight. And only
                     those who live the life of Christ are His co-workers. If one sin is
                     cherished in the soul, or one wrong practice retained in the life,
                     the whole being is contaminated."—The Desire of Ages, p. 313.

Model of Integrity      LESSON 7                                     ❑ Monday
                                                                             May 9
            Part 2   What simple statement revealed our Lord's total commit-
      HE REFUSED ment to seek the glory of God alone?
          TO TAKE
       ADVANTAGE     "I do not receive glory from men. . . . I have come in my
                   Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in
                   his own name, him you will receive" (John 5:41-43, RSV).

                      "Jesus came by the authority of God, bearing His image,
                   fulfilling His word, and seeking His glory; yet He was not ac-
                   cepted by the leaders in Israel; but when others should come,
                   assuming the character of Christ, but actuated by their own will
                   and seeking their own glory, they would be received. And why?
                   Because he who is seeking his own glory appeals to the desire
                   for self-exaltation in others."—The Desire of Ages, p. 212.
                      If ever there was a man who could have amazed His fellow
                   men with brilliant mental excursions, marvelous feats of mem-
                   ory, or the most charming graciousness that would have made
                   everyone feel that all was well—Jesus was that person. But that
                   would not have given us an example of love and integrity. "None
                   of the means that men employ to win allegiance or command
                   homage did Jesus use."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 31.
                      Jesus did not seek attention by dazzling the senses with His
                   glory; He did not seek distinction by purely human achievement
                   gained by great mental or physical effort. He turned the atten-
                   tion of His listeners to the love of God and away from Himself, to
                   give glory to God, not applause for Himself. Such is integrity in
                   living the Christian life.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can we appeal to the wealthy and the educated without
                   courting their favor and receiving special attention?

                      The test of integrity comes when we are able to treat all men
                   alike, giving courtesies and time to the poor and rich alike.
                   There is a difference between courting favor and humbly shar-
                   ing truth in the most refined manner possible. "He set at nought
                   the artificial distinctions of society. The aristocracy of birth,
                   wealth, talent, learning, rank, He ignored."—The Ministry of
                   Healing, p. 197.
                      The call to reflect the glory of God (that is, the character of
                   Jesus) and the unconsecrated urge to magnify self create a
                   division within the church member who professes Christianity.
                   All acts to gain applause, even where others gain a blessing,
                   reveal a spirit that is yet divided and lacking in integrity.

             Part 3  What circumstance demonstrated that Jesus would not fol-
         HE WAS NO low a course of action merely because it was generally ex-
        POLICY MAN pected of Him?

                       "Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for
                     to hear him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying,
                     This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them" (Luke
                     15:1, 2).

                        The church leaders insinuated that Jesus preferred to
                     socialize with well-known sinners. "If He were a true prophet,
                     they said, He would harmonize with them [the rabbis], and
                     would treat the publicans and sinners with the indifference they
                     deserved. It angered these guardians of society that He with
                     whom they were continually in controversy, yet whose purity of
                     life awed and condemned them, should meet, in such apparent
                     sympathy, with social outcasts. They did not approve of His
                     methods."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 185.
                        In other words, Jesus was not a policy man; He did not live his
                     life in accordance with mere human expectation but in con-
                     formity with what God wished would be human policy.

                      When Jesus ate with the publicans at Matthew's house,
                     what crisis did He cause? Matt. 9:10-13.

                        "He well knew that this would give offense to the Pharisaic
                     party, and would also compromise Him in the eyes of the
                     people. But no question of policy could influence His move-
                     ments. With Him external distinctions weighed nothing."—The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 274.
                        A man guided merely by policy will in some way recognize
                     distinction of race, or rank, or creed. Instead of perceiving with
                     a clear eye what Jesus would do, a policy man endeavors to
                     please those who can return his favors and guarantee his per-
                     sonal security. But for Jesus, "no question of policy could
                     influence His movements."

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the policy principle today? What excuses do I nor-
                     mally give for my concessions to the policy principle?

                        "The policy principle is one that will assuredly lead into dif-
                     ficulties. He who regards the favor of men as more desirable
                     than the favor of God will fall under the temptation to sacrifice
                     principle for worldly gain or recognition. Thus fidelity to God is
                     constantly being sacrificed. . .. Hold fast your integrity in the
                     strength of the grace of Christ, and He will fulfill His word to

Model of Integrity     LESSON 7                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      May 11
          Part 4   What winsome invitation from Jesus reveals how His way of
HE JOINED TRUTH, life joins truth, peace, and humility?
     PEACE, AND
       HUMILITY    "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
                 lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls" (Matt.
                 11:29).

                      Learning of Jesus implies truth. His meekness and lowliness
                   combine in humility, and peace is the rest that He offers. These
                   were combined in His life and offered to His followers.
                      Perfect peace reigned in the heart of Jesus because He was a
                   man of integrity; that is, He lived by the truth. There was no
                   indecision or division of interest. Truth was His only concern.
                   He did not bend His behavior to please others or Himself. This
                   we will practice too if we learn of Him.
                       "We cannot follow Christ without wearing His yoke, without
                   lifting the cross and bearing it after Him. If our will is not in
                   accord with the divine requirements, we are to deny our inclina-
                   tions, give up our darling desires, and step in Christ's
                   footsteps."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
                   tary, vol. 5, pp. 1090, 1091.
                       Peace, humility, and integrity are interdependent virtues.
                   Without integrity there can be no peace or humility.
                       The person who looks for recognition every time he does a
                   good deed will often look in vain; his peace will often be dis-
                   turbed because he feels slighted. Such a person reveals a very
                   immature, partial understanding of truth. Truth, as we see it in
                   Jesus, brings peace and issues forth in humility.

                   less integrity and the absence of outward show?

                     The Jewish leaders, as well as most of the nation, rejected
                   Jesus largely because He did not conform to their expectations
                   of greatness and truth. Truth "has been unpopular ever since
                   Satan gave man a disrelish for it by presenting fables that lead to

                      "Because their understanding was darkened by selfish prej-

                   the fact that real greatness can dispense with outward show....
                   They questioned, If He was what He claimed to be, why was He
                   so unpretending?"—The Desire of Ages, p. 242.
                      The Pharisees were also offended by His "spotless integrity.
                   His blameless life flashed light upon their hearts.... Such a light
                   was unwelcome."—The Desire of Ages, p. 243.

                                                                            May 12
             Part 5   What did Jesus teach about self and following Him?
       HE REQUIRES
          DEVOTION    "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and
           TO DUTY take up his cross daily, and follow me" (Luke 9:23).

                        It seems natural for the uncommitted or even the partially
                     committed heart to seek self-gratification, to work even noble
                     and spiritual duties into opportunities for selfish reward. But
                     when Jesus tells us to take His yoke and His cross, both symbols
                     of giving up the will to God, He is asking us to face life as He did.
                        "He was never elated by applause, nor dejected by censure or
                     disappointment. Amid the greatest opposition and the most
                     cruel treatment, He was still of good courage. But many who
                     profess to be His followers have an anxious, troubled heart,
                     because they are afraid to trust themselves with God. They do
                     not make a complete surrender to Him; for they shrink from the
                     consequences that such a surrender may involve. Unless they
                     do make this surrender, they cannot find peace."—The Desire
                     of Ages, p. 330.
                        When we walk in His steps, we shall not be seeking the
                     highest place. The Christian is more interested in leaving the
                     sweet fragrance of Jesus than having the reward. "We shall
                     understand that the value of our work does not consist in mak-
                     ing a show and noise in the world, and in being active and
                     zealous in our own strength."—The Desire of Ages, p. 331.
                        The burden of life is very heavy when we concern ourselves
                     with seeking proper recognition. Anxiety and stress may largely
                     be due to an excess of concern for personal reward. These
                     afflictions can be immeasurably reduced by recognizing God as
                     the One to whom all credit is due.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I know that when I do a good deed I will be uncon-
                     cerned about who gets the credit, or whether my efforts were
                     appreciated or not?

                       "We need to beware of self-pity. Never indulge the feeling that
                     you are not esteemed as you should be, that your efforts are not
                     appreciated, that your work is too difficult. Let the memory of
                     what Christ has endured for us silence every murmuring
                     thought. We are treated better than was our Lord. 'Seekest thou
                     great things for thyself? seek them not.' Jeremiah 45:5. The
                     Lord has no place in His work for those who have a greater
                     desire to win the crown than to bear the cross. He wants men
                     who are more intent upon doing their duty than upon receiving
                     their reward—men who are more solicitous for principle than
                     for promotion."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 476, 477.

  PRICE OF TRUTH
                      "From that time many of his disciples went back, and
                     walked no more with him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve,
                     Will ye also go away?" (John 6:66, 67).

                       After Jesus fed the 5000 men from a boy's lunch, the people
                     had all kinds of visions regarding this young rabbi who could
                     easily lead them in overthrowing the Roman yoke. They wanted
                     to make Him their king on the spot; they recognized His wisdom
                     and power as extraordinary, and they wanted to capitalize on
                     His abilities. Israel had at last found their Messiah. Jesus, with-
                     out question, had captured the attention and admiration of
                     Israel.
                        But a man of integrity prizes truth and duty above approval,
                     recognition, and peace: "Perceiving then that they were about
                     to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew
                     again to the hills by himself" (John 6:15, RSV).
                        "Praise and flattery would be pleasing to their ears; but the
                     truth is unwelcome; they cannot hear it. When the crowds fol-
                     low, and the multitudes are fed, and the shouts of triumph are
                     heard, their voices are loud in praise; but when the searching of
                     God's Spirit reveals their sin, and bids them leave it, they turn
                     their backs upon the truth, and walk no more with Jesus."—The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 392.

THINK IT THROUGH       What would I do if friends and even loved ones threatened
                     to part company with me because of the truth?

                       "Jesus Himself never purchased peace by compromise. His
                     heart overflowed with love for the whole human race, but He
                     was never indulgent to their sins. He was too much their friend
                     to remain silent while they were pursuing a course that would
                     ruin their souls.. . . Real peace can never be secured by com-
                     promising principle. And no man can be true to principle with-
                     out exciting opposition.... Their [the true believers'] only fear
                     should be lest they surrender the truth, and thus betray the trust
                     with which God has honored them."—The Desire of Ages,
                     p. 356.     •
                        When God looks for leaders today, "they will be humble,
                     God-fearing men, not conservative, not policy men; but men
                     who have moral independence and will move forward in the fear
                     of the Lord. They will be kind, noble, courteous; yet they will not
                     be swayed from the right path, but will proclaim the truth in
                     righteousness whether men will hear or whether they will
                     forbear."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 263.

                       have done to you" (John 13:15).

                          Teachers should be living illustrations of what they profess. If
                       Jesus had not united words with life, He would not have been
                       long remembered. "What He taught, He lived.... Thus in His life,
                       Christ's words had perfect illustration and support. And more
                       than this; what He taught, He was. His words were the expres-
                       sion, not only of His own life experience, but of His own charac-
                       ter. Not only did He teach the truth, but He was the truth. It was
                       this that gave His teaching power."—Education, pp. 78, 79.
                          Truth is more than a system of belief. It is the basis of a way of
                       life and can be understood only through demonstration. This
                       demonstration makes Christianity's principles convincing.
                          "Christ came to demonstrate the value of the divine principles
                       by revealing their power for the regeneration of humanity. He
                       came to teach how these principles are to be developed and
                       applied."—Education, p. 77.

                         As the modern followers of Jesus fulfill the gospel commis-
                       sion, what principles should guide their witness?

                          "We are to acknowledge His grace as made known through
                       the holy men of old; but that which will be most effectual is the
                       testimony of our own experience. We are witnesses for God as
                       we reveal in ourselves the working of a power that is divine.
                       Every individual has a life distinct from all others, and an experi-
                       ence differing essentially from theirs. God desires that our
                       praise shall ascend to Him, marked with our own individuality.
                       These precious acknowledgements to the praise of the glory of
                       His grace, when supported by a Christlike life, have an irresist-

    EACH PERSON the individual and his special needs?
     IMPORTANT
                   "When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to
                 him, 'Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay
                 at your house today' " (Luke 19:5 RSV).

                      Jesus related to His followers in a manner much different
                   from that of many teachers since—He was interested in the
                   personal life and needs of each person who showed the
                   slightest interest in His message. Some, like Zacchaeus, have
                   been unable to meet at the usual gathering places, such as the
                   church or schools, because of geographical, social, or
                   economic problems. Many are passed by because they are timid
                   or lacking in self-respect. Jesus sought out men and women
                   one by one, and they responded to this personal consideration.
                      There is always the tendency for men and women to do Chris-
                   tian work "wholesale"; it is easier to lecture to a large group
                   than to encourage dialogue and feedback. "Retailing" the mes-
                   sage to people, one by one, is more difficult; but it is the surest
                   way to determine whether any learning is done.
                      "Everywhere there is a tendency to substitute the work of
                   organizations for individual effort. Human wisdom tends to
                   consolidation, to centralization, to the building up of great
                   churches and institutions. . . .
                      "Christ commits to His followers an individual work—a work
                   that cannot be done by proxy."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 147.
                      Jesus talked to the multitudes whenever there was an oppor-
                   tunity, but He got farther with the individual audience. "The
                   work of Christ was largely composed of personal interviews. He
                   had a faithful regard for the one-soul audience; and that one
                   soul has carried to thousands the intelligence received."
                   —Evangelism, p. 58.
                      Even when Jesus talked to the multitudes, each person felt
                   that he was being addressed personally. "Even the crowd that
                   so often thronged His steps was not to Christ an indiscriminate
                   mass of human beings. He spoke directly to every mind and
                   appealed to every heart. He watched the faces of His hearers,
                   marked the lighting up of the countenance, the quick, respon-
                   sive glance, which told that truth had reached the soul."—

        HE TAUGHT (1 John 1:2, RSV).

                       Christ's method of teaching His disciples furnishes us with
                    the most complete case study of how we should teach anyone
                    who needs to hear the gospel. "Through personal association
                    He impressed Himself upon these chosen colaborers. . . .
                       "Only by such communion—the communion of mind with
                    mind and heart with heart, of the human with the divine—can be
                    communicated that vitalizing energy which it is the work of true
                    education to impart. It is only life that begets life."—Education,
                    p. 84.
                       One of the prerequisites for liking those who need what we
                    have to teach is to learn all we can about them. The more we
                    know about the hopes, fears, and burdens of others, the easier it
                    is to sympathize and identify. That was Christ's way. He knew
                    what was in man (see John 2:25), not only because He became
                    man, but also because He studied the needs and interests of His
                    contemporaries. "He taught in a way that made them feel the
                    completeness of His identification with their interests and
                    happiness."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 24.
                       The story of Peter can be told today only because Jesus never
                    gave up. Peter had so much to unlearn as well as to understand.
                    "Patiently, with discriminating love, the Saviour dealt with His
                    impetuous disciple, seeking to check his self-confidence, and
                    to teach him humility, obedience, and trust."—Education, p. 88.
                       The secret of great teachers and soul winners is that they
                    know how to awaken interest and inspire perseverance in indi-
                    vidual students. Massive supplies of knowledge dispensed
                    freely does not, in itself, guarantee great teaching or witness-
                    ing. More than dispensing mere information, Jesus awakened
                    the hidden potential in individuals, one by one.

                    confidence, He inspired trust. Revealing in Himself man's true

                                                                        May 18
         68Part 4   What was the dramatic distinctiveness about our Lord's
   CONCENTRATED teaching?
   ON ESSENTIALS
                    "They were astonished at his teaching, for his word was
                  with authority" (Luke 4:32, RSV).
                    "No man ever spoke like this man!" (John 7:46, RSV).

                     Jesus had a freshness and power that only personal ex-
                   perience with the truth could give Him. Truth for Jesus was a
                   way of life, a life in right relationship with reality, seen and
                   unseen.
                     Instead of cold, formal lecturing about what men have said
                   regarding the great issues of life, Jesus taught His hearers to
                   behold God "as manifested in His works, in His word, and by
                   His providences. He brought their minds in contact with the
                   mind of the infinite."—Education, p. 81.
                       There is a vast difference in learning what men have said
                    about God and what God Himself has said. Too many think they
                    are learned when they know only what men and women have
                    said about God and life's biggest issues.
                       Our Lord's secret of power was that ','He said nothing to
                    gratify curiosity or to stimulate selfish ambition. He did not deal
                    in abstract theories, but in that which is essential to the de-
                    velopment of character; that which will enlarge man's capacity
                    for knowing God, and increase his power to do good. He spoke
                    of those truths that relate to the conduct of life and that unite
                    man with eternity."—Education, p. 81.
                       Another feature of Christ's teaching power was that He did
                    not minimize the common life and the responsibilities of hum-
                    ble tasks. "The things of this life He placed in their true relation,
                    as subordinate to those of eternal interest; but he did not ignore
                   -their importance."—Education, p. 82.
                       The fact that He spoke from personal experience, and not
                    from secondhand knowledge gained through studying the
                    opinions of men, gave Jesus a special ring of authority. The
                    learned men of His day spoke with scholarly doubt and hesita-
                    tion; but Jesus knew God and the Scriptures by His own in-
                     volvement and thus possessed a certainty of the divine origin of
                    the Bible.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I speak with greater convincing power and author-
                    ity regarding truth and duty so that others find reason to
                    believe also?

                      Jesus developed confidence and insight regarding truth. He
                    is the pattern for all His followers. Through faith, truth can
                    become a reality for all.

                    "You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I
                   am" (John 13:13, RSV).

                       If there was no learning when Jesus taught, there would have
                    been no Christian church. The success of making the plan of
                   salvation known to the world depended on our Lord's effective
                   teaching methods.
                       The fact that the high and the low, the scholars and the
                   unlettered, young and old all heard Him gladly suggests that He
                    knew the art of adapting His messages to the various needs and
                   expectations of a great cross section of humanity. The great
                   secret of successful disciple makers is their versatility. Without
                   it, even a very learned person is terribly limited.
                       "His [our Lord's] messages of mercy were varied to suit His
                   audience. . . .
                       " ... The most highly educated were charmed with His words,
                   and the uneducated were always profited. He had a message for
                   the illiterate; and He made even the heathen to understand that
                   He had a message for them."—The Desire of Ages, p. 254.
                       A hallmark of Christ's teaching methods was His effective use
                   of parables whereby He awakened incruiry. "He sought to
                   arouse the careless, and impress truth upon the heart. Parable
                   teaching was popular, and commanded the respect and atten-
                   tion, not only of the Jews, but of the people of other nations. No
                   more effective method of instruction could He have
                   employed."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 20, 21.
                      In using parables He was able to draw lessons from all walks
                   of life, thus capturing the interest of many different kinds of
                   hearers. Illustrations from nature also provided a fresh avenue
                   to learning. In His day as well as ours "too often the minds of
                   students are occupied with men's theories and speculations,
                   falsely called science and philosophy.... Let everything which
                   their eyes see or their hands handle be made a lesson in charac-
                   ter building."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 25.
                      Illustrations for Christ were not merely attention devices but
                   also essential steps in the learning process: "The unknown was
                   illustrated by the known; divine truths by earthly things with
                   which the people were most familiar."—Christ's Object Les-

                      "And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him
                    to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
                    and saw two ships standing by the lake" (Luke 5:1, 2).

                       An essential feature of an effective disciple maker is his voice.
                    The best of presentations can be adversely received and often
                    rejected because the voice is offensive to the hearer. "The
                    ability to speak plainly and clearly, in full, round tones, is invalu-

                      Ellen White learned that loud, rapid talking, with the voice
                    raised to an unnatural pitch, is not the way to represent our
                    Lord. "Christ was presented before me, and His manner of

                    a slow, calm manner, reached those who listened, and His
                    words penetrated their hearts, and they were able to catch on to
                    what He said before the next sentence was spoken. Some seem
                    to think they must race right straight along or else they will lose
                    the inspiration and the people will lose the inspiration. If that is
                    inspiration, let them lose it, and the sooner the better."—
                    Evangelism, p. 670.
                       A teacher's skill is also measured by his directness and
                    simplicity. "In Christ's teaching there is no long, far-fetched,
                    complicated reasoning. He comes right to the point."—
                    Evangelism, p. 171.
                       The manner in which truth is given is just as important as the
                    content. "Jesus uttered truth in a plain, direct manner, giving
                    vital force and impressiveness to all His utterances."—
                    Evangelism, p. 56.
                       Although Jesus knew that He spoke truth and that the well-
                    being of His hearers depended upon accepting and assimilating
                    His principles into their lives, He never coerced or intimidated
                    people into obedience. Think of His patience with Judas. In the
                    end, it was Judas who had to make up his own mind.

              Part 1     What social event did Jesus attend?
         JOY AT THE
           WEDDING      "There was a marriage at Cana in Galilee ... ; Jesus also
                       was invited to the marriage" (John 2:1, 2, RSV).

                         In spite of the distortions that have accumulated over the
                       years regarding our Lord, He was indeed a highly social person,
                       one that others wanted in their presence. They would not have
                       wanted Him around if He were not a great contributor to the joy
                       and pleasantness that men and women crave.
                         By His first miracle the proud parents of the bride were saved
                       from great embarrassment. For months, perhaps years, the
                       family had sacrificed, cutting living expenses to the minimum,
                       saving for that one social event in their family's life. But, unfore-
                       seen, the refreshments were depleted, and the dreams of the
                       happy parents crashed. But Mary leaned over to her Son, to that
                       one Person who always seemed to know what to do, and whis-

                       His sympathy with men, and His desire to minister to their
                       happiness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 144.

                         Do you think that there is a connection between this wed-
                       ding miracle and His life theme: "I am come that they might
                       have life, ... more abundantly" (John 10:10)?

                         It was not a great sermon by which Jesus set the pattern of
                       three years to follow. Nor was it a loving touch of His healing
                       hand. Rather it was the glorious intervention of a Man who tried
                       to show God's attitude toward life's happy moments. He saved a
                       family from embarrassment and a wedding reception from
                       breaking up. Could you imagine that He did it with a stern face
                       or a superior air of condescension?

THINK IT THROUGH         What special God-man characteristic do you see revealed
                       in our Lord's participation at the wedding feast?

                         "Jesus began the work of reformation by coming into close
                       sympathy with humanity. . . .
                         "Jesus reproved self-indulgence in all its forms, yet He was
                       social in His nature. He accepted the hospitality of all classes....
                       He gave no license to dissipation, and no shadow of worldly
                       levity marred His conduct; yet He found pleasure in scenes of
                       innocent happiness, and by His presence sanctioned the social
                       gathering."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 150, 151.

                                                                          May 23
           Part 2     How important to Jesus was doing God's work for people?
      THIRST FOR
     RECOGNITION      "He said to them, 'I have food to eat of which you do not
                    know.... My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to
                    accomplish his work" (John 4:32-34, RSV).

                      Meeting the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well revealed many
                    beautiful aspects of our Lord's humanity. The human inter-
                    change was not merely one-way. Jesus was hungry, thirsty, and
                    bone-weary. The water was near but inaccessible without a rope
                    and a jar. Jesus needed what the Samaritan woman could give
                    Him, and she needed what Jesus could give her—more than she
                    ever dreamed.
                      The exchange was more than mechanical courtesy. Jesus
                    could never do anything halfway or impersonally. He came
                    through to the woman as a very special kind of man—a gentle-
                    man, a tactful, considerate human being. As Jesus saw that she
                    appreciated His spiritual probing, He felt the freedom of open-
                    ing up her human potential. He rejoiced in her frankness and in
                    seeing her take the first sips of the water of life.
                      When the disciples returned from the village with the noon-
                    day lunch, they were surprised with their Master's verve and
                    happy contentment. What had made the difference, especially
                    without food? Jesus had eaten the food of doing God's work,
                    and a needy human being had responded to His invitation to
                    salvation. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 191.)
                      "Our Redeemer thirsts for recognition. He hungers for the
                    sympathy and love of those whom He has purchased with His
                    own blood."—The Desire of Ages, p. 191.

                      What other occasions provided Jesus with spiritual and
                    social satisfactions? Luke 10:38-42.

                      To the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, Jesus often re-
                    turned, not only to provide spiritual growth but to be nurtured
                    socially by these wonderful people.
                      "At the home of Lazarus, Jesus had often found rest. The
                    Saviour had no home of His own; He was dependent on the
                    hospitality of His friends and disciples, and often, when weary,
                    thirsting for human fellowship, He had been glad to escape to
                    this peaceful household . . . .
                       "Our Saviour appreciated a quiet home and interested listen-
                    ers. He longed for human tenderness, courtesy, and
                    affection."—The Desire of Ages, p. 524.

                Part 3     What social occasion demonstrated our Lord's ability to mix
     AN INTERESTING      with social classes other than His own?
     LIST OF FRIENDS
                           "Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a
                         large company of tax collectors and others sitting at table with
                         them" (Luke 5:29, RSV).

                            Perhaps Jesus had the most varied and most interesting list of
                         friends in all Palestine. It seemed that everyone was stimulated
                         by His presence and conversation, even the Pharisees and
                         scribes who were immensely jealous of Him.
                            Sneering as they spoke, the Pharisees derided the disciples
                         for Christ's hearty social life, comparing Jesus with John the
                         Baptist. But our Lord's reply showed again His joyful heart:
                         "Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is
                         with them?" (Luke 5:34, RSV). Bridegrooms are not known for
                         their sadness or gloomy looks. By life and words He was telling
                         the world that the kingdom of God belongs to the radiant-
                         hearted.
                            Although John the Baptist had his very special mission, "the
                         austerity and isolation of his life were not an example for the
                         people."—The Desire of Ages, p. 150.
                            Jesus made it very clear that the badge of Christianity is that
                         of the social witness, not that of the ascetic. How tragically the
                         Christian church for centuries perverted the principle of love
                         and service! They emphasized the hermit principle, and cast a
                         cloud over the happy, involved spirit. They made self-imposed
                         discomfort and personal misery the proof of spirituality.

THINK IT THROUGH           How energetic is my outreach to people, especially when I
                         note that it is through the social relations that Jesus dem-
                         onstrated what Christianity is all about?

                           "It is through the social relations that Christianity comes in
                         contact with the world. Every man or woman who has received
                         the divine illumination is to shed light on the dark pathway of
                         those who are unacquainted with the better way. Social power,
                         sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, must be improved in bringing
                         souls to the Saviour. Christ is not to be hid away in the heart as a
                         coveted treasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed solely by the
                         possessor. We are to have Christ in us as a well of water,
                         springing up into everlasting life, refreshing all who come in

Model of Sociableness          LESSON 9                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       May 25
           Part 4     What incident illustrated our Lord's identification with the
     SHARED THE     heartaches of His friends?
    SORROWS OF
     HIS FRIENDS      "Jesus wept" (John 11:35).

                      Jesus possessed an inner joythat radiated gladness wherever
                    He went. That does not mean that He always found something to
                    laugh about. A perpetual smile is totally unrealistic in this world
                    of misery and heartbreak. There are times when someone else's
                    sorrows are too much and the true friend weeps. Friends can be
                    made over common pleasures and interests; but the deepest,
                    closest friends are those who have cried together.
                       Lazarus was a special friend of Jesus, perhaps in a different
                    and closer relationship than any of the Twelve. To learn of his
                    death and the despair of his sisters touched Jesus deeply. He
                    not only identified with their sorrow, but also with every person
                    who has seen his loved ones slip into death.
                       He felt the human hurt caused by death. "In view of this
                    human distress, and of the fact that the afflicted friends could
                    mourn over the dead while the Saviour of the world stood
                    by—`Jesus wept.' Though He was the Son of God, yet He had
                    taken human nature upon Him, and He was moved by human
                    sorrow. His tender, pitying heart is ever awakened to sympathy
                    by suffering. He weeps with those that weep, and rejoices with
                    those that rejoice."—The Desire of Ages, p. 533.

                       How did Jesus relate to the imprisonment of John the Bap-
                    tist? Matt. 11:4-9.

                      "The Saviour's heart went out in sympathy to the faithful
                    witness now buried in Herod's dungeon. He would not leave the
                    people to conclude that God had forsaken John, or that his faith
                    had failed in the day of trial."—The Desire of Ages, p. 218.

THINK IT THROUGH      What kind of friend am I when my friends are dying or when
                    they have lost loved ones? To the elderly and friendless?

                      There is a difference between mechanically repeating Bible
                    promises to a soul whose heart is aching and sharing the human
                    hurt as Jesus did. Knowing that a friend truly cares when the
                    heart is heavy is perhaps the greatest therapy that a sorrowing
                    person can receive. This caring can be shown in many ways,
                    such as staying the night while the bereaved sleep, arranging
                    meals, and answering the phone. The need is more often for
                    quiet companionship than for conversation.

     ADMONITIONS-1
                    "Ye are the salt of the earth" (Matt. 5:13).

                        From earliest times salt has been used as a food preservative;
                      for the want of salt wars have been fought. In fact, salt was one
                     of the chief economic products of the ancient world; many of
                     the great highways of antiquity were built so that salt could be
                     made available to the cities.
                        Salt was so scarce, even in the time of Christ, that it was used
                     as money. Part of the wage of the Roman soldier was paid in
                     salt; in Latin, this payment of salt was called salarium; hence,
                     our English word, salary. When it is said that a person is "not
                     worth his salt," we conclude that he or she is not earning his
                     salary.
                        Jesus selected His analogy well, for salt is an indispensable
                     commodity. The spiritual lesson is obvious: Without the Chris-
                     tian in the world, corruption would be complete. "Were those
                     who served God removed from the earth, and His Spirit with-
                     drawn from among men, this world would be left to desolation
                     and destruction, the fruit of Satan's dominion. Though the
                     wicked know it not, they owe even the blessings of this life to the
                     presence, in the world, of. God's people whom they despise and
                     oppress. But if Christians are such in name only, they are like
                     the salt that has lost its savor. They have no influence for good in
                     the world. Through their misrepresentation of God they are
                     worse than unbelievers."—The Desire of Ages, p. 306.
                        When Jesus compared His people with salt, He taught a prin-
                     ciple opposite to the hermit principle, that monstrous perver-
                     sion of His way of life. "When God calls His children salt, He
                     would teach them that His purpose in making them the subjects
                     of His grace is that they may become agents in saving others.
                     The object of God in choosing a people before all the world was
                     not only that He might adopt them as His sons and daughters,
                     but that through them the world might receive the grace that
                     bringeth salvation. Titus 2:11. . . .
                        "Salt must be mingled with the substance to which it is
                     added; it must penetrate and infuse in order to preserve. So it is
                     through personal contact and association that men are reached
                     by the saving power of the gospel."—Thoughts From the Mount

                 "Ye are the light of the world" (Matt. 5:14).

                       Light is a necessity of our existence. Without it there would be
                   no life on this planet. Even in modern technology light has some
                   very useful applications. For example, since the discovery of the
                   laser, a device to increase light intensity, a whole new world of
                   technology has been made possible in medicine, communica-
                   tion, and other fields.
                       But if light is to be useful, it has to be uncovered and permit-
                   ted to shine. Furthermore, light comes from a source of energy;
                   it is not self-generating. God makes Himself responsible for the
                   existence of light—His first act of creation. (See Gen. 1:3.)
                       The sad fact about human history is that although man did not
                   originate light, he is able to keep it from shining—at least for a
                   time. Ultimately, light will destroy the darkness; light has a way
                   of filtering through all the barriers men and women erect. No
                   matter how dark the room, it takes only the smallest crack and a
                   wisp of light for a person with normal vision to detect it.
                       Jesus compares His people to light; they are to make the
                   difference between life and death in the lives of others; they are
                   instruments of great power; they are healing agents in a very
                   sick, sad world.
                       "Jesus did not bid the disciples, 'Strive to make your light
                   shine;' He said,'Let it shine.' If Christ is dwelling in the heart, it is
                   impossible to conceal the light of His presence. If those who
                   profess to be followers of Christ are not the light of the world, it
                   is because the vital power has left them; if they have no light to
                   give, it is because they have no connection with the Source of
                   light."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 41.

            Part 1   What terrifying experience became an opportunity for
         WHEN LIFE Jesus to teach a lesson in genuine faith?
        TUMBLES IN
                     "Master, we perish.... And he said unto them, Where is your
                   faith?" (Luke 8:24, 25).

                        The disciples were desperate as their Lord slept. Their best
                     efforts seemed hopeless; their boat tossed like a cork on the
                     turbulent Sea of Galilee. Awakened by their cry of panic, Jesus
                      stood in that tossing boat, raised His hand to the angry sea, and
                      commanded peace.
                        Although they expressed their gratitude and praise to Jesus, it
                      was evident that He was interested in something far more im-
                     portant: "Where is your faith?" Jesus, as a man among men,
                     was making a very important point to those journeying with
                     Him. He had rested in the stern of the boat, wrapped in peace,
                     without a trace of fear in His heart. But His peace rested in
                     faith—the same faith that all men may experience when they
                     trust in their heavenly Father's love and power.
                        The power that stilled the storm was not His own, but that of
                     His Father in heaven. How He reacted to peril was the way all
                     men may face difficulties—that way is the natural outworking of
                     the life of faith.
                        "As Jesus rested by faith in the Father's care, so we are to rest
                     in the care of our Saviour. If the disciples had trusted in Him,
                     they would have been kept in peace....
                        " ... Living faith in the Redeemer will smooth the sea of life,
                     and will deliver us from danger in the way that He knows to be
                     best."—The Desire of Ages, p. 336.
                        He still reassures men and women when they fear that they
                     cannot be like Him. Any self-serving excuse that we cannot be
                     "like Him" this side of the resurrection receives His rebuke.
                     Such strange defeatism places a low estimate on His grace, a
                     low expectation on what He can do for His friends. If His grace
                     and example are to mean anything, He expects us to develop
                     lives of strength and victory, and not to spend the rest of our
                     lives in some kind of pious apology for failing to do what He says
                     can be done.
                        "Where is your faith?" This is the question that Jesus asks
                     those who are expecting the advent. Out of that group who talk
                     about being ready, there will be a smaller group who will under-
                     stand our Lord's question and will possess His faith.

                      "It was in hours of solitary prayer that Jesus in His earth life
                   received wisdom and power. Let the youth follow His example in
                   finding at dawn and twilight a quiet season for communion with
                   their Father in heaven."—Education, p. 259.

                     How necessary was prayer in our Lord's life? John 5:19.

                     Jesus overcame temptation, not by an inherent power pos-
                   sessed only by Him and not available to any other human being,
                   but by the continual grace given to Him from heaven.
                      "To the consecrated worker there is wonderful consolation in
                   the knowledge that even Christ during His life on earth sought
                   His Father daily for fresh supplies of needed grace; and from
                   this communion with God He went forth to strengthen and bless
                   others. Behold the Son of God bowed in prayer to His Father!
                   Though He is the Son of God, He strengthens His faith by prayer,
                   and by communion with heaven gathers to Himself power to
                   resist evil and to minister to the needs of men. . . His own
                   example is an assurance that earnest, persevering supplication
                   to God in faith—faith that leads to entire dependence upon God,
                   and unreserved consecration to His work—will avail to bring to
                   men the Holy Spirit's aid in the battle against sin."—The Acts of

THINK IT THROUGH     In what respects am I making my faith stronger and more

                     Prayer isthe channel through which we see God's plans for us
                   daily; this is more than a textbook understanding that the mind
                   alone knows. The reality of God's presence comes through
                   prayer; and "as a shield from temptation and an inspiration to
                   purity and truth, no other influence can equal the sense of God's
                   presence."—Education, p. 255.

             FAITH recognize and honor genuine faith?
        RECOGNIZES
             FAITH    "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and
                    be healed of your disease" (Mark 5:34, RSV).

                        Out of the crowd one day a weary, suffering woman reached
                     her hand. She had spent all her means upon physicians and
                     medicines. However, this woman was different from most
                     others; she did not capitulate to circumstances but tried her
                     best to remain in charge of her life. In her heart she had re-
                     sponded to what she knew about Jesus; and now, this day, she
                     wanted no more than the opportunity to touch His garment.
                        But "in that one touch was concentrated the faith of her life,
                     and instantly her pain and feebleness gave place to the vigor of
                     perfect health."—The Desire of Ages, p. 343.
                       The fact that a woman was healed was good news, but Jesus
                     was concerned about something even more important. He
                     wanted everyone to learn a lesson of faith, both the woman and
                     the crowd. "The Saviour could distinguish the touch of faith
                     from the casual contact of the careless throng" (The Desire of
                     Ages, p. 344), and He wanted all who saw the cure to know how it
                     happened—by faith and not by superstitious touch.
                       The touch of faith not only heals the body but also makes
                     possible a whole new emotional pattern and mental outlook.
                     The touch of faith kept Jesus Himself alert, fresh, patient, and
                     vigorous—and so it will be for those who follow His example.
                     Even as He trusted His heavenly Father for daily strength, so we
                     all must discover the ennobling power of living faith.

THINK IT THROUGH      What practical difference is there between belief and faith?
                     What makes a religious experience saving?

                       "To talk of religion in a casual way, to pray without soul
                     hunger and living faith, avails nothing. A nominal faith in Christ,
                     which accepts Him merely as the Saviour of the world, can never
                     bring healing to the soul. The faith that is unto salvation is not a
                     mere intellectual assent to the truth.... The only faith that will
                     benefit us is that which embraces Him as a personal Saviour;
                     which appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as
                     an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction by which those who

                     Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a
                     confiding trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering
                     power."— The Desire of Ages, p. 347.

                                                                           June 1
              Part 4     "He said, 'It is finished' " (John 19:30).
    IT IS FINISHED
                         What do you think had been "finished" when Jesus died on
                       the cross?

                          Within the terrible darkness that shrouded Calvary, Jesus
                       showed the universe how unbowed and undefeated a human
                       being can be when all the evidence shouts the contrary. He had
                       no visible reasons for encouragement and was bereft of evi-
                       dence that His life had been a success. Such is the marvelous
                       power of living faith.
                          No other person will be asked to carry a burden as Jesus did
                       through Gethsemane and on the cross. However, many will bear
                       seemi ng defeat in the face of death—for all practical purposes,
                       failure. Our Lord's conquering faith made all the difference in
                       His life, and only by that same faith will hard-pressed men and.
                       women conquer. (See Rev. 3:21.)
                          "In those dreadful hours He had relied upon the evidence of
                       His Father's acceptance heretofore given Him. He was 'ac-
                       quainted with the character of His Father; He understood His
                       justice, His mercy, and His great love. By faith He rested in Him
                       whom it had ever been His joy to obey. And as in submission He
                       committed Himself to God, the sense of the loss of His Father's
                       favor was withdrawn. By faith, Christ was victor."—The Desire
                       of Ages, p. 756.
                          The cross ended Satan's claim to leadership in the eyes of the
                       unfallen worlds and loyal angels. It summed tip a remarkable life
                       that Satan said could not be lived on this earth; that life proved
                       that God still reigned, that His love and grace were sufficient to
                       keep a committed person from falling into sin.
                          "By His life and His death, Christ proved that God's justice did
                       not destroy His mercy, but that sin could be forgiven, and that
                       the law is righteous, and can be perfectly obeyed. Satan's
                       charges were refuted."—The Desire of Ages, p. 762.

THINK IT THROUGH         In what way is our Lord's victory of faith relevant to me?

                         Jesus was victorious because He was a man of faith. "Could
                       one sin have been found in Christ, had He in one particular
                       yielded to Satan to escape the terrible torture, the enemy of God
                       and man would have triumphed. Christ bowed His head and
                       died, but He held fast His faith and His submission to God."—

Model of Faith       LESSON 10                                         ❑   Thursday
                                                                             June 2
           Part 5     What experience of Jesus assures us that faith is built on a
     GROUNDED IN    person's grasp of Holy Scripture?
       SCRIPTURE
                      "He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
                    bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
                    mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4).

                       "Faith claims God's promises, and brings forth fruit in obedi-
                    ence.... Genuine faith has its foundations in the promises and
                    provisions of the Scriptures."—The Desire of Ages, p. 126.
                       In the wilderness experience Jesus revealed His source of
                    trust and strength. From His earliest years the Bible had become
                    a personal voice to Him, assuring Him that the God of Abraham,
                    Isaac, and Jacob was His personal Friend also. "When we learn
                    the power of His word, we shall not follow the suggestions of
                    Satan in order to obtain food or to save our lives. Our only
                    questions will be, What is God's command? and what His prom-
                    ise? Knowing these, we shall obey the one, and trust the
                    other."—The Desire of Ages, p. 121.
                      There is power in the Word of God. By accepting and as-
                    similating the principles of the Bible we are reaching out to
                    claim the power of God even as did the sick woman in the noisy
                    crowd.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what respect will last-day Christians go through an ex-
                    perience similar to our Lord's wilderness trial?

                       "Those who endeavor to obey all the commandments of God
                    will be opposed and derided. They can stand only in God. In
                    order to endure the trial before them, they must understand the
                    will of God as revealed in His word; they can honor Him only as
                    they have a right conception of His character, government, and
                    purposes, and act in accordance with them. None but those
                    who have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible will stand
                    through the last great conflict."—The Great Controversy, pp.
                    593, 594.
                       "In order to have true, abiding faith in Christ, we must know
                    Him as He is represented in the word. Faith is trustful. It is not a
                    matter of fits and starts, according to the impulse and emotion
                    of the hour; but it is a principle that has its foundation in Jesus
                    Christ. And faith must be kept in constant exercise through the
                    diligent, persevering study of the word." —Fundamentals of

                      In the raising of Lazarus, Jesus demonstrated that He was
                    acting in cooperation with His heavenly Father. He supplied the
                    faith, and the Father supplied the power. "Ever He had been
                    careful to make it evident that He did not work independently; it
                    was by faith and prayer that He wrought His miracles."—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 536.
                      When Jesus depicted the beautiful analogy of the vine and its
                    branches, He was emphasizing the vital necessity of a living
                    connection between disciple and Lord. In The Desire of Ages,
                    pages 674, 675 it is observed that He was also stating that as the
                    vine does not stand alone as the oak but needs a trellis for
                    support, so He "in His humanity was dependent upon divine
                    power. 'I can of Mine own self do nothing,' He declared. John
                    5:30."

                     How did Jesus compare His works with those His followers
                    would be able to do? John 14:12, 13.

                       "God was manifested in Him that He might be manifested in
                    them. Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers,
                    that men may not have through faith in Him. His perfect human-
                    ity is that which all His followers may possess, if they will be in
                    subjection to God as He was.
                       " . . . All who will go to work, trusting not in what they
                    themselves can do, but in what God can do for and through
                    them, will certainly realize the fulfillment of His promise.
                    'Greater works than these shall he do.' "—The Desire of Ages,

                    this possibility?

                      "As the Son of God lived by faith in the Father, so are we to live
                    by faith in Christ. So fully was Jesus surrendered to the will of
                    God that the Father alone appeared in His life. Although
                    tempted in all points like as we are, He stood before the world
                    untainted by the evil that surrounded Him. Thus we also are to

down to serve others, that humility is
not a product of weakness, but of
love.

                                            for his needs—and who acts
                                            accordingly—will always be a truly
                                            humble person.
                                               "When we have true humility, we
                                            have victory. The enemy never can
                                            take out of the hand of Christ the one
                                            who is simply trusting in His promises.
                                            If the soul is trusting, and working
                                            obediently, the mind is susceptible to
                                            divine impressions, and the light of
                                            God shines in, enlightening the

                                            only study Jesus as the model of

                                            the characteristics of false humility. A

                                            spirit, a shunning of responsibility—all
                                            indicate that a person has
                    ht.                     misunderstood the character of Jesus
                                            and the joy of living life fully, to the

       WHO IS THE troversy"?
     GREATEST?-1
                     "The disciples came to Jesus, saying, 'Who is the greatest
                  in the kingdom of heaven?' " (Matt. 18:1, RSV).

                       The days of Christ's ministry were drawing to a close, the
                    shadows of intrigue and doom were settling in. The disciples
                    misread the signals that Jesus was giving them, thinking that He
                    was about ready to set up His earthly kingdom. Their concern,
                    not for their Master's mission, but for their own honor led them
                    to argue among themselves over who was best qualified for the
                    various offices that would be needed. (See Luke 9:46.)
                       Surely it was disappointing to Jesus to note that the disciples,
                    at this late date, did not understand the.nature of His kingdom.
                    His answer was that of a great teacher knowing that his students
                    were not ready for a theological explanation. A principle, how-
                    ever, He did make clear; it is the crux of the "great controversy"
                    and the miserable heart of all human misunderstanding and
                    grief. (See Mark 9:35.)
                       "The strife for the highest place was the outworking of that
                    same spirit which was the beginning of the great controversy in
                    the worlds above, and which had brought Christ from heaven to
                    die.... Lucifer desired God's power, but not His character. He
                    sought for himself the highest place, and every being who is
                    actuated by his spirit will do the same. Thus alienation, discord,
                    and strife will be inevitable. Dominion becomes the prize of the
                    strongest. The kingdom of Satan is a kingdom of force; every
                    individual regards every other as an obstacle in the way of his
                    own advancement, or a steppingstone on which he himself may
                    climb to a higher place."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 435, 436.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what way may even church members today use Satan's
                    methods as they "do the Lord's work"?

                      "There can be no more conclusive evidence that we possess
                    the spirit of Satan than the disposition to hurt and destroy those
                    who do not appreciate our work, or who act contrary to our
                    ideas."—The Desire of Ages, p. 487.
                      "While you are so eagerly striving to be first, remember that
                    you will be last in the favor of God if you fail to cherish a meek
                    and lowly spirit. Pride of heart will cause many to fail where they
                    might have made a success."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 50.

                                                                          June 6
         Part 2   How did our Lord illustrate His answer regarding great-
     WHO IS THE ness?
   GREATEST?-2
                  "Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest
                in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 18:4, RSV).

                      The disciples needed more than instruction regarding the
                   kingdom of God—they needed "a change of heart that would
                   bring them into harmony with its principles."—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 437.
                      When Jesus used a child as an example of the spirit and
                   attributes that would characterize those fit for His kingdom, He
                   took for granted that we would not look at the negative features
                   of spoiled children. His audience recognized His lesson without
                   difficulty, and so should we.
                      What do we see in young children (and older children who
                   grow up in the fear of God) that makes them so lovable and
                   irresistible? "The simplicity, the self-forgetfulness, and the con-
                   fiding love of a little child are the attributes that Heaven values.
                   These are the characteristics of real greatness."—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 437.
                      Another aspect of healthy, properly nurtured children is their
                   "unreserved obedience" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 125)
                   springing forth from simple trust in their parents and others.
                   Their love is pure, without design or measure. "To be great in
                   God's kingdom is to be a little child in humility, in simplicity of
                   faith, and in the purity of love. All pride must perish, all jealousy
                   be overcome, all ambition for supremacy be given up, and the
                   meekness and trust of the child be encouraged."—Testimonies,
                   vol. 5, p. 130.

THINK IT THROUGH    What Bible characters are a model of greatness for us to
                   emulate faithfully?

                      "Before honor is humility. To fill a high place before men,
                   Heaven chooses the worker who, like John the Baptist, takes a
                   lowly place before God. The most childlike disciple is the most
                   efficient in labor for God. The heavenly intelligences can co-
                   operate with him who is seeking, not to exalt self, but to save
                   souls. He who feels most deeply his need of divine aid will plead
                   for it; and the Holy Spirit will give unto him glimpses of Jesus
                   that will strengthen and uplift the soul."—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 436.
                      The Lord can be truly served only by those who desire first His
                   character before they want to prove by great feats or heights of
                   office that they have His power.

Model of Humility        LESSON 11                                      ❑ Tuesday
                                                                           June 7

             Part 3   How did Jesus indicate the significant difference between
          NOT WITH the power of His kingdom and that of worldly enterprises?
     OUTWARD SHOW
                      "The kingdom of God cometh not with outward shew" (Luke
                    17:20, margin).

                       The Jewish mind had expected the Messiah to set up a king-
                     dom that would outshine, outpower, outdazzle that of Rome.
                     Although Jesus had been saying for three years that His king-
                     dom would not possess the trappings of earthly power, even at
                     this late hour His own disciples could not discern a power
                     principle that would perform its missionwithout worldly pomp.
                       Only after the resurrection did they begin to understand that
                     the glory of God is in self-sacrificing love, not in coercive power
                     or in pomp.
                        "It is as true now as in apostolic days, that without the illumi-
                     nation of the divine Spirit, humanity cannot discern the glory of
                     Christ. The truth and the work of God are unappreciated by a
                     world-loving and compromising Christianity. Not in the ways of
                     ease, of earthly honor or worldly conformity, are the followers of
                     the Master found. They are far in advance, in the paths of toil,
                     and humiliation, and reproach."—The Desire of Ages, p. 508.
                       The kingdom of God and the ways of this world are in direct
                     confrontation. Humility and self-abnegation are not the
                     methods by which men and women seek success in business,
                     politics, or in any other line of work where they want the world's
                     attention.
                        "Now, as in Christ's day, the work of God's kingdom lies not
                     with those who are clamoring for recognition and support by
                     earthly rulers and human laws, but with those who are declaring
                     to the people in His name those spiritual truths that will work in
                     the receivers the experience of Paul: 'I am crucified with Christ:
                     nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me' Gal.
                     2:20."—The Desire of Ages, p. 510.

THINK IT THROUGH      When I want to impress my friends regarding the truths of
                     my church, what methods do I normally choose?

                       It is very easy to fall into the trap of thinking that we will
                     convince worldlings that we have the "truth" if we can impress
                     them with the physical aspects of the church.

Model of Humility      LESSON 11                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       June 8
          Part 4  In what terse terms did Jesus describe the single object of
   CAME TO SERVE His life mission?

                    "The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
                   minister" (Matt. 20:28).

                     Our Lord's whole life was a living illustration of loving service.
                   Never before in the history of the world had there been such a
                   clear example of humble self-sacrifice. But the disciples had not
                   yet understood, although only a few days separated them from
                   the crucifixion.
                     The disciples had learned some of their lessons well, but the
                   elements needed most were lacking. Position, recognition,
                   honor still were motivating forces. They were still pressing their
                   arguments as to who was the greatest; they were using worldly
                   standards, placing their own estimates upon themselves and
                   upon one another.

                     What very ordinary circumstance provided Jesus with His
                   opportunity to show what godliness is like? John 13:4, 5.

                     The disciples knew that their feet should be washed after their
                   dusty journey, but their pride kept them from serving one
                   another. The action of Jesus opened the eyes of eleven of the
                   disciples to the greatness of humility.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what subtle ways do I express how proud I am of my
                   humility?

                      Humility has become a very elastic word, especially for Chris-
                   tians. It has been used to cover up sloth and negligence. When a
                   person avoids responsibility, pleading that others can do the
                   job better, the deference is often considered as humility. "To be
                   clothed with humility does not mean that we are to be dwarfs in
                   intellect, deficient in aspiration, and cowardly in our lives,
                   shunning burdens lest we fail to carry them successfully. Real
                   humility fulfills God's purposes by depending upon His
                   strength."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 363.
                      Another perversion of humility is to feign humility by masking
                   pride. Think of the Pharisee and the publican. The Pharisee, and
                   the Laodicean in every age, look, walk, and pray self-praise,
                   although clothed with the appearance of humility. But "the lips
                   may express a poverty of soul that the heart does not acknowl-
                   edge. While speaking to God of poverty of spirit, the heart may
                   be swelling with the conceit of its own superior humility and
                   exalted righteousness."— Christ's Object Lessons, p. 159.

                                                                            June 9

              Part 5     How did Jesus link His earthly performance with that ex-
       GIVEN YOU AN    pected of His followers?
           EXAMPLE
                         "I have given you an example, that you also should do as I
                       have done to you" (John 13:15, RSV).

                          Christ made it very clear that washing His disciples' feet did
                       not detract from His dignity. Humble service, rather than de-
                       tracting from greatness, actually establishes it. Jesus knew well
                       how subtle and self-serving the human heart is; He would not
                       leave His followers to define the meaning of humility. "Christ
                       Himself set the example of humility. . . .
                          " ...Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, that by
                       His example He might teach what it means to minister. His
                       whole life was under a law of service. He served all, ministerd to
                       all. Thus He lived the law of God, and by His example showed
                       how we are to obey it."—The Desire of Ages, p. 649.
                          He demonstrated that in His kingdom "the principle of prefer-
                       ence and supremacy has no place. The only greatness is the
                       greatness of humility."—The Desire of Ages, p. 650.
                          Jesus was doing more than demonstrating gracious hospital-
                       ity when He washed the feet of His companions; He was institut-
                       ing an ordinance of the Christian church which would be more
                       than a mere memorial of what He once did.
                          "This ordinance is Christ's appointed preparation for the
                       sacramental service. While pride, variance, and strife for
                       supremacy are cherished, the heart cannot enter into fellowship
                       with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the communion of
                       His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus appointed
                       the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed."—The
                       Desire of Ages, p. 650

THINK IT THROUGH         In what way do I follow the ordinance of foot washing to
                       cleanse my soul from all self-exaltation and evil surmising?

                         One of the greatest services we can do for children is to teach
                       them that humility is the mark of true greatness.
                         "One of the characteristics that should be especially
                       cherished and cultivated in every child is that self-forgetfulness
                       which imparts to the life such an unconscious grace. . . .
                         "Children need appreciation, sympathy, and encouragement,
                       but care should be taken not to foster in them a love of praise....
                       He who looks higher than himself will be humble; yet he will
                       possess a dignity that is not abashed or disconcerted by out-
                       ward display or human greatness."—Education, p. 237.

Model of Humility       LESSON 11                                        ❑   Friday
                                                                           June 10
           Part 6     After Jesus washed the disciples' feet He said,
    HAPPY ARE YE      "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John
                    13:17).

                       Can anyone think of better reasons for happiness than to
                    remember the blessings of the Lord—His forgiveness, His prov-
                    idences, His promises for the future? Add to these the realiza-
                    tion that all is well between friends, neighbors, and church
                    members. Such happiness is grounded on the awareness of
                    one's own incapacities to do God's will by sheer willpower or to
                    please Him by human performance alone. The ordinance of foot
                    washing brings all this into sharp focus. The truly humble can
                    be the most willing servants of mankind, the most genuine
                    peacemakers, the clearest reflectors of Christ's happy spirit.
                       When the Christian leaves the foot-washing service and sits
                    around the table for the Lord's Supper, it is not a time for
                    sorrowing, with the record of failure depressing him. "The self-
                    examination, the confession of sin, the reconciling of differ-
                    ences, has all been done. Now they come to, meet with Christ.
                    They are not to stand in the shadow of the cross, but in its saving
                    light. They are to open the soul to the bright beams of the Sun of
                    Righteousness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 659.
                       The truly humble person is the truly happy person. He is not
                    troubled as to whether he is getting all that he deserves; he is

                    than he does. He counts his blessings gratefully, noting with
                    concerned sympathy those who are less fortunate.
                       Christians, like their Master, should be the happiest people
                    alive. Happiness is the by-product of unselfish ministry for
                    others. It is not found in the pursuit or acquirement of those
                    worldly goals by which others recognize human achievement.
                    Simply put: The only way to find happiness is to follow the
                    example of our Lord, a beautiful blend of dignity and humility.

THINK IT THROUGH      Knowing that no one strives to be unhappy, on what do I
                    spend most of my time and energy? Will such goals bring
                    worldly recognition but not true happiness?

                      "Real happiness is found only in being good and doing good.
                    The purest, highest enjoyment comes to those who faithfully

                                                                           June 12
            Part 1   What interesting comparison did Jesus make when He in-
       HARMLESS AS structed His disciples regarding the spirit that should mark His
           DOVES true followers?

                        "Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves"
                      (Matt. 10:16).

                        Truth must be made clear; it must make its way in an arena
                     often preoccupied by either gross evil or sinister, devious coun-
                     terfeits. But truth cannot be proclaimed by force or hate. Such
                     methods and spirit cannot abide in the makeup of a person who
                     understands truth. Truth will make its way, not only because its
                      content is irrefutable, but also because its spirit is disarming to
                     those who honestly seek truth.
                        "Christ Himself did not suppress one word of truth, but He
                     spoke it always in love. He exercised the greatest tact, and
                     thoughtful, kind attention in His intercourse with the people. He
                     was never rude, never needlessly spoke a severe word, never
                     gave needless pain to a sensitive soul. He did not censure
                     human weakness. He fearlessly denounced hypocrisy, unbelief,
                     and iniquity, but tears were in His voice as He uttered His
                     scathing rebukes.... While He always bore Himself with divine
                     dignity, He bowed with tenderest regard to every member of the
                     family of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 353.
                        To represent Jesus is more than to recite His words; it means
                     to "re-present" Him in flesh and blood. Therefore, His followers
                     "need to have close communion with God, lest, under provoca-
                     tion, self rise up, and they pour forth a torrent of words that are
                     unbefitting.... This is what Satan wants them to do; for these
                     are his methods. It is the dragon that is wroth; it is the spirit of
                     Satan that is revealed in anger and accusing. But God's ser-
                     vants are to be representatives of Him.... Then they can present
                     the gospel with divine tact and gentleness. And the spirit that is
                     kept gentle under provocation will speak more effectively in
                     favor of the truth than will any argument, however forcible."—
                     The Desire of Ages, p. 353.
                        The spirit of the church member is more important than his
                     message in attracting others to stop long enough to hear him
                     out. Of Jesus we read: "The beauty of His countenance, the
                     loveliness of His character, above all, the love expressed in look
                     and tone, drew to Him all who were not hardened in unbelief.
                     Had it not been for the sweet, sympathetic spirit that shone out
                     in every look and word, He would not have attracted the large
                     congregations that He did." —The Desire of Ages, p. 254.

                                                                           June 13
           Part 2     How did Paul summarize obedience to the law of God?
  FULFILLING THE
         LAW-1       "Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he
                    who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law" (Rom.13:8, RSV).

                       This simple truth—"love is the fulfilling of the law" (Rom.
                    13:10)—has been very hard for even Christians to grasp. Chris-
                    tians have come up with endless procedures, duties, rules, and
                    standards in order to establish grounds for spiritual security—
                    but there is only one test that all who will be finally saved will
                    have to pass. Did they love genuinely, freely, and spontane-
                    ously? (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 637-641.)

                      In what real-life story did Jesus illustrate the principle of
                    love? Luke 10:23-37.

                       "In the story of the good Samaritan, Christ illustrates the
                    nature of true religion. He shows that it consists not in systems,
                    creeds, or rites, but in the performance of loving deeds, in
                    bringing the greatest good to others, in genuine goodness."—
                    The Desire of Ages, p. 497.
                       The love here described is far different from the diluted con-
                    cepts that so often pass for love. Christian love is not a good
                    feeling only, not an impulsive gesture of goodwill, not an at-
                    titude prompted by the attractive qualities of someone else.
                    Genuine love is a principle, not a feeling; it is the fundamental
                    principle of the universe, "the law of life for earth and heaven."
                    —The Desire of Ages, p. 20.
                       The difference between earthly love and Christian love is that
                    the former is manifested toward the lovely, toward that which
                    will benefit the lover while the latter "seeketh not her own" and
                    even loves the unlovable. That kind of love was clearly man-
                    ifested in the mission of the God-man, Jesus Christ, who died
                    for us while we were yet sinners. (See Rom. 5:8.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Are people and their needs more important to me than
                    anything else in this world?

                      "When love fills the heart, it will flow out to others, not be-
                    cause of favors received from them, but because love is the
                    principle of action. Love modifies the character, governs the
                    impulses, subdues enmity, and ennobles the affections."—

      FULFILLING THE level of being and doing rather than merely in knowing about
            LAW-2 righteousness?

                        "Then Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise" (Luke
                      10:37).

                        "The lawyer found himself a lawbreaker. He was convicted
                     under Christ's searching words. The righteousness of the law,
                     which he claimed to understand, he had not practiced. He had
                     not manifested love toward his fellow man."—The Desire of
                     Ages, p. 498.
                        "The Samaritan had obeyed the dictates of a kind and loving
                     heart, and in this had proved himself a doer of the law."—The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 504.
                        Something very fundamental about the quality of life is being
                     taught in the story of the Good Samaritan. The lesson was
                     emphasized in the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus reminds
                     us that "not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter
                     the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father"
                     (Matt. 7:21, RSV), and also in that sobering story of the judg-
                     ment (Matt. 25:31-46) where Christ "represented its decision as
                     turning upon one point. When the nations are gathered before
                     Him, there will be but two classes, and their eternal destiny will
                     be determined by what they have done or have neglected to do
                     for Him in the person of the poor and the suffering."—The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 637.
                        Faith in Jesus means more than most now understand and, in
                     the judgment, it will be too late to learn. "The faith in Christ
                     which saves the soul is not what it is represented to be by many.
                     ... Belief that does not lead to obedience is presumption....
                        "Obedience is the test of discipleship. It is the keeping of the
                     commandments that proves the sincerity of our professions of
                     love. . . . When benevolence, kindness, tenderheartedness,
                     sympathy, are manifested in our lives; when the joy of right
                     doing is in our hearts; when we exalt Christ, and not self, we may
                     know that our faith is of the right order."—Thoughts From the

THINK IT THROUGH        Is genuine love something that I can plot and schedule or is
                     it a principle that controls me and directs my life, often in
                     unforeseen times and places?

                       Genuine love is spontaneous, impartial, and costs time,
                     energy, and resources, without any thought of repayment.

                     "How often would I have gathered your children together as
                   a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!"
                   (Matt. 23:37, RSV).

                       Jesus early in His life discovered the sting and heaviness. of
                   misunderstood, unrequited love—from his brothers, neighbors,
                   and church leaders. In His ministry He experienced it too.
                       "With a yearning heart, Jesus saw those who had been His
                   disciples departing from Him, the Life and the Light of men. The
                   consciousness that His compassion was unappreciated, His
                   love unrequited, His mercy slighted, His salvation rejected,
                   filled Him with sorrow that was inexpressible."—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 393.
                       Anyone who desires to become like their model of love will
                   also experience similar pain. Parents because of Christlike love
                   will sense their duty to speak firmly to erring children—and
                   children will turn against them as surely as close disciples
                   turned from Jesus. ,Love does not always bring peace; often it
                   brings the sword of unrequited love.

                     From His farewell to Jerusalem, what do we learn about our
                   Lord's quality of life? Luke 19:41, 42.

                      Not easy was it forJesus to recognize unrequited love. "Jesus
                   raised His hand,—that had so often blessed the sick and
                   suffering,—and waving it toward the doomed city, in broken
                   utterances of grief exclaimed: 'if thou hadst known, even
                   thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy
                   peace!' "—The Desire of Ages, p.576.
                      However, in His last visit to the temple, during the mysterious
                   farewell of long-suffering love, Jesus showed us how to man-
                   ifest love in the face of hate and unconcern. "Keen and search-
                   ing had been His denunciation of sin; but He spoke no word of
                   retaliation. He had a holy wrath against the prince of darkness;
                   but He manifested no irritated temper.... Even in meeting those
                   who are moved by a power from beneath to maintain falsehood,
                   in Christ he [the Christian] will still preserve calmness and
                   self-possession."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 619, 620.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is it possible that some people refuse to get involved with
                   the need of others because they do not want to suffer the pain
                   of rejected love?

                                                                        June 16
           Part 5     With what scene did Jesus illustrate the power and scope of
       THE GOOD     genuine love?
       SHEPHERD
                      "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life
                    for the sheep" (John 10:11).

                       Especially for His hearers this picture of Jesus as a good
                    shepherd summed up all those qualities of thoughtfulness and
                    protection that were needed by any helpless and dependent
                    flock of sheep.
                       Whatever we say about Jesus in regard to the special qualities
                    of a good shepherd applies equally well to those who are called
                    to be His undershepherds—all His followers who have heard his
                    "Come." We are not called only to receive His blessings but to
                    be relay stations of these blessings as we convert them into our
                    own life-style and appealingly draw others unto us.
                       Sheep we are—helpless, dependent when on our own. To
                    recognize this is to begin to receive the blessings granted to
                    those who are "poor in spirit" (Matt. 5:3). But love sent the
                    Shepherd looking for us, not because we were lovable, but in
                    order that He might make us lovable and so, hopefully, eventu-
                    ally worth the effort.
                       As our Good Shepherd, He knows us by name; we were made
                    to hear and respond to His voice. Though He may be millions of
                    light-years away from us at the throne of the universe, through
                    His Spirit He is just as near as He was to Mary or Peter when they
                    knew Him. "And they shall never perish, neither shall any man
                    pluck them out of my hand" (John 10:28).

THINK IT THROUGH      How can selfishness or love be measured?

                       If I love only when convenient or when I am appreciated, is
                    that any more than a pagan would do? The Pharisees scolded
                    sinners and heaped scorn upon those who did not accept their
                    brand of religion. Yes, they had their hand of fellowship out—
                    they were known as proselytizers around the world; but was it
                    the hand of the Good Shepherd, extended from the tender,
                    loving heart?
                       "How many of the wandering ones have you, reader, sought
                    for and brought back to the fold? When you turn from those who
                    seem unpromising and unattractive, do you realize that you are
                    neglecting the souls for whom Christ is seeking? At the very
                    time when you turn from them, they may be in the greatest need
                    of your compassion."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 191.

Model of Love      LESSON 12                                             ❑ Friday
                                                                           June 17

            Part 6   What basic principle of love has been called the golden
     ACTIVE LOVE rule?
      INSTEAD OF
  PASSIVE JUSTICE    "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should
                   do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
                   prophets" (Matt. 7:12).

                     Simply stated, this principle of the golden rule is "Christ's rule
                   of life, by which everyone of us must stand or fall in the
                   judgment."—The Desire of Ages, p. 640.
                     For centuries the leading moralists emphasized the negative
                   golden rule; that is, "What is distasteful to yourself, do not to
                   your neighbor; that is the whole law, the rest is but commen-
                   tary." But that was only passive justice; Jesus poured love over
                   justice and turned the negative golden rule into its positive
                   principle.
                     Embedded in this golden rule is the implicit thought that the
                   Christian knows much that the unconverted do not know. The
                   Christian should in imagination place himself where the uncon-
                   verted are. Knowing what Jesus has taught him, the Christian
                   would be compelled by the golden rule to do unto others what
                   he would want them to do for him—if the other person did not
                   know the truth about God.

THINK IT THROUGH    In what respect is love the sum of all virtues and not just one
                   among many?

                      "Love is the basis of godliness. Whatever the profession, no
                   man has pure love to God unless he has unselfish love for his
                   brother. . . . When self is merged in Christ, love springs forth
                   spontaneously. The completeness of Christian character is at-
                   tained when the impulse to help and bless others springs con-
                   stantly from within—when the sunshine of heaven fills the heart
                   and is revealed in the countenance."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                   p. 384.
                     Christlike love is not only a benefit to others. If so, it could
                   easily be perverted into a varying measure of spirituality
                   whereby we can be proud of our obvious "self-lessness." True
                   love cannot be turned on and off according to the cir-
                   cumstances; it is the outworking of sanctification.
                      "Love for Him will give vital force to everything that is under-
                   taken. Thus through the right use of our talents, we may link
                   ourselves by a golden chain to the higher world. This is true
                   sanctification; for sanctification consists in the cheerful per-
                   formance of daily duties in perfect obedience to the will of
                   God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 360.

                     "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
                   the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev.
                   14:12).

                       In that awesome fourteenth chapter of Revelation, Jesus out-
                    lined to John the earthshaking events that would characterize
                    the generation just preceding the second advent. The world will
                    be brought to decision by God Himself working through His
                    church, specifically those who "keep the commandments of
                    God, and the faith of Jesus."
                       The separation and the line of demarcation will become obvi-
                    ous; philosophies, theologies, and life-styles will be judged on
                    one basis—how faithfully is the character of Jesus being repro-
                    duced!.
                       Abundant are the references in the writings of Ellen G. White
                    that describe the harvest of the seeds of gospel truth. When
                    these shall be in full display, they will contrast with the full-
                    grown characteristics of those who have rejected the intent and
                    power of the gospel.
                       "The life of Christ on earth was a perfect expression of God's
                    law, and when those who claim to be children of God become
                    Christlike in character, they will be obedient to God's com-
                    mandments. Then the Lord can trust them to be of the number
                    who shall compose the family of heaven."—Christ's Object Les-
                    sons, p. 315.

                       What is the connection between commandment keeping
                     and the faith of Jesus?

                      "In order to be prepared for the judgment, it is necessary that
                    men should keep the law of God. That law will be the standard of
                    character in the judgment.... Faith is essential in order to the
                    keeping of the law of God; for 'without faith it is impossible to
                    please Him.' And 'whatsoever is not of faith is sin.' "—The Great
                    Controversy, p. 436.

THINK IT THROUGH       What relation is there between the character of Jesus and
                     the faith of Jesus?

                       Jesus overcame temptation the same way we must—by faith,
                     by that trusting, obedient relationship with the Father that says
                     Yes to whatever God says is best. The faith of Jesus developed
                     the character of Jesus. Such will be the experience of His
                     people in the last days.

                   cause the harvest has come" (Mark 4:29, RSV).

                     Here Jesus refers to the harvest principle that is employed
                   often in the Scriptures when the unfolding of God's purposes
                   are described. The harvest principle helps explain why the day
                   and hour of Christ's return cannot be predicted and what it is for
                   which our Lord yet waits.
                      Jesus chose to compare the end of this world to a farmer's
                   harvest, because He knew that men everywhere understand, to
                   some degree, the hopes and problems connected with harvest-
                   ing a field of wheat or tomatoes in a backyard garden. He
                   compared the focal point of the plan of salvation to an earthly
                   harvest.

                     In what ways are the goals of the kingdom of God and a
                   farmer's field of grain the same?

                      Neither is ready to harvest unless the grain has matured. Even
                   as the farmer waits for his grain to mature, so Jesus waits until
                   the gospel seed has produced a sizable and significant group of
                   mature Christians.
                      Developing this biblical concept of the harvest principle,
                   Ellen White wrote: "The object of the husbandman in the sow-
                   ing of the seed and the culture of the growing plant is the
                   production of grain.... So the divine Husbandman looks for a
                   harvest as the reward of His labor and sacrifice. Christ is seek-
                   ing to reproduce Himself in the hearts of men: and He does this
                   through those who believe in Him. The object of the Christian
                   life is fruit bearing—the reproduction of Christ's character in
                   the believer, that it may be reproduced in others."—Christ's
                   Object Lessons, p. 67.

THINK IT THROUGH     In view of the truth stated above, what am I personally doing
                   to hasten or delay His return?

                     Ellen White comments on the biblical principle of the harvest:
                   "Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
                   Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be
                   perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim
                   them as His own."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 69.

The Model Waiting to Be Reproduced                LESSON 13         ❑ Tuesday
                                                                      June 21

            Part 3   How did Jesus, through John the revelator, describe the
      THE HARVEST fulfillment of the harvest principle?
      PRINCIPLE-2
                     "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee
                   to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And he that sat on
                   the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was
                   reaped" (Rev. 14:15, 16).

                      Sadly, while the power of God is maturing Christlike charac-
                    ters, there is the parallel development of maturing sinners,
                    symbolized elsewhere by the tares. The last days will give evi-
                    dence, not only of what the power of God can do for men and
                    women, but also of what unrestrained self-indulgence and hate
                    will do. The exhibit of a world of greedy, thoughtless, violent
                    men and women will stand in stark contrast with those who
                    stand for integrity, peace, and hope. The harvest for which
                    Jesus waits will separate the end products of faith and of sin—
                    commandment keepers who reflect Christ's character from
                    those who have fully developed the characteristics of the beast
                    and his image.
                      The purpose of the divine Husbandman is to have the divine
                    seed—the principles of the gospel—bear fruit. The goal of the
                    divine seed sowing is to reproduce men and women like Jesus.
                    Such a goal is not visionary; it is the crowning glory of God's
                    love and grace and that for which all Heaven waits.
                      "By revealing in our own life the character of Christ we co-
                    operate with Him in the work of saving souls. It is only by
                    revealing in our life His character that we can co-operate with
                    Him. And the wider the sphere of our influence, the more good
                    we may do. When those who profess to serve God follow
                    Christ's example, practicing the principles of the law in their
                    daily life; when every act bears witness that they love God
                    supremely and their neighbor as themselves, then will the
                    church have power to move the world."—Christ's Object Les-
                    sons, p. 340.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what way does Jesus become my model during this time
                     that could be that of the last generation?

                       Someday a generation of advent-oriented Christians will rec-
                     ognize that God waits for a people about whom He can proudly
                     say, "Here they are; everyone look at them carefully. Do you
                     want what they have? Do you want your children to grow up like
                     theirs? Do you want their happiness and hope? If you do, then
                     you must know their secret. They keep My commandments, and
                     they have a faith like Jesus had."

The Model Waiting to Be Reproduced                LESSON 130 Wednesday
                                                               June 22
         Part 4    How did Jesus connect character development and the
 BEAR MUCH FRUIT glory of God?

                     "By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and
                   so prove to be my disciples" (John 15:8, RSV).

                      Sin is not only distrust and disobedience; it is also robbery. It
                   misappropriates that which belongs to God; it is a theft that
                   builds up a kingdom over against the kingdom of God. Sin
                   matures a character that is in stark contrast with the self-
                   sacrificing character of God.
                      One of the reasons why Jesus came to earth was to give men
                   and women a model of what the truly human 'Was like; He
                   showed us that the sanctified life simply means that God has full
                   ownership—mentally, physically, socially, and spiritually. The
                   rebel misuses and defaces God's original property; but the loyal
                   Christian will reflect the glory of God's kingdom.
                      "All who receive Christ as a personal Saviour are to dem-
                   onstrate the truth of the gospel and its saving power upon the
                   life.... All the riches of heaven are to be revealed through God's
                   people."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 301.
                      Reflecting or glorifying Christ is to be the sole goal of Chris-
                   tianity, just as reflecting or glorifying the Father was the sole
                   goal of our Lord's life.

THINK IT THROUGH      True Christians will reflect the character of God; and God
                   will be vindicated in the great controversy. What is the rela-
                   tionship between these two truths?

                      "Of the Spirit Jesus said, 'He shall glorify Me.' The Saviour
                   came to glorify the Father by the demonstration of His love; so
                   the Spirit was to glorify Christ by revealing His grace to the
                   world. The very image of God is to be reproduced in humanity.
                   The honor of God, the honor of Christ, is involved in the perfec-
                   tion of the character of His people."—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.
                      No other concept is more thrilling or more sobering than this:
                   The plan of salvation, as well as the time for the second advent,
                   depends upon the quality of glory that Christians reflect. "In His
                   people He is glorified. Through them the Sun of Righteousness
                   will shine in undimmed luster to the world.... He has bestowed
                   upon His people capabilities and blessings that they may repre-
                   sent His own sufficiency. The church, endowed with the righ-
                   teousness of Christ, is His depositary, in which the riches of His
                   mercy, His grace, and His love, are to appear in full and final
                   display."—The Desire of Ages, p. 680.

The Model Waiting to Be Reproduced                  LESSON 13 ❑ Thursday
                                                                 June 23
           Part 5     How closely are we to copy the Model Man?
      EVEN AS HE
       OVERCAME       "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
                    throne, even as I also overcame" (Rev. 3:21).

                       "These are the words of our Substitute and Surety. He who is
                    the divine Head of the church, the mightiest of conquerors,
                    would point His followers to His life, His toils, His self-denials,
                    His struggles and sufferings, through contempt, through rejec-
                    tion, ridicule, scorn, insult, mockery, falsehood, up the path of
                    Calvary to the scene of the crucifixion, that they might be en-
                    couraged to press on toward the mark for the prize and reward
                    of the overcomer. Victory is assured through faith and
                    obedience."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
                    tary, vol. 7, p. 966.
                       That glorious group in Revelation 14:12—those who keep the
                    commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus—are over-
                    comers!
                       Constantly we must keep in mind that "Christ's overcoming
                    and obedience is that of a true human being. . . .
                       "The obedience of Christ to His Father was the same obedi-
                    ence that is required of man. Man cannot overcome Satan's
                    temptations without divine power to combine with his instru-
                    mentality. So with Jesus Christ; He could lay hold of divine
                    power. He came not to our world to give the obedience of a
                    lesser God to a greater, but as a man to obey God's holy law, and
                    in this way He is our example. The Lord Jesus came to our world,
                    not to reveal what a God could do, but what a man could do,
                    through faith in God's power to help in every emergency. Man
                    is, through faith, to be a partaker in the divine nature, and to
                    overcome every temptation wherewith he is beset.
                       "The Lord now demands that every son and daughter of
                    Adam, through faith in Jesus Christ, serve Him in human nature
                    which we now have.... Jesus, the world's Redeemer, could only
                    keep the commandments of God in the same way that humanity
                    can keep them."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                    mentary, vol. 7, p. 929.

THINK IT THROUGH      When Jesus asks us to obey and overcome as He did, does
                    this make us happy or sad? Is this good news or dreary?

                      Could any news be more needed? What can bring us more
                    hope and greater happiness than to believe that we need not
                    succumb to temptation, that we need not remain sinners! This is
                    good news for honest, struggling men and women everywhere.

                                                                          June 24

                    "As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also
                  sent them into the world" (John 17:18).

                      "As Christ is the channel for the revelation of the Father, so
                   we are to be the channel for the revelation of Christ. While our
                   Saviour is the great source of illumination, forget not, 0 Chris-
                   tian, that He is revealed through humanity. . . . The church of
                   Christ, every individual disciple of the Master, is heaven's ap-
                   pointed channel for the revelation of God to men. Angels of
                   glory wait to communicate through you heaven's light and
                   power to souls that are ready to perish."—Thoughts From the
                   Mount of Blessing, p. 40.
                      One of the saddest misunderstandings and the most tragic of
                   perversities has been for Christians to think that they are reveal-
                   ing Christ and His truth by merely talking about Him and reciting
                   His words. God could not have revealed His love and holiness by
                   writing the message across the clouds; no more can we truly
                   reveal His love and power by merely proclaiming it from the
                   pulpit or the printing press.
                      Ellen White often describes the forces of heaven as "waiting"
                   for church members to grasp the purpose for their lives and why
                   Jesus has not returned. (See The Acts of the Apostles, p. 111;
                   and The Desire of Ages, p. 297.)

THINK IT THROUGH      What is my first responsibility to God and the test of my
                   fitness for heaven?

                      "Consider the life of Christ. Standing at the head of humanity,
                   serving His Father, He is an example of what every son should
                   and may be. The obedience that Christ rendered God requires
                   from human beings today."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 282.
                      "By implanting in their [Christ's followers'] hearts the princi-
                   ples of His word, the Holy Spirit develops in men the attributes
                   of God. The light of His glory—His character—is to shine forth in
                   His followers."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 414.
                      "At this time a message from God is to be proclaimed, a
                   message illuminating in its influence and saving in its power.
                   His character is to be made known. . . .
                         .. The children of God are to manifest His glory. In their own
