#### Time of the End

## 1977 Quater 4
YBREAK SERIES   OCT   DEC. 1977
The last loaf of bread. And the
     prophet had asked for it,
 calling on the woman to put
     God first and to trust the
  promise of God. She knew
  what God was like. So she
  poured out her last oil and
     meal for the Lord's work.


      This Sabbath, when the
   Sabbath School offering is
    received, will your giving
   habits show that you know
   what the Lord is like? Will
    yours be a sacrificial gift,
offered out of trust and love?


 The woman and her son saw
the miracle of God's continual
        providing. God is still
  performing miracles today.




                                   Open Heart
                       Let Gods love show through your giving.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY




          Dear Sabbath school members around the world:

          Saludos from the Inter-American Division!

          The Lord has marvelously blessed His work in Inter-America. In the last
          five years more than 210,000 new souls have been added to the church by
          baptism or profession of faith. The membership in the Division has
          soared to almost half a million members. This phenomenal growth has,
          of course, caused some problems--the need for more workers, more places
          of worship, more schools, more health facilities, et cetera.

          I can assure you that our workers and members are doing the utmost to face
          these tremendous needs. They are sacrificing in many ways to meet their
          portion of the church's needs at home and also in the world field.

          During this quarter we will be looking to you again to assist us in two
          special projects which the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering Overflow will benefit:

               1. The completion of a hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Haiti is
          a country of great possibilities, but also of many needs. For the last
          eight years, an out-patient clinic has served the Port-au-Prince area,
          taking care of 1,-450 patients per month. With the help of the organiza-
          tion and a group of members called "Missions International" a new hospi-
          tal was begun in 1975; however, they certainly need all the help they
          can receive to finish it. Your contributions to the Thirteenth Sabbath
          Offering this quarter will help to achieve this goal.

               2. The construction of the men's dormitory at the Central American
          Union College. Seven countries which in themselves form seven local
          fields, compose the Central American Union. From Guatemala and Belice
          in the north, to Panama in the south, these seven fields look to CADES,
          as the union college is known among them, for their workers and as the
          place of refuge for their youth. The present men's dormitory is quite
          old and inadequate for the needs of today. It is imperative that a new
          dormitory be built to accommodate the young men who are attending this
          institution to become workers. Your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for
          this quarter will also help to build this much needed men's dormitory at
          CADES.

           We know that with the help of the Sabbath school members around the world
           these two projects will be a reality soon. For the liberality with which
                ave always    ated    er-America, again we say MUCHAS, MUCHAS GRACIAS!

                The Time of the End
                                     Introduction

    "Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?" (Isa. 21:11). This
ancient cry from Edom echoes down the corridors of the centuries. The times were
perplexing, and the Edomites desired to know when the morning would come. They
longed for the dawn to roll away the mists of their dread and despair.
    Ed om's fearful inquiry is breathed again by many thoughtful persons today. Jour-
nalists speak of our world community as being in "a state of perpetual crisis."
Modern communications and modes of travel have shrunk our world. Distant, un-
known nations have become neighbors. What affects one part of the city affects the
other parts. And in this generation it seems as though the world city staggers from
one crisis to another. Men's hearts are fearful as they consider what disasters may be
coming in the future.
    But God has not left His people in doubt as to the meaning 'of our times. The
prophecies of the Bible foretold the conditions which would develop in our world
society just before Jesus' return. The troubles of an aging creation are described as
the sharp pains and anguish of birth which in turn will issue forth the coming of
Christ, the cessation of sin, and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom.
    In the Bible the period preceding the advent is called "the time of the end." As we
 shall see, "the time of the end" is a specific period of time beginning at the close of
 the papal period in 1798 and extending to the return of Christ. During this period
 would occur the signs foretold in Scripture.
    Jesus announced that celestial signs would signal His coming. Gabriel told the
 prophet Daniel that his book would be opened and understood in "the time of the
 end." And when the seal broke, earnest Bible students discovered that a great
 investigative, pre-advent judgment had begun in heaven and would continue during
 the time of the end, vindicating God and the subjects of His kingdom.
     Prophecy also disclosed the rise of a vigorous religious movement that would give
 God's last invitation of mercy with a special "time of the end" emphasis.
     But God's actions in heaven and through His last-day people would meet with many
 challenges on earth. Political, moral, social, and religious developments on earth
 would constitute not only signs of the nearing day of Christ, but would also pose
  problems to the advancement of God's work.
     As we study the many signs of distress and declension, we cannot but realize that
  humanity is nearly bankrupt. Insurmountable problems seem poised to crush out
  human existence as we know it. Yet, while many despair, this can be the church's
  finest hour. Men at their wits end may now give pause to listen to what God's people
  have to say. By word and by life-style the church may lift up Jesus Christ, the only
  answer and hope of mankind. Daily the second advent becomes more relevant as the
  only remedy for earth's ills.
     Like the ancient prophet, the church may answer the despairing cry of modern man
  with the hopeful, yet truthful words: "The morning cometh, and also the night." The
  eternal day of Christ's kingdom is about to dawn, and sin's day will be forever ended.

                         "One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths re-
                     vealed in the Bible is that of Christ's second coming to complete
                     the great work of redemption. To God's pilgrim people, so long
                     left to sojourn in 'the region and shadow of death,' a precious,
                     joy-inspiring hope is given in the promise of His appearing, who
                     is 'the resurrection and the life,' to 'bring home again His
                     banished.' The doctrine of the second advent is the very keynote
                     of the Sacred Scriptures."—The Great Controversy, p. 299
                         "The coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope of His
                     true followers. The Saviour's parting promise upon Olivet, that
                     He would come again, lighted up the future for His disciples,
                     filling their hearts with joy and hope that sorrow could not
                     quench nor trials dim. Amid suffering and persecution, the
                     'appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ' was
                     the 'blessed hope.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 302.

                       What promise did Jesus make which holy angels affirmed
                     on the day of His ascension? John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11.

                        "The disciples had beheld the cloud receive Him.... And the
                     angels had assured them that the very One whom they had seen
                     go up into heaven, would come again. . . . Well might the
                     disciples rejoice in the hope of their Lord's return."—The Desire
                     of Ages, p. 832.

                       What ordinance did Jesus institute to keep the hope of His
                     return fresh in the minds of His people? 1 Cor. 11:26.

                       "The Communion service points to Christ's second coming. It
                     was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the
                     disciples."—The Desire of Ages, p. 659.
                       For successful living a person needs to recognize a meaning-
                     ful authority and have a worthy objective in life. The Christian
                     centers his life on Christ. His hope is fixed upon the second
                     coming of Christ. All the decisions of his life are made in refer-
                     ence to Jesus and that final event.

THINK IT THROUGH       How does my personal belief in Christ's coming affect my
                     everyday living?

                       "I saw that the words, the dress, and actions should tell for
                     God. Then a holy influence will be shed upon         Unbelievers
                     will see that the truth we profess has a holy influence and that
                     faith in Christ's coming affects the character of the man or

The Final Times      LESSON 1                                     ❑ Monday
                                                                 September 26
          Part 2   What important climactic event did the disciples associate
      TIME'S END with the second coming of Christ?

                     "As he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
                   unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things
                   be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of
                   the world?" (Matt. 24:3).

                     Some Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will
                   usher in His personal reign over the nations of earth as they now
                   exist, and peace and prosperity will ensue. This view sees a
                   continuation of this present world under Christ's rule. But the
                   Scriptures plainly portray that Christ's coming brings the end of
                   this present world, not an extension. The coming of Christ
                   brings deliverance to God's people, but a cataclysmic end to
                   sinful human life.

                     How will the impenitent react to the actual appearing of
                   Christ? Matt. 24:30; Rev. 6:14-17.

                     What effect will the coming of Christ have upon the impeni-
                   tent and the organized forces of apostasy? 2 Thess. 1:7-9; 2:8.

                      "At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face
                   of the whole earth—consumed with the spirit of His mouth and
                   destroyed by the brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people
                   to the City of God, and the earth is emptied of its
                   inhabitants."—The Great Controversy, p. 657.

                     What impact do the last plagues and the second coming
                   have on the physical earth? Rev. 16:17-21; 2 Peter 3:10.

THINK IT THROUGH     What spiritual preparation am I making for the end of time—
                   the end of human probation?

                      "The day of the Lord is approaching with stealthy tread; but
                   the supposed great and wise men know not the signs of Christ's
                   coming or of the end of the world. . . .
                      "There are thousands upon thousands, millions upon mil-
                   lions, who are now making their decision for eternal life or
                   eternal death. The man who is wholly absorbed in his counting
                   room, the man who finds pleasure at the gaming table, the man
                   who loves to indulge perverted appetite, the amusement lover,
                   the frequenters of the theater and the ballroom, put eternity out
                   of their reckoning. . . . They are not in the procession that is
                   moving heavenward. They are led by the great apostate, and
                   with him will be destroyed."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 406, 407.

            Part 3   According to the apostle Paul, Christians were not to expect
      EXPECTED TIME the return of Christ until after the development of what apos-
                   tasy in the Christian church?

                       "Now we beseech you, brethren, . . that ye be not soon
                     shaken in mind, or be troubled ... as that the day of Christ is at
                     hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall
                     not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man
                     of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and
                     exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is wor-
                     shipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shew-
                     ing himself that he is God" (2 Thess. 2:1-4).

                        While the Christian must always live in daily reference to the
                     coming of Christ, yet God foretold that certain events would
                     take place in the earth before the actual advent.
                        "The apostle Paul warned the church not to look for the
                     coming of Christ in his day.... Not till after the great apostasy,
                     and the long period of the reign of the 'man of sin,' can we look
                     for the advent of our Lord. The 'man of sin,' which is also styled
                     'the mystery of iniquity,' the son of perdition,' and 'that wicked,'
                     represents the papacy, which, as foretold in prophecy, was to
                     maintain its supremacy for 1260 years. This period ended in
                     1798. The coming of Christ could not take place before that
                     time. Paul covers with his caution the whole of the Christian
                     dispensation down to the year 1798. It is this side of that time
                     that the message of Christ's second coming is to be
                     proclaimed."—The Great Controversy, p. 356.

                       What era of human suffering did Christ indicate would take
                     place before Christians could expect His return? Matt.
                     24:21, 22.

                       "Between these two events [the destruction of Jerusalem and
                     the second advent], there lay open to Christ's view long cen-
                     turies of darkness, centuries for His church marked with blood
                     and tears and agony.... For more than a thousand years such
                     persecution as the world had never before known was to come
                     upon Christ's followers. Millions upon millions of His faithful
                     witnesses were to be slain."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 630, 631.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why have Christians been told to "watch" for the return of
                     Christ, when it is clear from the prophecies that certain events
                     must first take place?

The Final Times     LESSON 1                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                September 28

         Part 4   For what length of time did Daniel prophesy that the little
      PROPHETIC horn (the Christian apostasy) would exercise supremacy over
          TIME God's faithful followers?

                     "And he shall speak great words against the most High, and
                   shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change
                   times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a
                   time and times and the dividing of time" (Dan. 7:25).

                      The apostle Paul warned the Thessalonians not to expect the
                   advent of Christ until after the development of "the man of sin"
                   within the church. "He [Paul] proceeded to emphasize the fact
                   that the papal power, so clearly described by the prophet
                   Daniel, was yet to rise and wage war against God's people. Until
                   this power should have performed its deadly and blasphemous
                   work, it would be in vain for the church to look for the coming of
                   their Lord."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 266.
                      An analysis of Daniel 7 provides the following data for iden-
                   tifying the little horn. (1) Location (verse 8): It would arise
                   among the nations of Western Europe. (2) Time of rise (verse
                   24): It would arise after the establishment of the nations of
                   Western Europe, that is, sometime subsequent to AD 476, the
                   date assigned for the disintegration of the Roman Empire in the
                   West. (3) Nature of the horn (verses 8, 20, 24): The horn is noted
                   as being, in some way different from the others. Comparison
                   with the beast of Revelation 13 shows that it is a religiopolitical
                   power. (4) Actions of the horn (verses 20, 21, 24, 25): This horn
                   subdues three of the other horns, speaks great words against
                   God, makes war upon His saints, and presumes to change His
                   times and laws. (5) A time period (verse 25). The horn would
                   exercise supremacy over God's people for "a time and times
                    and the dividing of times." This symbolic period of Daniel 7:25 is
                   1260 prophetic days (Rev. 12:6, 14), and thus 1260 years. (Com-
                    pare Eze. 4:6.)
                      These identifying marks point unerringly to only one power: a
                    religiopolitical system which arose on the ruins of the Western
                    Empire. Its leader legally recognized by law (Code of Justinian)
                    as the head of Christendom, the papacy sought and often suc-
                    ceeded to rule over Europe with great power during the Middle
                    Ages. Its special period of supremacy may be dated from AD 538
                    when freed from the last restricting Arian horn power (the Os-
                    trogoths) until 1798 when the French government invaded
                    Rome and declared the political rule of the papacy to be at an
                    end. All that was predicted was fulfilled by the papacy during
                    this extensive period.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why do you suppose God gave the church this detailed
                   information about the coming Christian apostasy?

              Part 5    According to Daniel, the close of what era of persecution
            TIME OF would mark the beginning of "the time of the end"?
            THE END
                        "They that understand among the people shall instruct
                     many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captiv-
                     ity, and by spoil, many days.... And some of them of under-
                     standing shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them
                     white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time
                     appointed" (Dan. 11:33-35).


                          Note that "the time of the end" is not the end of time. Rather,
                      it is an appointed period of time extending from the close of the
                      era of papal supremacy (1798) until the end of human probation.
                      Since 1798 momentous events have been taking place in both
                      heaven and earth as the plan of salvation has moved into its final
                      phases. "Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet
                      him" (Matt. 25:6).

                         How should we be affected by the fact that we live in the
                      "time of the end"? 1 Thess. 5:1-10.

                        "We have reached the period foretold in these scriptures
                     [Dan. 12:4, 10; Luke 21:31, 34, 36]. The time of the end is come,
                     the visions of the prophets are unsealed, and their solemn
                     warnings point us to our Lord's coming in glory as near at hand.
                        "The Jews misinterpreted and misapplied the word of God,
                     and they knew not the time of their visitation. The years of the
                     ministry of Christ and His apostles,—the precious last years of
                     grace to the chosen people,—they spent in plotting the destruc-
                     tion of the Lord's messengers. Earthly ambitions absorbed
                     them, and the offer of the spiritual kingdom came to them in
                     vain. So today the kingdom of this world absorbs men's
                     thoughts, and they take no note of the rapidly fulfilling
                     prophecies and the tokens of the swift-coming kingdom of
                     God." —The Desire of Ages, p. 235.

                     well as sober me?

                       "The attention of the people should be called to the moment-
                     ous event which is so near at hand. The signs of the times
                     should be kept fresh before their minds. The prophetic visions
                     of Daniel and John foretell a period of moral darkness and
                     declension; but at the time of the end, the time in which we are
                     now living, the vision was to speak and not lie. When the signs
                     predicted begin to come to pass, the waiting, watching ones are
                     bidden to look up and lift up their heads and rejoice because
                     their redemption draweth nigh."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 9, 10.

         Part 6   What prophetic book was promised to be unsealed in the
   PROPHECY AND period known as "the time of the end"?
       TIME OF
       THE END    "But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,
                even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
                knowledge shall be increased."
                  "And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed
                up and sealed till the time of the end" (Dan. 12:4, 9).

                      "Soon the eyes of many on both sides of the Atlantic were
                   fixed upon the next great designated event in the divine plan of
                   the centuries—the master 2300-year period was soon to end. In
                   fact, some 84 men in thirteen countries spread over four
                   continents—of which William Miller was but one—thought that
                   this fateful epoch would terminate about 1843, '44 or '47. . . .
                      "All felt that in some way it had to do with the prophesied 'end
                   events,' judgment scenes, the close of the gospel age, the Sec-
                   ond Advent, the end of the present world order. This was the
                   basic belief, first of the general Old World Advent Awakening,
                   and then of the distinctive New World Advent Movement of the
                   early decades of the nineteenth century. It was an unpre-
                   cedented concept and development in human thinking. It was

                   in the time of the end? Rev. 10:1-11.

                     "The book that was sealed was not the book of Revelation,
                   but that portion of the prophecy of Daniel which related to the
                   last days. . . . The book of Daniel is now unsealed, and the
                   revelation made by Christ to John is to come to all the inhabi-

          JUDGMENT
                       "I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
                     days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of
                     his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame,
                     and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and
                     came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered
                     unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
                     him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened" (Dan.
                     7:9, 10).

                        The prophecy of Daniel 7 depicts the struggle for world
                      dominion and control—first by a series of political powers, and
                      then by a religiopolitical system. The climax is reached when
                      God intervenes, and in heaven's court of judgment the domin-
                      ion of this earth is awarded to Christ, the Son of man, and to His
                      people (verses 13, 14, 27).

                        After the careers of what five powers does this heavenly
                      judgment take place? Dan. 7:1-8.

                         Among Bible expositors there is general agreement that the
                       four beasts of chapter 7 represent \the same world powers de-
                       picted by the metal image of chapter 2: Babylon, Medo-Persia,
                       Grecia, and Rome. Chapter 7, however, introduces two new
                      features: (1) The little horn with the eyes and mouth of a man,
                      and (2) a pre-advent judgment in the court of heaven.

                        Recall Lesson 1, part 4. Since the pre-advent judgment is
                      shown by the prophecy to come after the 1260-year reign of
                      the little horn, it would take place after what date?

                        At some point of time subsequent to 1798 (after the period of
                      papal dominion in Europe), the heavenly court would convene.
                      Investigation would be made. The power of the little horn power
                      would be taken away (verse 26); Christ and the saints would take
                      the rulership of the kingdom (verses 13, 14, 27). Thus chapter 7
                      foretold that a great and solemn judgment will take place in
                      heaven during the "time of the end."

THINK IT THROUGH       Wickedness in all its unfairness appears to run rampant.
                      What does the pre-advent judgment tell us about God?

                        "There are limits even to the forbearance of God. The bound-
                      ary of His long-suffering may be reached, and then He will surely
                      punish. And when He does take up the case of the presumptu-
                      ous sinner, He will not cease till He has made a full end."—Ellen

The Removal of a Seal        LESSON 2                             ❑    Monday
                                                                      October 3
          Part 2   What prophecy was to have particular significance in the
         ANGEL time of the end according to Gabriel?
   EXPLANATIONS
                   "Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. . . . He
                 said unto me, Understand, 0 son of man: for at the time of the
                 end shall be the vision" (Dan. 8:16, 17).

                     Two years after the vision of chapter 7 Daniel received
                   another as recorded in chapter 8. Although the latter vision
                   covers the same time period as in chapters 2 and 7, it especially
                   elaborates on the two new features of chapter 7: the little horn
                   and the pre-advent judgment. In the time of the end the meaning
                   of this judgment would be clarified.

                     What explanation did Gabriel give of the symbols of the ram,
                   goat, its large horn, and the four horns which came from the
                   stump of the former after Its breaking? Dan. 8:3-8, 20-22.

                     The fourth beast and its little horn (Daniel 7) are symbolized
                   in this vision (chapter 8) by a single horn. Describe its charac-
                   teristics. Dan. 8:9-12, 23-25.

                     Pagan and papal Rome have had so much in common that it is
                   reasonable to see the papacy as the "continuation" of the
                   pagan Roman Empire. In Daniel 8 this fact is represented by one
                   horn symbolizing the careers of both pagan and papal Rome,
                   though some aspects of the prophecy may apply more fully to
                   one or the other.
                     Pagan Rome attacked the people of God, crucified the Mes-
                   siah (Prince of princes), and eventually destroyed the earthly
                   temple. Papal Rome has likewise persecuted the people of God
                   (Dan. 7:21), and has drawn attention away from Christ by impos-
                   ing a human priesthood upon the church. It has done this
                   through the confessional and the sacrifice of the mass. Thus
                   Rome has for centuries diverted the attention of the sinner from
                   the significance of Christ's atoning death and His mediatorial
                   ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 7:25; 8:1, 2). In chang-
                   ing the divine law, in corrupting the prophetic voice of the
                   Scriptures, and in exalting the traditions of men above the Word
                   of God, Papal Rome has cast "truth" down to the ground. Pagan
                   Rome was destroyed by force of arms; spiritual Rome, however,
                   will be broken, not by human hands (Dan. 8:25), but by the
                   divine investigation and action in the heavenly judgment (Dan.
                   7:26), and by the glory of the second advent of Christ (2 Thess.
                   2:3-8).

THINK IT THROUGH     Although the Bible speaks against the system of the pa-
                   pacy, how should we regard individuals within the system?

                          "Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said
                       unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the
                       vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of
                       desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be
                       trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand
                       and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be
                       cleansed" (Dan. 8:13, 14).

                         Who had trampled upon the people of God and the
                       sanctuary? Dan. 8:9-12.

                          Daniel's concern naturally centered on the ruined temple in
                       Jerusalem. He became sick, overwhelmed with the foreboding
                       that the vision indicated a long delay in its restoration and the
                       end of the captivity.
                          But what sanctuary did the holy watcher have in mind? Daniel
                       lived to see Cyrus order the rebuilding of the temple in
                       Jerusalem, but that temple lost its significance at Calvary and
                       was obliterated in AD 70. Was Heaven's concern for an earthly
                       temple-sanctuary the ministry of which was done in types and
                       symbols? Or was God beginning to point His people to the
                       heavenly sanctuary where the Messiah would minister to indi-
                       viduals the benefits of His atonement, and where He would
                       finally resolve the issues in the great controversy? The fact that
                       the "little horn" of chapter 8 also represents the papal phase of
                       Rome (which functions in the Christian era) points us to the
                       heavenly sanctuary of the Christian dispensation.

                         At the close of what period of time did the holy one state the
                       sanctuary would be cleansed? Dan. 8:14.

                         In chapter 7 a court of judgment convening in heaven brought
                       the dominion of the papal horn to an end. Christ and His people
                       were awarded the kingdom. In chapter 8 the career of the little
                       horn in its papal phase of trampling upon God's people and the
                       priestly ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary are brought
                       to an end by the cleansing of that sanctuary. Since both visions
                       cover the same area, it is logical to conclude that the cleansing
                       of the sanctuary (or, the restoration "to its rightful state," RSV)
                       and the pre-advent judgment in heaven are the same event: the
                       last phase of Christ's priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
                       This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the earthly temple
                       with its symbolic service was not restored after AD 70.

The Removal of a Seal        LESSON 2                         ❑     Wednesday
                                                                     October 5
       Part 4     At a certain point in the 490 years allotted to the Jews after
  FORECASTS OF the reestablishment of Judah, what place was to be anointed?
    MESSIANIC
    MEDIATION     "Severity weeks of years are decreed concerning your
               people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an
               end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting
               righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a
               most holy place" (Dan. 9:24, RSV).

                     Although a period of twelve years elapsed between the vis-
                  ions of chapters 8 and 9 (550-538 BC), the two visions really
                  formed one unit. In Daniel 8 Gabriel did not explain the time
                  period of 2300 days and the cleansing of the sanctuary because
                  Daniel sickened and fainted. At his return Gabriel began by
                  explaining that a portion of the 2300 day-year period, namely
                  490 years, was to be allocated to the Jews during which time the
                  Messiah would come.
                     "To put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in
                  everlasting righteousness" are phrases that foretold the re-
                  demptive acts to be accomplished by the Messiah. His sinless
                  life and the supreme sacrifice on Calvary made possible the
                  final destruction of sin, instituted atonement for penitent sin-
                  ners, and provided righteousness through His merits.
                     "To anoint a most holy place" refers to the inauguration of
                  services in the heavenly sanctuary with Christ as its High Priest
                  when He was enthroned at the right hand of God at the time of
                  His ascension.(Compare Acts 2:33; 5:31; Rom. 8:34.) This is the
                  subject of the book of Hebrews. (See Heb. 8:1, 2.) The divine
                  spotlight thus shifts within the continuous vision of chapters 8
                  and 9 from an earthly typical sanctuary to the heavenly antitype.
                  The 70-week vision thereby pointed the nation to the redemp-
                  tive acts of Christon earth, and to the beginning of His ministra-
                  tion in heaven as man's High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary,

                    Whereas Gabriel pointed to the opening of the heavenly
                  sanctuary, what did David and Isaiah foretell about the Mes-
                  siah's priestly ministry? Ps. 110:1, 4. (Compare Matt.
                  22:42-45.)

                     Christ began His priestly mediation after His ascension into
                   heaven. What event does the prophecy indicate would begin
                   the 2300 days that would reach to Christ's final phase of
                   judgment- ministry" Dan. 8:14; 9:25.

         JUDGMENT-I
                          "And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three
                        hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed" (Dan.
                        8:14).
                          "Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state"
                        (RSV); "shall emerge victorious" (NEB).

                           We have seen from our previous study that the end-time
                        prophecies of Daniel, chapters seven through nine, point our
                        attention to the heavenly sanctuary, the very center and throne
                        of the divine government. The final ministry of Christ as Priest
                        will result in vindicating both God and His people. The authority
                        of God will be restored to its rightful place. Heaven will emerge
                        victorious in the contest between good and evil.

                          Daniel 8 depicts the "little horn" in its papal phase as attack-
                        ing and defiling the heavenly sanctuary (verses 11-13). What
                        action does the heavenly sanctuary court take against this
                        power? Dan. 7:11, 26.

                          What is the significance of this sentence by the heavenly
                        sanctuary court?

                           The original controversy arose in the universe when Satan
                         challenged God's authority. Satan questioned the necessity of
                        the divine law which he desired to abolish. He questioned the
                        divine character and motives in requiring the intelligent crea-
                        tion to keep His law. He asserted his "right" to be independent
                         of God. He argued that God could not be both just and merciful,
                        and he disputed the authority of Christ. All these issues and
                        challenges Satan has continued to pursue and emphasize here
                        on earth through paganism, and especially through apostate
                        Christianity. The law of God has been both changed and tram-
                        pled under foot. The character of God has been maligned,
                        caricatured, and misunderstood. The life, teachings, and
                        mediatorial work of Christ have been misinterpreted and His
                        place usurped.
                           Since Satan isthe instigator behind all human operations that
                        are opposed to God, the judgment rendered by the heavenly
                        sanctuary court against the "little horn," is really the rendering
                        of a verdict of guilt against Satan himself, and the clearing of the
                        Godhead (with the assent of the loyal universe) from all the
                        charges originally made by Satan. Thus the supreme objective
                        is the vindication of God.

The Removal of a Seal          LESSON 2                                ❑ Friday
                                                                       October 7
          Part 6   What promise related to final judgment is made to those
   ISSUES IN THE who fear God?
     JUDGMENT-II
                   "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
                 raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life,
                 but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his
                 angels" (Rev. 3:5).

                     The prophecies of Daniel 7 and 8 indicate that one aspect of
                   cleansing the sanctuary and restoring it to its rightful state
                   involves the condemning of the "little horn" and Satan and the
                   vindication of God. Also involved are those whose names have
                   been enrolled in the book of life. The books of Leviticus and
                   Hebrews show that one phase of the final ministry of Christ is
                   the blotting out of the records of the sins of all who have
                   accepted Jesus Christ.

                     What do the parables of the wheat and tares and of the net
                   suggest as one reason for the pre-advent judgment of all who
                   are recorded in the book of life? Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43, 47-50.

                     It must be kept in mind that all phases of final judgment
                   (pre-advent investigative phase, review phase during the mil-
                   lennium, executive phase at the close of the millennium) are not
                   for the sake of God who is omniscient. These are for the intelli-
                   gent universe—the unfallen beings, the redeemed, and finally
                   the impenitent—that all may fully understand the issues in the
                   great controversy and be fully satisfied with the rightness of
                   God and the wrongness of Satan and sin.

                      According to the parable of the wedding garment, what
                    question would be raised if sinners were taken into heaven?
                    See Matt. 22:2, 10-13.

                       The fact that books of record (Dan. 7:10; Rev. 20:12) are used
                    in the phases of judgment indicate that although sin may be
                    confessed and forgiven, the records are retained. The records
                    thus reveal the penitent's sins, but they also reveal that he has
                    laid hold of the merits of Christ and is trusting in Him. Records
                    can vindicate as well as condemn. Those found clothed in
                    Christ's righteousness will have their names retained in the
                    book of life, and the record of their sins will be blotted out. By
                    the judgment both God and His people will be vindicated and
                    freed from the accusations of Satan.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why do you think God has extended the final judgment
                    through three phases? What does it tell us about God?

              Part 1   For what purposes did the Creator make the sun, moon, and
       DIVINE DESIGN stars?

                        "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
                      heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
                      signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years" (Gen. 1:14).

                       It was the Creator's design to use the celestial orbs at times in
                     such a manner as to arrest attention and to focus it upon His
                     presence and mighty acts in the affairs of mankind.

                       What is the first recorded instance of God's use of the sun to
                     show His power over creation? Joshua 10:12-14.

                       "This mighty miracle testifies that the creation is under the
                     control of the Creator. Satan seeks to conceal from men the
                     divine agency in the physical world—to keep out of sight the
                     unwearied working of the first great cause. In this miracle all
                     who exalt nature above the God of nature stand rebuked."—

           Part 2 In response to Jesus' prediction that the temple would be
  DIVINE FORECAST destroyed, what question did the disciples later ask?

                     "As he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
                   unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things
                   be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of
                   the world?" (Matt. 24:3).

                     "Jesus did not answer His disciples by taking up separately
                   the destruction of Jerusalem and the great day of His coming.
                   He mingled the description of these two ... crises, leaving the
                   disciples to study out the meaning for themselves. When He
                   referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, His prophetic words
                   reached beyond that event to the final conflagration. . . . This
                   entire discourse was given, not for the disciples only, but for
                   those who should live in the last scenes of this earth's
                   history."—The Desire of Ages, p. 628.

                     List the events Jesus said would precede the fall of
                   Jerusalem. Matt. 24:4-14.

                     The activities of false messiahs and prophets, wars and strife,
                   natural calamities, persecution, waning spiritual fervor, and at
                   the same time the widespread advances of the gospel message
                   occurred before the fall of the Jewish nation. Similar events will
                   be repeated before the second advent of our Lord.

                     What was to be the immediate signal that the city was about
                   to be destroyed and the nation scattered? Luke 21:20-23.

                     What had Jesus foretold a few days earlier in tears about
                   the city and the nation? Luke 19:41-44.

                     "Jesus, looking down to the last generation, saw the world
                   involved in a deception similar to that which caused the de-
                   struction of Jerusalem. The great sin of the Jews was their
                   rejection of Christ; the great sin of the Christian world would be
                   their rejection of the law of God, the foundation of His govern-

           Part 3     After foretelling the fall of the nation of Israel, the Saviour
     DARK VALLEY    next referred to what long period of suffering?

                      "Then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the
                    beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And
                    except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
                    be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be short-
                    ened" (Matt. 24:21, 22).

                       Because of its proximity to His remarks on the fall of
                    Jerusalem, some commentators hold that the "great tribula-
                    tion" refers to the distress the Jews suffered by the Roman
                    conquest in AD 70. However, terrible as that siege was, it would
                    not be correct to say that its tribulation was greater than any
                    before it or after it. Nor did the war involve "the elect," that is,
                    Christians, since they obeyed Christ's warning and saved their
                    lives by fleeing. Rather, the prophetic glance of the Saviour
                    rested briefly on that persecution which His people were to
                    endure as Daniel had foretold.
                       "For more than a thousand years such persecution as the
                    world had never before known was to come upon Christ's fol-
                    lowers. Millions upon millions of His faithful witnesses were to
                    be slain. Had not God's hand been stretched out to preserve His
                    people, all would have perished."—The Desire of Ages, p. 631.

                      What development among Christians prepared the way for
                    this era of persecution? Acts 20:29, 30; 1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Thess. 2:
                    1-4.

                      "This compromise between paganism and Christianity re-
                    sulted in the development of 'the man of sin' foretold in
                    prophecy as opposing and exalting himself above God. That
                    gigantic system of false religion is a masterpiece of Satan's
                    power."—The Great Controversy, p. 50.

                      How long was the dark night of control by the Christian
                    apostasy to last? Dan. 7:25. (Compare Rev. 12:6, 14; 13:5.)

                      "Popery had become the world's despot. Kings and emperors
                    bowed to the decrees of the Roman pontiff. The destinies of
                    men, both for time and for eternity, seemed under his control."
                    —The Great Controversy, p. 60.

                    in Revelation 13?

                                                                        October 12
          Part 4   What wonders in the heavens did the prophet Joel predict
     HERALDS OF would occur before the ultimate day of the Lord comes?
    THE DAWN—I
                   "I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood,
                 and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into
                 darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the
                 terrible day of the Lord come" (Joel 2:30, 31).

                     In its larger context (verses 28-32) Peter saw a fulfillment of
                   this ancient prophecy on the day of Pentecost. (See Acts 2:16-
                   21.) But Pentecost must be regarded as only a partial fulfillment,
                   for the "great and notable day of the Lord" is yet future.

                     In relationship to what period of time did Christ more pre-
                   cisely locate the occurrence of these signs? Matt. 24:29, 30.
                   (Compare Mark 13:24, 25.)

                      "The 1260 days, or years, terminated in 1798. A quarter of a
                   century earlier, persecution had almost wholly ceased. Follow-
                   ing this persecution, according to the words of Christ, the sun
                   was to be darkened. On the 19th day of May, 1780, this prophecy
                   was fulfilled."—The Great Controversy, p. 306.
                      "May 19, 1780, stands in history as 'The Dark Day.' Since the
                   time of Moses no period of darkness of equal density, extent,
                   and duration, has ever been recorded."—The Great Con-
                   troversy, p. 308
                      "It has long been pointed out that it is the fact, and not the
                   cause, of the darkness that is significant ... as also in the case of
                   earthquakes, falling stars, and other events seen as signs of the
                   times. When the Lord would open a path for his people through
                   the sea, he did it by 'a strong east wind.' Ex. 14:21. Was it for this
                   reason any less miraculous? In like manner, to account for the
                   remarkable darkening of the sun and moon or of the falling stars
                   as events in nature is not to discredit them as merciful signs of
                    the approaching end of probationary time."—SDA Source

THINK IT THROUGH     A small cloud was sufficient evidence to Elijah that God
                   would send rain, and he acted accordingly (1 Kings 18:42-46).
                   How does the dark day event affect me? In order to motivate
                   me to a better life, how much evidence must I have to inspire
                   faith in the imminence of Christ's second advent.

                     "He [Elijah] did not wait for the full evidence that God had
                   heard him, but was willing to venture all on the slightest token of
                   divine favor. And yet what he was enabled to do under God, all
                   may do in their sphere of activity in God's service."—Prophets

                                                                           October 13

              Part 5     How did John describe the falling of the stars as foretold by
     HERALDS OF THE    both Joel and Jesus?
          DAWN—II
                         "The stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree
                       casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
                       wind" (Rev. 6:13).
                          On November 13, 1833, there occurred what is still recorded
                       as the most magnificent meteor shower ever witnessed. This
                       great display of celestial fireworks was witnessed from Canada
                       to Mexico, and from mid-Atlantic to the Pacific. Darting away
                       from a single point in the sky—in the constellation of Leo—the
                       meteors were thrown like the unripe figs of the prophetic de-
                       scription.

                         What significance does this particular sign have? Mark
                       13:24-26.
                          "Christ had pointed out some of the most important events in
                       the history of the world and of the church from His first to His
                       second advent; namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, the great
                       tribulation of the church under pagan and papal persecutions,
                       the darkening of the sun and moon, and the falling of the stars.
                       After this He spoke of His coming in His kingdom."—The Great
                       Controversy, p. 393.
                          "In 1833, . . . the last of the signs appeared which were
                       promised by the Saviour as tokens of His second advent. Said
                       Jesus: 'The stars shall fall from heaven.' Matthew 24:29. .
                          "Thus was displayed the last of those signs of His coming
                       concerning which Jesus bade His disciples: 'When ye shall see
                       all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.' Matthew
                       24:33."—The Great Controversy, pp. 333, 334.

                         Nearly a century and a half has passed since the 1833
                       falling of the stars. What Is the tendency of the human heart
                       when delay in a cherished hope seems apparent? Eze. 12:22, 23.
                         The inhabitants of Judah mocked the reliability of the pro-
                       phetic predictions made regarding that nation in the sixth cen-
                       tury BC. Their attitude reflects the common tendency of the
                       human mind in its impatience.

THINK IT THROUGH         How can I keep my hope bright In spite of delay In seeing the
                       fulfillment of the promised return?
                         "The long night of gloom is trying; but the morning is de-
                       ferred in mercy, because if the Master should come, so many
                       would be found unready. God's unwillingness to have His
                       people perish has been the reason for so long delay."—

          Part 6  As He concluded His portrayal of signs that would precede
      A DELAYED both the fall of Jerusalem and His advent, what did Jesus wish
       MORNING His followers to know?

                      "Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
                    tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
                    so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that It
                    is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, This genera-
                    tion shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled" (Matt.
                    24:32-34).

                       In His prophecy Christ intermingled two events: (1) the fall of
                    Jerusalem, and (2) His second coming and the end of the world.
                    The designation "this generation" was Christ's description of
                    His contemporaries (compare Matt. 11:16; 17:17). With refer-
                    ence to the destruction of Jerusalem, the phrase would denote
                    the Jews then living—they would see that terrible tragedy. It
                    occurred only 39 years later in AD 70.
                       The phrase "this generation" has had several interpretations.
                    One is that it refers to those persons who have seen the comple-
                    tion of all the signs mentioned, including those on the earth.
                    Another possible explanation is that in the providence of God,
                    probationary time could have been concluded at some point
                    after 1844 (the last prophetic date and the investigative phase of
                    judgment in heaven), but within the lifetime of the generation
                    witnessing the last of the celestial signs.

                     What hints of probable delay In the advent are given by
                    Christ In His prophecy? Matt. 24:48; 25:1, 5.

                      "It is true that time has continued longer than we expected in
                    the early days of this message. Our Saviour did not appear as
                    soon as we hoped. But has the word of the Lord failed? Never! It
                    should be remembered that the promises and threatenings of
                    God are alike conditional."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 67.

                      What is Peter's explanation to last-day scoffers for a de-
                    layed advent? 2 Peter 3:3, 4, 8-10.

                      "It [the coming of the Lord] will not tarry past the time that the
                    message is borne to all nations, tongues, and peoples. Shall we
                      . forget that God's forbearance to the wicked is a part of the
                    vast and merciful plan by which He is seeking to compass the
                    salvation of souls?"—Evangelism, p. 697.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Did the 40 years of wandering nullify God's promise to settle
                     Israel in Canaan? Why does the delay in the advent not nullify
                     the certainty of Christ's return and kingdom?

The End-time Church          LESSON 4                                ❑    Sunday
                                                                       October 16
           Part 1  As Jesus concluded His predictions regarding His return,
        A CALL TO what appeal did He make to the disciples which is especially
        VIGILANCE applicable to the church in "the time of the end"?

                     "Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
                   come."
                     "Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think
                   not the Son of man cometh" (Matt. 24:42, 44).

                     The Greek word translated "watch" literally means "be
                   awake" or "keep awake." Figuratively, it means to "be on the
                   alert," or "be vigilant." The apostle Paul commands, "Let us not
                   sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober" (1 Thess.
                   5:6). By this he means, Be not spiritually sleepy, lazy, or indif-
                   ferent, but rather be on the alert with regard to your personal
                   salvation and that of others.

                      What are some of the conditions which may cause a Chris-
                   tian to become sleepy and indifferent to his spiritual needs in
                   the end-time? Luke 21:34-36; Matt. 24:48-51.

                     "The evil servant says in his heart, 'My lord delayeth his
                   coming.' He does not say that Christ will not come. He does not
                   scoff at the idea of His second coming. But in his heart and by
                   his actions and words he declares that the Lord's coming is
                   delayed. He banishes from the minds of others the conviction
                   that the Lord is coming quickly. His influence leads men to
                   presumptuous, careless delay. They are confirmed in their
                   worldliness and stupor.... The evil servant eats and drinks with
                   the drunken, unites with the world in pleasure seeking. He
                   smites his fellow servants, accusing and condemning those
                   who are faithful to their Master. He mingles with the world. Like
                   grows with like in transgression. It is a fearful assimilation. With
                   the world he is taken in the snare."—The Desire of Ages, p.635.

                     What garment may the Christian lose in this critical period if
                   he fails to watch? Rev. 16:15. (Compare Matt. 22:11.)
                     How may the Christian best keep himself spiritually awake
                   at all times? Eph. 6:14; 1 Peter 1:13; Matt. 26:41.

         Part 2   "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
   PREPAREDNESS virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the
  ILLUSTRATED—I bridegroom" (Matt. 25:1).

                      Read the full parable in verses 1 through 13.
                      "Chapter 25 opens with the words: 'Then shall the kingdom of
                   heaven be likened unto ten virgins.' Here is brought to view the
                   church living in the last days, the same that is pointed out in the
                   close of chapter 24. In this parable their experience is illustrated
                   by the incidents of an Eastern marriage." —The Great Con-
                   troversy, p. 393.

                     List the aspects in which these ten young women are simi-
                   lar. What is represented by the lamps and oil? Ps. 119: 105.
                   (Compare Isa. 60:1.)

                     What failure in preparation does Jesus note in the foolish
                   virgins long before the crisis exposed their true condition?
                   Matt. 25:3.

                      "The class represented by the foolish virgins are not hypo-
                   crites. They have a regard for the truth, they have advocated the
                   truth, they are attracted to those who believe the truth; but they
                   have not yielded themselves to the Holy Spirit's working. They
                   have not fallen upon the Rock, Christ Jesus, and permitted their
                   old nature to be broken up. This class are represented also by
                   the stony-ground hearers. They receive the word with readi-
                   ness, but they fail of assimilating its principles.. . . The foolish
                   virgins have been content with a superficial work." —Christ's
                   Object Lessons, p. 411.

                     Why are the foolish virgins unable at the final crisis to obtain
                   oil from their wiser companions? Matt. 25:8, 9. (Compare Eze.
                   14:20.)

                       "In spiritual things no man can make up another's deficiency.
                   The grace of God has been freely offered to every soul.... But
                   character is not transferable. No man can believe for another.
                   ... No man can impart to another the character which is the fruit
                   of the Spirit's working."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 411, 412.

THINK IT THROUGH    How do I regard my personal religious faith? Is it a belief to
                   which I merely give assent, or is it a way of life which affects
                   my thoughts and actions even in a crisis?

              Part 3   What did the foresight and preparedness of the wise virgins
       PREPAREDNESS enable them to do when the bridegroom finally came?
     ILLUSTRATED—II
                       "The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps."
                       "And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bride-
                     groom cometh; go ye out to meet him."
                       "And they that were ready went in with him to the marriage:
                     and the door was shut" (Matt. 25:4, 6, 10).

                        The darkness in the parable represents the moral darkness
                      that envelops mankind. At what point in this moral gloom
                      does the parable suggest Jesus will return? Verse 6.

                        "It is the darkness of misapprehension of God that is en-
                      shrouding the world. Men are losing their knowledge of His
                      character."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 415.
                        "The coming of the bridegroom was at midnight—Ahe darkest
                      hour. So the coming of Christ will take place in the darkest
                      period of this earth's history."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 414.

                        Through the deepening moral darkness until the Bride-
                      groom arrives, the lamps of the wise continue to burn. What
                      does their burning symbolize? See Matt. 5:14-16; Phil. 2:15.

                         "Their light burned with undimmed flame through the night
                      of watching. It helped to swell the illumination for the bride-
                      groom's honor. Shining out in the darkness, it helped to illumi-
                      nate the way to the home of the bridegroom, to the marriage
                      feast. . . .
                        "Those who wait for the Bridegroom's coming are to say to
                      the people, 'Behold your God.' The last rays of merciful light, the
                      last message of mercy to be given to the world, is a revelation of
                      His character of love. The children of God are to manifest His
                      glory. In their own life and character they are to reveal what the
                      grace of God has done for them." —Christ's Object Lessons, pp.
                      414-416.

THINK IT THROUGH        If the lamp of my Christian experience is flickering, growing
                      dim because of a worldly life-style, who will guide lost souls of
                      my acquaintance to the kingdom?

                       "It is the love of God continually transferred to man that
                     enables him to impart light. Into the hearts of all who are united
                     to God by faith the golden oil of love flows freely, to shine out

The End-time Church         LESSON 4                             ❑     Wednesday
                                                                       October 19
           Part 4   What parable did Jesus tell to indicate how His church was
     A CALL FOR to "watch" in the time of the end?
  EVERY-MEMBER
   PARTICIPATION    "The kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
                  country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto
                  them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another
                  two, and to another one; to every man according to his several
                  ability; and straightway took his journey" (Matt. 25:14, 15).

                     The "talents" in the parable are monies which have been
                   entrusted to the servants, but they represent the gifts of the
                   Spirit.
                      "Then He showed what it means to watch for His coming. The
                   time is to be spent, not in idle waiting, but in diligent working.
                   This lesson He taught in the parable of the talents. . . .
                      "Christ's followers have been redeemed for service. Our Lord
                   teaches that the true object of life is ministry. . . . By living to
                   minister for others, man is brought into connection with Christ.
                   The law of service becomes the connecting link which binds us
                   to God and to our fellow men."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp.
                   325, 326.

                    In a similar parable, what instruction is given the church
                   while it awaits Christ's return? Luke 19:12, 13.

                     What divine obligation rests upon us as Christians whether
                   our abilities be many or few? 1 Peter 4:10.

                      "The Lord will not require from those who are poor that which
                   they have not to give; He will not require from the sick the active
                   energies which bodily weakness forbids. No one need mourn
                   because he cannot glorify God with talents that were never
                   entrusted to him. But if you have only one talent, use it well, and
                   it will accumulate. If the talents are not buried, they will gain yet
                   other talents."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                   mentary, vol. 5, p. 1100.

                     How does Paul illustrate God's design for cooperative, un-
                   selfish effort on the part of each Christian according to his
                   ability? 1 Cor. 12:12-18, 26, 27.

THINK IT THROUGH     As I analyze my gifts, is there any way in which I could more
                   effectively work for God in this end time?

                     "Let a living faith run like threads of gold through the per-
                   formance of even the smallest duties. . . . This is true
                   sanctification."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 360.

                                                                         October 20
              Part 5   "Unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; ... I
           A CALL TO know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou
         REPENTANCE wert cold or hot."
                       "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous there-
                     fore, and repent" (Rev. 3:14, 15, 19).

                        It must never be forgotten that while the church in the time of
                      the end is the object of Heaven's interest and concern, it is also
                      the object of Satan's wrath (Rev. 12:17). This wrath will be seen
                      not only in persecution, but also in more subtle ways. Satan will
                      influence the church to be self-satisfied and complacent.
                      Spiritual drowsiness will blind a complacent believer to his true
                      need. To give up the faith under pressure or to lose it in a
                      spiritual stupor—the result is the same, and Satan achieves his
                      objective.

                        What attitude of mind would permeate the church in the time
                      of the end according to Jesus? Rev. 3:16, 17.

                         "As a people we are triumphing in the clearness and strength
                      of the truth. We are fully sustained in our positions by an over-
                      whelming amount of plain Scriptural testimony. But we are very
                      much wanting in Bible humility, patience, faith, love, self-denial,
                      watchfulness, and the spirit of sacrifice. We need to cultivate
                      Bible holiness. Sin prevails among the people of God.... Many
                      cling to their doubts and their darling sins while they are in so
                      great a deception as to talk and feel that they are in need of
                      nothing."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 253.

                         What does the Heavenly Merchant offer to sell to the self-
                      righteous in Laodicea that will truly enrich them? Rev. 3:18.
                      What does He offer to do? Verse 20.

                        In reality, what do these items represent? Compare James
                      2:5 with Gal. 5:6. Compare Matt. 22:11 with Ise. 61:10.

THINK IT THROUGH        What response ought the church to make to Jesus' appeal
                      as it faces the ultimate day of the Lord? Joel 2:12, 13.

                        "Could the curtain be rolled back, could you discern the
                      purposes of God and the judgments that are about to fall upon a

                      and tremble for your own souls and for the souls of your fellow
                      men. Earnest prayers of heart-rending anguish would go up to
                      heaven. You would weep between the porch and the altar,
                      confessing your spiritual blindness and backsliding."—

                        "After these things I saw four angels standing on the four
                      corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that
                      the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on
                      any tree" (Rev. 7:1).

                       Revelation 7 is a parenthetical interlude between the sixth
                     and seventh seals. It provides the answer to the question, "Who
                     shall be able to stand?" (Rev. 6:17). The sixth seal covers the
                     events of a great earthquake, the darkening of the sun and
                     moon, the falling of the stars, and the destruction of the heavens
                     as the earth convulses. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore,
                     that the events described in chapter 7 occupy the era between
                     the last celestial sign (1833) and the second advent, "the time of
                     the end," and beyond.
                       Great wars were fought in Europe in the latter part of the
                     nineteenth century, Soon after the opening of the twentieth
                     came the devastating World War I. Peace ensued only to be
                     broken again by World War 11. From that time on wars have
                     mushroomed for a time and then subsided.
                       "The time during which the winds are held could not from the
                     nature of the case be a time of profound peace. This would not
                     answer to the prophecy, for in order to make it manifest that the
                     winds are being held, there must be disturbance, agitation,
                     anger, and jealousy among the nations, with occasional out-
                     bursts of strife, like fitful gusts breaking away from the impris-

       CONCERNS
      AND STRIFE    "And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having
                  the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
                  four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
                  saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we
                  have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads" (Rev.
                  7:2, 3).

                       "Everything in the world is in an unsettled state. The nations
                    are angry, and great preparations for war are being made. Na-
                    tion is plotting against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
                    The great day of God is hasting greatly. But although the na-
                    tions are mustering their forces for war and bloodshed, the
                    command to the angels is still in force, that they hold the four
                    winds until the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads."
                    —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
                    968.

                      What is the relationship between the work of the sealing
                    angel and the work of the three angels in Revelation 14?

                      The sealing angel and the three angels appear in the "time of
                    the end," particularly between 1844 and the second advent. The
                    work of each results finally in a people totally obedient to God.
                    In the case of the sealing angel they are designated the 144,000
                    (Rev. 7:4). In the case of the three angels, those obedient to God
                    are referred to as the saints who "keep the commandments of
                    God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12), and it is implied that
                    they are the 144,000 (Rev. 14:1-5). Since the angels of both
                    chapters operate at the same time with the same results, we may
                    conclude that they both represent the movement and message
                    of God's end-time church.

                       What is the seal of the living God? (Compare Ex. 20:8-11 and
                     2 Tim. 2:19.)

                       Seals were used in Bible times to show ownership and to give
                     authority to legal documents. The fourth precept functions as
                     God's seal, because it alone identifies the authority behind the
                     law—the Lord God, Creator of heaven and earth. The three
                     angels' messages call mankind back to the worship of the
                     Creator and the keeping of His Sabbath, the seal of His law. It
                     warns against a false worship. In the final crisis God's loyal ones
                     will be sealed as His children.

             Part 3    How did Jesus describe the condition of national govern-
     WORLD ANGUISH    ments prior to His coming?

                        "Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea
                      and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and
                      for looking after those things which are coming on the earth"
                      (Luke 21:25, 26).

                         The stormy, heaving sea may be understood as a figure of
                      speech describing the unsettled conditions of the nations in the
                      end time. In addition to this word picture, three terms are used
                      by Christ to describe last-day conditions among the nations:
                      "distress," "perplexity," and "hearts failing" ("fainting,"
                      NASB).
                         The Greek term rendered "distress" appears only here and in
                      Second Corinthians 2:4 where Paul speaks of his "anguish of
                      heart." The words "distress" and "perplexity" aptly depict the
                      world anguish of our times.
                         No governments in all human history have had to wrestle with
                      such gigantic problems as face mankind today. Problems of
                      finance and inflation are global. Uncertainties in the economies
                      of nations breed social unrest and revolution, and often a crip-
                      pling of national development and progress. National leaders
                      are confronted with enormous problems in environmental pol-
                      lution, population growth, vast droughts and resulting famines
                      and disease among their peoples, not to speak of having to
                      solve the difficulties created by energy shortages and pressures
                      for military preparedness. The problems are endless, and hu-
                      manly unsolvable. And yet national governments and leaders
                      agonize to find the solutions.

                       In Ezekiel's time the complexities of earth's political affairs
                      were symbolized by a series of moving, intersecting wheels.
                      Who controlled all these? Eze. 1:15-19, 26-28.

                         "The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living.
                      Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and
                      authority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their
                      attention fixed upon the events taking place about us. They are
                      watching the relations that exist among the nations. They ob-

                      element, and they recognize that something great and decisive
                      is about to take place—that the world is on the verge of a

                    work of preparation to stand in the day of God. . . .
                       " . Even now he is at work. In accidents and calamities by
                    sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in fierce tornadoes and
                    terrific hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves,
                    and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand forms, Satan
                    is exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest,
                    and famine and distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly
                    taint, and thousands perish by the pestilence. These visitations
                    are to become more and more frequent and disastrous." —The
                    Great Controversy, pp. 589, 590.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why do good people sometimes receive the blame for phys-
                    ical calamities? Compare Elijah (1 Kings 18:17, 18) and the
                    early Christians of the Roman Empire.

                      "The class that have provoked the displeasure of Heaven will
                    charge all their troubles upon those whose obedience to God's
                    commandments is a perpetual reproof to transgressors. It will
                    be declared that men are offending God by the violation of the
                    Sunday sabbath; that this sin has brought calamities." —The
                    Great Controversy, p. 590.

                                                                             October 27
              Part 5     What counsel is given to Christians with reference to their
     CHRISTIANS AND    relationship to civil governments?
      GOVERNMENTS
                          "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there
                       is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of
                       God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the
                       ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to them-
                       selves damnation."
                         "Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath,
                       but also for conscience sake" (Rom. 13:1, 2, 5).

                         In a sense, the Christian holds a dual citizenship. He is a
                       member of Christ's kingdom which is not of this world (John
                       18:36), at the same time he is a citizen of the nation in which he
                       resides. As distress among the nations increases because of
                       innumerable problems, modern Christians must seek to be
                       cooperative in every right measure and to avoid if possible all
                       misunderstandings.

                         What may the Christian's law-abiding conduct and prudent
                       speech silence? 1 Peter 2:13-15.

                          "It is not wise to find fault continually with what is done by the
                        rulers of government. It is not our work to attack individuals or
                        institutions... .
                              . . We should weed out from our writings and utterances
                       every expression that, taken by itself, could be so misrep-
                       resented as to make it appear antagonistic to law and order.
                       Everything should be carefully considered, lest we place our-
                       selves on record as encouraging disloyalty to our country and
                       its laws. We are not required to defy authorities. There will come
                       a time when, because of our advocacy of Bible truth, we shall be
                       treated as traitors; but let not this time be hastened by unad-
                       vised movements that stir up animosity and strife."— Tes-
                       timonies, vol. 6, p. 394.

                         For what class of men does the apostle Paul especially
                       request Christians to pray? For what reasons? 1 Tim. 2:1-4.
                         What will Christians eventually face? Rev. 13:15-17.

                          "Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as
                       enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints
                       of society, causing anarchy and corruption."—The Great Con-

Global Distress     LESSON 5                                          ❑ Friday
                                                                      October 28
         Part 6   As the world moves from crisis to crisis and global distress
     FLOODS AND becomes more acute, what alone will keep the Christian sta-
    FOUNDATIONS ble?

                     "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
                   them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
                   upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came,
                   and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not:
                   for it was founded upon a rock" (Matt. 7:24, 25).

                      "The word of God is the only steadfast thing our world knows.
                   It is the sure foundation. 'Heaven and earth shall pass away,'
                   said Jesus, 'but My words shall not pass away.' Matthew
                   24:35."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 148.
                      In the parallel passage (Luke 6:48) the builder "digged deep,
                   and laid the foundation on a rock." This is hearing and doing
                   Christ's word. The final issue in the controversy will be whether
                   or not a person will do what Jesus has said.

                     When at times governments become persecuting agencies
                   in the hands of Satan, what sustains God's people? Rom.
                   8:35-39.

                      "Though enemies may thrust them [God's people] into
                   prison, yet dungeon walls cannot cut off the communication
                   between their souls and Christ. One who sees their every weak-
                   ness, who is acquainted with every trial, is above all earthly
                   powers; and angels will come to them in lonely cells, bringing
                   light and peace from heaven. The prison will be as a palace; for
                   the rich in faith dwell there, and the gloomy walls will be lighted
                   up with heavenly light as when Paul and Silas prayed and sang
                   praises at midnight in the Philippian dungeon."—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 627.

                     What promise has God made to His people who may be
                   called upon to pass through trying situations? Isa. 43:2.

                     "The season of distress before God's people will call for a
                   faith that will not falter. His children must make it manifest that
                   He is the only object of their worship, and that no consideration,
                   not even that of life itself, can induce them to make the least
                   concession to false worship. To the loyal heart the commands
                   of sinful, finite men will sink into insignificance beside the word
                   of the eternal God. Truth will be obeyed though the result be
                   imprisonment or exile or death."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 512,
                   513.

                   velop a deeper faith and confidence in God?

            Part 1   Jesus cited attitudes of people in a former age as an illustra-
     THE GRASP FOR tion of end-time attitudes toward the second advent. What
      THE GOOD LIFE comparison did He make?

                        "As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of
                      the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives,
                      they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
                      into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all"
                      (Luke 17:26, 27).
                       In this particular instance Jesus does not stress the toil and
                     accomplishments of the antediluvians, or their strife and vio-
                     lence. Rather, He emphasizes their indulgence in the enjoyment
                     of themselves while neglecting to prepare for the Flood. Their
                     times are characterized by a people grasping for pleasure—
                     eating, drinking, and making love—an abandonment to the
                     enjoyment of the bodily appetites, a feverish search for sensual
                     experience. A similar obsession with the material and the sen-
                     sual will be prominent in the world before Jesus comes.
                        "God bestowed upon these antediluvians many and rich gifts;
                     but they used His bounties to glorify themselves, and turned
                     them into a curse by fixing their affections upon the gifts instead
                     of the Giver. They employed the gold and silver, the precious
                     stones and the choice wood, in the construction of habitations
                     for themselves, and endeavored to excel one another in
                     beautifying their dwellings with the most skillful workmanship.
                     They sought only to gratify the desires of their own proud
                     hearts, and reveled in scenes of pleasure and wickedness."—
                     Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 90, 91.

                       What conditions promoted sensualism and materialism in
                     the days of Lot and of Ezekiel? Eze. 16:49. Is this true today
                     also?
                       "God did not condemn the antediluvians for eating and drink-
                     ing.... Their sin consisted in taking these gifts without gratitude
                     to the Giver, and debasing themselves by indulging appetite
                     without restraint. It was lawful for them to marry. . . . But . . .
                     marriage was perverted and made to minister to passion."
                     —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 101.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is the world's emphasis on the enjoyment of self a
                     dangerous temptation to end-time Christians? See Luke
                     21:34-36.
                        "A similar condition of things exists now. That which is lawful
                     in itself is carried to excess. Appetite is indulged without re-
                     straint. . . . Intemperance benumbs the moral and spiritual
                     powers. . . . Men are living for the pleasures of sense."—

                                                 October 31
           Part 2   Although many will misuse their material goods in the last
   RIGHTEOUS USE days, what counsel does Jesus give to Christians?
       OF RICHES
                    "And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of
                  unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails they may receive
                  you into the eternal habitations" (Luke 16:9, RSV).

                      In the parable of the unjust steward (Luke 16:1-13) Jesus
                    taught that people should be in earnest about preparation for
                    the future world. Only by concern for the welfare of others could
                    they themselves be blessed.
                      "The means over and above the actual necessities of life are
                    entrusted to man to do good, to bless humanity."
                       "Give yourself to God for this work, use His gifts for this
                    purpose, and you enter into partnership with heavenly beings.
                    Your heart will throb in sympathy with theirs. You will be assimi-
                    lated to them in character. To you these dwellers in the eternal
                    tabernacles will not be strangers. When earthly things shall
                    have passed away, the watchers at heaven's gates will bid you
                    welcome."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 370, 373.

                       Although eating, marrying, and buying and selling of mate-
                    rial goods are not wrong in themselves, what perspective will
                    characterize the genuine end-time Christian? 1 Cor. 7:29-31.

                      These verses are not to be misunderstood as teaching that the
                    Christian is to neglect his wife and family or to be negligent in
                    secular matters. It is the Lord who entrusted him with these
                    blessings. The point is that life's cares, responsibilities, and
                    pleasures must always be subordinate to preparation for the
                    coming of Christ. We have only one short life in which to make
                    that preparation.

                      What lesson does Jesus intend to teach His followers in the
                    parable of the rich farmer? Luke 12:16-21.

                       "This man's aims were no higher than those of the beasts that
                    perish. He lived as if there were no God, no heaven, no future
                    life; as if everything he possessed were his own, and he owed
                    nothing to God or man."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 257, 258.

 THINK IT THROUGH    How may I use my material goods to bless my neighbors
                    more effectively and advance God's last-day movement?

                      It is the spirit of Christ to give, to sacrifice self for the good of

              Part 3     According to Eliphaz, how did the antediluvian people re-
          DEMISE OF    gard God?
              DEITY       "Will you keep to the old way
                            which wicked men have trod?
                          They were snatched away before their time;
                            their foundation was washed away.
                          They said to God, 'Depart from us,'
                            and 'What can the Almighty do to us?' "
                                                               Job 22:15-17, RSV.
                         The antediluvians ruled God out of their everyday living. To
                       have acknowledged the Creator would have required their al-
                       legiance and moral obligation to His commands. But the wicked
                       generation would have none of God. For all practical purposes
                       He was "dead."

                         Since men cannot live without recognizing some authority,
                       to what did the antediluvians turn? Rom. 1:21-25.
                           "Not desiring to retain God in their knowledge, they soon
                       came to deny His existence. They adored nature in place of the
                       God of nature. They glorified human genius, worshiped the
                       works of their own hands, and taught their children to bow
                       down to graven images."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 91.
                           The publishing of books on evolution by Charles Darwin re-
                       flected a revolutionary change in human thought that was oc-
                       curring in the period of "the time of the end" which we are
                       studying. The evolutionary theory has affected not only scien-
                       tific thought but also man's religious perspectives. As a result
                       God has been ruled out of His creation, discarded asan outworn
                       myth. In modern times large portions of the populations of earth
                       either deny God's existence or live as though He did not exist.

                         "What two elements of existence does David mention as
                       originating with God? Ps. 36:9.
                         When the mind is not enlightened by God, life loses its sense
                       of meaning. Modern life is characterized by this loss of mean-
                       ing. The popular interest in pleasures of all kinds covers an
                       inner urge to find coherence and sense in human existence.

                         Why is the church's special last-day message extremely
                       relevant to this end-time situation? Rev. 14:6, 7.

The Antediluvians and the Second Advent LESSON 60 Wednesday
                                                 November 2
          Part 4  When the knowledge and fear of God are removed from a
 SOCIAL VIOLENCE society, what attitudes and actions begin to appear?

                      "Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord
                    hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
                    there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
                    By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and commit-
                    ting adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood"
                    (Hosea 4:1, 2).

                      The moral law which governs mankind rests upon the two-
                    fold principle of love to God and impartial love to one's fellow
                    beings. When people cease to respect God, they cease to re-
                    spect one another. Crime and violence result.

                      Since the antediluvians did not wish to retain God in their
                    knowledge, what developed in their society? Gen. 6:11.

                      In what specific ways did that ancient generation sin
                    against one another? Rom. 1:28-32. (Compare with 2 Tim.
                    3:1-5.)

                       "Man will rise no higher than his conceptions of truth, purity,
                    and holiness. If the mind is never exalted above the level of
                    humanity, if it is not uplifted by faith to contemplate infinite
                    wisdom and love, the man will be constantly sinking lower and
                    lower."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 91.
                       Since God is no longer central in modern life, do conditions
                    similar to those of Noah's time prevail today? Even a cursory
                    survey of modern societies reveals deep-seated social unrest in
                    various forms of vandalism, increasing rates of crime, and the
                    infiltrating of organized crime into society, riots, racial tensions,
                    student unrest, crippling strikes, and revolutions. Corruption
                    exists at all levels of society.
                       "Fraud and bribery and theft stalk unrebuked in high places
                    and in low. The issues of the press teem with records of murder.
                    ... The spirit of anarchy is permeating all nations.... The picture
                     which Inspiration has given of the antediluvian world repre-
                    sents too truly the condition to which modern society is fast
                     hastening. Even now, in the present century, and in professedly
                     Christian lands, there are crimes daily perpetrated as black and
                     terrible as those for which the old-world sinners were
                     destroyed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 102.

                                                 November 3
            Part 5     What description does the Bible give of the antediluvians?
TAINTED THOUGHTS
                       "God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the
                     earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
                     was only evil continually" (Gen. 6:5).

                        The great citadel of the human being is the mind. As far as the
                     individual is concerned, the controversy between good and evil
                     is a battle to gain the mind which rightly owes its allegiance to
                     the Creator. Rejecting God, the minds of the people of the
                     antediluvian society became vain and darkened (Rom. 1:21).
                     Controlled by Satan (Rom. 6:16), their imaginations became
                     corrupted and-perverted.

                       What kinds of life-styles do tainted and Impure thoughts
                     produce? Mark 7:21-23. (Compare Prov. 23:7.)

                        Corrupt thinking was widespread in the antediluvian society;
                     so it is today in "the time of the end" as we approach Christ's
                     coming. Newspapers, magazines, books, movies, radio—and
                     especially television—make tremendous impacts on human
                     thinking. Television, now only a little more than a quarter of a
                     century old, has had an incalculable molding influence upon an
                     entire generation of youth from babyhood to adulthood. Unfor-
                     tunately, the mass media pours forth in its torrential output
                     much that is worldly-wise, impure, perverted, and violent. "By
                     beholding we become changed" is an unvarying law of the
                     mind. Modern society is fast moving toward the mental condi-
                     tion of the antediluvian world.
                        "This is an age when corruption is teeming everywhere. ...
                     The heart is corrupted through the imagination. The mind takes
                     pleasure in contemplating scenes which awaken the lower and
                     baser passions.... Avoid reading and seeing things which will
                     suggest impure thoughts. Cultivate the moral and intellectual
                     powers."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 410.

                       What prayer must an end-time Christian make and what
                     positive action must he take if he would preserve and develop
                     wholesome thought processes? Ps. 19:14; Phil. 4:8.

                     are at stake, what TV programs and reading would I eliminate
                     from my daily life?

The Antediluvians and the Second Advent LESSON 6 ❑ Friday
                                              November 4
         Part 6    The apostle Peter described Noah as what kind of a
  PREACHERS OF preacher? On what topic did Noah preach?
 RIGHTEOUSNESS
                   "And [God] spared not the old world, but saved Noah the
                eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the
                flood upon the world of the ungodly" (2 Peter 2:5).

                     While Noah earnestly appealed to the morally bankrupt soci-
                   ety of the antediluvian world and warned of the impending
                   Flood, we must not think that he was merely an alarmist. His
                   ministry was a ministry of righteousness; he preached under the
                   power of the Holy Spirit (see Gen. 6:3) for conversion of heart
                   which would result in a changed life-style.

                     Of what was Noah an heir? Heb. 11:7. (Compare Phil. 3:9.)

                     "Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses understood
                   the gospel. They looked for salvation through man's Substitute
                   and Surety."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 366.
                     In various times of crisis God sends warning messages to the
                   world through the preaching of His servants. These warnings of
                   judgments are not sent merely as means to scare individuals
                   into salvation. Warnings of an imminent Flood such as Noah
                   uttered, or warnings of divine judgments to fall on those who
                   worship the beast or its image, or receive its mark, serve to
                   arrest the attention of the people. Startling and solemn, they
                   arouse the mind to sense its deep spiritual need and the down-
                   ward course it is pursuing. Under the Spirit's conviction, the
                   truly penitent cry out for help. To meet that cry God's preachers
                   of righteousness both anciently and now offer the healing balm
                   of the gospel.

                      What message is offered by God's last-day preachers of
                   righteousness to a morally falling society, and with what re-
                   sults? Rev. 14:6, 12; Matt. 24:14. What are its warning as-
                   pects? Rev. 14:7-11; 18:4.

                     "Before the Flood God sent Noah to warn the world, that the
                   people might be led to repentance. . . . As the time of Christ's
                   second appearing draws near, the Lord sends His servants with
                   a warning to the world to prepare for that great event.... All who
                   will put away their sins by repentance toward God and faith in
                   Christ are offered pardon."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 102.

                       When there is no governing authority in a country, anarchy
                    prevails because each citizen does as he pleases. The same is
                    true in the spiritual realm. If God and His authority are rejected

                    as they choose to do, and being controlled by carnal natures,
                    sins of every hue abound. God and His law have been excised
                    from modern life. The ethics of many moderns spring from their
                    own desires.
                       "Society at the present time is corrupt, as it was in the days of
                    Noah... . They [the antediluvian race] expelled God from their
                    thoughts; they despised His law; trampled His standard of
                    character in the dust."--Fundamentals of Christian Education,
                    p. 421.

                      Can the individual of himself always know what is the right
                    thing to do? Prov. 16:25.

                        Current in modern society among the attacks on God's law is
                    the philosophy that there are no divine absolutes such as the
                    Ten Commandments to be strictly obeyed. It is argued that one
                    should do the loving thing in any given situation, and that the
                    "loving thing" may actually require lying, murder, adultery, etc.
                    However, since man has a sinful nature, even a born-again
                    Christian needs to be told by God just what the "loving thing" is
                    in various situations. God's law and God's Word provide
                    adequate essential guidance.
                        "God has given men no liberty to depart from His require-
                    ments.... In deciding upon any course of action we are not to
                    ask whether we can see that harm will result from it, but whether
                    it is in keeping with the will Df God."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                    p. 634.

                      What does this subtle hatred against God's law in "the time
                    of the end" reflect? 1 John 3:4, 8.

                      Lucifer transgressed God's will. He did not consider the law a
                    necessity for created beings. Ellen White writes: "He reiterated
                    his claim that angels needed no control, but should be left to
                    follow their own will, which would ever guide them right."—The

                                                                   November 7
          Part 2   What perversion in morals became commonplace when
      ABNORMAL people turned away from God?
   ASSOCIATIONS
                   "For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable pas-
                 sions. Their women exchanged natural relations for un-
                 natural, and the men likewise gave up natural relations with
                 women and were consumed with passion for one another,
                 men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in
                 their own persons the due penalty for their error" (Rom. 1:26,
                 27, RSV).

                     For what abnormal associations were Sodom and Gomor-
                   rah destroyed? Jude 7. (Compare Gen. 19:1-11.)

                     Jesus said that one of the signs of His near return would be a
                   condition of morality similar to that among the antediluvians
                   and Sodomites. Not only have the same deviant sexual patterns
                   become prominent in our times, being pursued with open bold-
                   ness, but some professed ministers now defend such practices,
                   organize churches for persons of this life-style, and ordain
                   some to the ministry. Such sinful brazenness indicates again
                   the eroding morality of our times and the approaching end of
                   the age.
                     "The sins that destroyed the antediluvians and the cities of
                   the plain exist today—not merely in heathen lands, not only
                   among popular professors of Christianity, but with some who
                   profess to be looking for the coming of the Son of man. If God
                   should present these sins before you as they appear in His sight,
                   you would be filled with shame and terror."—Testimonies, vol.
                   5, p. 218.

                     Can divine grace in our end time of moral pollution save and
                   transform the immoral who are penitent? 1 Cor. 6: 9-11.

                     "While he [Abraham) loathed the sins of that corrupt city, he
                   desired that the sinners might be saved. His deep interest for
                   Sodom shows the anxiety that we should feel for the impenitent.
                   We should cherish hatred of sin, but pity and love for the sinner.
                   All around us are souls going down to ruin as hopeless, as
                   terrible, as that which befell Sodom."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 140
                     "There is a strange abandonment of principle, the standard of
                   morality is lowered, and the earth is fast becoming a
                   Sodom."—Gospel Workers, p. 125.

               Part 3   In describing the development of sin in the world, what
      FAITHLESSNESS particular transgressions does the apostle Paul mention?
       IN THE FAMILY
                        "Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without
                      natural affection, implacable, unmerciful" (Rom. 1:31).

                        One of the most important moments in a person's experience
                     is marriage. God designed marriage to be a permanent bond
                     between two responsible, loving persons. One of the marked
                     tragedies of modern times is the waning of loyalty, faithfulness,
                     and affection between spouses, and the consequent breakup of
                     the home.
                        Among the antediluvians "Neither the marriage relation nor
                     the rights of property were respected. Whoever coveted the
                     wives or the possessions of his neighbor, took them by force,
                     and men exulted in their deeds of violence."—Patriarchs and
                     Prophets, p. 92.

                       What is God's ideal for marriage? Matt. 19:3-6.

                      What relationships are forbidden, being detrimental to both
                     Christian experience and the home? 1 Cor. 6:15, 17.

                        "Recent painful developments of evil are one of the great
                     evidences we have that the end is near. Satan, like a roaring lion,
                     is going about, seeking whom he may devour; and if men and
                     women, under the blazing light that now shines in this perilous
                     time, will be found fornicators, I am afraid that God will separate
                     them from the work forever. . .
                        "Cleanse the camp of this moral corruption, if it takes the
                     highest men in the highest positions. God will not be trifled with.
                     Fornication is in our ranks; I know it, for it has been shown me to
                     be strengthening and extending its pollutions.... Cleanse the
                     camp, for there is an accursed thing in it."—Testimonies to
                     Ministers, pp. 426-428.

                       How does God regard divorce? Mal. 2:15, 16. On what basis
                     only may the marital bond be broken and the innocent partner
                     remarry? Matt. 19:7-9.

                       "The slightest insinuations, ... inviting you to indulge in sin or
                     to allow the least unwarrantable liberty with your persons,
                     should be resented as the worst of insults to your dignified

Eroding Moral Behavior          LESSON 7                      ❑     Wednesday
                                                                   November 9
          Part 4 What disastrous decision did the descendants of Seth make
 MIXED MARRIAGES as they became acquainted with the descendants of Cain?

                      "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the
                    face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the
                    sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and
                    they took them wives of all which they chose" (Gen. 6:1, 2).

                      One of the basic causes for the quick erosion of moral stan-
                    dards in the antediluvian age was the intermarriage between the
                    followers of God and the worldly descendants of Cain. The
                    influence of the nonbelieving partners had a deadening effect
                    on the spiritual experience of the believers.
                       "The children of Seth, attracted by the beauty of the
                    daughters of Cain's descendants, displeased the Lord by inter-
                    marrying with them. Many of the worshipers of God were be-
                    guiled into sin by the allurements that were now constantly
                    before them, and they lost their peculiar, holy character. Min-
                    gling with the depraved, they became like them in spirit and in
                    deeds."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 81.

                      Why did God forbid His ancient people to intermarry with
                    those who were not of their faith? Deut. 7:1-4.

                      Whose tragic marriages are recorded in the Bible as a warn-
                    ing on this point? 1 Kings 11:1-4. (Compare Neh. 13:25-27.)

                       "Never should God's people venture upon forbidden ground.
                    Marriage between believers and unbelievers is forbidden by
                    God. But too often the unconverted heart follows its own de-
                    sires, and marriages unsanctioned by God are formed."—The
                    Adventist Home, p. 63.

                      Why is incomplete happiness to be expected if a husband
                    and wife form a religiously divided home? 2 Cor. 6:14-16.

                      "The heart yearns for human love, but this love is not strong
                    enough, or pure enough, or precious enough, to supply the
                    place of the love of Jesus.... Let woman give herself to Christ
                    before giving herself to any earthly friend, and enter into no
                    relation which shall conflict with this.... Unless you would have
                    a home where the shadows are never lifted, do not unite your-
                    self with one who is an enemy of God."—Messages to Young
                    People, p. 440.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it not spiritually safe, nor in the interest of mutual
                    happiness, for a Seventh-day Adventist to marry a Christian of

              Part 5     What conditions between parents and children did the

                         "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
                       come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
                       boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, un-
                       thankful, unholy" (2 Tim. 3:1, 2).

                          The prediction indicated that in many homes there would be
                       an open clash between parents and children. Respect for paren-
                       tal authority is basic to human happiness. A failure to appreciate
                       its legitimate place in society leads to a general contempt for
                       authority whether in the church, school, state, or even in
                       heaven.
                          "The family is the most important and fundamental unit in
                       society and government. Respect for parental authority and
                       obedience to parental law are the foundation of all order and
                       organization. As goes the home, so goes society, the nation,
                       and the world."
                          "The lack of regard for authority—parental, civil, and
                       divine—is the greatest evil of the modern world."—Taylor G.

                         The first care of the parents should be to establish good
                       government in the family. The word of the parents should be
                       law, precluding all arguments or evasions. Children should be

         DESIRE
                   "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you
                 abstain from immorality; that each one of you know how to
                 take a wife for himself in holiness and honor, not in the pas-
                 sion of lust like heathen who do not know God.... For God has
                 not called us for uncleanness, but in holiness" (1 Thess. 4:3-7,
                 RSV).

                      Whether the Greek phrase of verse 4 refers to the Christian
                   himself (KJV) or to a wife (RSV) is immaterial to the thrust of the
                   passage which calls the sanctified Christian to a life of moral
                   purity. Marriage is sacred. True love is honorable and responsi-
                   ble. Premarital sex, trial marriages, and wife-trading are but
                   various forms of immorality condemned in the Bible. Such prac-
                   tices are destructive of genuine happiness and holiness.

                     How did God establish the marriage relationship? Gen.
                   1:27; 2:18-24.

                      "God Himself gave Adam a companion . .. —one who was
                   fitted to be his companion, and who could be one with him in
                   love and sympathy. She was ... to stand by his side as an equal,
                   to be loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his
                   bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self, showing
                   the close union and the affectionate attachment that should
                   exist in this relation. . . .
                       " ... When the divine principles are recognized and obeyed in
                   this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and
                   happiness of the race, it provides for man's social needs, it
                   elevates the physical, the intellectual, and the moral
                   nature."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.

                     How does the apostle Paul show that conjugal love is proper
                   and sacred to the marriage estate? 1 Cor. 7:3-5.

                     The King James Version rendering "due benevolence" refers
                   to "conjugal rights" (RSV).
                     "Jesus did not enforce celibacy upon any class of men. He
                   came not to destroy the sacred relationship of marriage, but to
                   exalt it and restore it to its original sanctity. He looks with
                   pleasure upon the family relationship where sacred and unself-

          Part 1   Under what symbol does John portray the organized reli-
     MOTHER AND gious apostasy of the last days?
      DAUGHTERS
                   "Come hither; I will shew unto thee the Judgment of the
                 great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the
                 kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the
                 inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine
                 of her fornication.... And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
                 coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven
                 heads and ten horns.... And upon her forehead was a name
                 written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF
                 HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH" (Rev.
                 17:1-5).

                      In the Scriptures the professed followers of God are
                   figuratively represented as a woman (see Jer. 6:2) married to
                   God (see Isa. 54:5). Whenever God's people fraternized with the
                   world and corrupted their lives and teachings by adopting the
                   world's views, they committed spiritual adultery in the eyes of
                   God. (See Eze. 16:15; James 4:4.) Thus at times apostasy is
                   symbolized as a fallen, impure woman.
                      In the Revelation two symbolic women are presented. The
                   true people of God are symbolized by a pure, noble woman
                   clothed in gospel light (Revelation 12). The Christian apostasy is
                   symbolized by a fallen, impure woman who has illicit
                   connections with the rulers of the world (Revelation 17).

                      What biblical clues clearly identify this organized apos-
                   tasy? Rev. 17:3, 6, 18.
                      Only one professing Christian system has truly controlled to a
                   large extent the governments of the world and has been guilty of
                   slaying millions of Christians who differed with it. That is the
                   papacy.

                      Who would be the daughters of Babylon, depicted as being
                   like the mother in Revelation 17:5?
                      "Babylon is said to be 'the mother of harlots.' By her
                   daughters must be symbolized churches that cling to her
                   doctrines and traditions, and follow her example of sacrificing
                   the truth and the approval of God, in order to form an unlawful
                   alliance with the world."—The Great Controversy, pp. 382, 383.
                   The symbol of daughters thus depicts similar apostasy in the
                   non-papal systems, that is to say, in Protestantism.

THINK IT THROUGH     Because a prophetic symbol may deal with apostasy in a
                   given Christian system, does it mean that all persons in the
                   system are apostate? (See Rev. 18:4.)

A Changing Christianity          LESSON 8                            ❑ Monday
                                                                   November 14


          Part 2    What attitude against the Scriptures did the apostle Paul
  THE SCRIPTURES forewarn would develop within the Christian faith?
     CHALLENGED
                    "I charge you ... : preach the word.... For the time is coming
                 when people will not endure sound teaching, but having
                 itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to
                 suit their own likings, and will turn away from listening to the
                 truth and wander into myths" (2 Tim. 4:1-4, RSV).

                       The Christian religion rests upon two basic premises: (1)
                    There is a God, and (2) God has revealed Himself to man in the
                    Holy Scriptures. Yet a large portion of Christians in "the time of
                    the end" has rejected the authority of the Scriptures. And more
                    amazing is the fact that this change of attitude toward the Bible
                    developed largely in Protestantism which originally took as its
                    platform "the Bible and the Bible only"!
                       As noted in lesson 6, the entrance of the concepts of Darwin-
                    ian evolution in the mid-nineteenth century had a profound
                    influence on all areas of human thought. To the higher critical
                    Bible scholars who were already questioning the validity of
                    Scripture, it seemed to offer "scientific" proof that the first
                    chapters of Genesis were only myth and not genuine historical
                    records. At first there were attempts to harmonize the evolu-
                    tionary theory with the biblical account of Creation, but in time
                    liberal Protestantism gave this up. Eventually the authority of
                    the Scriptures was eroded away for those who accepted the
                    conclusions of evolution and higher criticism.

                     What biblical doctrine calls attention to the truth of the
                    Genesis account of Creation? Ex. 20:8-11; Mark 2:27.

                       "Many accept mere theories and speculations as scientific
                    facts, and they think that God's word is to be tested by the
                    teachings of 'science falsely so called.' 1 Timothy 6:20. . . .
                    Those who doubt the reliability of the records of the Old and
                    New Testaments too often go a step further and doubt the
                    existence of God and attribute infinite power to nature. Having
                    let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks of
                    infidelity."—The Great Controversy, p. 522.

THINK IT THROUGH      Does the witness of the Bible conflict with that of nature? Or
                    does the problem lie with interpretations? Should one source
                    of witness have precedence over the other? Explain.

             Part 3    What did Jesus foresee would dwindle among His
     A FAILING FAITH professed followers?

                      "When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the
                    earth?" (Luke 18:8).

                      "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
                    cold" (Matt. 24:12).
                       It is hard to imagine the widespread effect that the concepts
                    of evolution in conjunction with higher critical studies of the
                    Scriptures have had on religious thought. The claim that man
                    has evolved upward from simple forms forces the conclusion
                    that man never fell morally, as the Scriptures assert. Hence, he
                    is not a sinner in need of saving grace. Thus in one stroke the
                    doctrine of sin and the plan of salvation are rejected.
                       Furthermore, natural processes allow for no miraculous
                    intervention by God. Thus all miracles in the Scriptures are at
                    once suspect and denied.

                    Upon what great miracle—the greatest of miracles—does
                   Christianity rest? 1 Cor. 15:13, 14.
                     Liberal Protestantism has not only denied the recorded
                   miracles of healing, but also the miracles of Creation, the virgin
                   birth, the resurrection of Jesus in victory, and predictive
                   prophecy.

                     What particular group of predictions would be openly
                   denied by some in the end time? 2 Peter 3:3, 4.
                     Higher critics see an evolutionary development of Israel's
                   beliefs from simple to more complex. This, together with other
                   factors, has led to dissecting and speculating as to when the Old
                   Testament books were written. Inspired authors have been
                   repudiated in favor of editors and compilers. Critical studies in
                   the Gospels by scholars have promoted the belief that one can
                   today know nothing about the real Jesus of history, but only the
                   early church's concept of Him.

THINK IT THROUGH     What are the evidences that assure me of the trustworthi-
                   ness of my Bible when so many Christians reject it?
                      "To many the Bible is as a lamp without oil, because they have
                    turned their minds into channels of speculative belief that bring
                   misunderstanding and confusion. The work of higher criticism,
                   in dissecting, conjecturing, reconstructing, is destroying faith
                   in the Bible as a divine revelation. It is robbing God's word of
                   power to control, uplift, and inspire human lives." —The Acts of

         Part 4   By what means did John propose to test the false views
    DENIED DEITY about Christ which would be taught to Christians?

                     "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
                   they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out
                   into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit
                   that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of
                   God" (1 John 4:1-3).

                     That person teaches the authentic Christian faith who
                   teaches that Christ is true Deity, who, by the mystery of the
                   incarnation, became truly man, God with us (John 1:1-3, 14).
                   One of the sad signs of the end time is the open denial of the full
                   deity of Christ, not only by liberal Christians, but also by other
                   groups who claim to follow the Bible.

                     What do the Scriptures teach about the deity of Christ? Phil.
                   2:5, 6; Col. 2:9.

                     How did Jesus assert His divine eternal nature? John 8:24,
                   28, 57-59.

                     What acknowledgement and worship did Jesus accept from
                   His followers? John 20:27-29.

                   • "If men reject the testimony of the inspired Scriptures
                   concerning the deity of Christ, it is in vain to argue the point with
                   them; for no argument, however conclusive, could convince
                   them.... None who hold this error can have atrue conception of
                   the character or the mission of Christ, or of the great plan of God
                   for man's redemption."—The Great Controversy, p. 524.

                     What two other doctrines about Christ did Paul hold as basic
                   to the Christian faith? 1 Cor. 15:3, 4.

                      "The sacrifice of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great
                   truth around which all other truths cluster. In order to be rightly
                   understood and appreciated, every truth in the word of God,
                   from Genesis to Revelation, must be studied in the light that
                   streams from the cross of Calvary. I present before you the
                   great, grand monument of mercy and regeneration, salvation

          Part 5   Why are the Scriptures authoritative in matters of doctrine
     PROPOSITION and instruction?
   OR ENCOUNTER
                   "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
                 for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righ-
                 teousness" (2 Tim. 3:16).

                       The Greek word translated "inspiration of God" means
                    literally, "God-breathed." Bible truths originated with God.

                     What Divine Agent was involved in transmitting Heaven's
                    messages to mankind? 2 Peter 1:20, 21.

                       The Holy Spirit qualified the Bible writers both to receive the
                     divine messages and to transmit them orally or in writing in a
                    trustworthy manner. These prophetic revelations became a
                    body of objective truth, disclosing to later generations the
                    revealed will of God. The possession of the written revelation of
                    God was one of the great advantages enjoyed by God's people.
                    (See Rom. 3:1, 2.)
                       In recent years a different concept of inspiration has been
                    introduced into the Christian world and has permeated the
                    seminaries and ministries of liberal Protestantism and Catholi-
                    cism. The view holds that when a Bible writer had an encounter
                    with God it was simply a mystical confrontation of Person to
                    person. No information was revealed. The prophet had only an
                    experience with God. Later, as the situation demanded, the
                    prophet wrote to meet the need. However, what he wrote was
                    not information from God, but his own ideas, a witness of his
                    encounter with God. But since it is his own message, it may
                    contain error both of fact and of theology. A reader of this
                    document may also experience a divine encounter in spite of its
                    errors, and at that point the document becomes inspired to him.
                    It can be readily seen that such a view permits the Bible to be
                    freely criticized according to human criteria, and that its divine
                    authority is destroyed. The Bible is no longer regarded as an
                    objective body of truth to guide and to correct the believer. The
                    source of knowledge about the Christian religion and its
                    requirements is at once nullified—and this by Christians
                    themselves.

THINK IT THROUGH      What effect will the Bible have on my life if I regard it as the
                    voice of God? As the opinions of holy men?

                      "Human reasoning and the imaginings of the human heart
                    are undermining the inspiration of the Word of God.... This is
                    one of the marked signs of the last days."—Selected Messages,

A Changing Christianity         LESSON 8                                 Friday
                                                                    November 18


          Part 6     What explicit command did Christ give His church?
        ALTERED
      OBJECTIVES     "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
                   them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
                   Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
                   you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age"
                   (Matt. 28:19, 20, RSV).

                     As Christians preach the gospel under the power of the Holy
                   Spirit, what changes are wrought in those who accept it? John
                   3:3, 5; 1 Peter 1:23; 2 Cor. 5:17.

                     The objective of the gospel message is the salvation and the
                   transformation of the sinner. It is a one-by-one procedure. But
                   each converted individual exerts in turn an uplifting influence
                   upon others and his society.
                      With a changed view of the Scriptures and its doctrines there
                   also came into liberal Protestantism an altering of its objectives.
                   Since, in its opinion, man is not a lost sinner in need of salvation,
                   this wing of Christianity has turned to a "social gospel"—a
                   humanitarian attempt to better the physical and mental lot of
                   humanity by earthly and political means. Foreign missions have
                   declined since liberal Protestantism sees Christianity as only
                   one of a variety of religious roads leading heavenward.

                     Did Jesus teach that His kingdom of grace was to be
                   extended by social action for the masses, or by the ministry to
                   individual lives? John 4:13, 14.

                     "The Saviour attempted no civil reforms. He attacked no
                   national abuses, nor condemned the national enemies. He did
                   not interfere with the authority or administration of those in
                   power. He who was our example kept aloof from earthly
                   governments. Not because He was indifferent to the woes of
                   men, but because the remedy did not lie in merely human and
                   external measures. To be efficient, the cure must reach men
                   individually, and must regenerate the heart.
                     "Not by the decisions of courts or councils or legislative
                   assemblies ... is the kingdom of Christ established, but by the
                   implanting of Christ's nature in humanity through the work of
                   the Holy Spirit. . .. Here is the only power that can work the
                   uplifting of mankind. And the human agency for the ac-
                   complishment of this work is the teaching and practicing of the
                   word of God."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 509, 510.

                   Wesley. Does this preclude Christian social service?

          Part 1   According to John, what religious organization would excite
       A REVIVED the admiration of the modern world in the time of the end?
         PAPACY
                   "One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its
                 mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the
                 beast with wonder" (Rev. 13:3, RSV).

                      As we have seen from our earlier studies, the period known as
                   "the time of the end" began with the wounding of the papal
                   power in 1798. The abolition of papal civil rule and the setting up
                   of the French republic meant the full death of the system to the
                   thinking people of that period. But prophecy foretold a healing
                   of that wound. The papacy suffered another setback in 1870
                   when the newly unified kingdom of Italy took over the Papal
                   States. However, since the 1929 Concordat between the Vatican
                   and the Italian government (which restored the pope's political
                   control over the Vatican State), the papacy has been steadily
                   growing in power and influence throughout the world.

                     What will be the nearly universal attitude toward the papacy
                   near the end? Rev. 13:4.

                     There has been an astounding change in attitude toward the
                   papacy by Protestants and others since the pontificate of John
                   XXIII and Vatican Council II (1962-1965) at which time the
                   Roman Church sought to orient itself in a more meaningful
                   manner to the modern world. That council has markedly re-
                   duced the tensions between the Roman communion and other
                   groups and ushered in an era of dialogue. As a result many
                   Christians of different persuasions are willing to see a renewed
                   papacy functioning as a visible sign of the unity of the Church.

                     How supreme will Rome become again? Rev. 13:8.

                   supremacy."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

                      "Protestants have tampered with and patronized popery; they
                   have made compromises and concessions which papists them-
                   selves are surprised to see and fail to understand. Men are

         Part 2  What cooperative efforts are implied in the prophecy of the
     ECUMENICAL two-horned beast and the establishment of "the image of the
     MOVEMENTS beast"?

                      "I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
                   had two horns Ilke a Iamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he
                   exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and
                   causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the
                   first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.. . . [He says]
                   to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an
                   image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did
                   live" (Rev. 13:11-14).

                     Adventist Bible students have long recognized that the two-
                   horned beast symbolizes Protestant America. The prophecy
                   implies cooperation between Protestantism and Catholicism.
                   Protestant America is depicted as causing its people to show
                   homage to the beast and form an image to it. In its fullest
                   development the papacy is a union of church and state with the
                   church controlling the state. To form an "image" of this would
                   require the religious forces of the nation to be strong enough to
                   control the state and to employ it to further the ends of religion.
                   But to obtain such influence would require a large degree of
                   cooperation and fraternity among the various church commu-
                   nions. One of the religious phenomena particularly vigorous in
                   the twentieth century is the ecumenical movement among
                   Christians, an active movement to foster Christian unity and
                   cooperation

                     What will be the final cooperative effort of Christendom?
                    Rev. 19:11, 19, 20.

                      "The wide diversity of belief in the Protestant churches is
                    regarded by many as decisive proof that no effort to secure a
                    forced uniformity can even be made. But there has been for
                    years, in churches of the Protestant faith, a strong and growing
                    sentiment in favor of a union based upon common points of
                    doctrine. To secure such a union, the discussion of subjects
                    upon which all were not agreed—however important they might
                    be from a Bible standpoint—must necessarily be waived."—The
                    Great Controversy, p. 444.
                      One by-product of some modern church mergers and of
                    councils of churches is to constitute a block of public opinion
                    and thus become a political force.

     COUNTERFEIT people who would be living in the end time?
       REVIVALS
                   "Many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many"
                 (Matt. 24:11).

                     What made false religious teachers in the Corinth church so
                   deceptive? 2 Cor. 11:13-15.

                     "The path of error often appears to lie close to the path of
                   truth. It is hardly distinguishable from the path that leads to
                   holiness and heaven. But the mind enlightened by the Holy
                   Spirit may discern that it is diverging from the right way. After a
                   while the two are seen to be widely separated."—Testimonies,
                   vol. 8, pp. 290, 291.

                     What may accompany counterfeit religion that makes it
                   convincing to many? Matt. 24:24.

                      A worldwide religious phenomenon which has attracted great
                   attention in recent years is the charismatic movement, some-
                   times referred to as neo-Pentecostalism. Its emphasis is upon
                   speaking in tongues (glossolalia). The movement has made
                   deep inroads into Roman Catholicism as well as into the old-line
                   Protestant denominations. Because it has leaped denomina-
                   tional walls and has been embraced by Christians of various
                   persuasions, it is viewed by many as the force that will ac-
                   complish the ecumenical objectives. Many hail it as a genuine
                   manifestation of the Holy Spirit.

                     What tests must the Christian apply to any message even
                   though It may appear very Christian? Isa. 8:20; Matt. 7:15, 16,
                   1 John 4:1-3.

                     "The enemy of souls desires to hinder this work [the true
                   outpouring of the Spirit]; and before the time for such a move-
                   ment shall come, he will endeavor to prevent it by introducing a
                   counterfeit. In those churches which he can bring under his
                   deceptive power he will make it appear that God's special bless-
                   ing is poured out; there will be manifest what is thought to be
                   great religious interest. Multitudes will exult that God is working
                   marvelously for them, when the work is that of another spirit.
                   Under a religious guise, Satan will seek to extend his influence
                   over the Christian world."—The Great Controversy. p. 464.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why would the fact that the charismatic movement unites
                   persons of diverse communions by experience rather than by
                   the teaching of Scripture make It suspect?

                                                                   November 23
          Part 4   Jesus warned his follciwers to expect deceptive teachings
       PROPHECY on what important prophetic subject in the end time?
      PERVERTED
                   "Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
                 there; believe it not.... Behold, I have told you before. Where-
                 fore If they shall say unto you, Behold, he is In the desert; go
                 not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe It not"
                 (Matt. 24:23-26).

                      While liberal Protestantism has rejected the validity of Bible
                   prophecy, conservative Protestants have largely adopted the
                   system of prophetic interpretation known as futurism or dis-
                   pensationalism. Popularized by the notes of the Scofield Bible
                   and more recent works, "Futurism" is a perversion of the
                   prophecies with roots reaching back to the Catholic Counter-
                   Reformation. The view separates the seventieth week of Daniel
                   9 from its context, placing it at the end of the age. The
                   prophecies of the antichrist (little horn; leopard beast; man of
                   sin) are applied to a single person. Prophecies about Israel are
                   misapplied to teach a restored Judaism. The second advent is
                   divided into two phases: First, according to this view, there is
                   "secret rapture" at the beginning of the seventieth week, at
                   which time the "church" is taken to heaven. Then, it is taught,
                   an open coming will occur seven years later, at which time
                   Christ will establish His personal reign on the earth for a millen-
                   nium. The preaching of the "secret rapture" in connection with
                   a future restoration of the Jews has become very popular in our
                   times among conservative Christians.

                     According to Jesus, how open and known will His coming
                   be? Matt. 24:27; Rev. 1:7.

                      "The Saviour has warned His people against deception upon
                   this point, and has clearly foretold the manner of His second
                   coming.... This coming there is no possibility of counterfeiting.
                   It will be universally known—witnessed by the whole world."—
                   The Great Controversy, p. 625.

                     What will be heard by all at Christ's return? What will take
                   place among the righteous? 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

                     Where does Christ take His redeemed ones? 1 Thess. 4:17;
                   John 14:1-3. Where does John see them? Rev. 7:9, 10.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why are false teachers, who cite the Bible for support, more
                   deceptive than those who openly deny the Bible?

Religious Trends          LESSON 9                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                     November 24
              Part 5   From the mouths of what three symbols of religious powers
     RESURGENCE OF did John see demon spirits issue forth?
      NON-CHRISTIAN
          RELIGIONS    "I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
                     of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
                     mouth of the false prophet" (Rev. 16:13).

                        In the book of Revelation the "dragon" is first depicted in
                      chapter 12. There it is identified primarily as Satan (Rev. 12:9),
                      and secondarily as the power of pagan Rome which sought to
                      destroy Christ (verses 4, 5). In chapter 16 the "dragon" may be
                      understood as representing pagan or non-Christian religions.
                      For centuries Satan opposed God through paganism; later he
                      was successful in compromising Christianity with paganism.

                        With what fervor may we expect Satan to work near the end?
                      What kind of religious teachings may we expect to become
                      prominent? Rev. 12:12; 1 Tim. 4:1.

                         The resurgence of non-Christian religions is a modern
                      phenomenon. Millions in both the East and the West are turning
                      to modernized forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, and other Orien-
                      tal religions. Some young people in traditionally Christian coun-
                      tries know more about Krishna than they do about Christ. Many
                      developing nations are reviving their ancient native religions to
                      increase the national consciousness. Such movements hinder
                      the preaching of the gospel.
                         "As we near the close of time, there will be greater and still
                      greater external parade of heathen power; heathen deities will
                      manifest their signal power, and will exhibit themselves before
                      the cities of the world."—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 117, 118.

                        Through whom only can genuine salvation and happiness
                      be obtained? Why? John 14:6. (Compare Acts 4:12.)

                        "The principle that man can save himself by his own works lay
                      at the foundation of every heathen religion. . . . Wherever it is
                      held, men have no barrier against sin."—The Desire of Ages, pp.
                      35, 36.

                        What exclusive claim did Jesus make? Are all religions
                      doors to the same place? John 10:1, 7-9.

THINK IT THROUGH        What explanation can you give (apart from satanic influ-
                      ence) for the avid interest in non-Christian religions of many
                      modern persons.

          Part 6   What features of the first angel's message symbolize the
       ADVENTIST speed and the extensive outreach of the final gospel invite-
         ACTION tion?

                     "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
                   the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
                   earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
                   people" (Rev. 14:6).

                     The Seventh-day Adventist movement itself is a remarkable
                   sign of the times. Organizing its General Conference in 1863
                   with a membership of about 3500 and 30 ministerial workers,
                   the movement has grown to more than 2.5 million, some 82
                   percent being outside North America. Today Adventists pro-
                   claim their message in 559 languages. By means of radio and
                   television the message is literally sounding through the air.

                     What three lines of endeavor did Jesus pursue in proclaim-
                   ing the gospel? Matt. 4:23.

                     The advent movement works in these same three areas—
                   Christian education, evangelistic outreach, and medical mis-
                   sionary work. By these agencies we seek to uplift Christ and to
                   draw mankind to Him in preparation for His coming.
                      "The greatest wealth of truth ever entrusted to mortals, the
                   most solemn and fearful warnings ever sent by God to man,
                   have been committed to them to be given to the world; and in

                     What parable continues to depict the external growth of the
                   church? Matt. 13:31, 32.

                     "In this last generation the parable of the mustard seed is to
                   reach a signal and triumphant fulfillment. The little seed will
                   become a tree. The last message of warning and mercy is to go
                   to 'every nation, and kindred, and tongue' (Rev. 14:6-14), 'to
                   take out of them a people for His name' (Acts 15:14)."—Christ's

  "They worshipped the dragon              scopes which are published in
which gave power unto the                  hundreds of newspapers. Covens of
beast" (Rev. 13:4).                        modern-day witches meet regularly.
  "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly,         Supplies for sorcery and related
that in the latter times some shall        occult activities are sold in stores now

in modern times. Magic, witchcraft,        occurring in an age of highly

range of the occult have become very       education, an age which has

                                              The occult was one aspect of
                                           heathenism which proved a strong
                                           temptation to ancient Israel. This week
                                           we wish to study the counsels God
                                           gave Israel regarding occult arts. The

              Part 1   God cautioned Israel not to be concerned and anxious over
     HOROSCOPES OR what heathen system of predicting?
     CHRISTIAN HOPE
                       "Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and
                     be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are
                     dismayed at them. For the customs of the people are vain"
                     (Jer. 10:2, 3).

                        Astrology seems to have had its origin in Mesopotamia. The
                      assumption upon which ancient astrology rested was that the
                      movements of the celestial bodies affected human destinies.
                      Hence, the ancients were concerned to analyze carefully such
                      celestial phenomena as eclipses, comets, and the conjunctions
                      of the heavenly bodies. The earliest known text giving a horo-
                      scope is dated April 29, 410 BC.
                        Although we live in a very scientific age, millions have turned
                      to a revived astrology to find answers to their problems. Christ,
                      however, not stars, is the only satisfying solution.

                        To whom do the orderly but inanimate heavenly bodies
                      direct man's attention? Ps. 19:1; 8:3, 4.

                       What does the Creator wish to assure His earthly children
                      when they behold the stars? Isa. 40:26-31; Ps. 147:3-5.

                         "Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and
                      your fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot
                      weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not
                      indifferent to the wants of His children.... Take to Him every-
                      thing that perplexes the mind. Nothing is too great for Him to
                      bear, for He holds up worlds, He rules over all the affairs of the
                      universe.... The relations between God and each soul are as
                      distinct and full as though there were not another soul upon the
                      earth to share His watchcare, not another soul for whom He
                      gave His beloved Son."—Steps to Christ, p. 100.

                        Where does the Christian find his source of guidance in all
                      the affairs of life? Ps. 73:23, 24; Matt. 4:4.

                       "Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day. Sur-
                     render all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His
                     providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving
                     your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded
                     more and more after the life of Christ."—Steps to Christ, p. 70.

Fascination With the Occult           LESSON 10                     ❑ Monday
                                                                   November 28
         Part 2   What practices did God expressly forbid Israel to learn or to
     FORBIDDEN adopt?
     PRACTICES
                  "When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God
                giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations
                of those nations. There shall not be found among you any one
                that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or
                that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter,
                or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
                Wizard, or a necromancer" (Deut. 18:9-11).

                      The Canaanites whom Israel dispossessed were a deeply de-
                   praved people, and their influence and practices were degrad-
                   ing; hence, the straightforward warning to Israel.
                      A diviner might consult arrows, images, or animal livers in
                   seeking information or guidance (Eze. 21:21). An "observer of
                   times," literally, "of the clouds," may have been one who based
                   his predictions on a study of the clouds. The "enchanter" and
                   the "consulter with familiar spirits" were spirit mediums. The
                   "wizard" was also one who alleged to have special knowledge
                   from contact with the dead. Witchcraft or sorcery pertained to
                   those persons who employed powers gained from evil spirits,
                   and who at times used chemical substances. "A charmer,"
                   literally, "a tier of knots," refers to the making and wearing of
                   magic cords and knots as spells against evil.

                     Why did God command His people not to engage in these
                   pagan practices? Deut. 18:12.

                      What counsel did Paul give to the Ephesian members which
                   is also good counsel for modern Christians who might be
                   tempted to dabble in revived occultism? Eph. 5:11; 6:11, 12.

                      "There are many who become restless when they cannot
                   know the definite outcome of affairs. They cannot endure un-
                   certainty, and in their impatience they refuse to wait to see the
                   salvation of God. Apprehended evils drive them nearly dis-
                   tracted. They give way to their rebellious feelings, and run hither
                   and thither in passionate grief, seeking intelligence concerning
                   that which has not been revealed. If they would but trust in God,
                   and watch unto prayer, they would find divine consolation.
                   Their spirit would be calmed by communion with God."—

          Part 3       What is one of the reasons God gave for the overthrow of
JUDGMENT ON THE      ancient Babylon?
    OCCULT ARTS
                       "These two things shall come to thee in a moment in one
                     day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come
                     upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,
                     and for the great abundance of thine enchantments" (Ise.
                     47:9).

                       The great interest of the Babylonians in the occult arts is
                     attested to by classical writers and archaeological data.

                        In determining to deliver the Jews from Babylonian captiv-
                     ity, whom did the God of heaven say He would frustrate? isa.
                     44:24, 25.

                       Who were unable to assist Belshazzar and the nation of
                     Babylon on its last night of revelry to read the message on the
                     wall? Dan. 5:7, 8.

                       "Hushed was the boisterous mirth, while men and women,
                     seized with nameless terror, watched the hand slowly tracing
                     the mysterious characters. . . . They seemed to be arraigned
                     before the judgment bar of the eternal God, whose power they
                     had just defied."—Prophets and Kings, p. 524.

                       The destructive Judgments which fell on the mighty Babylo-
                     nian Empire were also predicted to fall upon what class of
                     persons? Isa. 47:13, 14.

                        In the judgments pronounced on Babylon's practitioners of
                     occult arts we may see God's attitude toward these activities.
                     God is no respecter of persons. What was wrong then is wrong
                     today. Christians dabble at their eternal peril.
                        "The magicians of heathen times have their counterpart in
                     the spiritualistic mediums, the clairvoyants, and the fortune-
                     tellers of today. The mystic voices that spoke at Endor and at
                     Ephesus are still by their lying words misleading the children of
                     men. Could the veil be lifted from before our eyes, we should see
                     evil angels employing all their arts to deceive and to destroy.
                     Wherever an influence is exerted to cause men to forget God,
                     there Satan is exercising his bewitching power. When men yield
                     to his influence, ere they are aware the mind is bewildered and
                     the soul polluted."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 290.

THINK IT THROUGH       To many persons such things as the Ouija board, palm read-

                     part in them?

          Part 4   What experience in Daniel's early service in Babylon ex-
    FRUSTRATED posed the falseness of heathen astrology?
FORTUNE-TELLERS
                   "Daniel answered In the presence of the king, and said, The
                 secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men,
                 the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto
                 the king; but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets,
                 and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be
                 in the latter days" (Dan. 2:27, 28).

                     Although these leaders in the occult arts claimed contact
                   with superhuman spirits and powers, what did they openly
                   admit on this occasion? Dan. 2:10, 11.

                    What was their experience some years later when they
                   were told the monarch's dream? Dan. 4:7, 18.

                     "Once more in this idolatrous nation, testimony was to be
                   borne to the fact that only those who love and fear God can
                   understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven."—
                   Prophets and Kings, p. 516.

                     Who only is omniscient and can truly foretell the future? Isa.
                   46:9, 10.

                      Satan cannot know the future. He is an astute student of
                   human nature. He controls many persons and has considerable
                   freedom to create events as he will. These factors enable evil
                   agencies to make predictions. But it is well known that the
                   spirits often err in their forecasts.
                      "Satan closely watches events, and when he finds one who
                   has a specially strong spirit of opposition to the truth of God he
                   will even reveal to him unfulfilled events, that he may more
                   firmly secure himself a seat in his heart. ...
                      "Those who have bitterly opposed the truth of God, Satan
                   uses as his mediums. To such he will appear in the assumed
                   person and garb of another, it may be a friend of the medium. He
                   will increase their faith by using the words of this friend and
                   relating circumstances which are about to take place or which
                   really have taken place and of which the medium knew nothing.
                   Sometimes previous to a death or an accident he gives a dream
                   or, personating another, converses with the medium, even im-
                   parting knowledge by means of his suggestions. But it is wis-
                   dom from beneath and not from above."—Testimonies, vol. 2,
                   pp. 171, 172.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why do you think people—even in high places such as

        Part 5   Convicted of the wrongness in participating in the occult
 BOOKS OF MAGIC arts, what did the Ephesian Christians do?

                     "Many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed
                   their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts
                   brought their books together, and burned them before all
                   men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty
                   thousand pieces of silver" (Acts 19:18, 19).

                     "These [magical] arts were almost a specialty in Ephesus. The
                   magicians and astrologers were about in great numbers, and
                   carried on a brisk trade in charms, books of divination, and rules
                   for interpreting dreams. The so-called 'Ephesian spells,' or
                   `Ephesian writings' (Ephesia grammata) were small slips of
                   parchment kept in silk bags, and on these slips were written
                   archaic words of obscure meaning."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 6, p. 376.

                     What experience had occurred which led new believers to
                   burn their books on the occult arts? Acts 19:13-20.

                     "By burning their books on magic, the Ephesian converts
                   showed that the things in which they had once delighted they
                   now abhorred. It was by and through magic that they had espe-
                   cially offended God and imperiled their souls; and it was against
                   magic that they showed such indignation. Thus they gave evi-
                   dence of true conversion.
                     "These treatises on divination contained rules and forms of
                   communication with evil spirits. They were the regulations of
                   the worship of Satan—directions for soliciting his help and
                   obtaining information from him. By retaining these books the
                   disciples would have exposed themselves to temptation; by
                   selling them they would have placed temptation in the way of
                   others. They had renounced the kingdom of darkness, and to
                   destroy its power they did not hesitate at any sacrifice."—The
                   Acts of the Apostles, pp. 288, 289.

                    With what kind of information should the Christian fill his
                   mind? Prov. 23:23; Col. 2:3, 10.

                     "Many will never be convinced that it is bliss to be ignorant of
                   a certain kind of knowledge, which arises from unsanctified
                   desires and unholy aims. The sons and daughters of Adam are
                   fully as inquisitive and presumptuous as was Eve in seeking
                   forbidden knowledge."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 504.

         Part 6  What was it that enabled the man in the synagogue of
DEMON POSSESSION Capernaum to recognize the deity of Jesus?

                      "There was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
                    and he cried out, saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with
                    thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I
                    know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus
                    rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him"
                    (Mark 1:23-25).

                      "The fact that men have been possessed with demons, is
                    clearly stated in the New Testament. The persons thus afflicted
                    were not merely suffering with disease from natural causes.
                    Christ had perfect understanding of that with which He was
                    dealing, and He recognized the direct presence and agency of
                    evil spirits."—The Great Controversy, p. 514.

                      To what extent did the demons degrade and ruin the two
                    Gadarene men Jesus met? Mark 5:1-19. (Compare Matt.
                    8:28-34.)

                      "The encounter with the demoniacs of Gergesa had a lesson
                    for the disciples. It showed the depths of degradation to which
                    Satan is seeking to drag the whole human race, and the mission

                     "The woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
                   the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in
                   the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it,
                   neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto
                   the woman, Ye shall not surely die" (Gen. 3:2-4).

                     It is upon this lie—the natural immortality of the soul—that
                   Satan erected the pagan religions with their various views of the
                   afterlife.
                     "Nearly all forms of ancient sorcery and witchcraft were
                   founded upon a belief in communion with the dead... .
                     "This same belief in communion with the dead formed the
                   cornerstone of heathen idolatry. The gods of the heathen were
                   believed to be the deified spirits of departed heroes. Thus the
                   religion of the heathen was a worship of the dead... .
                      "Modern spiritualism and the forms of ancient witchcraft and
                   idol worship—all having communion with the dead as their vital

                       The Hebrew for "medium" is rendered in the KJV as "them

                    employs this device in order to gain control of minds.
                       "Through spiritualism many of the sick, the bereaved, the

   OF GUIDANCE

                   not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets" (1 Sam.
                   28:6).

                      "The Lord never turned away a soul that came to Him in
                   sincerity and humility. Why did he turn Saul away unanswered?
                   The king had by his own act forfeited the benefits of all the
                   methods of inquiring of God. He had rejected the counsel of
                   Samuel the prophet; he had exiled David, the chosen of God; he
                   had slain the priests of the Lord. Could he expect to be

                   tions from the Lord?" —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 676.

                     In his desperation what did Saul request? Into what experi-

                     "It was not pardon for sin and reconciliation with God, that he
                   sought, but deliverance from his foes. By his own stubbornness
                   and rebellion he had cut himself off from God. There could be
                   no return but by the way of penitence and contrition; but the

                   help from another source."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 676.

                   and his sons? 1 Sam. 28:19.

                     "The pretended visitants from the world of spirits sometimes
                   utter cautions and warnings which prove to be correct.... The
                   fact that they state some truths, and are able at times to foretell

                     Isaiah's message was directed) continues to be practiced even
                     in modern times. Heads of state and officials in governments in
                     various periods of modern history have been known for seeking
                     political advice from spirit mediums.
                         "Spiritualism, which numbers its converts by hundreds of
                     thousands, yea, by millions, which has made its way into scien-
                     tific circles, which has invaded churches, and has found favor in
                     legislative bodies, and even in the courts of kings—this mam-

                     by King Manasseh's promotion of spiritualism and other

                       According to Ellen White, a number of army officers in the
                     U.S. Civil War consulted spirit mediums on military matters.
                     "Very many men in authority, generals and officers, act in con-
                     formity with instructions communicated by spirits. The spirits of
                     devils, professing to be dead warriors and skillful generals,
                     communicate with men in authority and control many of their
                     movements. One general has directions from these spirits to
                     make special moves and is flattered with the hope of success.
                     Another receives directions which differ widely from those
                     given to the first. Sometimes those who follow the directions
                     given obtain a victory, but more frequently they meet with
                     defeat."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 363, 364.

                       Why may we expect rulers and civil officials in the end time
                     to consult spirit mediums? Rev. 16:13, 14.

                        "Satan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive
                     the world. . . . Little by little he has prepared the way for his

          Part 6     What is Satan's purpose in speaking through spirit medi-
     DANGEROUS     ums? Compare his communication with Eve through a
     DECEPTIONS    serpent.

                     "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
                   through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from
                   the simplicity that is in Christ" (2 Cor. 11:3).

                      "When they have been led to believe that the dead actually
                   return to communicate with them, Satan causes those to appear
                   who went into the grave unprepared. They claim to be happy in
                   heaven and even to occupy exalted positions there, and thus the
                   error is widely taught that no difference is made between the
                   righteous and the wicked. . . . The law of God is set aside, the
                   Spirit of grace despised, the blood of the covenant counted an
                   unholy thing. The spirits deny the deity of Christ and place even
                   the Creator on a level with themselves." —The Great Con-
                   troversy, p. 552.
                      "Spiritualism teaches 'that man is the creature of progres-
                   sion; that it is his destiny from his birth to progress, even to
                   eternity, toward the Godhead.' And again: 'Each mind will judge
                   itself and not another.' The judgment will be right, because it is
                   the judgment of self. . . . The throne is within you.' Said a
                    spiritualist teacher: ... 'My fellow men, all were unfallen demi-
                   gods.' And another declares: 'Any just and perfect being is
                   Christ.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 554.

                     What does the apostle Paul state about the way Satan may
                   appear? 2 Cor. 11:13-15.

                      "There are many who shrink with horror from the thought of
                   consulting spirit mediums, but who are attracted by more pleas-
                   ing forms of spiritism. . . . Still others are led astray by the
                   teachings of Christian Science, and by the mysticism of
                   theosophy and other Oriental religions.
                      "The apostles of nearly all forms of spiritism claim to have the
                   power to cure the diseased.... And there are not a few, even in
                   this Christian age, who go to these healers, instead of trusting in
                   the power of the living God and the skill of well-qualified Chris-
                   tian physicians."—Evangelism, p. 606.
                      Since most Christians believe in inherent immortality, their
                   minds are conditioned to accept spiritualism's claims.

      POWER OF THE     Simon Magus?
        MIRACULOUS
                         "Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
                       Christ unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed
                       unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the
                       miracles which he did.... But there was a certain man, called
                       Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and
                       bewitched the people ... : to whom they all gave heed, from
                       the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power
                       of God. And to him they had regard, because that of long time
                       he had bewitched them with sorceries" (Acts 8:5-11).

                          It seems as though the human mind is always dazzled and
                       attracted by any happening which may be out of the ordinary. At
                       times God has enabled His servants to perform miracles. The
                       attention of the people has thereby been secured, their minds
                       made receptive for receiving truth, and God's name honored. At
                       the same time Satan through his agents has likewise wrought
                       miracles or illusions of miracles to sweep the unwary into his
                       deceptions.
                          "Let none cherish the idea that special providences or
                       miraculous manifestations are to be the proof of the genuine-

                         "He [Jesus] knew also that the father had, in his own mind,
                       made conditions concerning his belief in Jesus. Unless his
                       petition should be granted, he would not receive Him as the

                         What effect did the resurrection of Dorcas have on the work

                           "Dorcas had been of great service to the church, and God saw
                       fit to bring her back from the land of the enemy, that her skill and
                       energy might still be a blessing to others, and also that by this
                       manifestation of His power the cause of Christ might be
                       strengthened."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 132.

THINK IT THROUGH         Since both God and Satan can cause miracles to be per-
                       formed, how can I determine whether truth or error is being
                       confirmed through such wonders?

           Part 2   What description of Jesus' ministry is given by the writer of
    THE PURPOSE Acts?
       OF DIVINE
       MIRACLES     "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
                  with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that
                  were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him" (Acts
                  10:38).

                      The miracles of Christ were not wrought to attract attention to
                   Himself, nor to enrich Himself in a monetary way with offerings
                   from the grateful. Rather, the object of each miracle was to
                   bring honor to God, to open doors to broken hearts which
                   would permit grace to enter in a saving way.
                      "In word and in deed the Messiah, during His earthly ministry,
                   was to reveal to mankind the glory of God the Father. Every act
                   of His life, every word spoken, every miracle wrought, was to
                   make known to fallen humanity the infinite love of God."
                   —Prophets and Kings, p. 696.
                      "Christ never worked a miracle except to supply a genuine
                   necessity, and every miracle was of a character to lead the
                   people to the tree of life, whose leaves are for the healing of the
                   nations."—The Desire of Ages, p. 366.
                      "He desires that our dull senses shall be quickened to discern
                   His merciful kindness and to glorify Him for the working of His
                   power. He desires us to recognize Him in His gifts, that they may
                   be, as He intended, a blessing to us. It was to accomplish this
                   purpose that the miracles of Christ were performed ."—The De-
                   sire of Ages, p. 368.

                     What is one purpose for which God performs miracles for
                   His people as He sees fit? Heb. 2:3, 4.

                     What spiritual gifts may at times be entrusted to certain
                   believers? 1 Cor. 12:9, 10, first part. (See also verses 28-30.)

                     True miracles do not result from impetuous demands, but are
                   given as God sees best.
                     "The apostles were not always able to work miracles at will.

                       What three miracles of Moses did the magicians counterfeit

                       "The magicians did not really cause their rods to become
                     serpents; but by magic, aided by the great deceiver, they were
                     able to produce this appearance. It was beyond the power of
                     Satan to change the rods to living serpents. The prince of evil,
                     though possessing all the wisdom and might of an angel fallen,
                     has not power to create, or to give life; this is the prerogative of
                     God alone. But all that was in Satan's power to do, he did; he

                     mission.... The magicians failed to produce the miracle of lice,

Misleading Miracles       LESSON 12                            ❑     Wednesday
                                                                    December 14
          Part 4     Does a fulfilled prediction or a marvelous miracle of healing
    TESTING THE    always prove that a given teaching is from God?
    MIRACULOUS
                     "If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of
                   dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the
                   wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let
                   us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us
                   serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that
                   prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God
                   proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with
                   all your heart and with all your soul" (Deut. 13:1-3).

                      One of the striking facts of our scientific age is the recent
                   interest by all classes of people in the miraculous and the
                   supernatural. Faith healers are popular. Advertised meetings of
                   healing are well attended; some have been televised. Such a
                   climate is preparing the minds of the masses for the final delu-
                   sions of Satan. The question the Christian must ask is not
                   whether a miracle or wonder has truly taken place. Rather, he
                   must ask if the teaching or viewpoint which is being advocated
                   by the miracle worker is in harmony with the Word of God.
                      "The man who makes the working of miracles the test of his
                   faith will find that Satan can, through a species of deceptions,
                   perform wonders that will appear to be genuine miracles."—
                   Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 52.

                     Why will some who profess Christ and who work miracles in
                   His name not be accepted by the Master in the judgment?
                   Matt. 7:21-23.

                     "So closely will the counterfeit resemble the true that it will be
                   impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy
                   Scriptures. By their testimony every statement and every mira-
                   cle must be tested."—The Great Controversy, p. 593.
                     "The light from the Word is shining amid the moral darkness;
                   and the Bible will never be superseded by miraculous
                   manifestations."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 48.
                     "If those through whom cures are performed are disposed, on
                   account of these manifestations, to excuse their neglect of the
                   law of God, and continue in disobedience, though they have
                   power to any and every extent, it does not follow that they have
                   the great power of God. On the contrary, it is the miracle-
                   working power of the great deceiver."—Selected Messages, bk.
                   2, pp. 50, 51.

                   teach doctrine that is contrary to the Bible. (See Matt. 4:6.)

Misleading Miracles          LESSON 12                              ❑   Thursday
                                                                     December 15
             Part 5     Was God's special message which John the Baptist pro-
      MISSION AND     claimed, highlighted, authenticated, or made more believable
          MIRACLE     by miracles?

                         "Many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
                      all things that John spake of this man were true" (John 10:41).

                        The validity of John's message did not rest upon the miracu-
                      lous, but upon its harmony with the Old Testament predictions
                      of the Messiah. In the last preaching of God's final message
                      miracles will be wrought, but its truthfulness must rest upon its
                      agreement with Scripture, not on miracles.
                        "Unbelievers will require them [God's people] to do some
                      miracle, if they believe God's special power is in the church and
                      that they are the chosen people of God.... They should refer the
                      unbelieving to the written, inspired testimony for evidence of
                      their being the loyal people of God and heirs of salvation."—
                      Medical Ministry, p. 15.

                        What instruction is given those Christians who seek physi-
                      cal healing? James 5:14, 15.

                        "The way in which Christ worked was to preach the Word, and
                      to relieve suffering by miraculous works of healing. But I am
                      instructed that we cannot now work in this way, for Satan will
                      exercise his power by working miracles. God's servants today
                      could not work by means of miracles, because spurious works
                      of healing, claiming to be divine, will be wrought.
                        "For this reason the Lord has marked out a way in which His
                      people are to carry forward a work of physical healing, com-
                      bined with the teaching of the Word. Sanitariums are to be
                      established, and with these institutions are to be connected
                      workers who will carry forward genuine medical missionary
                      work."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 54.

                       What lesson does Second Corinthians 12:7-9 teach us? How
                      must the Christian always pray? 1 John 5:14.

                        "Some have asked me, 'Why should we have sanitariums?
                      Why should we not, like Christ, pray for the sick, that they may
                      be healed miraculously?' I have answered,'Suppose we were
                      able ... ; how many would appreciate the healing? Would those
                      who were healed become health reformers, or continue to be
                      health destroyers?' "—Medical Ministry, p. 13.

THINK IT THROUGH        In what ways may education in healthful living be more vital
                      to long-term happiness than a miracle of healing?

Misleading Miracles        LESSON 12                                 ❑ Friday
                                                                   December 16
          Part 6     For what purpose only should a Christian desire the
   MIRACLES AND    genuine gift of tongues?
       TONGUES
                     "Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
                   unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh
                   shall be a barbarian unto me. Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are
                   zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edify-
                   ing of the church" (1 Cor. 14:11, 12).

                      Closely allied to the great emphasis today on faith healing is a
                   kindred emphasis on glossolalia or speaking in tongues. In fact,
                   the two are made prominent in the current charismatic move-
                   ment. Glossolalia is not a language; rather it consists of strings
                   of unintelligable sounds understood by neither the speaker nor
                   the listener. It provides an ecstatic, semitrancelike experience
                   for the participant, but the gospel is not thereby transmitted to
                   others.
                      Writing about some Sabbath keepers who became involved in
                   a tongues experience in the 1850s, Ellen White identified its
                   source: "Some of these persons have exercises which they call
                   gifts and say that the Lord has placed them in the church. They
                   have an unmeaning gibberish which they call the unknown
                   tongue, which is unknown not only by man but by the Lord and
                   all heaven. Such gifts are manufactured by men and women,
                   aided by the great deceiver."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 412.

                     What are some of the spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit
                   bestows on believers as He chooses? 1 Cor. 12:1-11.

                     Does the Bible teach that every one must receive the gift of
                   tongues as evidence that he has been saved? 1 Cor. 12:27-31.

                      According to the clearest record of this phenomenon, what
                   Is the genuine gift of tongues? For what purpose was it given
                   at Pentecost? With what result? Acts 2:1.11, 37-41.

                     "This diversity of languages would have been a great hin-
                   drance to the proclamation of the gospel; God therefore in a
                   miraculous manner supplied the deficiency of the apostles....
                   They could now proclaim the truths of the gospel abroad,
                   speaking with accuracy the languages of those for whom they
                   were laboring."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 39, 40.

THINK IT THROUGH     An experience is important. How can I test my experience to
                   know whether it Is genuine or not? (See "Selected Mes-
                   sages," bk. 1, p. 43.)

             Part 1   What promise did God make to the nation of Israel concern-
      DISOBEDIENCE ing adequate rain? What were the conditions?
      AND DROUGHT
                      "It shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my
                    commandments which I command you this day, to love the
                    Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
                    your soul, that I will give you the rain of your land in his due
                    season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest
                    gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil" (Deut. 11:13,
                    14).

                        The "first" or "early" rains falling in late October or in
                      November were light, but sufficient to enable the Israelite to
                      plow and sow his fields. Heavy rains came in the end of De-
                      cember and January. The latter rains fell in March and April,
                      ripening the harvest. If either of the early or latter rains—or
                      both—failed, crop failure resulted and famine conditions en-
                      sued.

                        What did God forewarn the nation He would do if it turned
                      from allegiance to Him? Deut. 11:16, 17.

                        What was God's purpose In withholding the rains from the
                      land of Israel? Amos 4:6-8. (Compare Jer. 5:24, 25.)

                        "As the 'whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain to-
                     gether' ... , the heart of the infinite Father is pained in sympathy.
                     Our world is a vast lazar house, a scene of misery that we dare
                     not allow even our thoughts to dwell upon. Did we realize it as it
                     is, the burden would be too terrible. Yet God feels it all."—
                     Education, pp. 263, 264.

                       What extensive drought led the nation of Israel, at least in
                     part, to repent of their sins? 1 Kings 17:1. (Compare James
                     5:17, 18.)

                       "For stricken Israel there was but one remedy—a turning
                     away from the sins that had brought upon them the chastening
                     hand of the Almighty, and a turning to the Lord with full purpose
                     of heart.... It was to bring to pass this blessed result that God
                     continued to withhold from them the dew and the rain until a
                     decided reformation should take place."—Prophets and Kings,

                     What terrible plague and other calamities had shaken the
                   nation to feel its spiritual need? Joel 1:1-4, 6, 7, 12, 17-20.
                   (Compare Deut. 28:15, 38, 42.)

                     Through the centuries great swarms of locusts have plagued
                   mankind in different areas of the world. A ton of locusts—just a
                   portion of a swarm—will consume in a day as much as ten
                   elephants or 250 people can eat. The following eyewitness ac-
                   count gives an idea of the devastation of such a plague:
                     "We had a famine in the 2d year of the war [1915].... The sky
                   was darkened by the gigantic swarms of locusts which covered
                   the whole country, and neither sun nor moon could be seen. All
                   of Palestine was transformed into a desert within a few days. All
                   trees, from their tops to the ground, including the bark, were
                   eaten up clean; our vegetable gardens . . . disappeared as by
                   magic. The following spring there crept forth from hundreds of
                   billions of eggs the new brood, which consumed the little that
                   had been left. The result was a terrific famine." —SDA Bible
                   Dictionary, art., "Locust," p. 658.

                     Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, what warning did the
                   prophet see in these natural calamities? Joel 1:15.

                     The term "day of the Lord" is a common expression of the
                   prophets. The phrase indicates a time of divine judgment. Joel
                   saw in the terrible natural calamities a divine warning of a day of
                   retribution on Judah. If Joel prophesied in the seventh century
                   BC, the "day of the Lord" of which he wrote was the Babylonian
                   invasions and captivity.
                     Each local, historical "day of the Lord" in the days of the
                   prophets may be seen as a type of the ultimate day of the Lord.
                   (See 1 Thess. 5:1-4.) Thus we may see in today's ever-increasing
                   natural calamities the approaching of the return of Christ.

                    the sun, and the latter event may be dated in A.D. 1780... , this
                    earthquake has been identified with the Lisbon quake on Nov. 1,

                       What important events were marked by the occurrence of
                     earthquakes? Matt. 27:51, 52; 28:2-4.

                      Continuing destructive earthquakes in the time of the end
                    indicate the tremendous forces locked within the earth. When
                    will they finally convulse and shatter the planet? Rev. 16:17,

                       Of this time Ellen White writes: "The mountains shake like a
                    reed in the wind, and ragged rocks are scattered on every side.
                    There is a roar as of a coming tempest. The sea is lashed into
                    fury. There is heard the shriek of a hurricane like the voice of
                    demons upon a mission of destruction. The whole earth heaves
                    and swells like the waves of the sea. Its surface is breaking up.
                    Its very foundations seem to be giving way. Mountain chains are
                    sinking. Inhabited islands disappear. The seaports that have
                    become like Sodom for wickedness are swallowed up by the
                    angry waters."—The Great Controversy, p. 637.

Natural Calamities     LESSON 13                              ❑    Wednesday
                                                                  December 21
         Part 4    In addition to civil strife and earthquakes, what other kind of
       FAMINES disaster would be more widespread as the world approached
                its end according to Jesus?

                    "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
                  kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and
                  there shall be famines and troubles" (Mark 13:8).

                     Dearths or famines occur when crops fail or food cannot be
                  shipped to dependent areas. Wars, floods, extensive droughts,
                  or insects are the chief culprits in causing famine conditions.
                  Probably the worst famines in recorded history have come in
                  the "time of the end." Nine million Chinese died in the famine of
                  1877-1879; another million in a 1902 famine. A million persons
                  died in India in the famine of 1863; a million more in 1900. The
                  most widespread shortage of food occurred in Europe and Asia
                  after World War 11. And famines continue to press the popula-
                  tions of large areas of the globe. A belt of hunger encircles the
                  earth on either side of the equator in which two and one-half
                  billion people live, 60 percent of which are malnourished, 20
                  percent starving. Because of crop failures even large nations
                  have had to import foodstuffs. Although various nations share
                  food products with less fortunate lands, it was openly reported
                  in the U.S. press (1974) that North American food reserves
                  available for emergencies were down to 27 days of world con-
                  sumption.

                    What gracious promises are made by the Creator to His
                  people with regard to food? Matt. 6:25, 26, 31-33; Isa. 33:16.

                     Another source of great concern to world leaders is the ever-
                  increasing population—approximately 200,000 new persons
                  per day, or some 75 million per year. At present rates the popula-
                  tion of 4 billion is expected nearly to double by the end of the
                  century. Recurrent famine conditions aggravate the ever-
                  increasing need for more food. In spite of man's scientific
                  achievements, it would appear that he is approaching bank-
                  ruptcy in this area as in others.

                    In the famine years of Elijah's time how did God care for the
                  needs of the prophet? 1 Kings 17:3-7, 9-16.

                    "Though it [Christ's] is a spiritual kingdom, fear not that your
                  needs for this life will be uncared-for. If you give yourself to
                  God's service, He who has all power in heaven and earth will
                  provide for your needs."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-

                                                                   December 22
           Part 5     Whom do the 24 elders state will be brought to account and
   POLLUTION AND    destroyed at the close of human probation? Why?
  ACCOUNTABILITY
                      "The nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the
                    time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou
                    shouldest give reward unto thy servants . . . ; and shouldest
                    destroy them which destroy the earth" (Rev. 11:18).

                       The late Albert Schweitzer once said, "Man has lost the
                    capacity to foresee and to forestall. He will end by destroying
                    the earth." Although the Bible declares plainly that the second
                    advent of Christ will end this age, it is a harrowing fact of
                    modern life that man is capable of destroying the earth.
                       Since the invention and detonation of an atom bomb in the
                    1940s, greater and more deadly nuclear armament has been
                    devised. Some six nations presently have atomic weapons, but
                    nuclear technology and resources are such today that any na-
                    tion could—given sufficient time—manufacture atomic bombs.
                    Man is now capable, were he to enter into an all-out nuclear
                    warfare, literally to destroy civilization and life on the earth.
                       Modern man is also in danger of perishing by the pollution of
                    his own environment. The wastes of cities and industries are
                    befouling earth's rivers and lakes, destroying the wildlife and
                    upsetting the balance of nature. Pesticides often destroy animal
                    life and harm man himself. The fumes of automobiles and fac-
                    tories are poisoning the atmosphere.

                      Who is the true owner of the earth and its resources? Ps.
                    24:1.

                     What did God entrust to man? For what purpose? Ps. 115:16;
                    Gen. 1:26, 28.

                      God gave man dominion over the earth and its creatures.
                    Thus he has authorization to explore, to study, and to utilize the
                    resources of the natural world for the benefit of human and
                    animal life, thereby bringing glory to the Creator. But God never
                    intended man to exploit nature for selfish ends or to his own
                    destruction. The enormous problems of pollution, together with
                    the inventions of lethal forces capable of global destruction,
                    indicate the rapid approach of the hour when man must give an
                    account of his stewardship before the Judge of all the earth.

                    ing of my community? Do I have a responsibility In this area?

    PESTILENCES
                    "Great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
                  and pestilences" (Luke 21:11).

                      In spite of modern medical knowledge, from time to time
                   various parts of the habitable globe have been terribly ravaged
                   by disease and pestilence. Twenty million died in the world
                   epidemic of influenza (1918-1919) both from the disease and
                   from ensuing complications. Wars, earthquakes, and famines
                   create conditions for the outbreak of disease. Physically
                   weakened, refugees from these disasters are often decimated
                   by epidemics of typhus, cholera, diphtheria, and dysentery.
                   Some devastating diseases seem to strike an area without warn-
                   ing; others, such as venereal disease, are of epidemic propor-
                   tions due to man's pursuit of sensual pleasure.

                     Who is attempting to control this earth and constantly seeks
                   the destruction of its inhabitants? Eph. 2:2.

                     "Even now he [Satan] is at work. In accidents and calamities
                   by sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in fierce tornadoes
                   and terrific hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal
                   waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand
                   forms, Satan is exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripen-
                   ing harvest, and famine and distress follow. He imparts to the air
                   a deadly taint, and thousands perish by the pestilence. These
                   visitations are to become more and more frequent and disas-
                   trous."—The Great Controversy, pp. 589, 590.

                     What promise did God make to His people anciently that is
                   still valid today? Ex. 15:26. If disobedient, what could they
                   expect? Deut. 28:15, 21, 60, 61.

                      "We ask to be kept from the pestilence that walketh in dark-
                   ness, that is stalking with such power through the world; we are
                   then to cooperate with God, observing the laws of health and
                   life. Having done all that we possibly can, we are to keep asking

 the rising tide of a thousand global

Band-Aid would be if applied to a
mortally wounded soldier! The signs
of change and decay which surround
us call our attention to the fact that the
end of this present age is at hand.
    But the signs signify more than the
demise of a world whose disease is
incurable. Collectively they may be
compared to the voice announcing the
train's arrival at the station just before
it comes within view of the waiting
passengers.

          Part 1     How did Jesus say His people should react when they see
 THE UPLOOK AND    the signs of His coming?
     REDEMPTION
                     "When these things begin to come to pass, then look up,
                   and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh"
                   (Luke 21:28).

                     The inhabitants of the world will grow more perplexed as
                   problems multiply. The outlook robs men of hope. But for the
                   Christian the uplook is bright. Jesus is coming again, and this
                   age of sin and suffering is about to end! There are better things
                   ahead!
                     "Every report of calamity by sea or land is a testimony to the
                   fact that the end of all things is at hand. Wars and rumors of war
                   declare it. Is there a Christian whose pulse does not beat with
                   quickened action as he anticipates the great events opening
                   before us?"—Evangelism, p. 219.

                     How does Paul picture the condition of the physical earth
                   and God's people as they await their change? Rom. 8:22, 23.
                   (See also Heb. 1:10, 11.)

                     "Paul pictures the creation in the pangs of childbirth, as it
                   looks forward to joyful deliverance. . . .
                     " ... [The Christian] senses that the pangs of a world in travail
                   point forward to a time of deliverance, when there shall be 'new
                   heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.' "
                   —SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 571.
                     In a sense, the "time of the end" is the birth-pang period of the
                   earth which will grow more intense until the appearance of
                   Christ in glory.

                     In spite of the trials a Christian may have, upon what does
                   he rivet his faith and confidence? 2 Cor. 4:16-18.

                      "These trials of life are God's workmen to remove the im-
                   purities, infirmities, and roughness from our characters.... But
                   as we pass through these trials, as the fires of affliction kindle
                   upon us, we must not keep the eye on the fire which is seen, but
                   let the eye of faith fasten upon the things unseen, the eternal
                   inheritance, the immortal life, the eternal weight of glory; and
                   while we do this the fire will not consume us, but only remove
                   the dross, and we shall come forth seven times purified, bearing
                   the impress of the Divine."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 706, 707.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it spiritually healthier to contemplate the eternal
                   realities than to focus on present troubles? Is this an escape
                   from reality, or good sense?

          Part 2   As the Christian contemplates the grace of God and the
     THE BLESSED blessed hope of Christ's return, how is he prompted to live?
           HOPE
                    "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
                 all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
                 lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
                 present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
                 appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ"
                 (Titus 2:11-13).

                      "The blessed hope of the second appearing of Christ, with its
                   solemn realities, needs to be often presented to the people.
                   Looking for the soon appearing of our Lord will lead us to
                   regard earthly things as emptiness and nothingness." —Tes-
                   timonies, vol. 6, p. 406.

                     Of what should no Adventist be ignorant? How should he
                   react to the signs of this age? 1 Thess. 5:1-9; Rom. 13:11-14.

                     "We are not to be sad, but cheerful, and we are to keep the
                   Lord Jesus ever before us. He is soon coming, and we must be
                   ready and waiting for His appearing. Oh, how glorious it will be
                   to see Him and be welcomed as His redeemed ones! Long have
                   we waited, but our hope is not to grow dim. If we can but see the
                   King in His beauty we shall be forever blessed. I feel as if I must
                   cry aloud: 'Homeward bound!' We are nearing the time when
                   Christ will come in power and great glory to take His ransomed
                   ones to their eternal home."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 253.

                     When Christ returns, what will be one of the great joys of the
                   redeemed who have been colaborers with Him? 1 Thess.
                   2:19, 20.

                      "Every impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness
                   and to God is noted in the books of heaven, and in the day of
                   God everyone who has given himself as an instrument for the

             Part 3    How vital to the Christian faith is the doctrine of the resur-
      RESURRECTION rection?
       AND REUNION
                       "If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ
                    be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then
                    they also which are fallen asleep In Christ are perished"
                    (1 Cor. 15:16-18).

                         Death is an enemy, the fruitage of sin (1 Cor. 15:26; Rom.
                      5:12). It is no respecter of persons. There is an empty cradle, a
                      vacant chair, a missing loved one in most homes. One of the
                      most precious truths of Scripture is its truth about the resurrec-
                      tion. "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
                      alive" (1 Cor. 15:22). "Because I live," said Jesus, "ye shall live
                      also" (John 14:19).

                        What did Jesus promise to those who believe in Him should
                      they die? John 6:40.

                        "Look to Jesus. Trust in Jesus, whether you live or die. He is
                      your Redeemer. He is our Life-giver. If you fall asleep in Jesus He
                      will bring you forth from the grave to a glorious immortality. May
                      He give you peace and comfort and hope and joy from
                      henceforth."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 254.

                        At what great event will the righteous dead of all ages be
                      resurrected and united with the last living generation of God's
                      people? 1 Thess. 4:16-18.

                         "Amid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning, and the
                      roar of thunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the
                      sleeping saints. He looks upon the graves of the righteous, then,
                      raising His hands to heaven, He cries: 'Awake, awake, awake, ye
                      that sleep in the dust, and arise!' Throughout the length and
                      breadth of the earth the dead shall hear that voice, and they that
                      hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with the tread of
                      the exceeding great army of every nation, kindred, tongue, and
                      people. From the prison house of death they come, clothed with
                      immortal glory, crying, '0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave,
                      where is thy victory?' 1 Corinthians 15:55. And the living righ-

          Part 4    When and in what manner will the gift of Immortality be
    IMMORTALITY bestowed upon the redeemed?
      BESTOWED
                    "Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
                 shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
                 the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
                 be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this
                 corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put
                 on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on
                 incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
                 then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death
                 is swallowed up in victory" (1 Cor. 15:51-54).

                     The resurrection is a strong hope to the Christian, but as
                   mortals we cannot fathom the endlessness of an immortal exis-
                   tence! Here "we spend our years as a tale that is told," (Ps. 90:9),
                   but at the resurrection we will begin to live a life that will never
                   end.
                     "Then the living saints and the risen ones raised their voices
                   in a long, transporting shout of victory. Those bodies that had
                   gone down into the grave bearing the marks of disease and
                   death came up in immortal health and vigor. The living saints
                   are changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and caught
                   up with the risen ones, and together they meet their Lord in the
                   air. Oh, what a glorious meeting! Friends whom death had
                   separated were united, never more to part."— Early Writings, p.
                   287.

                     Our immortal bodies will be like whose glorified body? Phil.

                     "The redeemed are not only to possess Christ's character but
                   also to be clothed in an immortal body similar to that possessed
                   by Jesus since His resurrection.. . . This transformation com-
                   pletes the redemptive work. . . . The Christian is completely

                     How does Paul explain the nature of the immortal body? Is
                   personal identity lost? 1 Cor. 15:35-38, 42-44, 50, 53.

                     "Our personal identity is preserved in the resurrection,
                   though not the same particles of matter or material substance
                   as went into the grave... .
                     " ... The planted kernel decays, but there comes forth a new
                   kernel.... A much finer material will compose the human body,
                   for it is a new creation, a new birth."—Ellen G. White Com-

                        What was God's original purpose for the earth? Isa. 45:18.

                          "The earth originally given to man as his kingdom, betrayed
                      by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty
                      foe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemption. All
                      that was lost by sin has been restored. [Isa. 45:18 quoted] .
                      God's original purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled as
                      it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed. 'The righteous
                      shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.' Psalm

                         "There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and beside
                      them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared

Human Solutions-or the Saviour?               LESSON 14              ❑ Friday
                                                                   December 30
         Part 6  What request did Jesus make of the Father a short time
NOTHING BETWEEN before His crucifixion?

                     "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hest given me, be
                   with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou
                   hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of
                   the world" (John 17:24).

                      Man was made in the image of God so that he might have
                   communion and fellowship with his Maker. "Face-to-face,
                   heart-to-heart communion with his Maker was his [Adam's]
                   high privilege."—Education, p. 15. By causing man to join him
                   in sinful rebellion against God, Satan had thought to estrange
                   man from his Sovereign forever. But, through the carrying out
                   of the plan of salvation, that blessed communion will be fully
                   restored. The bond between God and the redeemed will be, in a
                   sense, even closer than it was originally, for the humanity of
                   Jesus links His earthly "brethren" to the divine center of all.

                     Although the Deity dwells in such glory as to be unap-
                   proachable by sinful men (1 Tim. 6:16), how will it be in the new
                   earth? Rev. 22:3, 4.

                      "The people of God are privileged to hold open communion
                   with the Father and the Son. 'Now we see through a glass,
                   darkly.' 1 Corinthians 13:12. We behold the image of God re-
                   flected, as in a mirror, in the works of nature and in His dealings
                   with men; but then we shall see Him face to face, without a
                   dimming veil between. We shall stand in His presence and
                   behold the glory of His countenance."—The Great Controversy,
                   pp. 676, 677.

                     What beings will there be in the ages of eternity with whom
                   the redeemed can have fellowship? Rev. 7:9-12.

                      "There the redeemed shall know, even as also they are
                   known. The loves and sympathies which God Himself has
                   planted in the soul shall there find truest and sweetest exercise.
                   The pure communion with holy beings, the harmonious social
                   life with the blessed angels and with the faithful ones of all ages
                   who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood
                   of the Lamb, the sacred ties that bind together 'the whole family
                   in heaven and earth' (Ephesians 3:15)—these help to constitute
                   the happiness of the redeemed."—The Great Controversy, p.
                   677.

                   Father and the Son in the age to come?
