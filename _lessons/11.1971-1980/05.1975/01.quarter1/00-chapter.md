         Dear Fellow Sabbath School Member:

         Thank you for the thirteenth Sabbath offering overflow to Southern Asia
         in third quarter, 1972. This provided expansion for facilities at the
         Burma Union Seminary, a new dormitory for boys at the Kottarakara High
         School in South India, and improvement of administration buildings and
         dormitories at the Roorkee School in North India.

         At the present our needs are sky-rocketing while the value of our money
         is dropping; therefore we appeal for your support again.

         Two-thirds of the overflow will go to Spicer Memorial College. In 1942,
         Spicer Memorial College was designed for 200 students. Today over 1,000
         students are on campus. Under God's providence the College has been able
         to adhere to Adventist educational philosophy and its graduates have
         been accepted into universities in various parts of the world. Circum-
         stances now indicate, however, that we should obtain official government
         recognition. Providentially, the way is opening for us to obtain this
         favor. This calls for: (1) expansion of library facilities, (2) a new
         science complex, and (3) demonstration schools for both secondary and
         primary divisions.

         The other one-third of the offering will be applied toward the purchase
         of land on which to build churches for our rapidly growing constituency.
         Ten years ago, in the Kerala section, there was a membership of just over
         4,000. Today it exceeds 12,000--a growth of over 3007,. Southern Asia
         has today three such sections with membership in excess of ten thousand.
         Church buildings continue to be our urgent need in many places.

         May we urge you to give liberally while you can, and your money still re-
         tains value. And, thank you, again.


                  incerely yours,

      THE COVER

      The nail-wounded hand is a readily recognized symbol of Jesus,
      emphasizing especially His self-sacrificing love. The heavenward
      pointing finger represents the purpose of Christ's whole earthly
      life to tell the world what God is really like.


1—AQT-1-75
                               WHAT IS "DAYBREAK"?

    A new series of Adult Sabbath School Lessons entitled "DaybVeak" begins
with this issue. The series grows out of the three angels' messages of Revela-
tion 14. The lessons for each quarter will be on a subject which is included in
the three angels' messages, but they will not be a study of the passage in
Revelation which records the three messages. Ellen G. White has stated
regarding these messages:
    "The theme of greatest importance is the third angel's message embracing
the messages of the first and second angels. All should under'Stand the truths
contained in these messages and demonstrate them in the daily life, for this is
essential to salvation. We shall have to study earnestly, prayerfully, in order to
understand these grand truths; and our power to learn and comprehend will
be taxed to the utmost."—Evangelism, page 196.
    But why have a series of lessons? There are two main reasons. First, to
assure balance in the lessons over an extended period of time so that a given
topic is studied neither too few nor too many times. Second, to provide a
connection between one quarter's lessons and the next. Thus the lessons for
each quarter will be related to those of the preceding quarter and to those of
the following quarter. This sequence of subjects will provide, as the series ad-
vances, a constantly growing base on which each member may build his study
in any current quarter.
    While the "Daybreak Series" has been planned with balance and sequence,
provision has also been made for flexibility. Thus, if circumstances make it
desirable, the sequence of the lessons could be changed or a new subject
introduced, but prepared in such a way as to be compatible with the overall
plan.

   The plan for the series is based on six areas of study:
       1. Revelation of God              4. Worship of the Creator
       2. God and man                    5. Worldwide mission
       3. The Christian life             6. Last-day prophecy

    Each of these areas will be infused with the gospel. These six areas will
not be entirely discrete, as some overlapping between subjects is nearly
unavoidable. These areas may be regarded as six peaks or high points of the,
message. Thus the other five areas may be viewed from any one of the six.
    This present subject—"God Is Like This—"—comes under the heading of
area 1, Revelation of God. Next quarter the lessons will come under the head-
ing of God and man, and so on consecutively for six quarters. Every seventh
quarter during the series the lessons will return to area 1 and thus begin another
round of study in the same areas as the previous six quarters, but on new
themes.
    The name, "Daybreak," points to the second advent of Jesus. The goal of
these lessons is to encourage and aid Sabbath School members to prepare to
Meet Jesus, and hasten His appearing. "Daybreak" will help to remind us of
this goal as we study each lesson.
    May we suggest that at the beginning of the "Daybreak Series" is a good
time for a renewal of your daily study pledge.
GOD 15 LIKE THIS—


INTRODUCTION
    It may seem to people that God is distant and unknowable. They
don't see Him, and they don't think they have personally heard from
Him. The Adventist person's whole religious life stems from his
belief that, while God can't be seen, He is near and has been heard
from. He believes that since the Fall, God has communicated with
people through nature, prophets, and special providences. These
avenues conveyed to people a knowledge of God, but always one
step removed from actually seeing God. One could see His products
in nature, or His mighty acts in emergency situations, or hear His
words proclaimed by a prophet, or see symbols that represented
His acts of salvation for His earthly children. What more could man
hope for? He could hope to see God Himself. Nature, tarnished by
sin, gave only a partial testimony about God; words, plagued by
ambiguity, gave an equivocal testimony; and symbols, subject to
misinterpretation and perversion of purpose soon lost their meaning.
    But why is it important to hear from God? For the same reason
that it is important to find directions for use enclosed with a product
you purchase.
    The manufacturer of the product, especially if the product is
complex, provides directions for use. These directions are necessary
in order to prevent injury to the user or damage to the product
and to assure that the buyer has the right product to fit his need.
 This world, its people, and other life forms are God's products. How
shall people, at once products and users, know how to use what
God has made, especially themselves—especially when someone
else has distributed directions for use destructive to the user and
 libelous to the Maker? So we need• to hear from the Maker. We
need to know that He is to be trusted in the directions He gives.
    Even more importantly we need to know the nature of His char-
 acter because the directions for human character grow out of the
 divine character; and as one by knowing God learns to trust God,
 his confidence in Him prompts consent to God's character as the
 base of his own life-style. So God Himself came to earth as Jesus
 of Nazareth in order that people could become acquainted with
 the unseen Father through the visible Jesus. Ellen G. White wrote:
 "In every circumstance, however trivial, he [Jesus] represented the
 Father."—Review and Herald, April 14, 1896.
     The entire life of Jesus—His teachings, miracles, incidents, and
 personal experiences—is a reflection to the world that "God is like
 this."

       "As a personal being, God has revealed Himself in
    His Son. . .
       "Christ, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling
    splendor of His divinity and came to live as a man among
    men, that they might, without being consumed, become
    acquainted with their Creator. . . .
       "Christ came to teach human beings what God desires
    them to know. . . .
       "He [God] sent His Son into the world to manifest, so
     far as could be endured by human sight, the nature and
    the attributes of the invisible God."

   "No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the
Father, he has made him known." John 1:18, RSV.

   God revealed Himself to men in Old Testament times. Reference is made
to this revelation in Hebrews 1:1. He revealed Himself first of all to Adam and
then to a succession of prophets who spoke and later wrote God's messages. He
came down on Mount Sinai in majesty in the presence of the congregation of
Israel.
   The tabernacle was established to reveal in some detail how God related
Himself to man. But all of these revelations had one weakness. They did not
show in human experience what God is like. Words and other symbols could
reveal many things about God, but only a living person could communicate the

experience of shaping life in a sinful world according to the character of God.
Ellen G. White wrote.
    "No verbal description could reveal God to the world. Through a life of
purity, a life of perfect trust and submission to the will of God, a life of humilia-
tion such as even the highest seraph in heaven would have shrunk from, God
Himself must be revealed to humanity. In order to do this, our Saviour clothed
His divinity with humanity. He employed the human faculties, for only by adopt-
ing these could He be comprehended by humanity. Only humanity could reach
humanity. He lived out the character of God through the human body which
God had prepared for Him. He blessed the world by living out in human flesh
the life of God, thus showing that He had the power to unite humanity to
divinity."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 924.
    "All that man needs to know or can know of God has been revealed in the
life and character of His Son....
    "Taking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with humanity and at
the same time to reveal our heavenly Father to sinful human beings. He was in
all things made like unto His brethren. He became flesh, even as we are. He
was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained by food and refreshed by
sleep. He shared the lot of men, and yet He was the blameless Son of God. He
was a stranger and a sojourner on the earth—in the world, but not of the
world; tempted and tried as men and women today are tempted and tried, yet
living a life free from sin."—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 286.

               Part 1    "Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with
      JESUS REVEALED you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath
                      seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then,
          THE FATHER Shew us the Father?" John 14:9.

                           "Is it possible, Christ said, that after‘ walking with Me, hear-
                       ing My words, seeing the miracle of feeding the five thousand,
                       of healing the sick of the dread disease leprosy, of bringing
                       the dead to life, of raising Lazarus, who was a prey to death,
                       whose body had indeed seen corruption, you do not know Me?
                       Is it possible that you do not discern the Father in the works
                       that He does by Me? ...
                           "Christ emphatically impressed upon them the fact that
                       they could see the Father by faith alone. God cannot be seen
                       in external form by any human being. Christ alone can repre-

                       1142.
                           In the introduction to his gospel what relationship does
                       the apostle John show exists between God and Jesus? John
                       1:1-3, 14.
                          "What speech is to thought, so is Christ to the invisible
                       Father. . . . He made known in His words, His character, His
                       power and majesty, the nature and attributes of God. Divinity
                       flashed through humanity in softening, subduing light. He was
                       the embodiment of the law of God, which is the transcript of
                       His character."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

                          In what way does the Word becoming flesh correspond to
                       the Old Testament prophecy quoted by the evangelist Mat-
                       thew? Matt. 1:23; cf. Isa. 7:14.
                          How has the unseen God become known to men? John

    THINK IT THROUGH      Of what importance, if any, is Christ's incarnation to the
                       restoration of man to his pristine perfection?
                          "The Saviour was deeply anxious for His disciples to under-
                       stand for what purpose His divinity was united to humanity. He
                       came to the world to display the glory of God, that man might
                       be uplifted by its restoring power. God was manifested in
                       Him that He might be manifested in them. Jesus revealed no
                       qualities, and exercised no powers, that men may not have
                       through faith in Him. His perfect humanity is that which all
                       His followers may possess, if they will be in subjection to
                       God as He was."—The Desire of Ages, page 664.

           Part 2    "Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily,
       HIS DEEDS I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what
                  he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these
    PROMPTED BY also doeth the Son likewise." John 5:19.
      HIS FATHER     See also John 5:30.
                       "My authority, He [Jesus] said, for doing the work of which
                    you accuse Me, is that I am the Son of God, one with Him in
                    nature, in will, and in purpose. . . . The Son of God was sur-
                    rendered to the Father's will, and dependent upon His power.
                    So utterly was Christ emptied of self that He made no plans
                    for Himself. He accepted God's plans for Him, and day by day
                    the Father unfolded His plans. So should we depend upon
                    God, that our lives may be the simple outworking of His will."
                    —The Desire of Ages, page 208.
                        What was to be the attitude of Jesus toward His Father's
                    will as foreseen prophetically by the psalmist? Ps. 40:8. How
                    does the prophet Isaiah express the same idea in a servant
                    song? Isa. 50:4, 5.
                       The Living Bible paraphrases part of Isaiah 50:4, 5 this
                    way: "Morning by morning he wakens me and opens my un-
                    derstanding to his will. The Lord God has spoken to me and I
                    have listened; I do not rebel nor turn away."
 THINK IT THROUGH       What is my attitude toward God's expressed will in His
                    Word and the promptings of His Holy Spirit to me personally?
                    "God's way is always the right and the prudent way. He
                 always brings honor to His name. Man's only security against
                 rash, ambitious movements is to keep the heart in harmony
                 with Christ Jesus. Man's wisdom is untrustworthy. Man is
                 fickle, filled with self-esteem, pride, and selfishness. Let the
                 workers doing God's service trust wholly in the Lord."—Testi-

                    "The strength of those who love and serve Him will be re-
                 newed day by day. His understanding will be placed at their
                 service, that they may not err in the carrying out of His pur-
                 poses."—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 11.

                 of life, that we may not, by reckless movements, place our-
                 selves in trial. We are not to plunge into difficulties, neglecting
                 the means God has provided, and misusing the faculties He
                 has given us. Christ's workers are to obey His instructions
                 implicitly. The work is God's, and if we would bless others
                 His plans must be followed. Self cannot be made a center;
                 self can receive no honor. If we plan according to our own
                 ideas, the Lord will leave us to our own mistakes. But when,
                 after following His directions, we are brought into strait places,
                 He will deliver us."—The Desire of Ages, page 369.

             Part 3      What was the source of Jesus' words?
        HIS WORDS
      PROMPTED BY       "For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which
                      sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say,
        HIS FATHER
                      and what I should speak." John 12:49.

                         See also John 3:34; 8:26, 28.
                         Today's English Version translates John 12:49: "The Father
                      who sent me has commanded me what I must say and speak."
                         From John 3:34 it is clear that it was through the Holy Spirit
                      that Jesus was given the appropriate words to speak on each
                      particular occasion. God is likewise eager to guide you and
                      me in our activities, and even in our speech.
                         "We are to be laborers together with the heavenly angels
                      in presenting Jesus to the world. With almost impatient eager-
                      ness the angels wait for our co-operation; for man must be the
                      channel to communicate with man. And when we give ourselves
                      to Christ in wholehearted devotion, angels rejoice that they
                      may speak through our voices to reveal God's love."—The
                      Desire of Ages, page 297.

                         Note how Jesus, through this guidance, was able to speak
                      apt words in difficult situations. Matt. 21:23-27; 22:15-22;
                      John 8:1-11; cf. Isa. 50:4.

 THINK IT THROUGH        How do you know that God was not partial to Jesus in
                      guiding Him more minutely than He is willing to guide you
                      and me?


                         "When you rise in the morning, do you feel your helplessness
                      and your need of strength from God? and do you humbly,
                      heartily make known your wants to your heavenly Father? If
                      so, angels mark your prayers, and if these prayers have not
                      gone forth out of feigned lips, when you are in danger of un-
                      consciously doing wrong and exerting an influence which will
                      lead others to do wrong, your guardian angel will be by your
                      side, prompting you to a better course, choosing your words

    JESUS DID HIS but the will of him that sent me." John 6:38.
   FATHER'S WILL    See also John 4:34; 8:29.
                       Today's English Version renders John 4:34: "'My food,'
                    Jesus said to them, 'is to obey the will of him who sent me
                    and finish the work he gave me to do.' "
                       "Jesus' complete submission to His Father is an assurance
                    to the believer that all that Jesus does for him has its source
                    in the loving heart of God. Christ's words here clearly dem-
                    onstrate the falsity of the opinion that God is angry with man
                    and that salvation for sinners has its basis in Christ's having
                    appeased the Father's wrath. Rather, Jesus' life of ministry
                    and sacrificial death for man were expressions of His Father's
                    love."—SDA Bible Commentary, on John 6:38.
                        From whom did the Jewish contemporaries of Jesus seek
                    honor and approval, and to whom was Jesus on the other
                    hand supremely loyal? John 5:41-44.
                       Phillips translates John 5:41 in this way: "Men's approval
                    or disapproval means nothing to me, but I can tell you that you
                    have none of the love of God in your hearts."
                        "The ultimate success of Jesus' work did not depend upon
                    whether the Jewish leaders of His day recognized Him as the
                    Messiah. The purposes of His message and His ministry tran-
                    scended any approbation that human beings could give. His
                    ultimate aim was the conquest of the kingdom of evil for the
                    glory of God."—SDA Bible Commentary, on John 5:41.
                         What words had the psalmist prophetically put in the
                    mouth of Jesus, expressing the source of His joy and pleasure?
                    Ps. 40:8.
                        "The one law of His [Jesus'] life was the Father's will. In the
                    visit to the temple in His boyhood, He had said to Mary, 'Wist
                    ye not that I must be about My Father's business?' Luke 2:49."

 THINK IT THROUGH      How may I be honored by God? John 12:26.
                        "If you would, as a church, secure the rich blessing of
                    God, you must individually make Him first and last and best
                    in every thought, plan, and work. Obedience to God is the
                    first duty of the Christian. A humble mind and a grateful
                    heart will elevate us above petty trials and real difficulties.
                    The less earnest, energetic, and vigilant we are in the service
                    of the Master, the more will the mind dwell upon self, magnify-

     THE SCRIPTURES
                            See also verses 7, 10.
                            As a man, Jesus did not follow His own notions or conve-
                        nience as to what to do when faced with a choice; He accepted
                        the Scriptures as His guide. The Scriptures of His day were
                        the Old Testament. That He knew its teachings is evident from
                        the answers He gave Satan in response to his temptations. All
                        His replies were from the book of Deuteronomy; namely, 8:3;
                        6:16; 6:13.
                            What admission did the Jews make about Jesus? John
                        7:15.
                            "The question asked during the Saviour's ministry, 'How
                        knoweth this man letters, having never learned?' does not indi-
                        cate that Jesus was unable to read, but merely that He had
                        not received a rabbinical education. John 7:15. Since He
                        gained knowledge as we may do, His intimate acquaintance
                        with the Scriptures shows how diligently His early years were
                        given to the study of God's word."The Desire of Ages, page
                        70.
                            In encountering the tempter, Jesus appraised his statements
                        solely by the Written Word rather than by his appearance. "In
                        the wilderness of temptation Satan came to Christ as an angel
                        from the courts of God. It was by his words, not by his ap-
                        pearance, that the Saviour recognized the enemy."—Ellen G.

                            How do the three basic temptations listed by the apostle

                        light, as he came to Christ. . . .
                           "Those who would have clear minds to discern Satan's de-
                        vices must have their physical appetites under the control of
                        reason and conscience. The moral and vigorous action of the
                        higher powers of the mind are essential to the perfection of
                        Christian character. And the strength or the weakness of the
                        mind has very much to do with our usefulness in this world,

                                                                        January 3

           Part 6       "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father
  THE MEANING OF     in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:
                     but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works."
       JESUS' LIFE   John 14:10.

                          Jesus repeatedly pointed to the Father as the source of His
                     life-style. The acts He did, and the words He spoke, He attri-
                     buted to His heavenly Father. In this way the Father became
                     understandable to those who saw and heard Jesus.
                          "The earth was dark through misapprehension of God. . . .
                     To know God is to love Him; His character must be mani-
                     fested in contrast to the character of Satan. This work only one
                     Being in all the universe could do. Only He who knew the
                     height and depth of the love of God could make it known. Upon
                     the world's dark night the Sun of Righteousness must rise,
                     'with healing in His wings.' Mal. 4:2."—The Desire of Ages,
                     page 22.
                          When Jesus perfomed a miracle of healing, that act had
                     meaning. It showed not only that He possessed this mighty
                     power, but that the deed He did was the deed of the Father.
                     When Jesus spoke His lessons of truth, He was really saying
                      that His lessons were the lessons of the Father. His whole
                      life was the statement that "God is like this."
                          "Christ's favorite theme was the paternal character and
                      abundant love of God. This knowledge of God was Christ's own
                      gift to men, and this gift He has committed to His people to
                      be communicated by them to the world."—Testimonies, Vol.

                          "The world's Redeemer was equal with God. His authority
                      was as the authority of God. He declared that He had no ex-
                      istence separate from the Father. The authority by which He
                      spoke, and wrought miracles, was expressly His own, yet He
                      assures us that He and the Father are one... .
                          "As Legislator, Jesus exercised the authority of God; His
                      commands and decisions were supported by the Sovereignty
                      of the eternal throne. The glory of the Father was revealed in
                      the Son; Christ made manifest the character of the Father. He
                      was so perfectly connected with God, so completely embraced
                      in His encircling light, that He who had seen the Son, had seen
                      the Father. His voice was as the voice of God."—Ellen G.

January 5-11


                           GOD IS LIKE THIS-


         He Cares
        About People
  "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
Luke 19:10.


    In this lesson man, lost in sin, is presented under the symbols of a lost coin,
a lost sheep, and a wayward son. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, went in search
of the lost. For this mission the Father gave the Son. The Son's search speaks
to us of the love of both Son and Father. As a shepherd rejoices in the recovery
of his lost sheep, so God joys in the rescue of His creatures.
    For a misdemeanor a farmer told his son that he had to spend the night in
the haymow and not in his comfortable bed in the house. The little son was
frightened at the prospect of spending the night alone in the hay barn. ,But the
sentence was irrevocable.
    As the son was about to retire for the night, he bravely went out to his sleep-
ing place in the hay while the rest of the family prepared to retire in the house.
Then the father also went out; he found his son in the hay and spent the night
with him. Although the sentence was unchanged, the son knew his father loved
him. So it was with God. Although the sentence for sin could not be revoked,
man learned that God loved him supremely because God Himself as Emmanuel
came in search of him by coming to live with him.
    "As soon as Adam sinned, the Son of God presented Himself as surety for
the human race."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 1,

                         The lost coin was not aware of its lost condition. As the
                     coin was stamped with the image or superscription of the
                     king, so man, though lost, is stamped with the image of his
                     King. See Genesis 1:27. The coin, though lost, did not cease
                     to be metal. So it is with man. "The lost coin represents those
                     who are lost in trespasses and sins, but who have no sense
                     of their condition. They are estranged from God, but they know
                     it not. Their souls are in peril, but they are unconscious and
                     unconcerned. In this parable Christ teaches that even those
                     who are indifferent to the claims of God are the objects of His
                     pitying love. They are to be sought for that they may be
                     brought back to God."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 193,
                     194.

                        What did the woman do when she found the lost coin?
                     Luke 15:9.

                        How does God react when a sinner repents and turns to
                     Him from his sinful way? Luke 15:7.

                        Ellen G. White suggests that the lost coin represents a
                     member of the Christian family who has not found Jesus as
                     his personal Saviour. "It was close at hand, yet it could be
                     recovered only by diligent search."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                     page 194.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Is there a member in my family who is lost to Christ? If so,
                     what am I doing to bring him to Jesus?

                        "This parable has a lesson to families. In the household
                     there is often great carelessness concerning the souls of its
                     members. Among their number may be one who is estranged
                     from God; but how little anxiety is felt lest in the family rela-
                     tionship there be lost one of God's entrusted gifts."—Christ's
                     Object Lessons, page 194.
                        "When you see those who are going down to death, you
                     will not rest in quiet indifference and ease. The greater their
                     sin and the deeper their misery, the more earnest and tender
                     will be your efforts for their recovery."—Christ's Object Les-

He Cares About People LESSON 2                                          ❑    Monday
                                                                            January 6

           Part 2      "And he spoke this parable unto them, saying, What man
  THE LOST SHEEP    of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
                    doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go
                    after that which is lost, until he find it?" Luke 15:3, 4.

                       "By the lost sheep Christ represents not only the individual
                    sinner but the one world that has apostatized and has been
                    ruined by sin. This world is but an atom in the vast dominions
                    over which God presides, yet this little fallen world—the one
                    lost sheep—is more precious in His sight than are the ninety
                    and nine that went not astray from the fold. Christ, the loved
                    Commander in the heavenly courts, stooped from His high
                    estate, laid aside the glory that He had with the Father, in
                    order to save the one lost world. For this He left the sinless
                    worlds on high, the ninety and nine that loved Him, and came
                    to this earth, to be 'wounded for our transgressions' and
                    'bruised for our iniquities.' (Isa. 53:5.) God gave Himself in His
                    Son that He might have the joy of receiving back the sheep
                    that was lost."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 190, 191.
                       When the shepherd finds his sheep, what is his reaction?
                    Luke 15:5-7.
                       "As the shepherd loves his sheep, and cannot rest if even
                    one be missing, so, in an infinitely higher degree, does God
                    love every outcast soul. Men may deny the claim of His love,
                    they may wander from Him, they may choose another master;
                    yet they are God's, and He longs to recover His own. He says,
                    'As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
                    among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out My
                    sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they
                    have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.' Eze. 34:12."
                    —Christ's Object Lessons, page 187.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Christ willingly left all to seek His lost sheep. Do I appre-
                    ciate His salvation so much that I am willing to follow His
                    example and go anywhere to seek those who are lost to
                    Christ?
                       "Thank God, He has presented to our imagination no picture
                    of a sorrowful shepherd returning without the sheep. The
                    parable does not speak of failure but of success and joy in
                    the recovery. Here is the divine guarantee that not even one
                    of the straying sheep of God's fold is overlooked, not one is
                    left unsuccored. Every one that will submit to be ransomed,
                    Christ will rescue from the pit of corruption and from the
                    briers of sin."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 188.

             Part 3      "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am
          THE GOOD    known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I
                      the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep."
          SHEPHERD
                        "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down
                      my life, that I might take it again." John 10:14, 15, 17.

                         In the Scriptures Christ is termed the "great shepherd" (Heb.
                      13:20) and the "chief Shepherd." 1 Peter 5:4. He calls Himself
                      the "good shepherd." John 10:11. "The Bible reveals Christ
                      to us as the Good Shepherd, seeking with unwearied feet for
                      the lost sheep."—Counsels to Teachers, page 261.
                         Through the symbolism of the shepherd, Jesus is presented
                      as tender and careful, as watchful and solicitous (Luke 15:4, 5),
                      as sacrificial and unselfish (John 10:14, 15), as prepared
                      to help (Ps. 80:1), and as seeking the straying. Ps. 119:176.

                         Who is the door to the sheepfold? John 10:9; cf. 14:6.

                          There is no other way to reconciliation or "at-one-ment"
                      with the Father than through Jesus. Knowledge will not do it;
                      philosophy cannot accomplish it. Innate human goodness will
                      not suffice. "In all ages, philosophers and teachers have been
                      presenting to the world theories by which to satisfy the soul's
                      need. Every heathen nation has had its great teachers and
                      religious systems offering some other means of redemption
                      than Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 478. But all this has
                      been in vain. There is but one way to the Father, and that way
                      is Jesus. "I am the way," says Jesus. John 14:6.

 THINK IT THROUGH         With such a Shepherd who was willing to give His own
                      life to find me, to what extent am I willing to follow Him
                      and His direction for me? Do I frequently insist on finding
                      and going my own way?

                          "It is the gospel of the grace of God alone that can uplift
                      the soul. The contemplation of the love of God manifested in
                      His Son will stir the heart and arouse the powers of the soul
                      as nothing else can. Christ came that He might re-create the
                      image of God in man; and whoever turns men away from Christ
                      is turning them away from the source of true development; he
                      is defrauding them of the hope and purpose and glory of life.
                      He is a thief and a robber."—The Desire of Ages, page 478.

He Cares About People LESSON 2                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   January 8

           Part 4     "And he said, A certain man had two sons: and the
    THE LOST SON  younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the por-
                  tion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them
                  his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered
                  all together, and took his journey into a far country, and
                  there wasted his substance with riotous living." Luke 15:11-13.
                      Why did not the father go in search of the son, as the
                  owner of the lost coin and the lost sheep had done? Unlike the
                  lost coin, which did not know it was lost, and the lost sheep,
                  which knew it was lost but did not know the way back, the
                  prodigal both knew he was lost and also knew the way back
                  to his father's house. He knew what he wanted and went in
                  pursuit of it. Hence, the father did not go in search of him,
                  pleading with him to return. A person who willfully practices
                  what he knows is wrong may become more hardened through
                  pleas to him to change. But the Holy Spirit can soften such a
                  heart and prevail on such a person to return to the Father.
                       What did the father do for his son upon his return? Luke
                   15:22-24.
                      "When he came to himself: An idiom in Semitic languages
                  as well as in Greek and Latin. In this instance it could be
                   paraphrased: 'When he realized how foolish he had been.' "—
                  The Interpreter's Bible, Vol. 8, p. 273.
                      "The love of God still yearns over the one who has chosen
                  to separate from Him, and He sets in operation influences to
                   bring him back to the Father's house. . . . Miserable as he
                   was, the prodigal found hope in the conviction of his father's
                   love. It was that love which was drawing him toward home.
                  So it is the assurance of God's love that constrains the sinner
                   to return to God. 'The goodness of God leadeth thee to repent-
                  ance.' Rom. 2:4. A golden chain, the mercy and compassion
                   of divine love, is passed around every imperiled soul."—

 THINK IT THROUGH      Who only can bring conviction and change to a person
                   who willfully pursues a course of wrongdoing and sin?
                       "Whatever the appearance may be, every life centered in
                   self is squandered. Whoever attempts to live apart from God
                   is wasting his substance. He is squandering the precious years,
                   squandering the powers of mind and heart and soul, and work-
                   ing to make himself bankrupt for eternity. The man who sep-
                   arates from God that he may serve himself, is the slave of
                   mammon. The mind that God created for the companionship
                   of angels has become degraded to the service of that which
                   is earthly and bestial. This is the end to which self-serving

             Part 5      "And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them
       OTHER SHEEP    also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there
                      shall be one fold, and one shepherd." John 10:16.

                          When Jesus spoke these words, the "other sheep" referred
                      to the Gentiles. After His death and resurrection the gospel
                      went to the Gentiles, and God's church today is made up largely
                      of non-Jews. But, despite this, the verse is true today. Not all
                      persons who today serve God with pure motives and to the
                      best of their knowledge have found God's truth and His rem-
                      nant church. Wrote Ellen G. White: "Notwithstanding the spir-
                      itual darkness and alienation from God that exist in the
                      churches which constitute Babylon, the great body of Christ's
                      true followers are still to be found in their communion."—The
                      Great Controversy, page 390.
                          God measures the commitment of His people qualitatively
                      rather than quantitatively. He evaluates the diligence with which
                      we have improved our opportunities to find His truth, and He
                      observes our attitude toward the known portion of His will. Do
                      His professed followers gladly respond to revealed truth, or
                      do they rebel against it?
                          "If rational beings really desire the truth, God will give
                      them sufficient light to enable them to decide what is truth.
                      If they have a heart to obey, they will see sufficient evidence
                      to walk in the light. But if they in heart desire to evade the
                      truth, he will not work a miracle to gratify their unbelief. He
                      will never remove every chance or occasion to doubt."—Ellen
                      G. White, Review and Herald, Jan. 5, 1886.

                          Is it possible for the evil one to separate God's committed
                      followers from Him? John 10:28, 29; cf. Rom. 8:35-39.

                         "The soul that has given himself to Christ is more precious
                      in His sight than the whole world. The Saviour would have
                      passed through the agony of Calvary that one might be saved
                      in His kingdom. He will never abandon one for whom He has
                      died. Unless His followers choose to leave Him, He will hold
                      them fast."—The Desire of Ages, page 483.

 THINK IT THROUGH         What will happen to all these other sheep before Jesus
                      returns in glory to receive His own?

                         "Not one is made to suffer the wrath of God until the truth
                      has been brought home to his mind and conscience, and has
                      been rejected. . . . Everyone is to have sufficient light to make
                      his decision intelligently."—The Great Controversy, page 605.

            Part 6      "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begot-
 FATHER GAVE SON     ten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
                     but have everlasting life." John 3:16.
   TO DIE FOR MAN

                        Some are prone to think that God loves us because Jesus
                     gave His life for us. But God does not love us because Jesus
                     gave His life for us; rather the Father's love for lost man con-
                     strained Him to give His Son to die for us in order to redeem
                     us. "As soon as there was sin, there was a Saviour."—Ellen
                     G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 1, p. 1084.
                         To rescue man from the predicament into which he had
                     fallen through disobedience, God was willing to empty the
                     storehouse of heaven and deplete the resources of the uni-
                     verse. Anything that was needed God was willing to do to
                     reinstate man, whom He had created• in love, in his intended
                     position as ruler of the earth and a son of God.
                         If but one soul would have accepted salvation, God was
                     still willing to make this overture of love to fallen man.

                        What is the response in heaven when a sinner returns?
                     Luke 15:7, 10.


                        Zephaniah 3:17 gives an intimate picture of God's satisfac-
                     tion and rejoicing when a sinner is saved. God is portrayed
                     as singing in satisfied love. Picture a young husband in com-
                     plete and happy contentment, singing or humming for sheer
                     joy as he looks at his wife rocking their baby.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How highly do I value a soul, or how much am I willing
                     to do to rescue a soul from sin and eternal death?


                         "The value of a soul, who can estimate? Would you know
                     its worth, go to Gethsemane, and there watch with Christ
                     through those hours of anguish, when He sweat as it were
                     great drops of blood. Look upon the Saviour uplifted on the
                     cross. Hear that despairing cry, 'My God, My God, why hast
                     Thou forsaken Me?' Mark 15:34. Look upon the wounded head,
                     the pierced side, the marred feet. Remember that Christ risked
                     all. For our redemption, heaven itself was imperiled. At the
                     foot of the cross, remembering that for one sinner Christ would
                     have laid down His life, you may estimate the value of a soul."

                             LESSON 3
                         January 12-18

  "Though your sins be as scarlet, they
shall be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as
wool." Isa. 1:18.

   God's gracious promise of forgive-
ness through the prophet Isaiah presents
God's plan for sinful man. Adam and
Eve departed from God's will. Their de-
scendants followed them in transgres-
sion. 'With intense interest the unfallen
worlds had watched to see Jehovah
arise, and sweep away the inhabitants
of the earth. And if God should do this,
Satan was ready to carry out his plan
for securing to himself the allegiance
of heavenly beings. He had declared,
that the principles of God's government
make forgiveness impossible. Had the
world been destroyed, he would have
claimed that his accusations were
proved true. . . . But instead of destroy-
ing the world, God sent His Son to save
it."—The Desire of Ages, page 37.
    Jesus' sacrifice provides forgiveness
for individual repentant sinners. His
teachings emphasize forgiveness, and
His own personal attitude toward those
who wronged Him was a forgiving one.
Thus He taught and demonstrated that
the Father forgives people when they
repent.

            Part 1      "And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was
                     taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in,
     THE PARALYTIC   and to lay him before him. And when they could not find
                     by what way they might bring him in because of the multi-
                     tude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through
                     the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. And
                     when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins
                     are forgiven thee." Luke 5:1.8-20.


                        Jesus desired to forgive sins; "it was to manifest His power
                     to forgive sins that the miracle was performed. . . .
                         "This paralytic had lost all hope of recovery. His disease
                     was the result of a life of sin, and his sufferings were embit-
                     tered by remorse....
                         "The palsied man was entirely helpless, and, seeing no
                     prospect of aid from any quarter, he had sunk into despair.
                     Then he heard of the wonderful works of Jesus. He was told
                     that others as sinful and helpless as he had been healed; even
                     lepers had been cleansed. And the friends who reported these
                     things encouraged him to believe that he too might be cured
                     if he could be carried to Jesus. But his hope fell when he
                     remembered how the disease had been brought upon him. He
                     feared that the pure Physician would not tolerate him in His
                     presence."—The Desire of Ages, page 267.

                       What did the paralytic and his friends possess that enabled
                     Jesus to heal him? Mark 2:5; cf. Matt. 13:58; Mark 6:5, 6.


 THINK IT THROUGH        What do I most ardently desire—physical benefits or spir-
                     itual healing?

                         "In words that fell like music on the sufferer's ear, the
                     Saviour said, 'Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
                     thee.'
                         "The burden of despair rolls from the sick man's soul; the
                     peace of forgiveness rests upon his spirit, and shines out upon
                     his countenance. His physical pain is gone, and his whole
                     being is transformed. The helpless paralytic is healed! the
                     guilty sinner is pardoned!
                          "In simple faith he accepted the words of Jesus as the
                     boon of new life. He urged no further request, but lay in bliss-
                      ful silence, too happy for words. The light of heaven irradiated
                      his countenance, and the people looked with awe upon the
                      scene."—The Desire of Ages, page 268.

                                                                       January 13

           Part 2      "And when they were come to the place, which is called
      THE ROMAN     Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one
                    on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then said Jesus,
     SOLDIERS AT    Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." Luke
       THE CROSS    23:33, 34.
                        Even in His excruciating suffering with nails piercing His
                    tender flesh Jesus' thoughts were not centered on self. His
                    mind went out in solicitude for others. Contrary to all human
                    inclinations, He asked His Father for mercy upon His execu-
                    tioners.
                        "His mind passed from His own suffering to the sin of His
                    persecutors, and the terrible retribution that would be theirs.
                    No curses were called down upon the soldiers who were han-
                    dling Him so roughly. No vengeance was invoked upon the
                    priests and rulers, who were gloating over the accomplish-
                    ment of their purpose. Christ pitied them in their ignorance
                    and guilt. He breathed only a plea for their forgiveness,—'for
                     they know not what they do.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 744.

                       According to what standard does God hold men respon-
                    sible or apportion accountability for light? Luke 12:47, 48.

                        "Had they known that they were putting to torture One who
                    had come to save the sinful race from eternal ruin, they would
                    have been seized with remorse and horror. But their ignorance
                    did not remove their guilt; for it was their privilege to know
                    and accept Jesus as their Saviour. Some of them would yet
                    see their sin, and repent, and be converted. Some by their
                    impenitence would make it an impossibility for the prayer of
                    Christ to be answered for them."—The Desire of Ages, pages
                    744, 745.
                        "God will not condemn any at the judgment because they
                    honestly believed a lie, or conscientiously cherished error; bUt
                    it will be because they neglected the opportunities of making
                    themselves acquainted with truth."—Testimonies to Ministers,
                    page 437.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Have you ever cherished a fleeting desire not to learn
                    any more truth lest you be held responsible for added knowl-
                    edge? What should be my attitude toward learning truth?

                        "That prayer of Christ for His enemies embraced the world.
                    It took in every sinner that had lived or should live, from the
                    beginning of the world to the end of time. Upon all rests the
                    guilt of crucifying the Son of God. To all, forgiveness is freely
                    offered. 'Whosoever will' may have peace with God, and in-
                    herit eternal life."—The Desire of Ages, page 745.

      THE THIEF ON
        THE CROSS         Note the punctuation of Luke 23:43 in The Desire of Ages,
                      page 750: "Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with
                      Me in paradise." Without a doubt this is the correct punctua-
                      tion of the verse.
                          The original Bible manuscripts contained no punctuation.
                      Punctuation was supplied later. Naturally, it was supplied in
                      accordance with a copyist's philosophy of life. Inasmuch as
                      the common belief was that the soul went to heaven immedi-
                      ately upon death, it was punctuated so as to give that meaning.
                      But from internal gospel evidence in John 20:17 we know that
                      Jesus did not go to paradise on Friday. He had not yet as-
                      cended to His Father when He appeared to Mary Sunday morn-
                      ing.
                          In the assuring answer of Jesus to the thief's request,
                      "Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in para-
                      dise," there is implicit and full forgiveness. In a moment the
                       thief's sinful past was blotted out. He was accounted righ-
                       teous or justified by God. As a babe just born into the kingdom
                       of God, he was perfect in God's sight. His attitude toward
                       God and His will had been changed from rebellion to willing
                      obedience.
                          "For long hours of agony, reviling and mockery have fallen
                       upon the ears of Jesus. As He hangs upon the cross, there
                       floats up to Him still the sound of jeers and curses. . . . While
                       the leading Jews deny Him, and even the disciples doubt His
                       divinity, the poor thief, upon the brink of eternity, calls Jesus
                      Lord. Many were ready to call Him Lord when He wrought
                       miracles, and after He had risen from the grave; but none
                       acknowledged Him as He hung dying upon the cross save
                       the penitent thief who was saved at the eleventh hour."—The
                       Desire of Ages, pages 750, 751.
                         Of what divine sentiment toward man is Jesus' answer
                      to the thief on the cross a reminder? John 6:37.
 THINK IT THROUGH         How may I experience the full and free deliverance from
                      sin that the thief on the cross experienced?

                         "With amazement the angels beheld the infinite love of
                      Jesus, who, suffering the most intense agony of mind and
                      body, thought only of others, and encouraged the penitent soul
                      to believe. In His 'humiliation He as a prophet had addressed
                      the daughters of Jerusalem; as priest and advocate He had
                      pleaded with the Father to forgive His „murderers; as a loving
                      Saviour He had forgiven the sins of the penitent thief."—The

          Part 4       "And he [Jesus] turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,
 MARY MAGDALENE    Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou
                   gayest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my
                   feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head."
                   Luke 7:44.
                      Read also Luke 7:36-50.
                       The woman at Simon's feast was Mary of Bethany, the sister
                   of Lazarus and Martha. See The Desire of Ages, pages 558,
                   559. Mary had been a fallen woman, and some still viewed her
                   in that way. Simon was ashamed and embarrassed to have
                   her appear at his feast. "Simon questioned whether the Sav-
                   iour were a prophet. Because Christ allowed this woman to
                   approach Him, because He did not indignantly spurn her as one
                   whose sins were too great to be forgiven, because He did not
                   show that He realized she had fallen, Simon was tempted to
                   think that He was not a prophet. Jesus knows nothing of this
                   woman who is so free in her demonstrations, he thought, or
                   He would not allow her to touch Him."—The Desire of Ages,
                   page 566.
                       What did Jesus say about the woman's sins? Luke 7:47, 48.
                     All Mary's scarlet sins God had freely forgiven because
                  she had responded to the Spirit's pleadings to her heart.
                     "Mary knew not the full significance of her deed of love.
                  She could not answer her accusers. She could not explain
                  why she had chosen that occasion for anointing Jesus. The
                  Holy Spirit had planned for her, and she had obeyed His
                  promptings. Inspiration stoops to give no reason. An unseen

                  action. It is its own justification."—The Desire of Ages, page

                     "When to human eyes her case appeared hopeless, Christ
                  saw in Mary capabilities for good. He saw the better traits of
                  her character. The plan of redemption has invested humanity
                  with great possibilities, and in Mary these possibilities were
                  to be realized. Through His grace she became a partaker of
                  the divine nature. The one who had fallen, and whose mind
                  had been a habitation of demons, was brought very near to
                  the Saviour in fellowship and ministry. It was Mary who sat at
                  His feet and learned of Him. It was Mary who poured upon
                  His head the precious anointing oil, and bathed His feet with
                  her tears. Mary stood beside the cross, and followed Him to
                  the sepulcher. Mary was first at the tomb after His resurrec-
                  tion. It was Mary who first proclaimed a risen Saviour."—The

He Readily Forgives LESSON 3                                       111 Thursday
                                                                     January 16

            Part 5    "And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
                  heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
     THE PRODIGAL
                  called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring
                  forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his
                  hand, and shoes on his feet." Luke 15:21, 22.
                      The prodigal was repentant. He admitted his sins and his
                  unworthiness to be called a son of his father. On the basis
                  of this the father, representing God, forgave him fully and
                  freely. "Whom Christ pardons, He first makes penitent"—
                  Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 7. With this the
                  father kissed him tenderly and then gave back to him all the
                  tokens of reinstatement as a son. His rags were removed and
                  he was clothed in "the best robe." The ring was a symbol
                  that the son was still a son. "Shoes were the token of sonship,
                  for only slaves went barefoot."—The Interpreter's Bible, Vol.
                  8, pp. 276, 277.
                      Only by the father's gift was he clothed in the way char-
                  acteristic of his family. These gifts replaced the evidences of
                  the son's impoverishment.
                       To what was the prodigal's return compared by the father?
                  Luke 15:24; cf. John 5:24.
                      In the sight of God a man is really dead only when he is
                  lost, that is, dead to the love of God. The prodigal had been
                  dead to the father until he came to himself. He comes to life
                  when he responds anew to his father's love. So we as sinners
                  became alive when we accepted Jesus as our Saviour. The
                   verse parallels the thought of verses 7 and 10 that there is joy
                  in heaven when a sinner once again becomes alive to the
                  will of God.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What is my attitude toward those who have deliberately
                  strayed away from God but later returned? What should
                  it be?
                      "Your heavenly Father will take from you the garments
                   defiled by sin. In the beautiful parabolic prophecy of Zecha-
                  riah, the high priest Joshua, standing clothed in filthy garments
                   before the angel of the Lord, represents the sinner. And the
                   word is spoken by the Lord, 'Take away the filthy garments
                  from him. And unto him He said, Behold, I have caused thine
                   iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change
                   of raiment. . . . So they set a fair miter upon his head, and
                   clothed him with garments.' Zech. 3:4, 5. Even so God will
                   clothe you with 'the garments of salvation,' and cover you
                   with 'the robe of righteousness.' Isa. 61:10. 'Though ye have
                   lien among the pots, yet, shall ye be as the wings of a dove
                   covered with silver, and her feathers‘ with yellow gold.' Ps.

He Readily Forgives LESSON 3                                              ❑ Friday
                                                                          January 17

            Part 6      "Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall
  FORGIVE SEVENTY    my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven
                     times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven
     TIMES SEVEN     times: but, Until seventy times seven." Matt. 18:21, 22.

                         "The rabbis said that three pardons were enough. Peter
                     proposed magnanimity, and so suggested seven."—The Inter-
                     preter's Bible, Vol. 7, p. 475. Jesus here corrected Peter.
                     "Seventy times seven" is four hundred and ninety. By this
                     Jesus meant that there must be no limit to forgiveness. As
                     long as an offender comes back, God gladly and willingly
                     forgives and welcomes him back. God had demonstrated this
                     in His relation to Israel in the Old Testament. As a case in
                     point, the book of Judges points out repeated departures of
                     Israel from God, but every time they repented God gladly
                     forgave. See Judges 3:7-9, 12-15; 4:1-4; 6:1-8.
                         Jesus thus reiterated His Father's eagerness to forgive the
                     repentant sinner irrespective of his past. God is not primarily
                     concerned with the past. All the failures and the shortcomings
                     of the past are blotted out through Jesus' shed blood. But He
                     is intensely concerned with my present response—my "now-
                     reaction," or my attitude toward Him and His plan.

                       What will be the result of returning to the Lord? Isa. 55:7;
                     Hosea 1-3; 2 Sam. 12:13.


                        Gomer is a symbol of God's people, while Hosea represents
                     God. God found every one of us initially, as Hosea found
                     Gomer, in spiritual adultery or sin. Then as Gomer we also
                     have departed from God, although we espoused Him as our
                     spiritual husband. Still God waits for our change of heart, ready
                     to take us back, just as Hosea took Gomer back as his wife
                     and the mother of his children.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Am I always willing to forgive those who have wronged
                     me and also forget their wrongdoing? Why?


                        "The dictionary says that forgiveness means 'to give up
                     resentment or claim to requital.' But is this true pardon? To
                     forgive but not forget usually means not to forgive. Only to
                     forgo resentment is a poor half forgiveness. Luke 17:5 tells us
                     that when the disciples heard this requirement of Jesus . . .
                     they exclaimed, 'Increase our faithl"—The Interpreter's Bible,
                     Vol. 7, p. 475. May God also increase our faith!

     GOD IS LIKE THIS-


                   He Hates Sin
   "And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were
better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were
drowned in the depth of the sea." Matt. 18:5, 6.


   Sin is disloyalty to God. When we sin, we give our allegiance to someone
else, or to self, rather than to God. It began in heaven. Lucifer, the light bearer
and anointed cherub at the throne of God, withdrew his loyalty from God. He
also led other angels to follow him and induced them to transfer their loyalty
from God to him and to regard him as supreme rather than God.
   The principle of selfishness underlying all sin is contrary to the character
of God, and He has opposed it with all of His resources. Sin divided the uni-
verse. Rather than being a unit, or a universe, through sin it became basically
a dualism with two forces in opposition to each other. On one side were God
and those loyal to Him, and on the other side were Satan and his followers.
   After the creation of Adam and Eve Satan transplanted sin to this earth.
Adam and Eve became sinners by obeying Satan rather than God. Jesus came
to this earth and demonstrated God's attitude toward sin. "The gift of Christ
reveals the Father's heart. It testifies that the thoughts of God toward us are
'thoughts of peace, and not of evil.' Jer. 29:11. It declares that while God's
hatred of sin is as strong as death, His love for the sinner is stronger than
death. Having undertaken our redemption, He will spare nothing, however dear,
which is necessary to the completion of His work. No truth essential to our
salvation is withheld, no miracle of mercy is neglected, no divine agency is left
unemployed."—The Desire of Ages, page 57.

                                                                            January 19

            Part 1    "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
            JESUS through, the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness
                   of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
     CONDEMNED SIN Rom. 8:3.

                         One of the great accomplishments of the life and death of
                     Jesus was the refutation of the idea that sin is a valid and
                     inevitable way of life for human beings. The intensity of this
                      condemnation can be measured by the cross. Jesus considered
                     the condemnation of sin of greater import than His personal
                     existence.
                         "Not until the death of Christ was the character of Satan
                      clearly revealed to the angels or to the unfallen worlds. The arch-
                     apostate had so clothed himself with deception that even holy
                      beings had not understood his principles. They had not clearly
                     seen the nature of his rebellion."—The Desire of Ages, page
                     758.
                         "The cross of Calvary, while it declares the law immutable,
                     proclaims to the universe that the wages of sin is death. In
                     the Saviour's expiring cry, 'It is finished,' the death knell of
                     Satan was rung. The great controversy which had been so
                     long in progress was then decided, and the final eradication
                     of evil was made certain. The Son of God passed through the
                     portals of the tomb, that 'through death He might destroy him
                     that had the power of death, that is, the devil.' Hebrews 2:14....
                         "The whole universe will haye become witnesses to the
                     nature and results of sin. And its utter extermination, which
                     in the beginning would have brought fear to angels and dis-
                     honor to God, will now vindicate His love and establish His
                     honor before the universe of beings who delight to do His
                     will, and in whose heart is His law. Never will evil again be
                     manifest."—The Great Controversy, pages 503, 504.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How does my estimate of sin compare with Christ's esti-
                     mate of it?

                        "The death of the spotless Son of God testifies that 'the
                     wages of sin is death,' that every violation of God's law must
                     receive its just retribution. Christ the sinless became sin for
                     man. He bore the guilt of transgression, and the hiding of His
                     Father's face, until His heart was broken and His life crushed
                     out. All this sacrifice was made that sinners might be redeemed.
                     In no other way could man be freed from the penalty of-sin.
                     And every soul that refuses to become a partaker of the atone-
                     ment provided at such a cost must bear in his own person the
                     guilt and punishment of transgression."—The Great Contro-

         Part 2        "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
         JESUS     are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beau-
                   tiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and
  DENOUNCED SIN    of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righ-
                   teous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniq-
                   uity." Matt. 23:27, 28.
                     Jesus unsparingly denounced sin that was carried on under
                  a cloak of piety. He always opposed sin, but He did not always
                  denounce it in the way that He did in Matthew 23.
                     "He [Jesus] hated but one thing in the world, and that was
                  sin. He could not witness a wrong act without pain which it
                  was impossible to disguise. Between the formalists, whose
                  sanctity of appearance concealed the love of sin, and a char-
                  acter in which zeal for God's glory was always paramount, the
                  contrast was unmistakable. Because the life of Jesus con-
                  demned evil, He was opposed, both at home and abroad. His
                  unselfishness and integrity were commented on with a sneer.
                  His forbearance and kindness were termed cowardice."—The
                  Desire of Ages, page 88.
                      In writing of the woes that Jesus pronounced on the Phari-
                  sees, Ellen G. White wrote:
                      "With hand uplifted to heaven, and a divine light enshroud-
                  ing His person, Christ spoke as a judge to those before Him.
                  His voice, that had so often been heard in gentleness and
                  entreaty, was now heard in rebuke and condemnation. The
                  listeners shuddered. Never was the impression made by His
                  words and His look to be effaced.
                      "Christ's indignation was directed against the hypocrisy,
                  the gross sins, by which men were destroying their own souls,
                   deceiving the people and dishonoring God. In the specious
                  deceptive reasoning of the priests and rulers He discerned
                   the working of satanic agencies. Keen and searching had been
                  His denunciation of sin; but He spoke no words of retaliation.
                  He had a holy wrath against the prince of darkness; but He
                  manifested no irritated temper."—The Desire of Ages, page

                  ordinary indignation?
                      "Divine pity marked the countenance of the Son of God as
                   He cast one lingering look upon the temple and then upon His
                   hearers. In a voice choked by deep anguish of heart and bitter
                   tears He exclaimed, . . . [Matt. 23:37 quoted]. This is the
                   separation struggle. In the lamentation of Christ the very heart
                   of God is pouring itself forth. It is the mysterious farewell of
                   the long-suffering love of the Deity."—The Desire of Ages,

             Part 3     "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
     SIN SEPARATES    saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God,
                      my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Matt. 27:46.
          FROM GOD
                         Jesus assumed man's sins. He carried the awesome burden
                      of sin. He knew that sin could not exist in the presence of His
                      Father, and it appeared to Him that the assumed burden of
                      mankind's sins would forever separate Him from His Father.
                         "The Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb.
                      Hope did not present to Him His coming forth from the grave
                      a conqueror, or tell Him of the Father's acceptance of the
                      sacrifice. He feared that sin was so offensive to God that Their
                      separation was to be eternal. Christ felt the anguish which the
                      sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer plead for the guilty
                      race. It was the sense of sin, bringing the Father's wrath upon
                      Him as man's substitute, that made the cup He drank so bit-
                      ter, and broke the heart of the Son of God."—The Desire of
                      Ages, page 753.

                         Note the similarity between God's pronouncement of judg-
                      ment on Judah by Isaiah and Jesus' experience at the cross.
                      Isa. 59:2. Note the difference.

                         Sin is destroyed by the presence of God. This fact is pointed
                      out in the Scriptures. See Heb. 12:29. Anything and everything
                      contaminated with sin becomes combustible in the presence
                      of God. The prophet Isaiah repeatedly points out that sin will
                      be destroyed by fire. See Isa. 33:11, 12; 30:33; 1:28-31; 9:18.
                         "If you cling to self, refusing to yield your will to God, you
                      are choosing death. To sin, wherever found, God is a consum-
                      ing fire. If you choose sin, and refuse to separate from it, the
                      presence of God, which consumes sin, must consume you."
                      —Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 62.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Do I possess a realistic appraisal of the dire effects of
                      sin? Do I realize that sin will inevitably separate me from
                      God for eternity unless I am freed from it?


                           "The God of heaven is 'of purer eyes than to behold evil,'
                      and cannot 'look on iniquity.' Habakkuk 1:13. It is not because
                      He is unwilling to forgive that He turns from the transgressor;
                      it is because the sinner refuses to make use of the abundant
                      provisions of grace, that God is unable to deliver from sin."

                                                                     January 22

           Part 4      "And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he
 JESUS PREFERRED    was afterward an hungered. And when the tempter came to
                    him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these
    DEATH TO SIN    stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is writ-
                    ten, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
                    that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." Matt. 4:2-4.


                        Jesus had fasted for nearly six weeks. He "was faint from
                    hunger, He was craving for food, when Satan came suddenly
                    upon Him. Pointing to the stones which strewed the desert, and
                    which had the appearance of loaves, the tempter said, 'If Thou
                    be the Son of God, command that these stones be made
                    bread.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 118.
                        Jesus had nearly reached the limit of human endurance. To
                    continue fasting would have been fatal. Yet under these cir-
                    cumstances He rejected Satan's suggestion. "In man's behalf,
                    Christ conquered by enduring the severest test. For 'our sake
                    He exercised a self-control stronger than hunger or death."
                    —The Desire of Ages, page 117.
                        Satan confronted Jesus with two further temptations, but
                    Jesus resisted them also and finally bade Satan flee.,
                        "After the foe had departed, Jesus fell exhausted to the
                    earth, with the pallor of death upon His face. The angels of
                    heaven had watched the conflict, beholding their loved Com-
                    mander as He passed through inexpressible suffering to make
                    a way of escape for us. He had endured the test, greater than
                    we shall ever be called to endure. The angels now ministered
                    to the Son of God as He lay like one dying. He was strength-
                    ened with food, comforted with the message of His Father's
                    love and the assurance that all heaven triumphed in His vic-
                    tory. Warming to life again, His great heart goes out in sym-
                    pathy for man, and He goes forth to complete the work He
                    has begun; to rest not until the foe is vanquished, and our
                    fallen race redeemed "—The Desire of Ages, page 131.
                        In His preference of death instead of sin Jesus revealed
                    how the heavenly Father views sin. Nothing in the world can
                    happen to a human being that is as serious as the commission
                    of sin.

            Part 5     "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and
 JESUS CAME TO DO saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
                   of the world." John 1:29.
    AWAY WITH SIN

                         Jesus came to this earth to separate man from sin. He knew
                     that lest man be separated from it, he will perish in it. A
                     sinner, not cleansed from sin and covered with the righteous-
                     ness of Christ, will perish in the presence of God. "The plan
                     of redemption contemplates our complete recovery from the
                     power of Satan. Christ always separates the contrite soul from
                     sin. He came to destroy the works of the devil, and He has
                     made provision that the Holy Spirit shall be imparted to every
                     repentant soul, to keep him from sinning."—The Desire of
                     Ages, page 311.

                         Which is the last enemy that Jesus will destroy? 1 Cor.
                      15:26.


                        Death is caused by separation from God, since there is no
                     source of life apart from God. Jesus will be able to abolish
                     death only by teaching, persuading, and empowering intelli-
                     gent beings to separate from sin. Sin will be eliminated from
                     the universe by permitting those who do not choose to let Jesus
                     rule them, through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to reap
                     the full result of separation from God—death. For "the sting of
                     death is sin." 1 Cor. 15: 56.

                         What did the Lord, under the symbol of wisdom in the
                     •Old Testament, say that those actually do who hate Him?
                      Prov. 8:36.

                         "By a life of rebellion, Satan and all who unite with him
                     place themselves so out of harmony with God that His very
                     presence is to them a consuming fire. The glory of Him who
                     is love will destroy them."—The Desire of Ages, page 764.

           Part 6      What is evident from the last part of the admonition of
      GO, AND SIN   Jesus to the woman taken in adultery?
        NO MORE       "And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go,
                    and sin no more." John 8:11.
                     . It is God's plan that those who have accepted Jesus and
                    been born again cease from sinning. It is His hope and plan
                    that we choose to be wholly His.
                       "The tempter's agency is not to be accounted an excuse
                    for one wrong act. Satan is jubilant when -he hears the pro-
                    fessed followers of Christ making excuses for their deformity
                    of character. It is these excuses that lead to sin. There is no
                    excuse for sinning. A holy temper, a•Christlike life, is acces-

                    tinue in sin, but that you may be saved from your sins; that
                    you, through the merits of his righteousness, may be re-instated
                    to the favor of God. Do you know that a holy and just God will
                    accept your efforts to keep his law, through the merits of his
                    own beloved Son who died for your rebellion and sin?"—Ellen

                       In teaching His disciples and the multitudes, what quality

      GOD IS LIKE THIS-


        He Hears
      People's Pleas
   "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall
be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." Matt. 7:7, 8.

  When Jesus was on earth, He responded to the pleas of those who sought
His help. There is no instance recorded in which He turned someone away.
This attitude to people was a reflection of the way the Father treats those who
make sincere requests of Him.
    Every sincere requedt reaches the ear and heart of God. Though our God
is the Ruler of an infinite universe, He is still "big enough" to be able to listen
to the smallest plea of the most insignificant of His earth-born children.
    "Jesus sees His true church on the earth, whose greatest ambition is to
cooperate with Him in the grand work of saving souls. He hears their prayers,
presented in contrition and power, and Omnipotence cannot resist their plea
far the salvation of any tried, tempted member of Christ's body."—Testimonies
to Ministers, page 19.
    "Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your fears before
God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary Him. He who numbers the
hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants of His children. . . . Take to
Him everything that perplexes the mind. Nothing is too great for Him to bear,
for He holds up worlds, He rules over all the affairs of the universe. Nothing
 that in any way concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. . . . The
relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there
 were not another soul upon the earth to share His watchcare, not another soul
 for whom He gave His beloved Son."—Steps to Christ, page 100.

             Part 1      "And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there
                      came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, and saying,
     THE CENTURION
                      Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously
                      tormented. And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal
                      him." Matt. 8:5-7.
                          To the centurion's expressed confidence that Jesus could
                      heal, the response of Jesus was instant. Thus, His reply, "I will
                      come and heal him."
                          The centurion's faith was so strong that he did not even
                      think it was necessary for the Master to come to his house and
                      see his servant. He thought of Jesus as a man in authority who
                      could heal by His word of command.
                          "He [Jesus] marveled at the faith of the centurion who came
                      to Him. The centurion did not question the Saviour's power.
                      He did not even ask Him to come in person to perform the
                      miracle. 'Speak the word only,' he said, 'and my servant shall
                      be healed.' ...
                          "He believed that Jesus could heal him. He had not seen
                      the Saviour, but the reports he heard had inspired him with
                      faith."—The Desire of Ages, page 315.
                        How was the centurion's implicit faith in Jesus' power
                      and willingness rewarded? Matt. 8:13.
                        Who was correct—the centurion who said he was un-
                      worthy, or the Jewish elders who said the centurion was
                      worthy of Jesus' help because of the good he had done?
                      Matt. 8:8; Luke 7:4.
                          The Jews fallaciously thought that a man through his good-
                      ness could merit the favor of God. They failed to realize that
                      "all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags" (Isa. 64:6) and that
                      man merits nothing except death for his sins. It is not his good-
                      ness that commends man to God, but his desperate need.
 THINK IT THROUGH        Is our faith in Jesus sufficiently strong so that we can take
                      Him at His word before seeing the deed?

                         "The Jewish elders who recommended the centurion to
                      Christ had shown how far they were from possessing the spirit
                      of the gospel. They did not recognize that our great need is
                      our only claim on God's mercy. In their self-righteousness they
                      commended the centurion because of the favor he had shown
                      to 'our nation.' But the centurion said of himself, 'I am not
                      worthy.' His heart had been touched by the grace of Christ.
                      He saw his own unworthiness; yet he feared not to ask help.
                      He trusted not to his own goodness; his argument was his great
                      need."—The Desire of Ages, pages 316, 317.

 THE LEPER'S PLEA   hold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face,
                    and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make
                    me clean." Luke 5:12.


                       The leper entertained no doubts about Jesus' ability or
                    power to cure him of his dreadful disease, but he wondered
                    whether the Master would be willing to stoop down to his
                    wretchedness and heal him. As a leper he was a human out-
                    cast and was shunned for fear of lethal contamination. The Jews
                    counted a leper as good as dead along with the blind, the
                    poor, and the childless. Hence, he was afraid to approach the
                    Master with his plea for healing. Nevertheless, he mustered
                    his courage and spoke to Jesus. But he did not possess suffi-
                    cient boldness to ask for healing. He left that up to the Master
                    as he said, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
                       There are certain requests we may present to God with full
                    assurance of fulfillment. One is a request for forgiveness of
                    sin. See 1 John 1:9.

                      As Jesus put forth His hand and touched the leper, what
                    change took place in him? Luke 5:13.


                       "Immediately a change passed over the leper. His flesh
                    became healthy, the nerves sensitive, the muscles firm. The
                    rough, scaly surface peculiar to leprosy disappeared, and a
                    soft glow, like that upon the skin of a healthy child, took its
                    place."—The Desire of Ages, page 263.

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways am I like the leper? Am I uncertain of Jesus'
                    willingness to heal me of the leprosy of sin? If so, place in-
                    delibly on memory's wall Hebrews 7:25.


                       "In the region of Christ's ministry, there were many of these
                    sufferers [lepers], and the news of His work reached them,
                    kindling a gleam of hope. But since the days of Elisha the
                    prophet, such a thing had never been known as the cleansing
                    of one upon whom this disease had fastened. They dared not
                    expect Jesus to do for them what He had never done for any
                    man. There was one, however, in whose heart faith began to
                    spring up."—The Desire of Ages, pages 262, 263.

                Part 3   "And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same
     THE SYROPHOENI-   coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, 0
                       Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed
         C IAN WOMAN with a devil." Matt. 15:22.
                          "This woman had heard of the prophet, who, it was reported,
                      healed all manner of diseases. As she heard of His power, hope
                      sprang up in her heart. Inspired by a mother's love, she deter-
                      mined to present her daughter's case to Him. It was her reso-
                      lute purpose to bring her affliction to Jesus. He must heal her
                      child. She had sought help from the heathen gods, but had
                      obtained no relief. And at times she was tempted to think,
                      What can this Jewish teacher do for me? But the word had
                      come, He heals all manner of diseases, whether those who
                      come to Him for help are rich or poor. She determined not to
                      lose her only hope."—The Desire of Ages, page 400.
                         Even though a Canaanite, or foreign heathen, she accepted
                      and believed the reports that had reached her about the benev-
                      olent Jewish healer. Thus she resolutely approached Jesus
                      for help.
                        What was the attitude of the disciples toward her re-
                      quest? Matt. 15:23. What was Jesus' attitude? Verse 28.
                         The disciples were typical of their times. They felt no in-
                      clination to listen to this woman and help her even though
                      she was in sore need of help. She, as a heathen with no hope
                      of salvation, was to them of less value than an animal. They
                      wanted their Master to dismiss her, since she made an ado of
                      their presence in a strange place.
 THINK IT THROUGH        In what ways do I, as the disciples, segregate people
                      according to their class or background rather than look upon
                      them as unique individuals with personal needs which Jesus
                      stands ever ready to meet?
                          "Christ knew this woman's•situation. He knew that she was
                      longing to see Him, and He placed Himself in her path. By min-
                      istering to her sorrow, He could give a living representation of
                      the lesson He designed to teach. For this He had brought His
                      disciples into this region. He desired them to see the ignorance
                      existing in cities and villages close to the land of Israel. The
                      people who had been given every opportunity to understand
                      the truth were without a knowledge of the needs of those
                      around them. No effort was made to help souls in darkness.
                      The partition wall which Jewish pride had erected, shut even
                      the disciples from sympathy with the heathen world. But these
                      barriers were to be broken down."—The Desire of Ages, page

He Hears People's Pleas LESSON 5                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    January 29

           Part 4      "There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
 THE IMPORTUNATE    regarded man: and there was a widow in that city; and she
                    came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And
           WIDOW    he would not for a while: but afterward he said within him-
                    self, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because
                    this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her con-
                    tinual coming she weary me." Luke 18:2-5.

                       Why did the judge finally decide to listen to the widow's
                    plea and obtain justice for her? Verse 5.

                       Jesus in this parable presents the character of God through
                    contrast. "Christ here draws a sharp contrast between the un-
                    just judge and God. The judge yielded to the widow's request
                    merely through selfishness, that he might be relieved of her
                    importunity. He felt for her no pity or compassion; her misery
                    was nothing to him. How different is the attitude of God toward
                    those who seek Him. The appeals of the needy and distressed
                    are considered by Him with infinite compassion."—Christ's Ob-
                    ject Lessons, page 165.
                       God is not coerced into helping man. He never forgets His
                    earth children. See Isaiah 49:15, 16. Though all earthly or
                    human ties be broken, yet God will not forget us. Jesus re-
                    flected this concern for the needy of His day.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Do I extend help to those in need because I feel I have
                    to, or do I respond to their needs cheerfully from a loving
                    and helpful heart?

                        "The woman who entreated the judge for justice had lost her
                    husband by death. Poor and friendless, she had no means of
                    retrieving her ruined fortunes. So by sin, man lost his connec-
                    tion with God. Of himself he has no means of salvation. But
                    in Christ we are brought nigh unto the Father. The elect of
                    God are dear to His heart. They are those whom He has called
                    out of darkness into His marvelous light, to show forth His
                    praise, to shine as lights amid the darkness of the world. The
                    unjust judge had no special interest in the widow who impor-
                    tuned him for deliverance; yet in order to rid himself of her
                    pitiful appeals, he heard her plea, and delivered her from her
                    adversary. But God loves His children with infinite love. To
                    Him the dearest object on earth is His church."—Christ's

             Part 5       "And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out
       PETER'S PLEA   of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when
                      he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning
          FOR HELP    to sink, he cried, saying, Lord save me." Matt. 14:29, 30.

                         "Looking unto Jesus, Peter walks securely; but as in self-
                      satisfaction he glances back toward his companions in the
                      boat, his eyes are turned from the Saviour. The wind is boister-
                      ous. The waves roll high, and come directly between him and
                      the Master; and he is afraid. For a moment Christ is hidden
                      from his view, and his faith gives way. He begins to sink. But
                      while the billows talk with death, Peter lifts his eyes from the
                      angry waters, and fixing them upon Jesus, cries, 'Lord, save
                      me.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 381.

                         How did Jesus respond to Peter's desperate plea? Matt.
                      14:31.

                         Peter was in the predicament of being about to perish in
                      the turbulent water through His own pride and self-conceit.
                      Being able to walk on water, while his friends remained in the
                      boat, Peter took his eyes off Jesus in complacent satisfaction
                      over his achievement. Then he began to sink. Too late he
                      recognized that walking on water was not his own accomplish-
                      ment; Jesus alone had enabled him to do it. As he suddenly
                      recognized this, he cried out to Jesus in desperation for im-
                      mediate help. Instant help from the Master saved him.

 THINK IT THROUGH        When have I, like Peter, taken the glory to myself, al-
                      though it is only through God's enabling grace I am able
                      to do anything good and worthwhile?


                         "When trouble comes upon us, how often we are like Peter!
                      We look upon the waves, instead of keeping our eyes fixed
                      upon the Saviour. Our footsteps slide, and the proud waters go
                      over our souls. Jesus did not bid Peter come to Him that
                      he should perish; He does not call us to follow Him, and then
                      forsake us. 'Fear not,' He says; 'for I have redeemed thee, I
                      have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine. When thou passest
                      through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers,
                      they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire,
                      thou shalt not be burned; neither shall, the flame kindle upon
                      thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy

            Part 6      "At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto
       THE FATHER    you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself
                     loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed
 HIMSELF LOVES US    that I came out from God." John 16:26, 27.

                        God the Father loved and does love us. He does not love
                     us because God the Son, Jesus, loved us and gave His life
                     for us; rather, the Father was willing to give His Son for our
                     redemption because He Himself loves us. See John 3:16. Thus
                     as Jesus readily heard and responded to the pleas of sincere
                     men, so does God the Father.

                        Is God's love for men dependent on their repentance of
                     sin and acceptance of His plan for them? Rom. 5:8.

                         Jesus demonstrated the nature of God's love. He came to
                     call and save sinners. Luke 5:32; Matt. 9:13. He loves sinners,
                     and He came to save and deliver them from their sins. Even
                     though He was willing to give His life for sinners, sin cannot
                     exist in the presence of God. "For our God is a consuming
                     fire" (Heb. 12:29) to sin. God does not change or vary. He
                     remains constant. But to some He is the source of destruction
                     or a burning fire (Isa. 33:14; 2 Thess. 2:8, 9; Rev. 6:15-17),
                     because they retain sin, while to others He is the source of
                     exceeding joy (Isa. 25:9). God is both justice and mercy. Which
                     way He manifests Himself is determined by the character of
                     the persons to whom He appears.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Do I realize that, although God is love, He will become a
                     source of destruction to me unless I let Him save me from
                     sin?

                         "Christ's lessons in regard to prayer should be carefully
                     considered. There is a divine science in prayer, and His illus-
                     tration brings to view principles that all need to understand.
                     He shows what is the true spirit of prayer, He teaches the ne-
                     cessity of perseverance in presenting our requests to God, and
                     assures us of His willingness to hear and answer prayer."—

                         "When perplexities arise, and difficulties confront you, look
                     not for help to humanity. Trust all with God. The practice of
                     telling our difficulties to others only makes us weak, and brings
                     no strength to them. It lays upon them the burden of our
                     spiritual infirmities, which they cannot relieve. We seek the
                     strength of erring, finite man, when we might have the strength
                     of the unerring, infinite God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page

    GOD IS LIKE THIS-


        He Is
    Concerned for
     Individuals
   "But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not there-
fore: ye are of more value than many sparrows." Luke 12:7.


   Too often we have no time for individuals. We deal with groups of people—
with classes or committees—but we neglect to talk to one person. individually.
Jesus took time to talk with single individuals. He still deals with us as persons
and is concerned with our personal problems.
    From the Gospels the reader gains the impression that Jesus spent more
of His time talking to individuals than preaching to crowds. His healing ministry
was of necessity a one-to-one relationship. And "during His, ministry Jesus
devoted more time to healing the sick than to preaching—The Desire of
Ages, page 350.
    "The work of Christ was largely made up of personal interviews. He had a
faithful regard for the one-soul audience. From that one soul the intelligence
received was carried to thousands."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 115.
    The concern of Jesus for the individuals whom He met on His earthly sojourn
demonstrated the concern that the heavenly Father has for every one of us.
"He knows each individual by name, and cares for each as if there were not
another upon the earth for whom He gave His beloved Son."—The Ministry of
Healing, page 229.

               Part 1      "There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a
      NOCTURAL VISIT    ruler of the Jews: the same came to Jesus by night, and said
                        unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from
     WITH NICODEMUS     God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except
                        God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily,
                        verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot
                        see the kingdom of God." John 3:1-3.

                            Read also John 3:4-21.
                            Nicodemus possessed great talents, was highly educated,
                         and was an honored member of the Sanhedrin, the highest
                         council among the Jews. See The Desire of Ages, page 167.
                         Although rich, learned, and honored, he was strangely stirred
                         by the teachings of the unschooled Teacher from Nazareth.
                         With his countrymen he looked for the promised Messiah to
                         deliver His people from the Roman oppression their sins had
                         brought upon them. As he observed the work of Jesus in the
                         light of the Messianic prophecies, he thought he discerned in
                        Him the promised Deliverer.
                            "In the interview with Nicodemus, Jesus unfolded the plan
                        of salvation and His mission to the world. In none of His sub-
                        sequent discourses did He explain so fully, step by step, the
                        work necessary to be done in the hearts of all who would
                        inherit the kingdom of heaven."—The Desire of Ages, page
                        176.
                           What apparently happened to the seed Jesus placed in
                        Nicodemus' heart during this night visit? John 7:45-52;
                        19:38-40.

                           "The lesson that Christ had given to Nicodemus had not
                        been in vain. Conviction had fastened upon his mind, and in
                        his heart he had accepted Jesus. Since his interview with the
                        Saviour, he had earnestly searched the Old Testament Scrip-
                        tures, and he had seen truth placed in the true setting of the
                        gospel."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

 THINK IT THROUGH          How can I gain the courage and willingness to speak to
                        one person alone?

                            The eighteenth century French preacher Bousset said: "It
                        requires more faith and courage to say two words face-to-face
                        with one sinner, than from the pulpit to rebuke two or three
                        thousand persons, ready to listen to everything, on condition
                        of forgetting all."

           Part 2      "Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called
          AT THE    Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his
                    son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore,
     SYCHAR WELL    being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it
                    was about the sixth hour. There cometh a. woman of Samaria
                    to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink." John
                    4:5-7.
                       Read also John 4:8-42.
                       "As she turned to go away, Jesus asked her for a drink.
                    Such a favor no Oriental would withhold. In the East, water
                    was called 'the gift of God.' To offer a drink to the thirsty
                    traveler was held to be a duty so sacred that the Arabs of the
                    desert would go out of their way in order to perform it. The
                    hatred between Jews and Samaritans prevented the woman
                    from offering a kindness to Jesus; but the Saviour was seeking
                    to find the key to this heart, and with the tact born of divine
                    love, He asked, not offered, a favor."—The Desire of Ages,
                    pages 183, 184.
                       Jesus was anxious to reach the woman. Although a Samari-
                    tan and a sinner, He knew she was susceptible to truth. Truth
                    pierced her assumed casualness and reached into her heart.
                    In response to the earnest words of Jesus "her light, bantering
                    manner began to change."—The Desire of Ages, page 184.
                       What confession did she make after Jesus had unveiled to
                    her the secrets of her sinful life? John 4:19.
                      After Jesus had told her He was the looked-for Messiah,
                    what did the woman do, and how fruitful was the personal
                    work for one lone woman? John 4:28-39.
                       "As soon as she had found the Saviour the Samaritan woman
                    brought others to Him. She proved herself a more effective mis-
                    sionary than His own disciples. . . . Through the woman whom
                    they [the disciples] despised, a whole cityful were brought to
                    hear the Saviour. She carried the light at once to her country-

                       "As Jesus spoke of the living water, the woman looked upon
                    Him with wondering attention. He had aroused her interest, and
                    awakened a desire for the gift of which He spoke. . . .
                       "Before this soul could receive the gift He longed to bestow,

             Part 3      "And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath
      JESUS PRAYED    desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I
                      have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou
         FOR PETER    art converted, strengthen thy brethren." Luke 22:31, 32.

                         Jesus was personally concerned with Peter's salvation. He
                      therefore did not merely pray for the disciples, or for the
                      church, as is indicated in John 17:9, 15, 20, but He prayed for
                      Peter personally. He foretold his full and complete conversion
                      after which he would feed the lambs and the sheep of the
                      Lord. See John 21:14-17.
                        After the resurrection, when Jesus appeared to "Mary
                      Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome,"
                      according to Mark 16:1 (see Matt. 28:9), how did He again
                      show His concern for Peter? Mark 16:7.

                         Jesus knew that Peter needed special encouragement after
                      his denial in the judgment hall. Hence, He sent a special mes-
                      sage to him and also appeared to Peter, before He appeared
                      to any of the other disciples. See Luke 24:34 and 1 Cor. 15:5.
                         "'Tell His disciples and Peter,' the angels said. Since the
                      death of Christ, Peter had been bowed down with remorse.
                      His shameful denial of the Lord, and the Saviour's look of
                      love and anguish, were ever before him. Of all the disciples
                      he had suffered most bitterly. To him the assurance is given
                      that his repentance is accepted and his sin forgiven. He is
                      mentioned by name."—The Desire of Ages, page 793.
THINK IT THROUGH          In what ways do I come short of being as solicitous as
                      was Jesus to rebuild and restore the courage and the sense
                      of belonging of one who has been trapped by Satan and
                      fallen into sin?

                         "Peter was naturally forward and impulsive, and Satan had
                      taken advantage of these characteristics to overthrow him. Just
                      before the fall of Peter, Jesus had said to him, 'Satan hath
                      desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have
                      prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art con-
                      verted, strengthen thy brethren.' Luke 22:31, 32. That time had
                      now come, and the transformation in Peter was evident. The
                      close, testing questions of the Lord had not called out one
                      forward, self-sufficient reply; and because of his humiliation
                      and repentance, Peter was better prepared than ever before
                      to act as shepherd to the flock."—The Desire of Ages, page

            Part 4      "So when Jesus saw his mother and his favourite disciple
  JESUS' CARE FOR    standing near, he said to his mother, 'Woman, there is your
                     son!' Then he said to the disciple, 'And, there is your mother!'
      HIS MOTHER     And from that hour the disciple took her to his home." John
                     19:26, 27, Moffatt.

                        Even in His hour of excruciating pain on the cross Jesus
                     was not oblivious of the future needs of His mother. As a lov-
                     ing son who would be unable to care for her in the future, Jesus
                     at the cross committed her to the care of John. John was tender
                     and loving and would give to her the care an aging woman
                     needed.
                         "The last lesson of Jesus was one of filial love. He looked
                     upon the grief-stricken face of His mother, and then upon
                     John; said He, addressing the former: 'Woman, behold thy
                     son!' Then, to the disciple: 'Behold thy mother!' John 19:27.
                     John well understood the words of Jesus, and the sacred trust
                     which was committed to him. He immediately removed the
                     mother of Christ from the fearful scene of Calvary. From that
                     hour he cared for her as would a dutiful son, taking her to his
                     own home. The perfect example of Christ's filial love shines
                     forth with undimmed luster from the mist of ages. While en-
                      during the keenest torture, He was not forgetful of His mother,
                     but made all provision necessary for her future."—The Story
                     of Redemption, page 224.

                        How did Jesus' provision for His mother fit into God's
                     instruction in the Old Testament concerning children's rela-
                     tionship to parents? Ex. 20:12.

                        Our first mundane duty is or should be toward our parents.
                     This is pointed out both in the Old and the New Testaments.
                     See Lev. 19:3; Deut. 5:16; Eph. 6:1-3; Col. 3:20. Jesus lived
                     by this precept.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How does my concern for my parents' needs compare with
                     that of Jesus for His mother?

                        "For nearly thirty years Jesus by His daily toil had helped
                     bear the burdens of the home. And now, even in His last agony,
                     He remembers to provide for His sorrowing, widowed mother.
                     The same spirit will be seen in every disciple of our Lord. Those
                     who follow Christ will feel that it is a part of their religion to
                     respect and provide for their parents. From the heart where
                     His love is cherished, father and mother will never fail of re-

             Part 5    "And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them
   JESUS' REPLY TO to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we
                    for another? When the men were come unto him, they said,
JOHN THE BAPTIST'S John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that
           INQUIRY should come? or look we for another?" Luke 7:19, 20.

                        In the gloom of imprisonment in the damp dungeon of Herod
                     Antipas the poison of doubt in Jesus as the promised Messiah
                     entered John's mind. These doubts were instilled by John's own
                     disciples. "Doubts which otherwise would never have arisen
                     were suggested to John. Satan rejoiced to hear the words of
                     these disciples, and to see how they bruised the soul of the
                     Lord's messenger. Oh, how often those who think themselves
                     the friends of a good man, and who are eager to show their
                     fidelity to him, prove to be his most dangerous enemies! How
                     often, instead of strengthening his faith, their words depress
                     and dishearten!"—The Desire of Ages, page 215.
                        How did Jesus answer the anxious queries of John's dis-
                     ciples, and what were they to report to John the Baptist?
                     Luke 7:21-23.
                        Jesus was aware of the troubled forebodings in the mind
                     of His forerunner and friend. These were grounded in his mis-
                     understanding of Christ's kingdom. He knew the reasons for
                     John's perplexity; therefore He did not dismiss the messengers
                     and their inquiry as foolish and unwarranted. He' invited them ,
                     to remain with Him and observe His work of healing and teach-

                     were coming to Him to be healed. The blind were groping their
                     way through the crowd; diseased ones of all classes, some
                     urging their own way, some borne by their friends, were eagerly

                                                                     February 7

          Part 6       "But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
   GOD KNOWS US     Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many spar-
                    rows." Luke 12:7.
       MINUTELY
                         Jesus assures us that He knows us individually. He knows
                    the unique circumstances and peculiar needs of each one of
                    us.
                         "God cares for everything and sustains everything that He
                    has created. He who upholds the unnumbered worlds through-
                    out immensity, at the same time cares for the wants of the
                    little brown sparrow that sings its humble song without fear.
                    When men go forth to their daily toil, as when they engage in
                    prayer; when they lie down at night, and when they rise in the
                    morning; when the rich man feasts in his palace, or when the
                    poor man gathers his children about the scanty board, each is
                    tenderly watched by the heavenly Father. No tears are shed
                    that God does not notice. There is no smile that He does not
                    mark."—Steps to Christ, page 86.

                       How had God in the Old Testament expressed His aware-
                    ness of the singular conditions and experiences of each in-
                    dividual? Ps. 87:4-6; 56:8.

                        James Moffat, in A New Translation of the Bible, renders
                    Psalm 56:8: "Thou countest up my sleepless hours, my tears
                    are gathered in thy bottle—are they not noted in thy book?"
                        God is aware of the conditions under which every one of
                    us is born and reared as well as the unique circumstances of
                    each person. When God shall write up His people, He will keep
                    all this in mind.
                        It is our impression of having been forgotten by everyone
                    —or our impression of complete aloneness—that at times
                    makes our lot seem almost unbearable. If we could only re-
                    member that God is aware of us and that He still watches over
                    us, we would indeed acclaim Him as our God as did Nathanael
                    (see John 1:49), and our despair would evaporate. His promise
                    to you and me today is this: "If we surrender our lives to His
                    service, we can never be placed in a position for which God
                    has not made provision. Whatever may be our situation, we
                    have a Guide to direct our way; whatever our perplexities, we
                    have a sure Counselor; whatever our sorrow, bereavement, or
                    loneliness, we have a sympathizing Friend."—Christ's Object
                    Lessons, page 173.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What instances or experiences can I recall from my own
                    life that convince me that God knows about my peculiar or
                    unique needs and that He cares for me?

"The Lord saw our fallen condition;
He saw our need of grace, and because
He loved our souls, He has given us
grace and peace. Grace means favor to
one who is undeserving, to one who
is lost. The fact that we are sinners,
instead of shutting us away from the
mercy and love of God, makes the ex-
ercise of His love to us a positive ne-
cessity in order that we may be saved."

GOD IS LIKE THIS-


                   He Gives
                    Grace
    "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it
is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast." Eph. 2:8, 9.

   Man in himself is hopelessly lost. He may long for and strive for salvation,
but he cannot attain to it. Only death—eternal death—awaits man as a result
of his sin. "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23.
Thus all men, left to themselves, are doomed to death.
   But does not God have a law? Cannot the law help man to attain salvation?
Yes, God does have a law, but there is no possibility that man can receive help
from the law. A law, the violation of which demands the life of the transgressor,
cannot save anyone. Everyone who has violated it in the least particular can
only look forward to death. This is man's sore plight. Although man was created
to live for time and for eternity, he squandered this opportunity and privilege
through sin. Through sin man became doomed to extinction. But through His
grace God saves us. Jesus' teachings reflect to us the grace of God toward
unworthy, but repentant, sinners.
   "Grace is an attribute of God exercised toward undeserving human beings.
We did not seek for it, but it was sent in search of us. God rejoices to bestow
His grace upon us, not because we are worthy, but because we are so utterly
unworthy. Our only claim to His mercy is our great need.
    "The Lord God through Jesus Christ holds out His hand all the day long
in invitation to the sinful and fallen. He will receive all. He welcomes all. It is
His glory to pardon the chief of sinners."—The Ministry of Healing, page 161.

        THE REWARD      householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
                        labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed witl,
         FOR LABOR      the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vine
                        yard." Matt. 20:1, 2.

                           This parable was preceded by the incident of the rich younc
                       ruler who approached the Master Teacher asking what gooc
                       thing he should do to have eternal life. Against the background
                       of the disciples' having left all to follow Jesus, Peter ques-
                       tioned; "What shall we have therefore?" See Matt. 19:27-30
                       In answer to this question Christ showed the part played by
                       grace in the Christian life.
                           The New English Bible, instead of "a penny a day," says
                       the offer was "the usual day's wage." The Interpreter's Bible
                       (Vol. 7, p. 490) suggests that "a penny" denotes a generous
                       wage for that time and place. Lange's Commentary (Vol. 8,
                       p. 352) points out that a "shilling would be a far better popular
                       equivalent for a denarius than penny." And cites as evidence
                       that "Polybius (11. 15) mentions that the charge for a day's en-
                       tertainment in the inns of Cisalpine Gaul (today's northern Italy)
                       was only . . . one twentieth of a denarius." Hence "a penny a
                       day" denotes good pay for a day's work.

                          What is the meaning of the illustration of the camel and
                       the needle's eye? Matt. 19:24, 26.

                          "It is only through the unmerited grace of Christ that any
                       man can find entrance into the city of God."—Christ's Object

                          How does this conform to the words of God through the
                       prophet Isaiah? Isa. 55:1.

 THINK IT THROUGH         What is my motive in serving God?

                           "In the parable the first laborers agreed to work for a stipu-
                        lated sum, and they received the amount specified, nothing
                        more. Those later hired believed the master's promise, 'What-

                       the generosity of his purpose.

                     Read also Matt. 20:5-7.
                     Hour after hour the householder called other men to work
                  in his vineyard. With these he agreed about no wage. He only
                  promised that "whatsoever is right I will give you." These men
                  responded to the call. They did not argue nor haggle abdut

                     Would you regard it as foolish to accept employment
                  without knowing the exact wages you were to receive for
                  your service?
                     It all depends upon your confidence in the party which
                  hires you and how urgently you need employment. It is con-
                  ceivable that a person may have unbounded confidence in his
                  employer, or need money so badly, that he will do whatever
                  work is offered him without inquiring about the rate of pay.
                     "The Lord desires us to rest in Him without a question as
                  to our measure of reward. When Christ abides in the soul, the
                  thought of reward is not uppermost. This is not the motive
                  that actuates our service. It is true that in a subordinate sense
                  we should have respect to the recompense of reward. God de-
                  sires us to appreciate His promised blessings. But He would
                  not have us eager for rewards nor feel that for every duty we
                  must receive compensation. We should not be so anxious to
                  gain the reward as to do what is right, irrespective of all gain.
                  Love to God and to our fellow men should be our motive."

He Gives Grace LESSON 7                                                    ❑ Tuesday
                                                                           February 11

             Part 3      "So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith
          SAME PAY    unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire,
                      beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came
          FOR EACH    that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every
                      man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that
                      they should have received more; and they likewise received
                      every man a penny." Matt. 20:8-10.


                        , "The reception of the penny by the laborers represents the
                      character that God will give to those who follow Him."—Ellen
                      Gr. White, Review and Herald, July 10, 1894.
                           At first sight it might appear unfair to give the same wage
                      to ,all laborers regardless of the length of time they worked.
                      But when we realize what the penny represents, we humbly
                      recognize that it is a gift of God's grace to all of us.
                           To the first servants, the Jews, as to the last servants hired,
                      the Gentiles, the penny—salvation—was a gift of God's grace.
                      Everyone who appreciates God's gift of salvation will rejoice
                      that he was called or found by God in the early morning of
                      life, rather than saved at the last moment like the thief on the
                      cross.

 THINK IT THROUGH         How disinterestedly do I serve God without comparing my
                      lot with that of others?


                          "Not the amount of labor performed or its visible results
                      but the spirit in which the work is done makes it of value with
                      God. Those who came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour
                      waVe thankful for an opportunity to work. Their hearts were
                      full of gratitude to the one who had accepted them; and when
                      at the close of the day the householder paid them for a full
                      day's work, they were greatly surprised. They knew they had
                      not earned such wages. And the kindness expressed in the
                      countenance of their employer filled them with joy. They never
                      forgot the goodness of the householder or the generous com-
                      pensation they had received. Thus it is with the sinner who,
                      knowing his unworthiness, has entered the Master's vineyard
                      at the eleventh hour. His time of service seems so short, he
                      feels that he is undeserving of reward; but he is filled with
                      joy that God has accepted him at all. He works with a humble,
                      trusting spirit, thankful for the privilege of being a co-worker
                      with Christ. This spirit God delights to honor."—Christ's Object

He Gives Grace LESSON 7                                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      February 12

            Part 4      "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which
   THE INVITATION    made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to
                     call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would
  TO THE WEDDING     not come." Matt. 22:2, 3.

                          "In this parable, as in that of the great supper, are illus-
                     trated the gospel invitation, its rejection by the Jewish people,
                     and the call of mercy to the Gentiles."—Christ's Object Les-
                     sons, page 307.
                          Although similar to the parable of the great supper in Luke
                     14:16-24, this story teaches different truths. Like the former,
                     it illustrated the rejection of the gospel invitation by the Jews
                     and the giving of the invitation to the Gentiles. "This was the
                     message borne to the Jewish nation after the crucifixion of
                     Christ; but the nation that claimed to be God's peculiar people
                     rejected the gospel brought to them in the power of the Holy
                     Spirit."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 308.
                          The king in the parable represents God; the son, Jesus.
                     "By the marriage is represented the union of humanity with
                     divinity."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 307.
                        To whom was the invitation to the wedding extended upon
                     the rejection of the invitation by those first called? Matt.
                     22:8-10.

                         "He who is found wanting is cast out, but all who upon
                     examination are seen to have the wedding garment on are ac-
                     cepted of God and counted worthy of a share in His kingdom
                     and a seat upon His throne. This work of examination of char-
                     acter, of determining who are prepared for the kingdom of
                     God, is that of the investigative judgment, the closing work
                     in the sanctuary above."—The Great Controversy, page 428.

 THINK IT THROUGH      All of us are invited to the wedding, but what, in symbol
                     and experience, determines our eligibility to attend it?


                        "The man who came to the feast without a wedding garment
                     represents the condition of many in our world today. They
                     profess to be Christians, and lay claim to the blessings and
                     privileges of the gospel; yet they feel no need of a transforma-
                     tion of character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 315.
                        "There will be no future probation in which to prepare for
                     eternity. It is in this life that we are to put on the robe of
                     Christ's righteousness."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 319.

He Gives Grace LESSON 7                                                ❑ Thursday
                                                                       February 13

              Part 5    "And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw
     EXAMINATION OF there a man which had not on a wedding garment: and he
                     saith unto him, Friend, how tamest thou in hither not having
         THE GUESTS a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then said the
                     king to .the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him
                     away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weep-
                     ing and gnashing of teeth." Matt. 22:11-13.
                         "The guests at the gospel feast are those who profess to
                     serve God, those whose names are written in the book of life."
                     —Christ's Object Lessons, page 310.
                         "Previous to the wedding the king comes in to see the
                     guests, to see if all are attired in the wedding garment, the
                     spotless robe of character washed and made white in the blood
                     of the Lamb."—The Great Controversy, page 428.
                        It might appear unfair for the groom's father to throw out
                     a poor guest at his son's wedding who could not afford formal
                     attire. But it was not. Every guest had been offered suitable
                     apparel by the groom's father. Hence, it was an insult to the
                     wedding party for the guest not to wear it.
                        God has invited every one of us to His wedding feast in
                     heaven. To be fit for heavenly society He offers us the garment
                     of Christ's righteousness.
                         What was done to the guest who did not wear the wed-
                     ding garment? Matt. 22:13, 14.
                        Lest we come away from the study of this parable more self-
                     righteous and calloused to God's invitation to salvation ex-
                     tended to every one of us, we will turn our attention away
                     from the Jewish nation and their rejection of God's plan to
                     ourselves. God is inviting every one of us—and the whole
                     world—to His wedding feast. The call in this parable is a per-
                     sonal call to each one of us.
 THINK IT THROUGH       How do I receive the messengers of faith, both through
                     the Bible and the inspired writings and through His mouth-
                     pieces today, and their pleas to me?
                        "The spiritual banquet has been set before us in rich abun-
                     dance. We have had presented to us by the messengers of
                     God the richest feast—the righteousness of Christ, justification
                     by faith, the exceeding great and precious promises of God
                     in His Word, free access to the Father by Jesus Christ, the
                     comforts of the Holy Spirit, and the well-grounded assurance
                     of eternal life in the kingdom of God. We ask, What could God
                     do for us that He has not done in preparing the great supper,
                     the heavenly banquet?"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

He Gives Grace      LESSON 7                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                       February 14

           Part 6   "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not
       SALVATION of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any
                  man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in
        IS A GIFT Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before or-
                    dained that we should walk in them." Eph. 2:8-10.

                        Remembering that the penny, received as payment by the
                    laborers in the vineyard, represents the character of Christ, it
                    is obvious that no one can earn it or attain to such a state of
                    maturity or perfection in their own wisdom and strength. We
                    are to receive the character of Christ as a gift from God. In
                    this way we become partakers of the divine nature.
                        We are forgiven for committed sins through Christ's death.
                    This is justification, "our title to heaven," by which we are ac-
                    counted righteous for Christ's sake, or for what He has done
                    for us in response to our change of attitude toward Him and
                    His will. Then we shall be preserved or given enabling power
                    to resist temptation successfully through Christ's living out His
                    life within us through the Holy Spirit; this is sanctification
                    which is "our fitness for heaven." See Messages to Young
                    People, page 35.

                      For what purpose did God send His Son into the world?
                    Matt. 1:21.

                       Jesus came and died for us not merely to earn the right to
                    forgive us for sins committed but to save us or deliver us from
                    the bondage of sin. God had sent Him according to the proph-
                    ecy of Isaiah not merely "to bind up the brokenhearted" but
                    "to proclaim, liberty to the captives, and the opening of the
                    prison to them that are bound." In. 61:1; cf. 42:7.
                       To attain to God's plan for us we need not merely forgiving
                    grace but sustaining or preserving grace. It was for such grace
                    that Jesus daily implored His Father. "Christ during His life
                    on earth sought His Father daily for fresh supplies of needed
                    grace."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 56.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Do I expect to sin continuously, or do I believe Jesus can
                    give me power to become victorious over the tempter?

                       "Christ always separates the contrite soul from sin. He came
                    to destroy the works of the devil, and He has made provision
                    that the Holy Spirit shall be imparted to every repentant soul;
                    to keep him from sinning."—The Desire of Ages, page 311.

            GOD IS LIKE THIS-




   "Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I
will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock." Maft. 7:24.
    It is God who initiated the search for man in sin. He has loved man before
man responded in any way to His loving overtures. But God's loving search is
in the hope of a voluntary, loving response from man. The response for which
God looks is not only the inner response of man's mind, but a whole-life re-
sponse of man to God's revealed will. Thought and action combined is the only
valid response to God when man is found of Him.
    Jesus repeatedly taught this principle. It comes to light clearly in the parable
of,the houses built on rock and on sand. But Jesus not only taught obedience;
He Himself obeyed the Father. Thus by His teachings and His life He revealed
that God requires man's obedience.
    "Christ came to the world with the accumulated love of eternity. Sweeping
away the exactions which had encumbered the law of God, He showed that the
law is a law of love, an expression of the Divine Goodness. He showed that
in obedience to its principles is involved the happiness of mankind, and with
it the stability, the very foundation and framework, of human society.
    "So far from making arbitrary requirements, God's law is given to men as
a hedge, a shield. Whoever accepts its principles is preserved from evil. Fidel-
ity to God involves fidelity to man. Thus the law guards the rights, the individ-
uality, of every human being. It restrains the superior from oppression, and
the subordinate from disobedience. It ensures man's well-being, both for this
world and for the world to come. To the obedient it is the pledge of eternal
life, for it expresses the principles that endure forever.
    "Christ came to demonstrate the value of the divine principles by revealing
their power for the regeneration of humanity. He came to teach how these prin-
ciples are to be developed and applied."—Education, pages 76, 77.

              Part 1      What condition for friendship with Him did Jesus state?
           FRIENDS        "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you."
                       John 15:14.
           OF JESUS
                           In ordinary human friendships obedience is not a require-
                        ment. For one to insist that his friends obey him places a
                        strain on the relationship that will probably destroy it. But the
                        relationship of the believer to Jesus is no ordinary friendship,
                        because Jesus redeemed man. Obedience characterizes the
                        servant-master relationship. But the obedience that Jesus re-
                        quires is not the blind obedience of a servant. Jesus said
                        (verse 15) that He revealed to them what the Father revealed
                        to Him and therefore they were His friends, not merely His
                        servants. The disciples were to obey Jesus because they under-
                        stood His requirements. If, knowing Jesus' identity and His
                        requirements, the disciples refused to obey Him, they would
                        thus reject His friendship. Jesus pointed to His heavenly Father
                        as the source of the commands that they were to understand,
                       accept, and obey because they were Jesus' friends.
                           Jesus placed no burden on the disciples that He Himself
                       had not borne. Jesus said (verse 10) that He had kept His
                       Father's commandments. This was exactly the requirement that
                       He sought to lay upon the disciples.
                           "We give evidence of being the friends of Christ when we
                       manifest implicit obedience to His will. It is no evidence to
                       say, and do not; but in doing, in obeying, is the evidence. Who
                       are obeying the commandment to love one another as Christ
                       has loved them?"—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 691.
                           "The test is: What are you doing for Christ? What sacrifices
                       are you making? What victories are you gaining? A selfish
                       spirit overcome, a temptation to neglect duty resisted, passion
                       subdued, and willing, cheerful obedience rendered to the will
                       of Christ are far greater evidences that you are a child of God
                       than spasmodic piety and emotional religion."—Testimonies,

 THINK IT THROUGH         Why do I obey Jesus?

                          "When men are bound together, not by force or self-interest,
                       but by love, they show the working of an influence that is
                       above every human influence. Where this oneness exists, it
                       is evidence that the image of God is being restored in hu-
                       manity, that a new principle of life has been implanted. It
                       shows that there is power in the divine nature to withstand
                       the supernatural agencies of evil, and that the grace of God
                       subdues the selfishness inherent in the natural heart."—The

             Part 2      "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he
RELATIVES OF JESUS    stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Be-
                      hold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do
                      the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my
                      brother, and sister, and mother." Matt. 12:48-50.
                        Jesus had - no lack of love for the members of His family,
                      but He here pointed out that allegiance to the Father super-
                      sedes human relationships. A prime purpose of Christ's life
                      was to attract people to do God's will. He taught that if they
                      would respond to His teaching, they would hold a relation to
                      Him that was closer than that of nearest relatives.
                         How important did Jesus regard the obedience to His
                      Father's will in His own life? John 4:34.
                          "God stands toward His people in the relation of a father,
                      and He has a father's claim to our faithful service. Consider the
                      life of Christ. Standing at the head of humanity, serving His
                      Father, He is an example of what every son should and may be.
                      The obedience that Christ rendered God requires from human
                      beings today. He served His Father with love, in willingness and
                      freedom. . . . Christ counted no sacrifice too great, no toil
                      too hard, in order to accomplish the work which He came to
                      do....
                          "Thus we are to serve God. He only serves who acts up
                      to the highest standard of obedience. All who would be sons
                      and daughters of God must prove themselves co-workers with
                      God and Christ and the heavenly angels. This is the test for
                      every soul."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 282, 283.
 THINK IT THROUGH          "When He gives you the mind of Christ, your will becomes
                      as His will, and your character is transformed to be like
                      Christ's character. Is it your purpose to do God's will? Do
                      you wish to obey the Scriptures?"—"Testimonies/' Vol. 5,
                      p. 515.
                          'There is no such thing as following Christ unless you refuse
                      to gratify inclination and determine to obey God. It is not your
                      feelings, your emotions, that make you a child of God, but
                      the doing of God's will. A life of usefulness is before you if
                      your will becomes God's will. Then you may stand in your God-
                      given manhood, an example of good works. You will then help
                      to maintain rules of discipline instead of helping to break them
                      down. You will then help to maintain order instead of despising
                      it and inciting to irregularity of life by your own course of
                      action. I tell you in the fear of God: I know what you may be

             Part 3   What persons did Jesus say would enter the kingdom?
         BELIEVERS    "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
        IN JESUS—I into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of
                     my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that
                     day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and
                     in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done
                     many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I
                     never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
                     Matt. 7:21-23.

                         Jesus did not here teach that the doing of the Father's will
                     is the means by which the saved gain an entrance into the
                     kingdom, but only that all those who enter the kingdom have
                     done His will. People are redeemed by Christ. As a result of
                     this redemption they will obey His will. For one to continue in
                     sin, refusing to do God's will, negates redemption. This teach-
                     ing of Jesus calls attention to two results of salvation by faith:
                     (1) obedience to the heavenly Father, and (2) entrance into
                     the kingdom. Faith must be adequate to accomplish the first
                     result if it is to accomplish the second result.
                         "A mere profession of discipleship is of no value. The faith
                     in Christ which saves the soul is not what it is represented to
                     be by many. 'Believe, believe,' they say, 'and you need not
                     keep the law.' But a belief that does not lead to obedience
                     is presumption. The apostle John says, 'He that saith, I know
                     Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the
                     truth is not in him.' 1 John 2:4. Let none cherish the idea that
                     special providences or miraculous manifestations are to be
                     the proof of the genuineness of their work or of the ideas
                     they advocate. When persons will speak lightly of the word of
                     God, and set their impressions, feelings, and exercises above
                     the divine standard, we may know that they have no light in
                     them."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 146.

THINK IT THROUGH         "1 entreat you who have long professed the faith and who
                     still pay outward homage to Christ: Do not deceive your own
                     souls. It is the whole heart that Jesus prizes. The loyalty of
                     the soul is alone of value in the sight of God."—"Testimonies,"

           Part 4      Jesus followed His teaching on doing the Father's will with
       BELIEVERS    His parable of the houses built on rock and on sand.
     IN JESUS—II       Read Matthew 7:24-27.
                       What is the meaning of building on the rock? Verse 24.

                       What is the meaning of building on the sand? Verse 26.

                       "It is not enough, He says, for you to hear My words. By
                    obedience you must make them the foundation of your char-
                    acter. Self is but shifting sand. If you build upon human the-
                    ories and inventions, your house will fall. By the winds of
                    temptation, the tempests of trial, it will be swept away. But
                    these principles that I have given will endure. Receive Me;
                    build on My words."—The Desire of Ages, page 314.
                       "There are many in the church who at heart              to the
                    world, but God calls upon those who claim to      to believe the
                    advanced truth, to rise above the present attitude of the pop-
                    ular churches 'of to-day. Where is the self-denial, where is the
                    cross-bearing that Christ has said should characterize His
                    followers? The reason we have had so little influence upon
                    unbelieving relatives and associates is that we have mani-
                    fested little decided difference in our Practices from those of
                    the world. Parents need to awake, and purify their souls by
                    practicing the truth in their home life. When we reach the
                    standard that the Lord would have us reach, worldlings will
                    regard Seventh-day Adventists as odd, singular, strait-laced

                        "There are two great principles, one of loyalty, the other of
                    disloyalty. We all need greater Christian courage, that we may
                    uplift the standard on which is inscribed the commandments
                    of God and the faith of Jesus. . . . The line of demarcation
                    between the obedient and the disobedient must be plain and
                    distinct. We must have a firm determination to do the Lord's
                    will at all times and in all places. . . .
                        "Christian strength is obtained by serving the Lord faith-
                    fully. Young men and young women should realize that to be
                    one with Christ is the highest honor to which they can attain.
                    By the strictest fidelity they should strive for moral indepen-
                    dence, and this independence they should maintain against

             Part 5      "Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him,
          REJECTER    One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou
                      hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
          OF JESUS    heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me." Mark
                      10:21.
                         "Christ made the only terms which could place the ruler
                      where he would perfect a Christian character. His words were
                      words of wisdom, though they appeared severe and exacting.
                      In accepting and obeying them was the ruler's only hope of
                      salvation. His exalted position and his possessions were exert-
                      ing a subtle influence for evil upon his character. If cherished,
                      they would supplant God in his affections. To keep back little
                      or much from God was to retain that which would lessen his
                      moral strength and efficiency; for if the things of this world
                      are cherished, however uncertain and unworthy they may be,
                      they will become all-absorbing."—The Desire of Ages, page
                      520.
                         "Christ's dealing with the young man is presented as an
                      object lesson. God has given us the rule of conduct which
                      every one of His servants must follow. It is obedience to His
                      law, not merely a legal obedience, but an obedience which
                      enters into the life, and is exemplified in the character. God
                      has set His own standard of character for all who would be-
                      come subjects of His kingdom. Only those who will become
                      co-workers with Christ, only those who will say, Lord, all I
                      have and all I am is Thine, will be acknowledged as sons
                      and daughters of God. All should consider what it means to
                      desire heaven, and yet to turn away because of the conditions
                      laid down. Think of what it means to say 'No' to Christ. The
                      ruler said, No, I cannot give You all. Do we say the'same? The
                      Saviour offers to share with us the work God has given us
                      to do. He offers to use the means God has given us, to carry
                      forward His work in the world. Only in this way can He save
                      us."—The Desire of Ages, page 523.
 THINK IT THROUGH         What temptations place me in danger of rejecting Jesus'
                      call to follow Him?

                         "Christ does not lessen the claims of the law. In unmistak-
                      able language He presents obedience to it as the condition
                      of eternal life—the same condition that was required of Adam
                      before his fall. The Lord expects no less of the soul now than
                      He expected of man in Paradise, perfect obedience, unblem-
                      ished righteousness. The requirement under the covenant of
                      grace is just as broad as the requirement made in Eden—
                      harmony with God's law, which is holy, just, and good."—

lie Requires Obedience LESSON 8                                       ❑ Friday
                                                                     February 21

          Part 6       "And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and
     EXPERIENCE     prayed, saying, 0 my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
                    pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."
       OF JESUS
                       "He went away again the second time, and prayed, say-
                    ing, 0 my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me,
                    except I drink it, thy will be done."

                        "And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the
                    third time, saying the same words." Matt. 26:39, 42, 44.


                        Jesus obeyed His heavenly Father just as He taught His
                    followers to obey Him. To obey the Father Jesus went through
                    agony and even came to the point of death in Gethsemane.
                    See The Desire of Ages, page 693. His Father's will meant
                    more to Jesus than His own existence.
                        "The words fall tremblingly from the pale lips of Jesus, '0
                    My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me, except I
                    drink it, Thy will be done.'
                        "Three times has He uttered that prayer. Three times has
                    humanity shrunk from the last, crowning sacrifice. But now
                    the history of the human race comes up before the world's
                    Redeemer. He sees that the transgressors of the law, if left
                    to themselves, must perish. He sees the helplessness of man.
                    He sees the power of sin. The woes and lamentations of a
                     doomed world rise before Him. He beholds its impending fate,
                     and His decision is made. He will save man at any cost to
                     Himself. He accepts His baptism of blood, that through Him,
                     perishing millions may gain everlasting life. He has left the
                     courts of heaven, where all is purity, happiness, and glory, to
                     save the one lost sheep, the one world that has fallen by
                     transgression. And He will not turn from His mission. He will
                     become the propitiation of a race that has willed to sin. His
                     prayer now breathes only submission: 'If this cup may not
                     pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.' "—The
                     Desire of Ages, pages 690-693.
                         The whole life of Jesus had been one of obedience to the
                     Father, and the experiences of Gethsemane and then Calvary
                     tested the ultimacy of His commitment to the Father's will.
                     Nothing that Satan or man could do to Jesus could turn Him
                     from obedience to His Father.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I successfully endure all the trials that Satan and
                    people bring upon me?

GOD IS LIKE THIS-


                  He Sustained
   "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren,
that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to
God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people." Heb. 2:17.

    Through the incarnation Jesus took upon Himself human nature. He was
born in human flesh with the weaknesses resident in human nature after cen-
turies in sin. "Jesus accepted humanity when the race had been weakened by
four thousand years of sin. Like every child of Adam He accepted the results
of the working of the great law of heredity. What these results were is shown
in the history of His earthly ancestors. He came with such a heredity to share
our sorrows and temptations, and to give us the example of a sinless life."
—The Desire of Ages, page 49.
    This week's lesson differs from previous ones by being a presentation of
the way in which the Father was reflected in the life of Jesus. Usually during
the quarter we have been studying teachings and actions of Jesus that re-
flected the Father. What Jesus did for, or said to, people showed what the
Father was like. But this week we study a truth about God that Jesus made
known—a truth growing out of His own personal relationship with the Father.
Jesus was a human being, and we can learn what the Father is willing to do
for human beings who follow Jesus by seeing what He did for Jesus Himself.
    Throughout His earthly life Jesus experienced much trouble—in His family,
from His friends, from the government, and from religious leaders. His troubles
did not come because God had forsaken Him; and the troubles of Christians
do not result because God forsakes them. His troubles came because He was
in the enemy's territory, as are we. Although Jesus was not spared from trouble,
His Father sustained Him in every difficulty. And so during this week we shall
study Jesus in the kinds of trouble we experience and see Him sustained by
the heavenly Father in the same way that the Father is willing to sustain trou-
bled Christians today.

Jesus in Trouble
He Sustained Jesus in Trouble LESSON 9                                     ❑ Sunday
                                                                          February 23

             Part 1       "He came unto his own, and his own received him not."
        HE CAME TO     John 1:11.
           HIS OWN        Jesus did not come to this earth because the prospect of
                      the incarnation was filled with pleasure for Him. "When the
                      Lord of glory left his station of high command to become a
                      man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, accepting ignominy
                      and death in order to deliver man from the consequence of
                      his disobedience, he did not consult his own convenience or
                      pleasure."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Sept. 21, 1876.
                      He came because it was the only way of delivering man from
                      sin and death.
                          What Old Testament prophecies, for instance, did the
                      Jews misinterpret in order to prove that Jesus was not the
                      promised Messiah? Isa. 24:23; Ps. 72:8.
                           "Many who were convinced that Jesus was the Son of God
                      were misled by the false reasoning of the priests and rabbis.
                      . . . They made contemptuous comparisons between the glory
                      here pictured [in Isa. 24:33; Ps. 72:8] and the humble appear-
                      ance of Jesus. The very words of prophecy were so perverted
                      as to sanction error."—The Desire of Ages, page 458.
                         What did His own townspeople at Nazareth do when He
                      returned home for a visit? Luke 4:16, 28-30; cf. John 7:1.
                         "Across the bright days of Christ's ministry in Galilee, one
                      shadow lay. The people of Nazareth rejected Him. 'Is not this
                      the carpenter's son?' they said."—The Desire of Ages, page
                      236.
                         After Jesus had fed the five thousand and they were anx-
                      ious to proclaim Him king, what did Jesus do with the
                      excited crowd? Mark 6:46; cf. John 6:15.
                         "When Christ forbade the people to declare Him king, He
                      knew that a turning point in His history was reached. Multi-
                      tudes who desired to exalt Him to the throne today would turn
                      from Him tomorrow. The disappointment of their selfish ambi-
                      tion would turn their love to hatred, and their praise to curses.
                      Yet knowing this, He took no measures to avert the crisis."

                      people know you, how do your neighbors greet your return
                      after an absence?
                        "If men could have had the world with Christ, multitudes
                      would have proffered Him their allegiance; but such service
                      He could not accept."—The Desire of Ages, page 383.

He Sustained Jesus in Trouble       LESSON 9                         ❑ Monday
                                                                     February 24

           Part 2      In His eating habits, of what was Jesus accused by the
  MISUNDERSTOOD     people?
AMONG THE PEOPLE        "The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say,
                    Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of pub-
                    licans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children."
                    Matt. 11:19.

                       John the Baptist had dressed very simply and had been
                    abstemious in his eating habits. His diet consisted of "locusts
                    and wild honey." Mark 1:6. The Jews, condemned by his sim-
                    ple eating habits, said he was devil possessed. See Matthew
                    11:18. When Jesus came and socialized over the well-spread
                    table, the same people showed their unreasonableness by ac-
                    cusing Him of gluttony.
                       Jesus was indeed a friend of publicans and sinners. "Our
                    Saviour never turned away from the truly penitent, no matter
                    how great their guilt."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald,
                    Jan. 11, 1881. Wherever there was a receptive heart, Jesus
                    went irrespective of the criticism His enemies would bring
                    against Him. He did associate and eat with the publicans
                    and sinners. See Matt. 9:9 and Luke 19:5. The acceptance of
                    salvation by such justified His sociability.
                       How did some Jews impugn His integrity? John 7:12.

                       Being the truth personified (see John 14:6), Jesus was still
                    accused of deception. He was an honest person surrounded by
                    a people preponderantly false and deceptive. He was endeav-
                    oring to deliver them from the entanglements of dishonesty
                    and insincerity.
                       What did the apostle John, later in his book of Revelation,
                    repeatedly call Jesus? Rev. 3:14; 1:5; 19:11; 22:6.

                       In our- conversations we often use the phrases "I think," "I
                    believe," "I presume," since we are not absolutely sure whether
                    or not our report is true. Jesus does not employ these phrases;
                    He knows, and what He says is reliable and true and without
                    equivocation.
 THINK IT THROUGH      How do I regard) the teachings of Jesus? Do I accept them
                    as completely true and valid, or do I also suggest that some
                    of what He says is not really so?

                       "The voice of the True Witness has been heard in reproof,
                    but has not been obeyed. Men have chosen to follow their own
                    way instead of God's way because self was not crucified in
                    them."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 720.

             Part 3    "For neither did his brethren believe in him." John 7:5.
            FAMILY     His  brothers did not accept Jesus as the promised Messiah,
                    but "from the day when she heard the angel's announcement
       AND FRIENDS in the home at Nazareth Mary had treasured every evidence
       OPPOSED HIM that Jesus was the Messiah. His sweet, unselfish life assured
                     her that He could be no other than the Sent of God. Yet there
                     came to her also doubts and disappointments, and she had
                     longed for the time when His glory should be revealed."—
                     The Desire of Ages, page 145.

                        What did His friends think of Him when they saw and
                     heard of His activities? Mark 3:21.

                        "The sons of Joseph were far from being in sympathy with
                     Jesus in His work. The reports that reached them in regard
                     to His life and labors filled them with astonishment and dismay.
                     They heard that He devoted entire nights to prayer, that through
                     the day He was thronged by great companies of people, and
                     did not give Himself time so much as to eat. His friends felt
                     that He was wearing Himself out by His incessant labor; they
                     were unable to account for His attitude toward the Pharisees,
                     and there were some who feared that His reason was becom-
                     ing unsettled."—The Desire of Ages, page 321.
                        "The enmity kindled in the human heart against the gospel
                     was keenly felt by the Son orGod, and it was most painful to
                     Him in His home; for His own heart was full of kindness and
                     love, and He appreciated tender regard in the family relation.
                     His brothers desired that He should concede to their ideas,
                     when such a course would have been utterly out of harmony
                     with His divine mission. They looked upon Him as in need of
                     their counsel."—The Desire of Ages, page 326.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How would you react if your own brothers and sisters
                     and other relatives turned against you and thought you were
                     insane when you complied with God's will for you?

                        "What a support Christ would have found in His earthly
                     relatives if they had believed in Him as one from heaven, and
                     had co-operated with Him in doing the work of God! Their un-
                     belief cast a shadow over the earthly life of Jesus. It was a
                     part of the bitterness of that cup of woe which He drained for
                     us."—The Desire of Ages, page 325.

           Part 4      "The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we
      ACCUSED OF    stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou,
                    being a man, makest thyself God." John 10:33.
      BLASPHEMY
                       Arrogating to oneself, or to man, powers, privileges, or pre-
                    rogatives that belong solely to God is blasphemy. Not knowing
                    that Jesus was God, or refusing to accept Him as God among
                    men, the Jews customarily accused Him of blasphemy when
                    He forgave sins (see Matt. 9:23; Luke 7:47-49) or claimed one-
                    ness or identity with His Father (see John 8:58, 59).

                       At the time of Jesus' trial before the high priest Caiaphas,
                    of what was Jesus again accused and why? Matt. 26:63-66.

                       Jesus was the Son of God, and He guarded His Father's
                    name and honor. But for confessing His relationship to His
                    Father He was repeatedly accused of blasphemy.
                       "This is one of the times when Christ publicly confessed
                    His claim to be the Messiah, the One for whom the Jews had
                    long looked. Weighted with such great results, it was to Christ
                    one of the most wonderful moments of His life. He realized
                    that all disguise must be swept away. The declaration that He
                    was one with God must be openly made. His judges looked
                    upon Him as only a man, and they thought Him guilty of
                    blasphemous presumption. But He proclaimed Himself as the
                    Son of God. He fully asserted His divine character before the
                    dignitaries who arraigned Him before their earthly tribunal. His
                    words, spoken calmly, yet with conscious power, showed that
                    He claimed for Himself the prerogatives of the Son of God."

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is my attitude toward Jesus when He speaks to me
                    in words of quiet authority because He is God?

                       "So perverted had the priesthood become that when Christ
                    declared Himself the Son of God, Caiaphas, in pretended hor-
                    ror, rent his robe, and accused the Holy One of Israel of
                    blasphemy.
                       "Many today who claim to be Christians are in danger of
                    rending their garments, making an outward show of repentance,
                    when their hearts are not softened nor subdued. This is why so
                    many continue to make failures in the Christian life. An out-
                    ward appearance of sorrow is shown for wrong, but their re-
                    pentance is not that which needs not to be repented of."—Ellen

                                                                         February 27

              Part 5      "Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto
           HIS OWN     the chief priests, and said unto them, What will ye give me,
                       and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with
      BETRAYED HIM     him for thirty pieces of silver." Matt. 26:14, 15.

                          This meeting of Judas with the leaders of the Jews took
                       place after Jesus had tacitly rebuked Judas at the feast in
                       Simon's house. There He commended Mary for her generous
                       deed of anointing His feet with ointment after Judas had severely
                       censured her for what he considered a wasteful act. "The re-
                       proof rankled in his heart. He determined to be revenged. From
                       the supper he went directly to the palace of the high priest,
                       where he found the council assembled, and he offered to be-
                       tray Jesus into their hands."—The Desire of Ages, pages 563,
                       564. Now it only remained for Judas to find a suitable place
                       and time to fulfill the agreement and deliver Jesus into their
                       hands. This he did in the Garden of Gethsemane. See Matt.
                       26:47-55.
                          What did all the disciples do after Judas had betrayed
                       their Master? Matt. 26:56.

                           Jesus in accordance with the prophecy was left to tread
                       the winepress alone. See Isa. 63:3. But this was not the first
                        time Jesus had felt lonely.
                           "The disciples were terrified as they saw Jesus permit Him-
                       self to be taken and bound. They were offended that He should
                       suffer this humiliation to Himself and them. They could not
                       understand His conduct, and they blamed Him for submitting
                       to the mob. In their indignation and fear, Peter proposed that
                       they save themselves. Following this suggestion, 'they all for-
                       sook Him, and fled.' But Christ had foretold this desertion.
                       'Behold,' He had said, 'the hour cometh, yea, is now come,
                       that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall
                       leave Me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father
                       is with Me.' John 16:32."—The Desire of Ages, page 697.
                           Which other disciple later denied His Master? Matt. 26:
                       69-75.

 THINK IT THROUGH         In what ways do I also, through my acts and words, be-
                       tray and deny my Master?

                         "The loneliness of Christ, separated from the heavenly
                       courts, living the life of humanity, was- never understood or
                       appreciated by the disciples as it should have been."—The

HIS ONENESS WITH
                    "The Father and the Son each have a personality,"—Testi-
      FATHER SUS- monies, Vol. 9, p. 68, but Jesus was one with the Father "in
       TAINED HIM nature, in will, and in purpose."—The Desire of Ages, page 208.
                       From the preceding parts of this lesson it is evident that
                    Jesus often met disappointment and trouble. But in the expe-
                    rience of Jesus these did not result in discouragement. No
                    disappointment, no enmity, no trial—nothing—separated Jesus
                    from His Father. They were one "in nature, in will, and in
                    purpose."
                       "As the world's Redeemer, Christ was constantly confronted
                    with apparent failure. He, the messenger of mercy to our world,
                    seemed to do little of the work He longed to do in uplifting and
                    saving. Satanic influences were constantly working to oppose
                    His way. But He would not be discouraged."—The Desire of
                    Ages, page 678.
                       Even when His earthly mission was nearly complete, what
                    did His disciples still fail to understand? Acts 1:6; cf. Matt.
                    16:21; 20:17-19; Mark 10:32-34.

                       "Just before leaving His disciples, Christ once more plainly
                    stated the nature of His kingdom. He recalled to their remem-
                    brance things He had previously told them regarding it. He
                    declared that it was not His purpose to establish in this world
                    a temporal kingdom. He was not appointed to reign as an
                    earthly monarch on David's throne."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                    page 30.
                       How was it possible for Jesus to bear up amid this con-
                    stant loneliness when no one, not even His disciples, under-
                    stood Him? Isa. 26:3; 48:18; Ps. 119:165.

                       Jesus was constantly misunderstood by His friends; His
                    enemies impugned His motives. Still He possessed complete
                    peace of mind. The secret of this repose of mind amid con-
                    stant conflicts was His undisturbed unity, or oneness, with His
                    Father.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Have I cultivated such a friendship and intimacy with God
                    'that I can, like Jesus, be sustained by Him when all others
                     forsake me?

                        "Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that
                    men may not have through faith in Him. His perfect humanity
                    is that which all His followers may possess, if they will be in
                    subjection to God as He was."—The Desire of Ages, page 664.

GOD IS LIKE THIS-


He Heals People
     "And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a
 physician; but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners
 to repentance." Luke 5:31, 32.

    "It was generally believed by the Jews that sin is punished in this life. Every
affliction was regarded as the penalty of some wrongdoing, either of the suf-
 ferer himself or of his parents. It is true that all suffering results from the
transgression of God's law, but this truth had become perverted."—The Desire
of Ages, page 471.
    Although illness and suffering are the results of sin, they are often not the
results of personal sin or wrongdoing. Rather they are the cumulative results
of the sins of mankind.
   As Jesus came to take away sin, so He also came to eliminate the results of
sin. He came as a physician to heal the maladies of men. The scope of His
healing ministry embraced both the physical and the spiritual.
    "Christ was bound up in all branches of the work. He did not make any
division. He did not feel that He was infringing on physicians when He healed
the sick. He proclaimed the truth, and when the sick came to Him for healing,
He asked them if they believed that He could make them whole. He was just
as ready to lay His hands on the sick and afflicted as He was to preach the
gospel. He was just as much at home in this work as in proclaiming the truth;
for healing the sick is a part of the gospel."—Medical Ministry, pages 237, 238.
    Thus Jesus showed to the world that the Father is not the source of illness
and suffering. He desires the health of every person.

                      poviier. Satan is the destroyer; God is the restorer."—The Min-
                      istry of Healing, page 113.

                        What was God's ideal plan for His people in Old Testa-
                      ment times? Ex. 15:26; 23:25; Deut. 7:15.

                          Many people erroneously differentiate—between Jesus and
                       the God of the Old Testament. In many instances God, or the
                      Lord of the Old Testament, was Jesus personally. Where this
                      is not the case, it is well to remember that although God the
                      Father and God the Son are different persons, They are one
                      in plans, purposes, and motives. See The Desire of Ages, page
                      208.
                          "Christ had been the guide and teacher of ancient Israel,
                      and He taught them that health is the reward of obedience to
                      the laws of God. The Great Physician who healed the sick in
                      Palestine had spoken to His people from the pillar of cloud,
                      telling them what they must do, and what God would do for
                      them. 'If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord
                      thy God,' He said, 'and wilt do that which is right in His sight,
                      and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His
                      statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which
                      I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that
                      healeth thee.' Ex. 15:26. Christ gave to Israel definite instruc-
                      tion in regard to their habits of life, and He assured them, 'The
                      Lord will take away from thee all sickness.' Deut. 7:15. When
                      they fulfilled the conditions, the promise was verified to them.
                      'There was not one feeble person among their tribes.' Ps.
                      105:37."—The Desire of Ages, page 824.

 THINK IT THROUGH        The laws of health are the laws of God.


                          "These lessons are for us. There are conditions to be ob-
                      served by all who would preserve health. All should learn what
                      these conditions are. The Lord is not pleased with ignorance
                      in regard to His laws, either natural or spiritual. We are to be
                      workers together with God for the restoration of health to the
                      body as well as to the soul."—The Desire of Ages, page 824.

          Part 2      What did a certain nobleman ask Jesus to do?
     NOBLEMAN'S
     SON HEALED       "When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into
                    Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would
                    come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of
                    death." John 4:47.

                       How did Jesus counter his request? John 4:48.

                       "Notwithstanding all the evidence that Jesus was the Christ,
                    the petitioner had determined to make his belief in Him con-
                    ditional on the granting of his own request....
                       "Yet the nobleman had a degree of faith; for he had come
                    to ask what seemed to him the most precious of all blessings.
                    Jesus had a greater gift to bestow. He desired, not only to
                    heal the child, but to make,, the officer and his household
                    sharers in the blessings of salvation, and to kindle a light in
                    Capernaum, which was so soon to be the field of His own
                    labors. But the nobleman must realize his need before he
                    would desire the grace of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page
                    198.
                      Realizing that his son's life was at stake due to his own
                    wavering faith, what was the nobleman's further request?
                    John 4:49.
                       "Like a flash of light, the Saviour's words to the nobleman
                    laid bare his heart. He saw that his motives in seeking Jesus
                    were selfish. His vacillating faith appeared to him in its true
                    character. In deep distress he realized that his doubt might
                    cost the life of his son. He knew that he was in the presence
                    of One who could read the thoughts, and to whom all things
                     were possible. In an agony of supplication he cried, 'Sir, come
                     down ere my child die.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 198.
                       What was Jesus' response to his cry of faith? John 4:50.

                        "His faith took hold upon Christ as did Jacob, when, wres-
                    tling with the Angel, he cried, 'I will not let Thee go, except
                    Thou bless me.' Gen. 32:26."—The Desire of Ages, page 198.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Do I at times make my belief in God dependent on the
                    fulfillment of certain requests? What is wrong with such an
                    attitude?

                       "The Saviour cannot withdraw from the soul that clings to
                     Him, pleading its great need."—The Desire of Ages, page 198.

      BOY BELOW      have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
                     and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he
        MOUNT OF     foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and
 TRANSFIGURATION     I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and
                     they could not." Mark 9:17, 18.

                        "Authority over unclean spirits, to call them out, had been
                     conferred on the disciples when Jesus sent out the twelve to
                     preach through Galilee."—The Desire of Ages, page 427. But
                     on this occasion, because of their unbelief, the disciples were
                     unable to exorcise the evil spirit despite the Master's confer-
                     ment of power.
                        The boy's father, noticing the inability of the disciples to
                     drive out the evil spirit from his boy, was prone to believe that
                     Jesus Himself would be unable to cure his son. Nevertheless,
                     he brought him to Jesus and said, "If thou canst do any thing,
                     have compassion on us, and help us." Mark 9:22.
                       Upon what did Jesus make the boy's healing dependent?
                     Mark 9:23.
                        What was the father's desperately earnest response to
                     Jesus' disclosure? Mark 9:24.

                        The father threw himself fully upon the mercy of Jesus, con-
                     fessing his weakness and helplessness, but pleading with Jesus
                     to supply his need of faith.
 THINK IT THROUGH       On this particular occasion who manifested more faith—
                     the nine disciples below the mountain or the father of the
                     sick boy?

                        "The selection of the three disciples to accompany Jesus
                     to the mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. Instead
                     of strengthening their faith by prayer and meditation on the
                     words of Christ, they had been dwelling on their discourage-
                     ments and personal grievances. In this state of darkness they
                     had undertaken the conflict with Satan.
                         "In order to succeed in such a conflict they must come to
                     the work in a different spirit. Their faith must be strengthened
                     by fervent prayer and fasting, and humiliation of heart. They
                     must be emptied of self, and be filled with the Spirit and power
                     of God. Earnest, persevering supplication to God in faith—
                     faith that leads to entire dependence upon God, and unre-
                     served consecration to His work—can alone avail to bring
                     men the Holy Spirit's aid in battle against 'principalities and
                     powers."—The Desire of Ages, page 431.

He Heals People LESSON 10                                         ❑   Wednesday
                                                                        March 5

           Part 4   "And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of
   INFIRM WOMAN infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could
                    in no wise lift up herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called
                    her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from
                    thine infirmity. And he laid his hands on her: and immedi-
                    ately she was made straight, and glorified God." Luke
                    13:11-13.

                        In this instance of healing there is no mention that the
                    woman requested Jesus to heal her, but Jesus noticed her
                    infirmity and wanted to heal her. This is the character of Jesus
                    and also of the Father.
                        The compassion of Jesus was touched by illness and defor-
                    mity. He delighted in setting men and women free from Satan's
                    bonds, as He set this woman free. See verse 16. During His
                    public ministry "He went about doing good, and healing all
                    that were oppressed by Satan. About them were whole villages
                    where there was not a moan of sickness in any house; for He
                    had passed through them, and healed all their sick."—The
                    Desire of Ages, page 241.
                        Yet His compassion sought more than physical care; He
                    longed to cure the soul and enable the person restored to
                    health to see and acknowledge God as Lord of life and Jesus
                    as Saviour from sin.

                       What was the woman's response to her miraculous heal-
                    ing? Luke 13:13.

                       Her cure was complete. Deliverance from physical malady
                    turned her eyes and attention to God, whom she now glorified.
                    She wanted to serve Him in her new-found health. This woman
                    through her healing "was made straight" not merely in body
                    but also in soul.
                       Jesus called her "a daughter of Abraham." Verse 16. To a
                    Jew that was tantamount to being called a "child of heaven."
                    All of us likewise were created to be children of heaven and
                    of God, not children of sin and of Satan.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How do I use my health—to serve sin and Satan or to
                    glorify God?

                      "Health is a treasure. Of all temporal possession it is the
                    most precious. Wealth, learning, and honor are dearly pur-
                    chased at the loss of the vigor of health. None of these can
                    secure happiness, if health is lacking. It is a terrible sin to
                    abuse the health that God has given us."—Counsels on Diet

             Part 5      "And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into
      THE GADAREHE    the country of the Gadarenes. And when he was come out
                      of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a
        DEMON IACS    man with an unclean spirit, who had his dwelling among the
                      tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains."
                      Mark 5:1-3.

                        Read also Matthew 8:28-34 and Luke 8:26-39.
                         Matthew, undoubtedly an eyewitness to this event, mentions
                      two men, while Mark and Luke speak of only one. Probably
                      one of the demoniacs had been reported to them as being
                      outrageously savage and fierce.

                         Even though demon-possessed, what did the man appar-
                      ently faintly realize and desire to do; but what words came
                      from his lips? Mark 5:6, 7.
                        What command did Jesus give to the demons, and what
                      was the effect? Mark 5:8, 13.

                         "With authority He bade the unclean spirits come out of
                      them. His words penetrated the darkened minds of the unfor-
                      tunate men. They realized dimly that One was near who could
                      save them from the tormenting demons. They fell at the Sav-
                      iour's feet to worship Him."—The Desire of Ages, pages 337,
                      338.

                         After the men had been delivered from demon possession,
                      what did they desire to do and what was Jesus' advice to
                      them? Mark 5:18-20.

                         "As Jesus was about to enter the boat, they kept close to
                      His side, knelt at His feet, and begged Him to keep them near
                      Him, where they might ever listen to His words. But Jesus
                      bade them go home and tell what great things the Lord had
                      done for them."—The Desire of Ages, page 339.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Consider the cost of 2,000 swine sacrificed for the con-

                         "The two restored demoniacs were the first missionaries
                      whom Christ sent to preach the gospel in the region of Decap-
                      olis. . . . They bore in their own persons the evidence that
                      Jesus was the Messiah. They could tell what they knew; what
                      they themselves had seen, and heard, and felt of the power of
                      Christ. This is what everyone can do whose heart has been
                      touched by the grace of God."—The Desire of Ages, page 340.

He Heals People LESSON 10                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                        March 7

           Part 6 Read John 5:2-9.
 MAN AT THE POOL  Jesus healed the man who had been ill thirty-eight years.
    OF BETHESDA When the man carried his bed on the Sabbath, Jesus was
                  brought into conflict with the religious leaders. Some of the
                  statements Jesus made during this conflict present thoughts
                  that advance the central concept of this week's lesson.
                      Who had healed the sick man? John 5:17.
                      What was the relation between Jesus and His Father in
                  healing this man? John 5:19.
                      Jesus' act of healing was really the act of the heavenly
                  Father. As Jesus desired the health of those about Him, so
                  the Father desires the health of the people of this world. He
                  is a sympathetic healer and never the cause of people's ill-
                  nesses. If we would understand the relation of the heavenly
                  Father to disease, we must see Jesus in His healing ministry.
                  The following quotation from Ellen G. White has reference to
                  the things of nature and not specifically to human disease and
                  health, but the principles expressed are applicable to man
                  and his illness.
                      "The God of nature is perpetually at work. His infinite
                  power works unseen, but manifestations appear in the effects
                  which the work produces. The same God who guides the
                  planets works in the. fruit orchard and in the vegetable garden.
                  He never made a thorn, a thistle, or a tare. These are Satan's
                   work, the result of degeneration, introduced by him among the
                   precious things; but it is through God's immediate agency that
                  every bud bursts into blossom. When He was in the world in
                   the form of humanity, Christ said: 'My Father worketh hitherto,
                   and I work.* John 5:17."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, pp. 186, 187.
 THINK IT THROUGH      If God desires the health of all, why are not all well?
                      "There are cases where God works decidedly by His divine
                   power in the restoration of health. But not all the sick are
                   healed. Many are laid away to sleep in Jesus. John on the
                   Isle of Patmos was bidden to write: 'Blessed are the dead
                   which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit,
                   that they may rest from their labors; and their works do fol-
                   low them.' Revelation 14:13. From this we see that if persons
                   are not raised to health, they should not on this account be
                   judged as wanting in faith.
                      "We all desire immediate and direct answers to our prayers,
                   and are tempted to become discouraged when the answer is
                   delayed or comes in an unlooked-for form. But God is too
                  wise and good to answer our prayers always at just the time
                  and in just the manner we desire. He will do more and better
                  for us than to accomplish all our wishes."—The Ministry of

   "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men." Phil. 2:6, 7.


    "God gave His Son to die for sinful human beings a death of ignominy and
shame. He who was Commander in the heavenly courts laid aside His royal
robe and kingly crown, and clothing His divinity with humanity, came to this
world to stand at the head of the human race, as the pattern-man. He humbled
Himself to suffer with the race, to be afflicted in all their afflictions.
    "The whole world was His, but so completely did He empty Himself that
during His ministry He declared, 'Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.' "—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 904.
   Self-denial by the Godhead had a broader significance even than being a
means of helping man. Ellen White wrote: "The victory gained at His death on
Calvary broke forever the accusing power of Satan over the universe, and
silenced his charges that self-denial was impossible with God and therefore not
essential in the human family."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
mentary, Vol. 7, p. 974.
    "He [Satan] had accused God of seeking merely the exaltation of Himself
in requiring submission and obedience from His creatures, and had declared
that, while the Creator exacted self-denial from all others, He Himself practiced
no self-denial and made no sacrifice. Now it was seen that for the salvation
of a fallen and sinful race, the Ruler of the universe had made the greatest
sacrifice which love could make; for 'God was in Christ, reconciling the world
unto Himself.' 2 Corinthians 5:19. It was seen, also, that while Lucifer had
opened the door for the entrance of sin by his desire for honor and supremacy,
Christ had, in order to destroy sin, humbled Himself and become obedient
unto death."—The Great Controversy, page 502.

                        When His plan for man's happiness miscarried through
                     Satan's deception and man's fall, God did not rest passively.
                     The second Person in the Godhead decided to go in search
                     of man.
                        To what depth of ignominy did He stoop to rescue man
                     from his pit of degradation and misery and restore him to
                     his pristine position? Phil. 2:8.
                        "Jesus' obedience was rendered to the extent of laying
                     down His life. It was humiliation indeed for God to become
                     man; and then, being man, to die a shameful death on the
                     cross....
                        "The emphasis is not only on the fact that Christ died but
                     on the kind of death. It was a death that involved intense
                     shame as well as intense suffering. Crucifixion was reserved
                     for slaves, non-Romans, and the lowest criminals. It was a
                     death upon which the law of Moses had pronounced a curse
                     (Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13), and even the Gentiles considered it
                     the most foul and cruel of all punishments. The message of
                     a crucified Christ was a stumbling block to the Jews and
                     foolishness to the Greeks (1 Cor. 1:23)."—SDA Bible Com-
                     mentary, on Phil. 2:8.

THINK IT THROUGH        To what extent of self-denial am 1 willing to go to save
                     a soul for God's kingdom?

                         "Laying aside his royal robe and kingly crown, Christ clothed
                     His divinity with humanity, that human beings might be raised
                     from their degradation, and placed on vantage-ground. Christ
                     could not have come to this earth with the glory that he had
                     in the heavenly courts. Sinful human beings could not have
                     borne the sight. He veiled His divinity with the garb of hu-
                     manity, but he did not part with his divinity. A divine-human
                     Saviour, he came to stand at the head of the fallen race, to
                     share in their experience from childhood to manhood. That
                     human beings might be partakers of the divine nature, he came
                     to this earth, and lived a life of perfect obedience."—Ellen

                                                                            March 10

           Part 2     "For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,
   JESUS CAME AS    but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
                    Mark 10:45.
       A SERVANT
                        In heaven Jesus was the ruler of the heavenly host. All
                    power and all majesty were His. It was the greatest joy of un-
                    fallen angels to execute His every bidding and wish. Daily fel-
                    lowship with His Father was His joy and delight.
                        In coming to this earth Jesus left all this. He came to work
                    out man's salvation through arduous toil.
                        "Jesus was a silent and unselfish worker. He did not seek
                    fame, riches, or applause; neither did he consult his own ease
                    and pleasure. When the day's labor was done, and he had
                    dismissed his disciples that they might seek needed rest, he
                    often retired to the lonely mountain or the silent grove, and
                    spent the night in prayer, offering up his petitions with strong
                    crying and tears. Not for himself were those vigils kept, but for
                    those he came to save. He was standing between the. living
                     and the dead."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Jan. 6,
                    1885.
                      How does Christ's pattern of greatness differ from that
                    common in the world? Mark 10:42-44; cf. Luke 22:25-27.
                       "On earth, men in positions of authority tend to 'lord it over'
                    those under them. But among the citizens of the heavenly
                    kingdom, power, position, talent, and education are to be de-
                    voted exclusively to serving others, and may never be used
                    as levers to lord it over others. . . .
                       "He who is greatest will serve others most unselfishly. Ap-
                    parently, the approval of Jesus tests upon the desire to 'be
                    great' in terms of serving instead of dominating:"—SDA Bible
                    Commentary, on Matt. 20:26.
THINK IT THROUGH       What is my concept of greatness? Do I use the scale of
                    the world or that of God when I think of it?
                       "If intellectual greatness, apart from any higher considera-
                    tion, is worthy of honor, then our homage is due to Satan,
                    whose intellectual power no man has ever equaled. But when
                    perverted to self-serving, the greater the gift, the greater
                    curse it becomes. It is moral worth that God values. Love and
                    purity are the attributes He prizes most. John was great in the
                    sight of the Lord, when, before the messengers from the San-
                    hedrin, before the people, and before his own disciples, he
                    refrained from seeking honor for himself, but pointed all to
                    Jesus as the Promised One. His unselfish joy in the ministry
                    of Christ presents the highest type of nobility ever revealed
                    in man."—The Desire of Ages, page 219.

                                                                            March11

               Part 3      "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into
     JESUS SERVED AT    his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to
                        God; he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and
       LORD'S SUPPER    took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water
                        into a boson, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to
                        wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded." John
                        13:3-5.

                           At the Passover service Jesus aptly illustrated His teachings
                        about true greatness. Prior to this Jesus had told them that
                        He had come in among them as a servant rather than as a
                        master. But this may have been difficult for the disciples to
                        visualize. After all, He was still their Master, and they were
                        obviously servants. It was they who had arranged the people
                        at the feeding of the five thousand and of the four thousand
                        and had distributed the bread and fish to the crowds. But at
                        the Passover meal Jesus verily assumed a servant's position
                        by washing their feet. This menial act they all understood as
                        a servant's part.

                           What was Peter's reaction to his Master's humble posi-
                        tion as a servant among them? John 13:6, 8.

                            "As the disciples watched Christ's action, they were greatly
                        moved. When Peter's turn came, he exclaimed with astonish-
                        ment, 'Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?' Christ's condescension
                        broke his heart. He was filled with shame to think that one
                        of the disciples was not performing this service. 'What I do,'
                        Christ said, 'thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know here-
                        after.' Peter could not bear to see his Lord, whom he believed
                        to be the Son of God, acting the part of a servant. His whole
                        soul rose up against this humiliation. He did not realize that
                        for this Christ came into the world. With great emphasis he
                        exclaimed, 'Thou shalt never wash my feet.' "—The Desire of
                        Ages, pages 645, 646.

THINK IT THROUGH          Am I, as a follower of Jesus, willing to serve humbly in
                        any capacity, or am I eagerly looking and campaigning for
                        positions of authority where I can tell others what to do?

                          "In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exemplifi-
                        cation of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God.
                        God does not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by
                        upholding all things, He is constantly ministering for others."

He Is Self-denying     LESSON 11                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     March12

           Part 4      "Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it
   JESUS CAME TO    is written of me,) to do thy will, 0 God." Heb. 10:7.
     DIE FOR MAN
                        This was the ready response of Jesus, the second Person
                    in the Godhead, to execute the plan of salvation. "Nearly two
                    thousand years ago, a voice of mysterious import was heard
                    in heaven, from the throne of God, 'Lo, I come.' Sacrifice and
                    offering Thou wouldest not, but a body hast Thou prepared
                    Me. . . . Lo, I come (in the volume of the Book it is written
                    of Me,) to do Thy will, 0 God.' Heb. 10:5-7. In these words is
                    announced the fulfillment of the purpose that had been hidden
                    from eternal ages. Christ was about to visit our world, and to
                     become incarnate."—The Desire of Ages, page 23.
                      What impelled Jesus to go on a mission that would ulti-
                    mately demand His life? Isa. 53:11.
                       The thoughts and attention of Jesus as He undertook His
                    descent to this earth were not focused on the arduous work
                    and gruesome suffering He would have to endure. He looked
                    beyond the immediate and visualized the reward of His labors
                    at the fulfillment of the plan of salvation. In this way He en-
                    dured with fortitude the adversities and the trials.
                       "What sustained the Son of God during His life of toil and
                    sacrifice? He saw the results of the travail of His soul and
                    was satisfied. Looking into eternity, He beheld the happiness
                    of those who through His humiliation had received pardon and
                    everlasting life. His ear caught the shout of the redeemed. He
                    heard the ransomed ones singing the song of Moses and the
                    Lamb."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 601.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Where is our attention generally focused—on the poisible
                    present trials or on the victory and glory at the end of life's
                    sojourn?
                       "Christ can look upon the misery of the world without a
                    shade of sorrow for having created man. In the human heart
                    He sees more than sin, more than misery. In His infinite wis-
                    dom and love He sees man's possibilities, the height to which
                    he may attain. He knows that, even though human beings
                    have abused their mercies and destroyed their God-given
                    dignity, yet the Creator is to be glorified in their redemption."

                       "If but one soul would have accepted the gospel of His
                    grace, Christ would, to save that one, have chosen His life
                    of toil and humiliation and His death of shame. If through our
                    efforts one human being shall be uplifted and ennobled, fitted
                    to shine in the courts of the Lord, have we not cause for re-
                    joicing?"—The Ministry of Healing, page 135.

              Part 5      "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said,
       JESUS' DEATH    Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said
                       thus, he gave up the ghost." Luke 23:46.

                          Read also Matthew 27:46, 50.
                          Jesus had come to do His Father's will. It was God's will
                       —the will of God the Father, God the Son, and Go\Id the Holy
                       Spirit—that Jesus die in man's stead. There was no escape.
                       Someone had to die for the departure from God's will. For
                       repentant man to be entitled to live, Jesus must take his place.

                          What did the Jewish priests and leaders mockingly say
                       that Jesus was unable to do? Mark 15:31.

                       ' Jesus could not save Himself and us also. He could have
                       saved Himself only at the cost of leaving us, or man, in the
                       lurch. He could not save both. One must die. He chose to die
                       that we might be saved. The priests were unwittingly proclaim-
                       ing the truth about Jesus' situation.
                           "Save yourself, He cannot save himself—has great interest
                       as being a judgment in the only terms these people knew, self-
                       preservation. They could not conceive of any other than the
                       selfish motive of saving oneself. The only test they knew of
                       life was whether it worked out to the gain of self. They could
                       not conceive the supreme success of losing it in sacrifice, of
                       giving it as ransom, of being unable to save self just because
                       others were being saved by that very inability. So on that
                       basis they said, 'You see, the fool was wrong. He could not
                       save himself.'
                           "People who have only one small yardstick with which to
                       measure life are always scornful of the Christian gospel and
                       the Christian faith. Weighed on the scale of 'miserable aims
                       that end in self,' the teaching of Jesus is found wanting. It does
                       not work for self-aggrandizement or self-saving. It brings a
                       new measurement. God weighs life on a different scale."—
                       The Interpreter's Bible, Vol. 7, p. 906.

THINK IT THROUGH          By what scale do I measure success?

                          "Jesus, suffering and dying, heard every word as the priests
                       declared, 'He saved others; Himself He cannot save. Let Christ
                       the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may
                       see and believe.' Christ could have come down from the cross.
                       But it is because He would not save Himself that the sinner
                       has hope of pardon and favor with God."—The Desire of Ages,

            Part 6      "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to
         GOD WAS     himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry
                     of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling
        IN CHRIST    the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto

                     2 Cor. 5:18, 19.

                        In the work of redeeming man, Jesus, the second Person in
                     the Godhead, was not alone. The plan of salvation, or the
                     work of atonement was a joint enterprise on the part of the
                     three Persons in the Godhead. But in the divine economy
                     Jesus was chosen to come to this earth as our Redeemer.
                     Colossians 1:20-23, NEB, well expresses it in these words:
                     "Through him God chose to reconcile the whole universe to
                     himself, making peace through the shedding of his blood upon
                     the cross—to reconcile all things, whether on earth or in
                     heaven, through him alone. . . . This is the gospel which has
                     been proclaimed in the whole creation under heaven."
                         "All heaven suffered in Christ's agony; but that suffering
                     did not begin or end with His manifestation in humanity. The
                     cross is a revelation to our dull senses of the pain that, from
                     its very inception, sin has brought to the heart of God. Every
                     departure from the right, every deed of cruelty, every failure
                     of humanity to reach His ideal, brings grief to Him."—Educa-

                     the gruesome spectacle of seeing their Creator die? Matt.
                     27:45.

                        "With amazement angels witnessed the Saviour's despair-
                     ing agony. The hosts of heaven veiled their faces from the
                     fearful sight. Inanimate nature expressed sympathy with its
                     insulted and dying Author. The sun refused to look upon the
                     awful scene. Its full, bright rays were illuminating the earth

                     mercy does not set aside justice. The law reveals the attributes
                     of God's character, and not a jot or tittle of it could be changed
                     to meet man in his fallen condition. God did not change His

                          GOD IS LIKE THIS-



        He Gives Life
   "And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak
therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak." John 12:50.

    Both Jesus and the Father desire that man shall have eternal life. The Father,
is not a hard-hearted judge who must be persuaded by Jesus to give eternal
life to the believer. Rather, Jesus indicated in the above verse that the ever-
lasting life of the believer was the commandment of the Father. The instances
in which Jesus raised dead persons to life reflect to us the attitude of the
heavenly Father toward the dead. He desires men to be alive and not dead,
and He has promised eternal life to those who believe in Jesus. The fear of
death is a symptom of a lack of faith. This lack of faith can be either a doubt
of God's power to restore one to life, or a lack of faith in Jesus for the cleansing
from sin by which eternal life is conferred.
    Our faith in the heavenly Father can be strengthened by a correct under-
standing of the Bible and by grasping the significance of the teachings and
acts of Jesus. "The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a
state of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten thousand
times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy intelligences, all wait-
ing to do His will. Through channels which we cannot discern He is in active
 communication with every part of His dominion. But it is in this speck of a world,
in the souls that He gave His only-begotten Son to save, that His interest and
 the interest of all heaven is centered. God is bending from His throne to hear
 the cry of the oppressed. To every sincere prayer He answers, 'Here am I.' He
 uplifts the distressed and downtrodden. In all our afflictions He is afflicted. In
every temptation and every trial the angel of His pre.sence is near to deliver.
    "Not even a sparrow falls to the ground without the Father's notice. Satan's
 hatred against God leads him to hate every object of the Saviour's care. He
seeks to mar the handiwork of God, and he delights in destroying even the
 dumb creatures. It is only through God's protecting care that the birds are
preserved to gladden us with their songs of joy. But He does not forget even
 the sparrows. 'Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.' "

                                                                               March 16

              Part 1      "For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given
       JESUS IS LIFE   to the Son to have life in himself."


                         "In him [Jesus] was life; and the life was the light of
                       men." John 5:26; 1:4.


                           See also John 14:6; 11:25.
                           In speaking about man we may correctly say that he has
                       life. There are dead men as well as living men. This signifies
                       that a man may possess life, while another man may be dead
                       or no longer possess life. In speaking about God and Jesus,
                       it is more correct to say They are life. In the Old Testament,
                       when Moses asked God at the time of the Exodus what His
                       name was and how he might introduce Him to the Israelites,
                       "God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
                       shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
                       unto you." Ex. 3:14. This expresses the nature of His existence
                       —He has life in and of Himself.

                          What words did Jesus use in His dispute with the Jews
                       that hint that He did not merely possess life, as they did
                       then, but was the source of life? John 8:58.


                          "The name of God, given to Moses to express the idea of
                       the eternal presence, had been claimed as His own by this
                       Galilean Rabbi. He had announced Himself to be the self-
                       existent One, He who had been promised to Israel, 'whose
                       goings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity.'
                       Micah 5:2, margin."—The Desire of Ages, pages 469, 470.

 THINK IT THROUGH         How can I increase my faith in Jesus as the source of life?


                           "The divinity of Christ is the believer's assurance of eternal
                       life."—The Desire of Ages, page 530.
                           " 'I am come that they might have life, and that they might
                       have it more abundantly.' John 10:10. This life is what we
                       must have, and we must have it more abundantly. God will
                       breathe this life into every soul that dies to self and lives to
                       Christ. But entire self-renunciation is required. Unless this takes
                       place, we carry with us the evil that destroys our happiness.
                       But when self is crucified, Christ lives in us, and the power of
                       the Spirit attends our efforts."—Our High Calling, page 21.

           Part 2      "Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city [Hain],
  JESUS RESTORED    behold, there was a dead man carried out. . . . And he came
                    and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And
    PHYSICAL LIFE   he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And he that
                    was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him
                    to his mother." Luke 7:12-15.
                       "And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud
                    voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth,
                    bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was
                    bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose
                    him, and let him go." John 11:43, 44.
                       Read also Luke 8:49-55.
                       On these occasions Jesus restored physical life. But Jesus
                    would like us to envision more than life on this earth. The
                    three persons raised from the dead by Jesus rose only to die
                    again. It is His purpose that man shall live not only for time
                    but for eternity.
                       Jesus was, or rather is, life. No death could enter where
                    Jesus was present in person. "Had Christ been in the sick-
                    room, Lazarus would not have died; for Satan would have
                    had no power over him. Death could not have aimed his dart
                    at Lazarus in the presence of the Life-giver."—The Desire of
                    Ages, page 528.
                       What did Jesus assure Martha that He is? John 11:25.
                       On another occasion what did Jesus also declare that He
                    is? John 14:6.
                       As Christians we should aim to live for eternity and at the
                    same time be a means of preservation of men's physical life.
                    Daniel filled such a mission among the magicians of Babylon.
                    See Dan. 2:24. Paul on board ship for Rome did likewise. See
                    Acts 27:23, 24, 37, 44. But we should go beyond the preserva-
                    tion of physical life and become instrumental in saving men
                    also for eternity.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Am I living so close to God that I may be instrumental
                    in saving some from physical death as did Daniel and Paul?
                    Remember that Jonah's presence among the mariners nearly
                    caused their death. See Jonah 1:14-16.
                        "The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth, and
                    it appeals to us with even greater power than to those who
                    heard it in the temple on that last day of the feast. The foun-
                    tain is open for all. The weary and exhausted ones are offered

      OFFER US LIFE
                         Were Adam and Eve created mortal or immortal? Gen.
                      2:16, 17.

                        In the beginning God gave life to Adam and Eve. It was not
                      immortal life, but conditional immortality.

                         How can sinful man regain the eternal life he forfeited?
                      John 3:15, 16.

                           Our physical life is a gift of God. "His energy is still exerted
                       in upholding the objects of His creation. It is not because the
                       mechanism that has once been set in motion continues to act
                       by its own inherent energy that the pulse beats and breath
                       follows breath; but every breath, every pulsation of the heart,
                       is an evidence of the all-pervading care of Him in whom 'we
                       live, and move, and have our being.' Acts 17:28."—Patriarchs
                      and Prophets, page 115.
                           " 'Life' includes the physical, intellectual, and spiritual.
                      Physical life is regarded as abundant in a body that is full of
                      vigor and in perfect health. Jesus' miracles of physical healing
                      gave an abundant physical life to those whose life forces were
                      ebbing. But physical restoration was by no means the complete
                      fulfillment of Jesus' mission. Man also has intellectual and
                      spiritual life, which must also be made alive and abundant,
                      for 'man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that
                      proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord' (Deut. 8:3). Important
                      as the physical and the intellectual aspects of a well-rounded
                      life are, no life is fully complete unless the spiritual nature is
                      nurtured."—SDA Bible Commentary, on John 10:10.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What is the Biblical distinction between being alive and
                      having eternal life? See John 6:54.

                           "The sapless branch, ingrafted into the living vine, becomes
                      a part of the vine. It lives while united to the vine. So the
                      Christian lives by virtue of his union with Christ. The sinful
                      and human is linked to the holy and divine. The believing soul
                      abides in Christ, and becomes one with Him. When persons
                      are closely united in the relations of this life, their tastes be-
                      come similar, they come to love the same things. So those
                      who abide in Christ will love the things which He loves. They

                    zee, but lost it when they sinned. True, their physical life was
                    extended, but they were no longer conditionally immortal. . . .

                    Bible Commentary, on John 10:10.
                       Jesus came that we might have life and that we "might
                    have it more abundantly"—life, not merely this present life,
                    but the eternal life that God originally purposed that man
                    should enjoy.
                       Eternal life is represented in the Bible as "being granted to
                    the believer at the moment he accepts his Lord (1 John 3:14;
                    5:11, 12; cf. DA 388). This gift the overcomer never loses.

                    between death and the resurrection do not deprive him of the
                    gift. His life continues to be 'hid with Christ in God' (Col. 3:3)
                    to be translated into glorious immortality on the resurrection
                    morn."—SDA Bible Commentary, on John 8:51.
                       How only can this eternal life be obtained? John 3:3-7.

                        In commenting upon Jesus' words to Nicodemus that he
                    "must be born again," E. G. White says: "Nicodemus had come
                    to the Lord thinking to enter into a discussion with Him, but
                    Jesus laid bare the foundation principles of truth. He said to
                    Nicodemus, It is not theoretical knowledge you need so much
                    as spiritual regeneration. You need not to have your curiosity
                    satisfied, but to have a new heart. You must receive a new
                    life from above before you can appreciate heavenly things.
                    Until this change takes place, making all things new, it will
                    result in no saving good for yon to discuss with Me My author-
                    ity or My mission."—The Desire of Ages, page 171.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Most everyone is eager to preserve and sustain physical
                    life, but how anxious am I to obtain eternal life?

                       "Like Israel of old, the wicked destroy themselves; they fall
                    by their iniquity. By a life of sin, they have placed themselves
                    so out of harmony with God, their natures have become so
                    debased with evil, that the manifestation of His glory is to them
                    a consuming fire."—The Great Controversy, page 37.

                                                                          March 20

             Part 5       "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh proflteth noth-
   WE ACCEPT JESUS     ing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and
                       they are life." John 6:63.
 THROUGH HIS WORD
                          Basically, we learn to know Jesus through the Word, the
                      Bible, as it is illuminated or made alive to us through the Holy
                      Spirit. There is indeed a personal illumination or an existential-
                      ist experience, but the personal illumination must be constantly
                      checked by the Written Word so that the personal illumination
                      will be in harmony with the objective or historical revelation
                      contained in the Bible. Only in this way can we be sure that
                      our personal illumination is of divine origin. Satan is today
                      vigilant in tearing down confidence in the Written Word and
                      substituting for it belief in alleged personal revelations from
                      God, which diverge from the teachings of the Bible.

                          On what occasions did Jesus manifest His confidence in
                      the written revelation rather than relying on a personal reve-
                      lation? Luke 16:31; cf. Matt. 4:4 and Deut. 8:3; Matt. 4:7 and
                      Deut. 6:16; Matt. 4:10 and Deut. 6:13.

                          "The creative energy that called the worlds into existence
                      is in the word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life.
                      Every command is a promise; accepted by the will, received
                      into the soul, it brings with it the life of the Infinite One. It
                      transforms the nature and re-creates the soul in the image of
                      God.
                          "The life thus imparted is in like manner sustained. 'By
                      every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God' (Matthew
                      4:4) shall man live."—Education, page 126.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Do I esteem it as great a privilege to commune with God
                      and Jesus through the Bible as I would to speak to Them
                      face to face?

                         "By looking constantly to Jesus with the eye of faith, we
                      shall be strengthened. . . . As they [God's people] feed upon
                      His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys
                      the natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ
                      Jesus. The Holy Spirit comes to the soul as a Comforter. By
                      the transforming agency of His grace, the image of God is
                      reproduced in the disciple; he becomes a new creature. Love
                      takes the place of hatred, and the heart receives the divine
                      similitude. This is what it means to live `by every word that
                      proceedeth out of the mouth of God.' This is eating the Bread
                      that comes down from heaven."—The Desire'of Ages, page 391.

                                                                         March 21

           Part 6      "I and my Father are one." John 10:30.
       JESUS AND
  FATHER ARE ONE       Many other languages, including the Greek in which this
                    verse was originally written, make it plain that "one" in this
                    verse does not denote one person, but rather one in substance,
                    essence, or nature. God the Father and God the Son are one
                    and the same in nature. Thus, as the Father has life in Himself,
                    so the Son has life in Himself. "In Christ is life, original, un-
                    borrowed, underived."—The Desire of Ages, page 530.

                       How was this oneness of Jesus with His Father reflected in
                    His words and deeds? John 12:49; 5:19.

                        Jesus spoke and acted in complete harmony with His
                    Father's will. In heaven they had been one "from the days of
                    eternity."—The Desire of Ages, page 19. When He came to this
                    earth as a man, He continued to speak and act in harmony
                    with His Father's will.
                        From Christ's infancy to His death on the cross Satan re-
                    peatedly tried to shatter this divine oneness. But even as a
                    man, Jesus was completely loyal to His Father by surrendering
                    His will to His Father's will moment by moment.
                        "From all eternity Christ was united with the Father, and
                    when He took upon Himself human nature, He was still one
                    with God. He is the link that unites God with humanity. 'For-
                    asmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
                    he also himself likewise took part of the same' (Heb. 2:14).
                    Only through Him can we become Children of God. To all who
                    believe on Him, He gives power to become the sons of God.
                    Thus the heart becomes the temple of the living God. It is
                    because Christ took human nature that men and women be-
                    come partakers of the divine nature. He brings life and immor-
                    tality to light through the gospel."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1,
                    p. 228.

 THINK IT THROUGH       In your concept of God the Father and God the Son, are
                    they alike in character and attitude toward man, or do they
                    differ?

                        "As the severed branch, leafless, and apparently lifeless,
                    is ingrafted into the living stock, and, fiber by fiber, and vein
                    by vein, drinks in the life and strength of the vine until it buds
                    and blossoms and bears fruit, even so may the sinner, by re-
                    pentance and faith, connect himself with Christ, become a
                    partaker of the divine nature, and bring forth in words and
                    deeds the fruit of a holy life."—Our High Calling, page 145.

GOD IS LIKE THIS-


   He Desires
People's Freedom
   "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." John
8:36.
    People often view God as a manipulator of the human will. But such manipu-
lation is a characteristic of Satan, not of God. Sometimes God may appear
as coercing people, but such appearances are not the reality. Jesus reflects
the Father in this respect as He reflects Him in other characteristics. In the
Gospels, Jesus' relationship to people can be seen to be requesting, pleading,
and teaching. He forthrightly disavowed the use of force to deliver Himself
from His persecutors. Concerning Christ's arrest, E. G. White wrote: "They
[the disciples] were disappointed and indignant as they saw the cords brought
forward to bind the hands of Him whom they loved. Peter in his anger rashly
drew his sword and tried to defend his Master; but he only cut off an ear of
the high priest's servant. When Jesus saw what was done, He released His
hands, though held firmly by the Roman soldiers, and saying, 'Suffer ye thus
far,' He touched the wounded ear, and it was instantly made whole. He then
said to Peter, 'Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the
sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to
My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?'
—a legion in place of each one of the disciples."—The Desire of Ages, page
696.
    Jesus did not overpower the wills of men. In this week's lesson we will study
 some of the instances in the life of Jesus that reveal the heavenly Father's
 desire for the freedom of His children.
    This freedom, we will note, is of two kinds: (1) the freedom to choose be-
 tween right and wrong, and (2) the spiritual freedom that results from accept-
ance of Jesus as Lord. Both aspects of freedom are noted in this week's lesson.

            Part 1       "And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said
 JESUS RESPECTED      Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly." John 13:27.
 JUDAS'S FREEDOM         Jesus honored man's right to choose freely. He recognized
                      Judas's opportunity to follow the inducements of Satan and
                      betray Him into the hands of His enemies if he so chose, or
                      to do God's will and remain loyal to his Master. At the Last
                      Supper Judas finally and conclusively chose to do despite to
                      the Holy Spirit's pleading with him.
                         "John and Judas are representatives of those who profess
                      to be Christ's followers. Both these disciples had the same
                      opportunities to study and follow the divine Pattern. Both were
                      closely associated with Jesus and were privileged to listen to
                      His teaching. Each possessed serious defects of character; and
                      each had access to the divine grace that transforms character.
                      But while one in humility was learning of Jesus, the other re-
                      vealed that he was not a doer of the word, but a hearer only.
                      One, daily dying to self and overcoming sin, was sanctified
                      through the truth; the other, resisting the transforming power
                      of grace and indulging selfish desires, was brought into bond-
                      age to Satan."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 558.

                         What incident or experience confirmed Judas in his re-
                      jection of Jesus as his Master? Matt. 26:6-16; John 12:4-8.

                          The criticism of Mary's generous deed apparently began
                       with Judas. "Mary's act was in marked contrast with that which
                      Judas was about to do. What a sharp lesson Christ might have
                      given him who had dropped the seed of criticism and evil
                      thinking into the minds of the disciples! How justly the ac-
                      cuser might have been accused! . . . The Saviour reproached
                      him not....
                          "But the look which Jesus cast upon Judas convinced him
                      that the Saviour penetrated his hypocrisy, and read his base,
                       contemptible character. And in commending Mary's action,
                      which had been so severely condemned, Christ had rebuked
                      Judas. Prior to this, the Saviour had never given him a direct
                      rebuke."—The Desire of Ages, page 563.

                         In what way did Judas's decision to betray his Master
                      end? Matt. 27:3-5.

 THINK IT THROUGH        I, too, possess freedom of choice. How do I use it when
                      someone slights or insults me or possibly reprimands me?
                      Do I choose to cherish a spirit of retaliation, or do I entertain
                      a spirit of forgiveness?

          Part 2   Read Luke 15:11-13.
   PRODIGAL AS A
                   The father in this parable represents God. The prodigal
  SYMBOL OF MAN represents the sinner who walks away from God. The prodigal
                    wanted freedom from his father's presence and surveillance.
                    He also knew how to get it. He simply told his father he
                    wanted to leave him, and the father did not seek to keep him
                    by force.

                       How may we become sons of God? John 1:12, 13.

                       God wants us all as His children to abide within the house
                    of His will. We are called to be His sons. But the decision
                    whether or not we choose to live with Him and abide by His
                    will as His sons is ours to make.

                       After a while what happened to the prodigal in the
                    strange land? Luke 15:14-16.

                       "The lesson of the prodigal is given for the instruction of
                    youth. In his life of pleasure and sinful indulgence, he expends
                    his portion of the inheritance in riotous living. He is friendless,
                    and in a strange country; clad in rags, hungry, longing even
                    for the refuse fed to the swine. His last hope is to return,
                    penitent and humbled, to his father's house, where he is
                    welcomed, forgiven, and taken back to a father's heart. Many
                    youth are doing as he did, living a careless, pleasure-loving,
                    spendthrift life, forsaking the fountain of living waters, the
                    fountain of true pleasure, and hewing out to themselves broken
                    cisterns, which can hold no water."—Messages to Young Peo-
                    ple, page 408.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Do I occasionally walk away from God willfully as did
                    the prodigal? Why?

                       "Christ has enjoined upon His disciples that they co-operate
                    with Him in His work, that they love one another as He has loved
                    them. The agony which He endured upon the cross testifies to
                    the estimate He places upon the human soul. All who accept
                    this great salvation pledge themselves to be co-workers with
                    Him. None are to consider themselves special favorites of
                    heaven and center their interest and attention upon self. All
                    who have enlisted in the service of Christ are to work as He

              Part 3      "And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired
         PRODIGAL'S    servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and
      TRUE FREEDOM     I perish with hunger!" Luke 15:17.
       WITH FATHER
                          The prodigal, while still at home, had had his every need
                       supplied. In the faraway country he had also lived lavishly
                       until his pecuniary resources were depleted. With his wealth
                       gone, necessity stared him in the face. He was now forced
                       to do some thinking, and, through his volitional response to
                       his father's love, his thoughts turned in the right direction—
                       toward his father. "He came to himself," or realized his prior
                       foolishness. He then exercised his willpower and chose to re-
                       turn to his father.
                          What shows that his change of heart was genuine? Luke
                       15:18, 19.
                          True repentance accepts the guilt of departure from the
                       right. The repentant prodigal did not say, or think, that it was
                       his father's fault—sternness, rigidity for the right, insufficient
                       time for recreation or self-enjoyment—that had forced him to
                       leave home. He simply said, "I have sinned."
                          How did the father receive his returning son? Luke 15:20,
                       22-24.
                           The prodigal found true freedom in his return to his father.
                       In the far country he had been but a slave, eking out a meager
                       living by herding swine. On his return he was instantly restored
                       to sonship. The father gave him a ring and put shoes on his
                       feet.
                           What is Jesus' attitude toward those who return to Him?
                       John 6:37; Matt. 11:28-30.
                          All those of us who have been in the "strange land" and
                       done yeoman's service for the enemy of our souls God gladly
                       welcomes back to His house. Jesus sets us free. He purchased
                       the right to do this by His death for us on the cross. See The
                       Desire of Ages, page 745.
 THINK IT THROUGH         How much do I appreciate Christ's deliverance from Sa-
                       tan's slavery?
                          "We are saved because God loves the purchase of the blood
                       of Christ; and not only will He pardon the repentant sinner,
                       not only will He permit him to enter heaven, but He, the Father
                       of mercies, will wait at the very gates of heaven to welcome
                       us, to give us an abundant entrance to the mansions of the
                       blest."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

He Desires People's Freedom LESSON 13                              ❑   Wednesday
                                                                        March 26

           Part 4   "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be
   JESUS CAME TO free indeed." John 8:36.
    SET MAN FREE    Freedom is found only in fellowship with God through Jesus.
                    There is no freedom apart from God, since separated from
                    God there is only death. In order to be free one must be alive,
                    and life eternal is available to man only as he is grafted into
                    the vine which is Jesus.
                        "To obey God is not to enter into servitude to God, but to
                    enter into fellowship with God, and that fellowship is eternal
                    life. .   . Even on the human level, the more explicitly we
                    obey a person, the more we can enter into fellowship with
                    him, and the more he can tell us about himself."—William
                    Barclay, Jesus as They Saw Him (New York: Harper & Row,
                    1962), page 286.
                        "Christ came to break the shackles of sin-slavery from the
                    soul. 'If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be
                    free indeed.' The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus' sets
                    us 'free from the law of sin and death.' Rom. 8:2.
                        "In the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No ex-
                    ternal force is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of
                    God, man is left free to choose whom he will serve. In the
                    change that takes place when the soul surrenders to Christ,
                    there is the highest sense of freedom. The expulsion of sin is
                    the act of the soul itself. True, we have no power to free our-
                    selves from Satan's control; but when we desire to be set
                    free from sin, and in our great need cry out for a power out
                    of and above ourselves, the powers of the soul are imbued
                    with the divine energy of the Holy Spirit, and they obey the
                    dictates of the will in fulfilling the will of God."—The Desire
                    of Ages, page 466.
                       According to the words of Jesus, do many avail them-
                    selves of the freedom He offers? Matt. 22:14.

                       "It is a matter of the greatest wonder to the heavenly host
                    that so few care to be freed from the bondage of evil influences,
                    so few are willing to exercise all their powers in harmony with
                    Christ in the great work of their deliverance."—Our High Call-
                    ing, page 321.
 THINK IT THROUGH     Have I occasionally lingered before accepting God's free-
                    dom from sin? Why?
                        "The only freedom finite will can enjoy, consists in coming
                    into harmony with the will of God, complying with the con-
                    ditions that make man a partaker of the divine nature."—Our

He Desires People's Freedom LESSON 13                                 ❑ Thursday
                                                                        March 27

          Part 5        "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of ev-
MAN CREATED FREE    ery tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the
                    tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat
                    of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
                    die." Gen. 2:16, 17.

                       Implicit in God's command to Adam and Eve, not to eat of
                    the tree of knowledge of good and evil, was their ability to
                    act contrary to God's desire for them if they so chose. God
                    created man with free moral choice.
                       It was God's hope that Adam and Eve and their descendants
                    would abide by His will for them. By successfully/overcoming
                    the suggestions of the tempter and remaining loyal to God
                    they would develop from innocence to virtue. Unfallen man
                    "was placed in circumstances of probation. That is to say, the
                    citadel of his nature was his will. It was for him to choose
                    whether he would abide in that relation to God which would
                    ensure his fullest realization of possibility, or whether he would
                    by severance from God encompass his own ruin. It was a
                    terrible and awful alternative. Yet unless it were offered to
                    man, the highest fact of his being would be atrophied, for will
                    power, having no choice, ceases to be of value."—G. Campbell
                    Morgan, The Crisis of the Christ (New York: Fleming H. Revell
                    Co., 1903), page 31.
                        Despite Adam and Eve and their descendants' wrong use
                    of free choice, what did God still grant to man? Deut. 30:19;
                    Joshua 24:15; 1 Kings 18:21.

                       "The will is the governing power in the nature of man, the
                    power of decision, or choice. Every human being possessed
                    of reason has power to choose the right. In every experience
                    of life, God's word to us is, 'Choose you this day whom ye
                    will serve.' Joshua 24:15. Everyone may place his will on the
                    side of the will of God, may choose to obey Him, and by thus
                    linking himself with divine agencies, he may stand where
                    nothing can force him to do evil."—Education, page 289.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How do I use this divine endowment of free moral agency
                    —contrary to God's plan as did Adam and Eve, or in accord-
                    ance with His will for me?

                       "0 that every one might realize that he is the arbiter of his
                    own destiny! Your happiness for this life, and for the future,
                    immortal life lies with yourself."—Messages to Young People,

           Part 6      "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate
  CHOICE BETWEEN    the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one,
                    and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
 GOD AND MAMMON     Matt. 6:24.

                        It is impossible to serve two masters whose characters and
                    interests are different.
                        "Those who begin their Christian life by being half and
                    half, will at last be found enlisted on the enemy's side, what-
                    ever may have been their first intentions. And to be an apos-
                    tate, a traitor to the cause of God, is more serious than death;
                    for it means the loss of eternal life."—Ellen G. White Com-
                     ments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 5, p. 1086.

                       How do we show whose servants we are? Rom. 6:16; cf.
                    2 Peter 2:19.

                        "Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under
                    the control of another power. He is not his own. He may talk
                    of freedom, but he is in the most abject slavery. He is not
                    allowed to see the beauty of truth, for his mind is under the
                    control of Satan. While he flatters himself that he is following
                    the dictates of his own judgment, he obeys the will of the
                    prince of darkness."—The Desire of Ages, page 466.
                        In the state of sin man is divided between two loyalties—
                    loyalty to God and loyalty to Satan. But no man can retain
                    mental and/or physical health while he is constantly drawn
                    in two directions. If he does not make up his mind, he finally
                    becomes a schizophrenic.
                        Some of us as youngsters were intrigued with absolute
                    freedom. We neither wanted to be subject to God nor to the
                    devil. We wanted to be a third entity as it were, but search
                    for such a status is in vain. Absolute freedom does not exist.
                    Man is either a servant of "sin unto death, or of obedience
                    unto righteousness." Through individual choice every moral
                    being places himself either on the side of Satan or on the side
                    of God. There is no other alternative.

 THINK IT THROUGH     On whose side do I usually place myself through my per-
                    sonal choice—on the side of Jesus or on the side of Satan?

                       "To every nation and to every individual of today God has
                    assigned a place in His great plan. Today men and nations are
                    being measured by the plummet in the hand of Him who makes
                    no mistake. All are by their own choice deciding their destiny."
