TO: Sabbath School Members
     Around the World.
                          S

Dear Sabbath School Members,

     I have been•deegy impiessed by the way the members of the Sabbath School
family are continually helping one'another.: Since I have been working in the
administration, I have observed in the statistical_reports-:the wonderful re-
sults of the enthusiasm generated in our Sabbath Schools for the world-wide
mission program.

     Now, we in the Euro-Africa Division are the recipients. Whether we give,
or whether we receive, we are all blessed by God Who looks .with loving favor
upon His children in all lands.

   ' Even now, before we receive your offering, we would like to thank you for
your sacrifice. We will be directing the ."Overflow7 from the thirteenth
Sabbath to the follOwing very needy projects:

     1. Italian Publishing House. The sale of our literature by our litera-
ture evangelists has developed so rapidly that ourpublishing house is too
small to cope with the needs of the work. Built in 1925 when we had only
about 400 members in Italy, this fine institution has served us well. But
now.we must expand,. and we are counting on you to assist us.

   - 2. Union Training School - Mozambique. With 14,000 'church members, and
27,000 Sabbath School members, our educational program in Mozambique is
stretched to the limit. We have many elementary schools, but only''one secon-
dary school, namely •Munguluni Training School,„ established in 1957. Unfor7,
tunately, this school has no provision to enable students to earn their board
or tuition.; There is no scope for industry or agriculture. So a new school
is to be built near Beira, which will provide a well balanced training program
forour workers. We are sure you will want to help in this project.

     Will you not give generously this thirteenth Sabbath? Let us'prepare for
this offering, and God will bless what we do.

Your brother in the faith,

                       In the Image of God
                                  Introduction

     Man has always asked questions about himself: What is life? What is living?
Why is there evil? Where did I come from? Where am I going? Yet never before
has the question, What is man? been of such overwhelming concern to so many
people all over the world.
     The reasons are found in what has been happening to us. Evolutionary theory
has eroded the view of man as a creature of God, but it has failed to give man
the meaning of his life and destiny. The revolutionary changes of our time have
affected every aspect of our lives: our work, our personhood, our relation with
other people, our life-style, our interests, and our morality. The thousand-and-one
new ideologies and philosophies on man, including the "new morality" and hun-
dreds of new cults and sects, have caused great intellectual confusion, moral
restlessness, and spiritual bewilderment.
     But though there exists a remarkable consensus among thinking people every-
where that man is seriously ill and needs healing, people differ concerning the
real causes of man's illness and brokenness. And how can we even start thinking
about healing man before we know for sure what the disease is and what causes
it? But our understanding of the disease and its causes, and our insights into the
best way to heal and to help man, hinge on the question, What is man?
     In our scientific age many have turned to science for an answer to the ques-
tions about man. Science has given us many insights and great power; but to the
question, What is man? it has no answer. "Man is," wrote Alexis Carrel, scientist
and Nobel Prize winner for physiology, "a great unknown, and a stranger."
     Many in our day, therefore, are turning to philosophy, mysticism, occultism, or
spiritualism to find an answer to the pressing question, What is man? But, though
philosophy has greatly enhanced our understanding of man, its insights and find-
ings are so diverse and so contradictory that it is impossible to find in existen-
tialism, Marxism, vitalism, humanism, or any of the many other "isms" a view of
man that is central to them all and that could guide us in the struggles, ques-
tions, and perplexities of life. Philosophers and mystics are human too. They can
look at man only from within their own limited human experience. But there is
no real knowledge about man within man himself.
     To find out, therefore, who and what we are, we must go beyond the limita-
 tions set by our own senses and experiences. We must turn to a source that lies
outside of man. That source we find in God's revelation; that is, in the inspired
 Word of God. Who but the Spirit of God really understands our minds, and who
 but God knows our hearts? And as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. Prov. 23:7,
KJV. It is as the psalmist says, "In thy light shall we see light." Ps. 36:9.
     This quarter's study centers on the Biblical view of man. This is not a mere
theoretical discussion on "dry doctrines"; it is an issue of practical concern.
 The Biblical message on man is the only solution to modern man's confusion,
 restlessness, and bewilderment. It is like a cup of water to a person dying from
 thirst in a desert. It is the only medicine that can heal man from his present
 illness, the only cure to restore him from his brokenness. May the insights
 gained during this quarter of Bible study inspire us to go out into the world to
 announce the good news to all men. May this study also hasten the day when
 we shall all be renewed after the image of Christ (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10) and
 reflect His character in our lives and thoughts, so that our Lord can come and
 our destiny can be fulfilled.
                                                                                  5

                                                                       LESSON 1
                                                               March 30-April 5




   "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
him." Gen. 1:27.

    The Bible pictures man as a creature made in the image of God. See Gen.
1:26, 27; 5:1, 2; 9:6; Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10; James 3:9. In this term lies the whole
essence of man—his origin, his nature, and his destiny. But what does the term
actually mean? Many books have been written in an attempt to give a right in-
terpretation of the term "the image of God." And there is yet no end to the
debate. What is the difficulty? For one thing, the reality of it is foreign to us.
We cannot point to any ordinary human being who in his life and person fully
reflects the image of God. Furthermore, the Bible itself nowhere gives us a full
and clear definition. To the contrary, from the many texts that speak of the
image of God a rather large variety of meanings emerges. Adam and Eve were
the only persons who, at least for some time, really lived up to their calling as
the image of God; but the descriptions of them in the Bible are very limited.
    Would Bible writers have used the term so often if it is impossible for man
to understand its true meaning? Would they have urged us to be renewed after
the image of our Creator if they had not spelled out its meaning? Would Ellen
White so consistently have written about the restoration of the image of God
in man as Jesus' work of redemption if the meaning were unknowable? The
 descriptions of Adam, the first man created in the image of God, may be vague.
 But the first Adam has been followed by the second Adam. In Jesus Christ,
 whom the Scriptures call the very image of God, we find the perfect model of
 a true man. See 2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15. And the apostle Paul says that the be-
 liever has to "put on the new nature, which is being constantly renewed in the
 image of its Creator," "which shows itself in the just and devout life." Col. 3:10;
 Eph. 4:24, NEB. The conclusion is that by a diligent study of the Word of God,
 by comparing scripture with scripture, and by studying the life and the person of
 Jesus Christ as the very image of God, we may indeed find the essential meaning
 of the term, "image of God." Ellen White wrote that "the education to be se-
 cured by searching the Scriptures is an experimental knowledge of the plan
 of salvation. Such an education will restore the image of God in the soul."—
 Christ's Object Lessons, pages 42, 43.
     "The word destroys the natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in
 Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit comes to the soul as a Comforter. By the trans-
 forming agency of His grace, the image of God is reproduced in the disciple;
 he becomes a new creature."—The Desire of Ages, page 391.

The Image of God         LESSON 1                                     ❑ Sunday
                                                                       March30


        Part 1     "And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to
      MAN IS A dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the
               times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
     CREATURE . . . for in him we live, and move, and have our being." Acts
                   17:26-28.
                      The message that emerges from every passage speaking
                   of man as the image of God (Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:1-3; 9:6; Col.
                   3:10) is: Man owes his life to God. He does not exist by him-
                   self. Scientists have advanced theories to explain the origin
                   of life, but true scientific investigation cannot penetrate the
                   moment of beginning. We owe our life to God. It did not begin
                   spontaneously, and it does not continue by itself.
                     To what events does the Bible ascribe the origin of life in
                   man? Gen. 2:7.
                      It is apparent that man has no life in himself, no natural
                   immortality; only God has. But, as a creature made in the image
                   of God, man was made "to share in the very being of God,"
                   who is life. 2 Peter 1:4, NEB. See also John 14:6.
                      What are some of the images used in the Bible to empha-
                   size man's dependence upon his Maker? Isa. 64:8; Jer.
                   18:2-11; John 15:5, 6.
                      What is the meaning of the tree of life in Genesis 2:9?
                   See also Gen. 3:22-24.
                       "The tree of life is a representation of the preserving care
                   of Christ for His children. As Adam and Eve ate of this tree,
                   they acknowledged their dependence upon God. The tree of
                   life possessed the power to perpetuate life, and as long as
                   they ate it, they could not die. The lives of the antediluvians
                   were protracted because of the life-giving power of this tree,
                   which was transmitted to them from Adam and Eve."—Ellen
                   G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 988.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways do I recognize my dependence upon God?
                      "God created man in His own image. Here is no mystery.
                   There is no ground for the supposition that man was evolved
                   by slow degrees of development from the lower forms of animal
                   or vegetable life....
                      "Man was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was
                   in harmony with the will of God. . . . His affections were pure;
                   his appetites and passions were under the control of reason.
                   He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God and in
                   perfect obedience to His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

The Image of God LESSON 1                                            ❑   Monday
                                                                         March 31

         Part 2    For what purpose was man created? Isa. 43:7; 1 Cor.
TO GLORIFY GOD  6:19, 20.

                      To be called the image of God implies a very special rela-
                   tionship between man and God. Animals and plants, too, de-
                   pend upon God for their life. But as the image of God, man
                   received the power to think and to speak so that he could
                   respond to God. That ability to respond—returning love for
                   love and gratitude for grace—meant that man also had re-
                   sponsibility for what he would do, say, and think.

                      Since the creation declares the glory of God (Ps. 19:1-6),
                   what difference is there between man's way of glorifying
                   God and that of the rest of God's creation? John 15:8; Matt.
                   5:16; Rom. 15:5, 6.

                       Only man has the ability to acknowledge Jesus as Creator.
                   The whole creation declares the glory of God. But it does so
                   unawares, not by its own choice or volition. Only man, being
                   in the image of God, can consciously and in freedom respond
                   to his Creator and acknowledge the goal for which he was
                   made, that is, to glorify God. As soon as he loses sight of that
                   goal, life loses its quality. Then the image of God is marred,
                   and man is thrown off balance.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the relationship between the first angel's message
                   and the restoration of the image of God? Read Rev. 14:6, 7.

                       "Created to be 'the image and glory of God' (1 Corinthians
                   11:7), Adam and Eve had received endowments not unworthy
                   of their high destiny. Graceful and symmetrical in form, regular
                   and beautiful in feature, their countenances glowing with the
                   tint of health and the light of joy and hope, they bore in out-
                   ward resemblance the likeness of their Maker. Nor was this
                   likeness manifest in the physical nature only. Every faculty
                   of mind and soul reflected the Creator's glory."—Education,
                   page 20.
                       "Many misunderstand the object for which they were cre-
                   ated. It was to bless humanity and glorify God, rather than to
                   enjoy and glorify self."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 354.
                       "'God created man in His own image' (Genesis 1:27), and
                   it was His purpose that the longer man lived the more fully he
                   should reveal this image—the more fully reflect the glory of
                   the Creator."—Education, page 15.

         Part 3    "Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign

                   your God." Ezek. 20:12, 20.
                      In Eden God gave Adam and Eve a clear sign to remind
                   them constantly of their high calling, nature, and destiny as
                   the image of God.
                       What seal did God put on His image, and for what pur-
                   pose? Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Ezek. 20:20; Mark 2:27.
                       God blessed the seventh day and made it holy. That is, God
                   set the day aside as a special day to remind man of his de-
                   pendence upon his Maker. By instituting the Sabbath, a special
                   gift of grace (Mark 2:27), God constantly reminds man of the
                   fact that it is He who holds the times in His hands (Ps. 31:14,
                   15), who sustains the universe (Heb. 1:2, 3) and who gives
                   man life and breath and all else (Acts 17:25). It is the cord
                   that ties man to God. With the Sabbath God has provided a
                   seal for man as His image. The seal and image of God are
                   so intimately related that to break one is to break the other.
                   This is clear throughout the whole history of God's people.
                      By what three incidents did Jesus confirm the intimate
                   relationship between the Sabbath and the work of restoring
                   the image of God in man? John 5:1-18; Matt. 12:1-14.
THINK IT THROUGH      How does Sabbath observance help me in living up to my
                   calling and destiny as the image of God?
                       "'The importance of the Sabbath as the memorial of crea-
                   tion is that it keeps ever present the true reason why worship
                   is due to God'—because He is the Creator, and we are His
                   creatures. 'The Sabbath therefore lies at the very foundation
                   of divine worship, for it teaches this great truth in the most
                   impressive manner, and no other institution does this. The
                   true ground of divine worship, not of that on the seventh day
                   merely, but of all worship, is found in the distinction between
                   the Creator and His creatures. . . .'—J. N. Andrews, History
                   of the Sabbath, chapter 27. It was to keep this truth ever before
                   the minds of men, that God instituted the Sabbath in Eden. . . .
                   Had the Sabbath been universally kept, man's thoughts and
                   affections would have been led to the Creator as the object of
                   reverence and worship, and there would never have been an
                   idolater, an atheist, or an infidel."—The Great Controversy,

The Image of God         LESSON 1                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       April 2

        Part 4       "So God created man in his own image, in the image of
     MALE AND      God created he him; male and female created he them."
                   Gen. 1:27.
       FEMALE
                      "In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God
                   made he him; male and female created he them; and blessed
                   them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they
                   were created." ten. 5:1, 2.
                      There is a sense in which man was not made a single in-
                   dividual, but two. The image of God is a plurality. Notice what
                   the text says: "Male and female He created them . . . and
                   named them Man." Gen. 5:1, 2, RSV. Not Adam alone is man.
                   As male and female, in their togetherness, they are called man.
                      The name "Adam" and the word "man" are the same word
                   in Hebrew; thus some Bible versions use "Adam" in the above
                   texts, while others use "man."
                      What words of God to man, and about him, suggest that
                   the image of God includes the partnership between male and
                   female? Gen. 1:27, 28; 2:18-24.
                      One other passage deserves consideration in this connec-
                   tion. Genesis 1:26 states: "And God said, Let us make man in
                   our image." Why does the Scripture here suddenly introduce
                   the plural pronouns, "us" and "our"? God did not use them
                   when He made the planets and the earth and all that is in it.
                   We can infer that there is a relationship between the creation
                   of man in the image of God and the use of the plural pronouns
                   "us" and "our." God Himself consists of more than one person
                   (1 Cor. 8:6; John 1:1-3; Matt. 28:19); and His image, therefore,
                   reflects that plurality.
                       The duality of male and female does not refer only to man's
                   sexuality. Man, in the Biblical view, is not characterized by his
                   biological nature, but by his personality and his relationships.
                   Man is always a total person, an indivisible whole. Male and
                   female are two complementary ways of being a human person.
                   The Biblical view of man holds that male and female are per-
                   sons who are made for each other, who need each other, who
                   challenge each other, who complement each other, and who
                   enrich each other. This can be seen in everyday Christian re-
                   lationships between men and,women.
                       In their togetherness they are called "man," made in the
                   image of God.
THINK IT THROUGH     In which ways can a person best fulfill his calling as the
                   image of God? Is marriage the only way?

                   social being."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 46.

The Image of God       LESSON 1                                  ❑ Thursday
                                                                     April 3

         Part 5      "And God said, Let us make man 'in our image, after our
       TO RULE   likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the
                 sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and
     THE EARTH   over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
                 upon the earth." Gen. 1:26.
                     The whole creation was made for a purpose. The record
                 states that when creation stood completed, "God saw every
                 thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good." Gen.
                 1:31. This means that the entire creation was well suited for
                 the particular purpose for which God had made it. From the
                 way the creation account is given it may be concluded further
                 that each step was meant as a preparation for the next. Last
                 in creation came man, the one for whom it was made, the
                 image of God. To him was given dominion over the whole•
                 earth and all that was in it.
                     What majestic role did God give to man in the universe?
                 Ps. 8:1-9.
                     "Every human being, created in the image of God, is en-
                 dowed with a power akin to that of the Creator—individuality,
                 power to think and to do."—Education, page 17. Made lower
                 than God, he was crowned with glory and honor. He was made
                 for the exercise of kingly powers. This is a far cry from the
                 pessimism, the poverty, and the powerlessness of the millions
                 of people living in misery today. But that was never God's
                 intention. It came upon man when he broke his relationship
                 with God, when he no longer recognized his Creator as the
                 source and owner of all things. Snatching at equality with God,
                 man fell from royal greatness to utter misery, from freedom
                  to slavery, from power to weakness. Since Psalm 8 refers to
                 man after he fell into sin, the message it contains is, in fact,
                 a call to return to the greatness and dignity with which the
                  Creator endowed man when He made him in His own image.
                      By what means and when will men again rule as kings
                  over the earth? 2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 5:9, 10 (see RSV); Rev. 3:21;
                 22:5.
THINK IT THROUGH      Is man's present control of the earth still an evidence of
                 his creation in the image of God? or is it an unholy usurpa-
                 tion of power? or both?
                     "He [God] has endowed us with a power not wholly unlike
                  His. To us has been given a degree of control over the forces
                  of nature. As God called forth the earth in its beauty out of
                  chaos, so we can bring order and beauty out of confusion. And
                  though all things are now marred with evil, yet in our com-
                  pleted work we feel a joy akin to His, when, looking on the
                  fair earth, He pronounced it 'very good.' "—Education, pages

The Image of God LESSON 1                                                ❑ Friday
                                                                           April 4

        Part 6         "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be
 AND SUBDUE IT     fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue
                   it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
                   fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon
                   the earth." Gen. 1:28.
                       The aspect of the image of God spelled out most elaborately
                   in Genesis 1:26-28 is man's relationship to the natural world.
                   Dominion over the earth, rulership over God's creation, the
                   charter to fill the earth, and the commission to work, to create,
                   to build, and to invent clearly belong to the very nature of
                   man. In this respect man is truly an image of his Maker, who
                   filled the earth with new life, and who continued to work con-
                   stantly in it. See Gen. 1, 2; John 5:17.
                      What divine charter is given to man in Genesis 2:15?
                       God's commission to Adam to till the garden and to care
                   for it is the very basis of man's cultural activities in the widest
                   sense of that word. Even the English word "culture"—referring
                   to the complex whole of human activities, thoughts, and be-
                   haviors—originates from a word that means "to plough; to till
                   the soil; to tend the garden." Paradise was not a place where
                   no work was to be done; it was the starting point of a dynamic
                   life of labor, thought, and human creativity under God. Work,
                   in the fullest sense of that word, is essential to man's whole
                   life.
                      What kind of work does Isaiah's prophecy of Judah in-
                   dicate man will still do in the new earth? Isa. 65:21-23.
                      Vigorous mental and physical activities are part of the nature
                   and calling of the image of God. They became "a safeguard
                   against temptation" (Patriarchs and Prophets, page 50) after
                   man fell into sin, and they will remain a part of his life in the
                   new earth. In Genesis 1:26-28; 2:15 and Isa. 65:21-23 we find
                   the divine charter for man's exploration of the earth, the devel-
                   opment and control of its resources.
                      Science and technology stem from this Biblical charter. The
                   earth and its space were made for man and given for his use.
THINK IT THROUGH      What prevents men today from being really in control of
                   the earth and its space?
                       "God appointed labor as a blessing to man. . . . In mental
                   and physical activity Adam found one of the highest pleasures
                   of his holy existence. . . . Our Creator, who understands what
                   is for man's happiness, appointed Adam his work. The true
                   joy of life is found only by the working men and women."—

                                                     LESSON 2          April 6 12

   "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to
the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
Rom. 8:29.

    The Biblical term, "the image of God," has a large variety of meanings. From
the texts it appears that these meanings may be summarized under three head-
ings: 1. Man is a child of God, made for His glory. 2. Man is made not for Himself,
but for fellowship with his fellowman, his neighbor. 3. Man was given dominion
over the earth and power to rule over nature.
    Ellen G. White, in a similar vein, summarized the image of God in the follow-
ing paragraph: "God created man a superior being; he alone is formed in the
image of God, and is capable of partaking of the divine nature, of cooperating
with his Creator and executing His plans."—Sons and Daughters of God, page 7.
    These thoughts put into perspective the commonly held view that the image
of God refers to man's power to speak and to think, his bodily features, or his
 "soul." These features are essential to enable man to act in his capacity as the
 image of God. But the root idea of the image of God is that man's capacities
 be used for the loving end to which God uses His omnipotence. This is indi-
 cated by the fact that a person may think, speak, and act in rebellion.
     The person of Jesus Christ is the standard by which the image of God can
 be explained. The Bible testifies of Him that He was the very image of God
(2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15) and thereby an example for us to follow (1 Peter 2:21) so
 that we might be renewed after His image (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10). Jesus Christ
 was the Son of man, an expression used almost eighty times in the Gdspels to
 indicate that "As Jesus was in human nature, so God means His followers to
 be."—Sons and Daughters of God, page 21.
     Jesus Christ, as the image of God, is not only the very source of our knowl-
 edge concerning man, his nature and his destiny; He is also the only standard
  by which all our understanding about man must be judged, and our only ex-
  ample to follow. Only in Jesus do we know what God intended us to be; and
  only in Him, and through Him, will we be renewed into the image of our Maker.
  "Christ came to this world, subject to His Father's will, for one great purpose
  —to show men and women what God desires them to be and what, through
  His grace, they may be."—Medical Ministry, page 42.

Jesus, the Example of God's Image LESSON 2                            ❑   Sunday
                                                                           April 6

         Part 1        "He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And
THE SON OF GOD     Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son
                   of the living God." Matt. 16:15, 16.

                       The question Jesus once raised, Who do the people say
                   the Son of man is? still confronts us today. Modern man's
                   reaction to Jesus is as varied as it was in the days when Jesus
                   lived as a man among men. Some say, He is a prophet; others,
                   He is possessed, a psychopath. Why listen to Him? See John
                   10:20, 21. What is our answer?

                     On what basis can men say, "Jesus is the Son of God"?
                   Matt. 9:1-8; 11:27, 28.

                       Any individual who is confronted with Jesus Christ recog-
                   nizes in Him a unique and very exceptional Person. Even His
                   enemies had to admit that He was different—in authority, in
                   power, in character, in holiness. This difference the Bible ex-
                   plains as the result of His divine origin. Jesus was God. He
                   forgave men their sins, which led people to the reaction, Who
                   but God alone can forgive sins? Matt. 9:1-8; Mark 2:5-7. Jesus,
                   in fact, had all the authority and power which the Scriptures
                   attribute only to God. John 5:26, 27; Matt. 28:18.
                     Why is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God necessary?
                   John 14:6-14; 17:3; Acts 4:11, 12; 16:31.

                      "The only way in which the fallen race could be restored
                   was through the gift of his Son, equal with himself, possessing
                   the attributes of God."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald,
                   Nov. 8, 1892, p. 690. (Quoted in Questions on Doctrine, page

THINK IT THROUGH     Do I really believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of
                   God? On what basis?

                      "Christ, the Word, the only begotten of God, was one with
                   the eternal Father—one in nature, in character, in purpose—the
                   only being that could enter into all the counsels and purposes
                   of God. 'His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The
                   mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.'

                   lasting.' Micah 5:2."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 34.
                      "No one, looking upon the childlike countenance, shining
                   with animation, could say that Christ was just like other chil-
                   dren. He was God in human flesh."—Ellen G. White, The

Jesus, the Example of God's Image LESSON 2                             El Monday
                                                                           April 7

        Part 2        Read John 1:1, 3, 14.
    THE WORD
   MADE FLESH         Though verily God, Jesus was at the same time truly man.
                   The Bible maintains that Jesus took upon Himself the form of
                   a human being, our flesh and blood, our very nature (Phil. 2:6,
                   7). This is a great mystery (1 Tim. 3:16), but it is the heart of
                   the Christian gospel, the basis of man's salvation (1 John 4:2, 3).
                      How much did Jesus actually become like a man? Rom.
                   8:3; Heb. 2:14-17; Phil. 2:6, 7.

                       "Christ did not make-believe take human nature; He did
                   verily take it. He did in reality possess human nature. 'As the
                   children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself like-
                   wise took part of the same.' He was the Son of Mary; He was
                   of the seed of David according to human descent."—Ellen G.
                   White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 5, p. 1130.
                      What Scriptural evidence is there that Jesus was verily a
                   man of our flesh and blood? Matt. 26:38; John 4:6, 7; Isa.
                   53:1-5.

                      "He came to this world in human form, to live a man
                   amongst men. He assumed the liabilities of human nature, to
                   be proved and tried."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, Vol. 5, p. 1114.
                     "Jesus was in all things made like unto His brethren. He
                   became flesh, even as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and
                   weary. He was sustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He
                   shared the lot of man."—The Desire of Ages, page 311.
                      Why did God become man? Luke 19:10; John 17:4-6;
                   1 John 3:8.

                      "Christ could not have come to this earth with the glory
                   that He had in the heavenly courts. Sinful human beings could
                   not have borne the sight. He veiled His divinity with the garb
                   of humanity, but He did not part with His divinity. A divine-
                   human Saviour, He came to stand at the head of the fallen
                   race, to share in their experience from childhood to manhood.
                   That human beings might be partakers of the divine nature, He
                   came to this earth, and lived a life of perfect obedience."—
                   Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, June 15, 1905. (Quoted in

Jesus, the Example of God's Image LESSON 2                           111 Tuesday
                                                                          April 8

       Part 3         "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;
                   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
      HE WAS
                   2 Cor. 5:21.
  WITHOUT SIN
                      Jesus was subject to all our infirmities, temptations, and
                   weaknesses. He subjected Himself to all the humbling condi-
                   tions of man's fallen nature after thousands of years of sin.
                   But He was without sin. 1 John 3:5. None could ever convict
                   Him of any wrongdoing, not even His enemies. John 8:46; Luke
                   23:14.
                      Could Jesus have fallen into sin?
                       "Many claim that it was impossible for Christ to be over-
                   come by temptation. Then He could not have been placed in
                   Adam's position; He could not have gained the victory that
                   Adam failed to gain. If we have in any sense a more trying
                   conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to succor
                   us. But our Saviour took humanity, with all its liabilities. He
                   took the nature of man, with the possibility of yielding to temp-
                   tation. We have nothing to bear which He has not endured."—
                   The Desire of Ages, page 117.
                      Can Jesus' example of living without sinning be reached
                   by men? 1 Peter 2:21, 22; 1 John 3:1-10.
                       Contrary to those who maintain that Jesus lived a sinless
                   life because of His divinity, the Bible assures us that Jesus
                   became a "second Adam" and lived His life of perfect obe-
                   dience to God and love to His neighbor as a human being. He
                   used no powers that are not available to any person who by
                   faith is renewed after the image of God. "Christ came to the
                   earth, taking humanity and standing as man's representative, to
                   show in the controversy with Satan that man, as God created
                   him, connected with the Father and the Son, could obey every
                   divine requirement."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 926.
                       "As Jesus was in human nature, so God means His followers
                   to be."—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 289.
                       "We cannot equal the pattern; but we shall not be approved
                   of God if we do not copy it and, according to the ability which
                   God has given, resemble it."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 549.
THINK IT THROUGH      What is there in my life that hinders me from imitating
                   the pattern of Christ?
                       "Christ has redeemed Adam's disgraceful fall, and has per-
                   fected a character of perfect obedience, and left an example
                   for the human family, that they may imitate the Pattern."—Ellen

Jesus, the Example of God's Image LESSON 2                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       April 9

         Part 4      "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
   HE HUMBLED      who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
                   equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took
       HIMSELF     upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the like-
                   ness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he
                   humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
                   death of the cross." Phil. 2:5-8.

                      From the very beginning to the very end Jesus lived for
                   God, doing His will and glorifying Him. To His parents He ex-
                   plained, "Did you not know that I must be in my Father's
                   house?" Luke 2:49, RSV. At His baptism Jesus told John the
                   Baptist that He wished to "fulfill all righteousness." Matt. 3:15,
                   RSV. And at the end of His life, Jesus cried out, "Not my will,
                   but thine, be done." Luke 22:42. From the beginning to the
                   end Jesus' life was characterized by His own words, "My food
                   is to do the will of him who sent me." John 4:34, RSV.

                     By what authority and power did Jesus live a life of
                   obedience to God? John 5:30; 8:28.

                      After Jesus had told His disciples that He could do nothing
                   of Himself and that all they had seen Him do was the result
                   of His total surrender to God, His Father, He added, "I am the
                   vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him,
                   the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
                   nothing." John 15:5. Man can live up to his calling as the image
                   of God only if he recognizes that without Christ he can do
                   nothing.

                      What did Jesus see as the purpose of His life? John 17:
                   1-4. See also Luke 2:13, 14.

                      Jesus could be the Person He was because He was wholly
                   dedicated to God, lived in total dependence upon Him, and
                   trusted and obeyed Him in everything. It is this characteristic
                   that sets Him apart from us and challenges us to become like
                   Him. As the pot is made for the glory of the potter, so is man
                   made to glorify Him whose image he bears.

THINK IT THROUGH       In which ways do I glorify God?

                      "'The light of the knowledge of the glory of God' is seen
                   'in the face of Jesus Christ.' . . . He was 'the image of God,'
                   the image of His greatness and majesty, 'the outshining of His
                   glory.' It was to manifest this glory that He came to our world."

         Part 5       What did Jesus teach was the fulfillment of His life?
      A LIFE OF
                      "Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your
       SERVICE     minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be
                   your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be minis-
                   tered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
                   many." Matt. 20:26-28.
                       What examples from Jesus' life give evidence that His
                   life was wholly devoted to His fellowmen? Matt. 4:23-25;
                   Luke 8:1, 2. See also Acts 10:38.
                       Jesus has shown us clearly that the image of God is real-
                   ized in a life of complete surrender to God and of a total de-
                   votion to our fellowmen. As the image of God, man lives to
                   glorify God and to serve his neighbor. These two aspects of
                   life are inseparable.
                      What is the relationship between our service to God and
                   our service to our fellowmen? Matt. 25:31-46; 1 John 4:11-21.
                      "His [Christ's] followers are not to feel themselves detached
                   from the perishing world around them. They are a part of the
                   great web of humanity; and Heaven looks upon them as broth-
                   ers to sinners as well as to saints. The fallen, the erring, and
                   the sinful, Christ's love embraces; and every deed of kindness
                   done to uplift a fallen soul, every act of mercy, is accepted as
                   done to Him."—The Desire of Ages, page 638.
THINK IT THROUGH      Who is my neighbor?
                       "In the story of the good Samaritan, Christ illustrates the
                    nature of true religion. He shows that it consists not in systems,
                    creeds, or rites, but in the performance of loving deeds, in
                   bringing the greatest good to others, in genuine goodness."
                   —The Desire of Ages, page 497.
                       "Christ has shown that our neighbor does not mean merely
                   one of the church or faith to which we belong. It has no refer-
                   ence to race, color, or class distinction. Our neighbor is every
                   person who needs our help.... Our neighbor is everyone who
                   is the property of God.
                       "In the story of the good Samaritan, Jesus gave a picture
                   of Himself and His mission....
                       "The lesson is no less needed in the world today.... Many
                   who profess His name have lost sight of the fact that Christians
                   are to represent Christ. Unless there is practical self-sacrifice
                   for the good of others, in the family circle, in the neighborhood,
                   in the church, and wherever we may be, then whatever our
                   profession, we are not Christians."—The Desire of Ages, pages

Jesus, the Example of God's Image LESSON 2                             ❑ Friday
                                                                        April II

        Part 6        "Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
 WIND AND SEA      there was a great calm. But the men marvelled, saying, What
                   manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey
     OBEY HIM      him!" Matt. 8:26, 27.
                      Indeed, what sort of a man is this? This experience points
                   out a third characteristic of Jesus, "the very image of God."
                   Besides living a life of total dependence upon His Father and
                   of service to His fellowmen, Jesus rules over the earth. He has
                   dominion over the wind and the sea; He is in control of the
                   fish and of the wild animals, as God had commissioned man
                   when He made him in His own image.
                       What other examples are there in Scripture of Jesus' con-
                   trol of nature? Luke 5:1-7; John 2:1-11.
                      These miracles of Jesus' control over nature have often been
                   ascribed to His divinity, and therefore as not related to our
                   human nature at all. But Jesus was man. Of course these
                   miracles are related to divine power, but not due to Jesus'
                   divinity. It is God's power working through Jesus. See follow-
                   ing quotation.
                      What is the main obstacle to man today in executing con-
                   trol over nature? Matt. 14:28-32; 17:14-18. See also Mark
                   16:16-20 and Acts 5:12-16.
                      "When Jesus was awakened to meet the storm, He was in
                   perfect peace. There was no trace of fear in word or look, for
                   no fear was in His heart. But He rested not in the possession
                   of almighty power. It was not as the 'Master of earth and sea
                   and sky' that He reposed in quiet. That power He had laid
                   down, and He says, 'I can of Mine own self do nothing.' John
                   5:30. He trusted in the Father's might. It was in faith—faith in
                   God's love and care—that Jesus rested, and the power of that
                   word which stilled the storm was the power of God."—The

                   of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.
                      "This work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ,
                   by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God.... The Christian
                   will feel the promptings of sin, but he will maintain a constant
                   warfare against it. Here is where Christ's help is needed. Human
                   weakness becomes united to divine strength."—The Great

    "We may behold and admire the work of God
in the natural world, but the human habitation is
the most wonderful.
    "From the first dawn of reason the human mind
should become intelligent in regard to the physical
structure. Here Jehovah has given a specimen of
Himself; for man was made in the image of God.
It is Satan's determined work to destroy the moral
image of God in man. He would make the intelli-
gence of man, his highest, noblest gift, the most
destructive agent to pollute with sin everything he
touches."—"Medical Ministry," page 221.
The Body
and God's Image
   "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice LESSON 3
and offering thou wouldest not, but a body host thou prepared A.,r,ll /349
me. . . . Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is writ-
ten of me,) to do thy will, 0 God." Heb. 10:5-7.
    In the Scripture the term "image of God" refers not only to what
man has, but also to what he is; not only to his abilities or his at-
tributes, but also to his activities, his character, his relationships.
Some have concluded, therefore, that man's physical nature, his
body, is of no importance. Throughout the centuries people have
believed that the image of God consists of man's soul or his moral
character only. But the Bible clearly states that when God created
Adam and Eve, He formed them from a material substance. "And
God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very
good." Gen. 1:31. There is no depreciation or contempt in the
Scriptures for man's physical existence. To the contrary, man's
physical form and attributes are the very instruments by which he
becomes a child of God, a neighbor, and a ruler over God's crea-
tion. There is, in essence, nothing inferior or immoral about the
human flesh. It is a divine gift and an indispensable part of man
as the image of God.
    A look at Jesus will affirm this view. He took "our sinful nature"
(Medical Ministry, page 181), "man's nature in its fallen condition"
(Signs of the Times, June 9, 1898) with all the "infirmities of de-
 generate humanity" (The Desire of Ages, page 117). Yet He was
without a taint of corruption and without sin. He was the perfect
image of God. It is obvious, then, that even though our bodies may
 be weak and frail, bearing the marks of ages of sin, we can still
 be the image of God, as Christ has shown us in His life and person.
    The Scripture writers do not distinguish between man's per-
sonality, character, or relationship to God and his fellowmen on
 the one hand, and his physical form or attributes on the other. In
Romans 12:1 the apostle Paul urges that we present our "bodies
 a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea-
sonable service." It is clear that the Bible does not refer here to
 our physical, biological substance, but to us as whole persons. Of
 Jesus we read in Luke 22:19 and 1 Corinthians 11:24 that He gave
 His body for us. What is meant, of course, is that Jesus gave Him-
self, as Paul also testifies in Galatians 1:3, 4: "Jesus Christ, who
 gave himself for our sins." The Biblical concept of man can be
 expressed by the statement: Man does not have a body; he is a
 body.

                                                                         April 13

         Part 1       What is the meaning of the word "flesh"?
  MAN IS FLESH
                       "And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam,
                   and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the
                   flesh instead thereof; . . . and Adam said, This is now bone
                   of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." Gen. 2:21, 23.

                       See also Ex. 30:32; Job 10:11; Ps. 79:2; Isa. 49:26.
                       The Hebrew word basar, meaning "flesh," is used 256 times
                   in the Old Testament. Basar stands for the divine gift of man's
                   physical form. It is the means through which man communicates
                   with God and his fellowmen, the form in which he fulfills his
                   divine calling and destiny. Basar is an indispensable part of
                   man as the image of God.
                      What other connotations does the word "flesh" have in
                   the Old Testament? Gen. 6:17, 19; 9:17; Job 10:4; Isa. 40:6-8.

                      Basar refers to both men and animals. Both are creatures,
                   which is also a meaning of flesh. In that respect man is totally
                   different from God—the Creator, all-powerful, all-knowing, and
                   present everywhere at once. But man, as flesh, can be at only
                   one place at a time; he is weak, has very limited knowledge,
                   and is mortal. "All flesh is grass, and . . . is as the flower of
                   the field." Isa. 40:6.
                       Note that basar does not have any connotation here of in-
                   feriority, evil, or sinfulness. But since man is weak and mortal,
                   the Old Testament writers considered it foolishness when a
                   person relied on the flesh; that is, on his own strength or the
                   strength of his fellow creatures. See Jer. 17:5; 2 Chron. 32:8.
                   The contrast is not between an evil body and a good soul or
                   spirit, but between a person who relies on himself and the
                   one who is flesh putting his trust in God. Man is flesh. This is
                   a challenge to rely solely on God, his Maker.

THINK IT THROUGH      What did Christ, really, give up when He became flesh?

                      "As a member of the human family He was mortal, but as
                   God He was the fountain of life to the world. He could, in His
                   divine person, ever have withstood the advances of death, and
                   refused to come under its dominion; but He voluntarily laid
                   down His life, that in so doing He might give life and bring
                   immortality to light. . . . What humility was this! It amazed
                   angels. The tongue can never describe it; the imagination
                   cannot take it in. The eternal Word consented to be made flesh!
                   God became man!"—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, July
                   5, 1887. (Quoted in Questions on Doctrine, page 56.)

The Body and God's Image LESSON 3                                     ❑    Monday
                                                                           April 14

        Part 2       "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother,
    ONE FLESH      and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
                   Gen. 2:24.

                      See also Eph. 5:31.
                      Basar (flesh) stands for the whole person in his physical
                   existence. Since all men are flesh, the word also refers to the
                   unity that exists between people. Through Noah God made a
                   covenant with all flesh. Gen. 9:17. God is, indeed, "the God
                   of all flesh." Jer. 32:27. In fact, the first time the Bible uses
                   the term "flesh," it is precisely to emphasize that man is a
                   social being, that the image of God consists of the together-
                   ness and solidarity between two or more people. To be of one
                   flesh, therefore, does not just refer to a biological union be-
                   tween man and woman, but to the fact that they are one family,
                   one kin, one communion. At marriage, this new communion
                   takes precedence over the relationship a person has had with
                   the members of the family in which he has been reared.
                      How does "being one flesh" help us in our lives? Gen.
                   37:27.
                      The more I recognize the oneness of all flesh, the less
                   hatred there can be between people "of one flesh." "For no
                   man ever yet hated his own flesh." Eph. 5:29. No man is an
                   island. It is precisely because of our lack of emphasis on the
                   fact that all men are made of one flesh—that we are all of one
                   race (flesh) and therefore brothers—that there is so much
                   loneliness, competition, and prejudice in the world today. The
                   Bible challenges us to recognize that to be a person, we must
                   show solidarity with our neighbor, who is flesh of our flesh, and
                   therefore our brother and sister.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the meaning of the fact that Jesus became "one
                   flesh" with us? In which ways did He show His solidarity with
                   men?

                      "Of Christ's relation to His people, there is a beautiful illus-
                   tration in the laws given to Israel. When through poverty a
                   Hebrew had been forced to part with his patrimony, and to sell
                   himself as a bondservant, the duty of redeeming him and his
                   inheritance fell to the one who was nearest of kin. See Lev.
                   25:25, 47-49; Ruth 2:20. So the work of redeeming us and our
                   inheritance, lost through sin, fell upon Him who is 'near of kin'
                   unto us. It was to redeem us that He became our kinsman.
                   Closer than father, mother, brother, friend, or lover is the Lord
                   our Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, page 327.

         Part 3       "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the
   A TEMPLE OF     Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye
                   are not your own? . . . Therefore glorify God in your body,
THE HOLY SPIRIT    and in your spirit, which are God's." 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

                       The New Testament basically reflects the same view con-
                   cerning the human body as the Old Testament and therefore
                   flesh has the following meanings: (1) the whole person in his
                   physical existence (Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16; 1 Cor. 1:29), so that
                   the word "flesh" is interchangeable with the personal pronouns
                   "I," "me," "you," et cetera. Rom. 7:18; Eph. 5:28; 2 Cor. 7:5.
                   (2) man as a creature, in contrast with God (2 Cor. 1:17; 10:2;
                   Eph. 6:10-12); he is mortal. 1 Cor. 15:50-53; 2 Cor. 4:11. (3) man
                   in his fellowship with other human beings. Rom. 4:1; 9:3-5.
                       The Bible calls the human, fleshly body a temple for God's
                   glory. But flesh without God's Spirit produces sin. Flesh can
                   be used for good or evil.
                     What does the New Testament tell us concerning Jesus'
                   body? Gal. 4:4; John 20:25, 27; Luke 24:39.

                      In Matthew 4:2 we read of Jesus' hunger in the wilderness,
                   and in John 19:28 of His thirst at the cross. According to
                   Matthew 8:24 Jesus slept in the ship. Matthew 11:19 says that
                   He ate and He drank, and Luke 24:41-43 mentions that He
                   did this even after His resurrection. The testimony is clear:
                   Jesus was a real human being. He existed in the same kind
                   of human body as His contemporaries. "He employed the
                   human faculties, for only by adopting these could He be com-
                   prehended by humanity. . . . He lived out the character of
                   God through the human body which God had prepared for
                   Him. He blessed the world by living out in human flesh the life
                   of God, thus showing that He had the power to unite humanity
                   to divinity."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

                   the Spirit?

                       "Wonderful in its significance is the brief record of His early
                   life: 'The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
                   wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.' . . . His mind
                   was active and penetrating, with a thoughtfulness and wisdom
                   beyond His years. Yet His character was beautiful in its sym-

        Part 4        "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground,
      A LIVING     and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
                   became a living soul." Gen. 2:7.
     CREATURE
                      What is the meaning of "breath of life"? Gen. 7:22; Ps.
                   104:29; 150:6; Isa. 2:22; Acts 17:25.

                      The Hebrew word most commonly used for "breath" is
                   ruach. It is the indication of life in man and also refers to the
                   power of God in nature, in the animal world, and in man. He
                   moves and sits and thinks and feels and laughs because God
                   gives him the power, the ruach, to do so.
                      It is often the case with Biblical terms that they defy our
                   classifications. Not only do they have more than one mean-
                   ing, these words can often be used interchangeably with other
                   terms. For instance, ruach means breath, wind, spirit, power,
                   temper, mood, disposition, anger, courage, sadness, attitude,
                   et cetera. See Joshua 5:1 and Judges 8:3.

                      Who is the owner of man's spirit? Num. 16:22; Job 34:14,
                   15; Eccl. 12:7.

                      The Bible emphasizes that our heartbeat and our thinking,
                   our love and our courage, are gifts of God. He is the owner
                   of our spirit that moves us and makes us the living creatures
                   we are. But there is one other aspect of ruach that needs spe-
                   cial attention. It is through this spirit that God communicates
                   with us and empowers us to live up to our calling as the image
                   of God. This is clearly demonstrated in Ezekiel 36:26-28, RSV.
                   "A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within
                   you; .. . and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful
                   to observe my ordinances. You shall dwell in the land which
                   I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will
                   be your God." See also Ezek. 37:14; Ps. 51:12, 13. It is this
                   spirit of a man that gives him understanding (Job 32:8), and
                   that helps him to become acquainted with God's will for him.
                   Prov. 1:23.

     STRONG IN     in spirit." Luke 1:80.
        SPIRIT         The New Testament confirms and elaborates on the teach-
                   ings of the Old Testament concerning man's spirit. The Greek
                    word pneuma, as it applies to man, is equivalent to the Hebrew
                   ruach and means: (1) breath of life (Matt. 27:50; Luke 8:55;
                   Acts 7:59; James 2:26); (2) disposition, attitude, mood, seat
                    of emotions, seat of knowledge, et cetera, such as in Mark 2:8;
                   John 13:21; 1 Peter 3:4; (3) the instrument by which man com-
                   municates with God. Luke 1:47, 80; Acts 18:24, 25. This third
                   meaning is especially strongly developed in the writings of the
                   apostle Paul. Rom. 1:9; 8:16; 1 Cor. 14:2, 14-16. This is a meet-
                   ing of man's spirit and God's Spirit.
                     What was the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of Jesus?
                   Matt. 4:1; Luke 2:27; 10:21; John 1:32, 33.
                      What does Jesus actually mean by being born of the
                   Spirit? John 3:5-8. See also John 1:33.
                       Spirit stands for life in the fullest sense. It is only when a
                   man receives God's spirit, His breath of life, that he becomes
                   a living being. No man, however, is to live for himself, but for
                   the glory of God and to serve his fellowmen. The power to do
                   so comes from God through the Holy Spirit. Man is then a new
                   creation, having not only a spirit but the Spirit, as exemplified
                   in the life of Christ.
                      What relationship is there between man's spirit and the
                   Spirit of Christ? Rom. 8:1-17.
THINK IT THROUGH      Is it possible for me to have the mind of Christ? See
                   Phil. 2:5.
                      "To pray in Christ's name means much. It means that we
                   are to accept His character, manifest His spirit, and work His
                   works....
                      "If we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts
                   and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to
                   His will, that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out
                   our own impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its
                   highest delight in doing His service. . . .
                      "Those who decide to do nothing in any line that will dis-
                   please God, will know, after presenting their case before Him,
                   just what course to pursue. And they will receive not only
                   wisdom, but strength. Power for obedience, for service, will
                   be imparted to them, as Christ has promised. Whatever was
                   given to Christ . . . was given to Him as the head and repre-
                   sentative of humanity."—The Desire of Ages, page 668.

The Body and God's Image LESSON 3                                       111 Friday
                                                                          April 18

         Part 6       "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." 2 Cor.
      FREEDOM      3:17, RSV.

                      When God created man in His own image, He made them
                   free human beings. Unlike the animals, who are guided by
                   their instinct, man could make his own choices and decisions.
                   Freedom is an indispensable aspect of man as the image of
                   God. For without freedom man cannot really choose, or love,
                   or respond.
                      In what way was Adam's freedom realized? Gen. 2:17.
                       "God placed man under law, as an indispensable condition
                   of his very existence. He was a subject of the divine govern-
                   ment, and there can be no government without law. God might
                   have created man without the power to transgress His law; He
                   might have withheld the hand of Adam from touching the for-
                   bidden fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a free
                   moral agent, but a mere automaton. Without freedom of choice,
                   his obedience would not have been voluntary, but forced.
                   There could have been no development of character."—Pa-
                   triarchs and Prophets, page 49.
                      What choice did Isaiah prophesy that Immanuel would be
                   prepared to make? Isa. 7:14, 15.
                       The decision that would confront Immanuel was the same
                   decision that Adam met before him. Adam was created free
                   from any bias toward evil, or desire to know it. The choice
                   Adam had to make was to affirm freely that God was his
                   Creator, and he God's creature. The purpose for which man
                   was created was to glorify God. God wanted Adam to do so
                   voluntarily. The presence of the tree of knowledge of good and
                   evil was a challenge to Adam to respond to God's love. But
                   it also opened the possibility not to do so. Freedom, therefore,
                   is not a goal in itself. Freedom is a means by which man can
                   fulfill his original calling and destiny: to serve God and to love
                   his neighbor.
                      In what way is our freedom today best fulfilled? Gal.
                   5:1, 13.
THINK IT THROUGH      How do I use my freedom daily?
                      "The youth have an inborn love of liberty; they desire free-
                   dom; and they need to understand that these inestimable bless-
                   ings are to be enjoyed only in obedience to the law of God.
                   This law is the preserver of true freedom and liberty. . . .

                   precepts.' . . . Psalm 119:45."—Education, page 291.

"In the gift of His son for our redemption, God has
shown how high a value He places upon every human
soul, and He gives to no man liberty to speak con-
temptuously of another. We shall see faults and
weaknesses in those about us, but God claims every
soul as His property—His by creation, and doubly His
as purchased by the precious blood of Christ. All were
created in His image, and even the most degraded
are to be treated with respect and tenderness. God
will hold us accountable for even a word spoken in
contempt of one soul for whom Christ laid down His
life."—"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages

   "And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many
years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou
fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those
things be, which thou host provided?" Luke 12:19, 20.
    For centuries the Christian view of man has been strongly influenced by the
writings of the Greek philosopher Pla10. He suggested that man consists of two
parts: an immortal soul and a corrupt, mortal body. These two he saw as totally
different: the one eternal and good, the other evil, weak, and temporary. During
life on earth, claimed Plato, the soul has to reside in the body, as in a prison
from which it is liberated at death. He spoke of the body as "a source of endless
trouble" and believed that pure knowledge of anything could be had only when
the soul was released from the body.
    In the Bible the body is called "a temple of the Holy Spirit." 1 Cor. 6:19, RSV.
It was created by God and does not encase a soul, but is itself the soul. Could
there be any greater contrast between the concept of the body as a prison of
the soul and the Biblical view of the body as a temple of God?
    The way one views the body and the soul will determine how he looks at
death and consequently at spiritualism, at the importance of caring for the body
during life, and at the method and results of salvation by faith.
    In this week's lesson we shall study the Biblical view of the soul and the
body.

                                                                            April 20


        Part 1    "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground,
  A LIVING SOUL and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
               became a living soul." Gen. 2:7.

                       The Hebrew word nephesh is here translated "soul." It is
                   a key word for understanding the Biblical view of man. But
                   nephesh has no less than 42 different meanings. It means the
                   life of animals as well as of men; and it means animals as well
                   as persons. Over against the Greek notion that man has a
                   soul, the Old Testament assures us that man is a soul. Nephesh
                   means the whole person, not just a part of a person, as in
                   Greek thought. Hence, it can even be used interchangeably
                   with the word "flesh," basar.

                     What other usages of the term "soul" are there in the Old
                   Testament? 1 Sam. 30:6; 2 Kings 4:27; Isa. 26:8.

                      Though nephesh also refers to animals and other living
                   organisms, it basically refers to living human beings. The soul
                   (nephesh) eats and drinks; it feels sadness, anger, grief, and
                   desire.
                      Nephesh is also the Hebrew term for the person who thinks,
                   who wills, and who loves. See Prov. 19:2; Song of Solomon
                   1:7; 1 Sam. 18:1. It is man's individuality and personality. We
                   also read of the soul that thirsts for God (Ps. 42:2; 63:1), yearns
                   for Him (Isa. 26:9) and lives to praise Him (Ps. 119:175).
                   Nephesh, therefore, stands for the whole person, and in many
                   cases can best be translated by "I," "me," "you," "we," or
                   "they."

                      What is the meaning of Jeremiah 6:8?

                       Soul (nephesh) in the Old Testament stands for life and
                   living organisms, for the person as a whole as well as for his
                   desires and emotions, feelings and appetites, religious long-
                   ings as well as anger, bitterness and frustration. The soul
                   thinks, wills, loves, and understands. The soul being the whole
                   man, can also die. The word can even be used for a corpse
                   (body), as in Num. 19:13 and Haggai 2:13. Rather than being
                   the opposite of flesh, soul includes the flesh.

THINK IT THROUGH     Compare the Greek view of man with that of the Old Testa-
                   ment.

        Part 2       "For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,
 SOUL AND LIFE     but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
                   Mark 10:45.
                     Compare Matt. 20:28.
                      The word here translated "life" is the Greek psuche. This
                   word is more often translated "soul." As it is used in the New
                   Testament it has the same meanings as the Hebrew word
                   nephesh in the Old Testament. It stands for any living organism
                   (Rev. 16:3), for life itself as in Luke 12:22, 23, for the whole
                   person, and for personality as in Romans 13:1, the inward
                   man, his desires, emotions, mind, feelings, as in Mark 14:34.
                   But even if psuche refers to a particular aspect of man, it never
                   denotes a separable, intelligent part of man, as in Greek
                   philosophy. Psuche can often be translated by a personal pro-
                   noun such as "I," "myself," "you," "your life."

                       Study the meaning of "soul" in the parable of the rich
                   fool in Luke 12:16-23. Use a modern translation and compare
                   it with the KJV.

                       In the Revised Standard Version the parable is translated as
                   follows: "The land of a rich man brought forth plentifully; and
                   he thought to himself, 'What shall I do? . . . I will do this: I
                   will pull down my barns, and build larger ones; and there I
                   will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul
                   [psuche], Soul [psuche], you have ample goods laid up for
                   many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.' But God
                   said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul [psuche] is required of
                   you.'
                       "And he said to his disciples, 'Therefore I tell you do not
                   be anxious about your life [psuche], what you shall eat, nor
                   about your body, what you shall put on. For life [psuche] is
                   more than food, and the body more than clothing.' "

                     What is the meaning of "soul" in the following texts?
                   James 5:20; 1 Peter 1:9; 4:19; Rev. 6:9 and 20:4.

                      It can be concluded that in the Bible the word "soul" means
                   the whole person, either alive or dead. As we have seen, the
                   Hebrews used the word nephesh, soul, also for "corpse."
                      The idea that "soul" can have a separate existence apart
                   from the body, or that it possesses an immortal essence, is
                   foreign to the Bible.

                                                                         April 22

         Part 3       "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able
 SOUL AND BODY     to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
                   both soul and body in hell." Matt. 10:28.

                       In the Bible usage of "body" and "soul" each means the
                   whole person. One is not superior to the other. In Hebrew
                   thought man is soul and man is body. When a man dies, the
                   Bible says that the soul has died, or the man died.
                       However, "soul" in both the Old and New Testaments often
                   refers in particular to a person's relationship to God, whereas
                   "flesh" emphasizes man as a creature, in contrast to God, who
                   is the Creator and the Life-giver. It is in this meaning that
                   Jesus' contemporaries understood His words. Don't fear those
                   who can harm you in your bodily existence, rob you of your
                   goods, or even kill you. That means nothing. For even death
                   cannot separate you from God. But you ought to fear God, on
                   whom your whole life depends. To be separated from Him—
                   that is, "losing your soul"—is the worst that can happen.
                   Therefore, watch out that you keep your soul—that is, your
                   relationship with God.

                      Interpret 1 Thessalonians 5:23.

                       The apostle Paul did not teach that man is composed of
                   three parts—body, soul, and spirit, but he spoke of three dif-
                   ferent ways in which a person relates to other persons. In the
                   Bible man is one indivisible whole. Terms such as "soul" or
                   "body" or "spirit" are not used to indicate separate parts of
                   a man. Each term refers to the whole man in a particular func-
                   tion. The soul emphasizes in particular man in his relationship
                   to God; the spirit refers to man understanding and communi-
                   cating with God, while the body denotes his relationship with
                   human beings as well as his whole earthly existence. To indi-
                   cate how thoroughly the God of peace sanctifies our lives, the
                   apostle Paul emphasizes, in good Hebrew fashion, that sanc-
                   tification should affect every aspect of life: not just our rela-
                   tionship to God (soul), but also our whole thinking, will, and
                   innermost feelings, (spirit), and our work and our relationships
                   with our fellowmen (body). Sanctification affects our whole
                   person and our whole life.

The Soul and God's Image           LESSON 4                       ❑   Wednesday
                                                                        April 23

        Part 4     "And so it is written, The first Adam was made a living
     SOUL AND soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. . . . The
               first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord
        SPIRIT from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are
                   earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are
                   heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy,
                   we shall also bear the image of the heavenly." 1 Cor.
                   15:45-49.

                      What is the meaning of the words "soul" and "spirit"
                   here? How do they relate to each other?

                       Adam was the first man created by God, and all men are
                   descended from him. The record indicates that Adam was made
                   from the dust of the ground (earthy), which may still be re-
                   flected in his name (possibly related to adamah—Hebrew for
                   "earth" or "ground"), though the origin of the name is not quite
                   clear yet. Paul referred to Genesis 2:7 when he wrote, "And
                   so it is written." The central statement of the Biblical view
                   of man is that Adam was made a "living soul." This "soul"
                   had no existence in itself but depended wholly on the life-
                   giving Spirit of God. In 1 Cor. 15:44 the word psuchikos (from
                   the word psuche) is used to describe the "natural body"—that
                   is, man in his earthly existence. Adam contrasts with Christ,
                   who is called "a life-giving Spirit." The first one had no life
                   in himself, whereas Christ is the life. From Him all life takes
                   its origin. The word "soul" here refers to the individual, the
                   whole person, in his earthly existence. Spirit is that life-giving
                   power that makes man a "living soul." All men receive their
                   earthly existence—as body, as soul, as person—through Adam.
                   At the resurrection, man will receive a new existence directly
                   from Christ.

                      What is the meaning of "the image of the heavenly" in
                   1 Cor. 15:49? See Phil. 3:20, 21.

                      Read and interpret John 4:23, 24.

                      The Spirit is the inexhaustible power of divine life from
                   which all life takes its origin. Through that Spirit all men live
                   and breathe and have their existence. Acts 17:25. Contrary to
                   a popular use of the term "spirit," in the Scriptures a spirit
                   is a person; he has a form and a bodily existence.

The Soul and God's Image LESSON 4                                     ❑   Thursday
                                                                           April 24


         Part 5       "And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ,
                   the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto
     FLESH AND
                   him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood
         BLOOD     hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
                   heaven." Matt. 16:16, 17.
                       The term "flesh and blood" does not occur in the Old Testa-
                   ment. Yet its meaning lies anchored in the Hebrew concept of
                   flesh (basar) and not in the Greek view of flesh as being cor-
                   rupt, evil, and inferior to the soul or the spirit.
                      What is the meaning of "flesh and blood" in such New Tes-
                   tament passages as Matt. 16:17; Gal. 1:16; Eph. 6:12?
                       The Hebrew word for flesh (basar) means man as a creature.
                   He is mortal and weak. For his knowledge, his strength, and
                   his whole life he depends upon God, his Maker. "If he [God]
                   should take back his spirit to himself, and gather to himself
                   his breath, all flesh would perish together, and man would
                   return to dust." Job 34:14, 15, RSV. "All flesh is grass, and
                   all its beauty is like the flower of the field." Isa. 40:6, RSV.
                   Man has no way by himself to know about such things as the
                   origin of evil or that Jesus is the Son of God or what is best
                   in his life. It is foolishness to trust, therefore, on the judgment
                   of man, no matter how good he is, or to build on the strength
                   of mortal beings. Our only true source of knowledge is God;
                   it is not found in ordinary man—that is, unaided by the Spirit
                   of God.
                      What is the meaning of Leviticus 17:11?
                      "Seven times in the books of Moses the prohibition against
                   eating blood is repeated (Gen. 9:4; Lev. 3:17; 7:26, 27; 17:10;
                   Deut. 12:16, 23, 24; 15:23). The reason given is that blood
                   represents life; in fact, the blood is the life."—SDA Bible
                   Commentary, on Lev. 17:11.
                      The word translated "life" in some of these texts is nephesh,
                   the word often translated as "soul" in the Old Testament.
                       Compare the prohibition to eat the "blood with the flesh"
                   in the Old Testament with Jesus' words in John 6:53, 54.

                     Jesus' words must indeed have been hard to understand, if
                   not outright repulsive, to the Jews of His day. And even to the
                   non-Jews. What is the real meaning of the Lord's Supper?

THINK IT THROUGH      How do I know that Jesus is the Son of God, if this knowl-
                   edge has not come to me by "flesh and blood"—that is, from
                   other human beings?

                    "Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of
                 thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet."
                     "0 Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the
                 earth!" Ps. 8:4, 6, 9.
                     What is man? The Bible speaks of him as the image of God.
                 From the study of the Person of Christ (Lesson 2) and by com-
                 paring scripture with scripture on the meaning of the image of
                 God (Lesson 1), it was found that the image of God stands for
                 these basic concepts:
                     1. Man as a creature. He is totally dependent upon God. He
                 lives and moves and thinks and acts only because God shares
                 with him His life. Without God's power, man does not exist; he
                 can do nothing. Looking at man, therefore, reminds us of his
                 Maker.
                     2. Man as a social being. His life's fulfillment lies in his
                 togetherness and solidarity with other people. The most inti-
                 mate relationship between people is the marriage relationship.
                 But the image of God in man is realized wherever he lives for
                 others. Jesus was never married. Yet in Him, whose life was
                 characterized by serving others, even unto death, the perfect
                 image of God is revealed.
                     3. Man as ruler of the earth, called to have dominion over
                 God's creation. Unlike the animal world, man is a cultural be-
                 ing. He builds, he invents, he creates his own environment and
                 makes his own life-style. In these creative activities, as builder,
                 inventor, and maker, man resembles the Creator, in whose
                 image he is made.
                     Soul, body and spirit. It is clear that in the Scriptures the
                  term "image of God" refers not only to what man has, but also
                  to what he is; not only to his abilities or his attributes, but also
                  to his actions, his character, habitual responses, and relation-
                  ships. In order for man to communicate with God, respond to
                 His love, relate to other people, and exert dominion over the
                 earth, God has given man instruments, talents, or tools to do
                  so. Our faith comes through hearing (Rom. 10:14), and with
                  our tongues we sing the praises of our Lord and Father (James
                  3:7-9). Soul, body, and spirit are such instruments. By these
                  man realizes and fulfills his calling and destiny as the image
                  of God. In the Scriptures the essence of man lies in his three-
                  fold relationship: (1) to God, (2) to his fellowmen, and (3) to
                  the created world—not in three parts of man. What really
                  counts is what we do with our bodies, how we use our hands,
                  our intellect, and our speech—in short, whether we offer our-
                  selves as a living sacrifice, dedicated and fit for God's service,
                  and worship Him.
                                                                                   37

         Part 1       Read Revelation 12:7-9.
      A WAR IN        For man, born in iniquity and conceived in sin (Ps. 51:5) it
       HEAVEN      is difficult to imagine that at one time there was no evil in the
                   universe, no disruption of any kind, no destruction, no war, no
                   violence, no crime, and no sorrow. Yet the Bible says so.
                     What was the original state of man and the universe?
                   Gen. 1:31 through 2:9.
                      "Before the entrance of evil there was peace and joy
                   throughout the universe. All was in perfect harmony with the
                   Creator's will. Love for God was supreme, love for one another
                   impartial."—The Great Controversy, page 493.
                      Was Satan created by God? Since God is the Creator of
                   everything, it has been suggested that God is also the origina-
                   tor of evil. This is an absurdity. Evil is not something that was
                   made or created. Evil is negative. It was not created by God
                   or willed by Him. Sin is a wrong attitude, a rejection of good,
                   a distortion of the relation between a creature and his Creator.
                      Through the symbolism of the king of Babylon and the
                   prince of Tyre, what do the following references say about
                   Satan's identity before he rebelled against God? Isa. 14:12;
                   Ezek. 28:12-15.
                      "There was no note of discord to mar the celestial har-
                   monies. But a change came over this happy state. There was
                   one who perverted the freedom that God had granted to His
                   creatures. Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had
                   been most honored of God and was highest in power and glory
                   among the inhabitants of heaven."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   page 35.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is sin ever reasonable?
                       "It is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a
                   reason for its existence. Yet enough may be understood con-
                   cerning both the origin and the final disposition of sin to make
                   fully manifest the justice and benevolence of God in His deal-
                   ings with evil. Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than
                   that God was in no wise responsible for the entrance of sin;
                   that there was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no defi-
                   ciency in the divine government, that gave occasion for the
                   uprising of rebellion. Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no
                   reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to ex-
                   cuse it is to defend it. Could excuse for it be found, or cause
                   be shown for its existence, it would cease to be sin."—The

Sin's Beginnings LESSON 5                                            ❑ Monday
                                                                       April 28

        Part 2    What attitude was it that brought sin into the universe?
    THE SIN OF Isa. 14:13, 14; Ezek. 28:16, 17.
        PRIDE     The Scripture says, "A man's pride will bring him low, but
                   he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor." Prov. 29:33, RSV.
                   Together with pride, the Bible mentions envy, unholy ambition,
                   jealousy and covetousness as sources of sin. These are all
                   aspects of the one negative attitude that brought ruin to the
                   universe.

                      Against which person of the Godhead in particular did
                   Lucifer rebel? Rev. 12:7-9.

                      "Coveting the honor which the infinite Father had bestowed
                   upon His Son, this prince of angels aspired to power which it
                   was the prerogative of Christ alone to wield."—The Great Con-
                   troversy, page 494.
                      "To dispute the supremacy of the Son of God, thus impeach-
                   ing the wisdom and love of the Creator, had become the pur-
                   pose of this prince of angels. To this object he was about to
                    bend the energies of that master mind, which, next to Christ's,
                    was first among the hosts of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   page 36.

                      How did Lucifer's attitude affect other angels? 2 Peter
                   2:4; Jude 6; Rev. 12:4, 7, 8.

                      "Leaving his place in the immediate presence of the Father,
                   Lucifer went forth to diffuse the spirit of discontent among
                   the angels. He worked with mysterious secrecy, and for a
                   time concealed his real purpose under an appearance of rever-
                   ence for God. He began to insinuate doubts concerning the
                   laws that governed heavenly beings, intimating that though
                   laws might be necessary for the inhabitants of the worlds,
                   angels, being more exalted, needed no such restraint, for their
                   own wisdom was a sufficient guide. .
                      "The spirit of dissatisfaction thus kindled was doing its
                   baleful work."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 37, 38.

THINK IT THROUGH      Has pride also led me astray? How can I identify and
                   overcome it?

                      "Pride in his own glory nourished the desire for supremacy.
                   The high honors conferred upon Lucifer were not appreciated
                   as the gift of God and called forth no gratitude to the Creator.
                   He gloried in his brightness and exaltation, and aspired to be
                   equal with God."—The Great Controversy, page 495.

Sin's Beginnings LESSON 5                                                Tuesday
                                                                         April 29

          Part 3      From God's attitude toward sinful men, what can we con-
 SIN AND GRACE     clude was His attitude toward fallen Lucifer?
                      "Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no
                   pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
                   from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
                   for why will ye die?" Ezek. 33:11.
                      "In great mercy, according to His divine character, God
                   bore long with Lucifer....
                      "A compassionate Creator, in yearning pity for Lucifer and
                   his followers, was seeking to draw them back from the abyss
                   of ruin into which they were about to plunge. But His mercy
                   was misinterpreted. Lucifer pointed to the long-suffering of God
                   as an evidence of his own superiority. . . . Thus it was that
                   Lucifer, 'the light bearer,' the sharer of God's glory, the at-
                   tendant of His throne, by transgression became Satan, 'the
                   adversary' of God and holy beings and the destroyer of those
                   whom Heaven had committed to his guidance and guardian-
                   ship."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 39, 40.
                     Can God's grace be rejected? Isa. 30:12, 13; Luke 10:16;
                   Heb. 12:25.
                      God's grace can be resisted. It need not be effective. God
                   seeks to bring men into a relation of love and obedience with
                   Himself. Both of these presuppose the freedom to accept or
                   to reject God's love and authority.
                      What happened to Satan when he continued to reject the
                   grace of God? Isa. 14:12; Ezek. 28:16, 17; Luke 10:18.
                      "God could employ only such means as were consistent with
                   truth and righteousness. Satan could use what God could not
                   —flattery and deceit. He had sought to falsify the word of God
                   and had misrepresented His plan of government, claiming that
                   God was not just in imposing laws upon the angels; that in
                   requiring submission and obedience from His creatures, He
                   was seeking merely the exaltation of Himself. It was therefore
                   necessary to demonstrate before the inhabitants of heaven, and
                   of all the worlds, that God's government is just, His law per-
                   fect."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 42.
THINK IT THROUGH      Do I stand in danger of rejecting the grace of God?
                      "We urge this appeal upon you: you have received the grace
                   of God; do not let it go for nothing. God's own words are:
                            'In the hour of my favour I gave heed to you;
                            on the day of deliverance I came to your aid.'
                   The hour of favour has now come; now, I say, has the day
                   of deliverance dawned." 2 Cor. 6:1, 2, NEB.

Sin's Beginnings LESSON 5                                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     April 30

         Part 4       Why did God not destroy Satan, thereby preventing him from
       SIN AND     bringing ruin to the whole world? From Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   pages 41-43, four reasons may be gleaned:
       JUSTICE
                       1. If God had destroyed the devil immediately, millions of
                   angels—and inhabitants of other worlds in the universe—would
                   never have known for sure whether or not the charges Satan
                   advanced against God had an element of truth in them. The
                   destruction of Satan might even have left the impression that
                   some of the charges—especially that God's law was unjust—
                   were true. It became necessary, therefore, for God to demon-
                   strate before the inhabitants of heaven and of all the worlds
                   that His government is just, His law perfect, and the principles
                   of love and obedience correct.
                      2. Satan blamed God for the discord that he himself had
                   caused in heaven. All evil he declared to be the result of the
                   divine administration. He claimed that it was his own object to
                   improve upon the statutes of Jehovah. Therefore, God permit-
                   ted him to demonstrate the nature of his claims an6,;13: show
                   the working out of his proposed changes in the divine law. His
                   own work must condemn him. Satan had to be unmasked so
                   that the whole universe could see that he was a deceiver, a
                   rebel, a liar, and a murderer.
                       3. If God had destroyed Satan immediately, many creatures,
                   not quite convinced of the justice of God, would have served
                   God from fear rather than from love. They would have honored
                   Him and obeyed Him, but not voluntarily so, not in freedom. The
                   influence of the deceiver would not have been fully destroyed,
                   and the spirit of rebellion would have remained.
                       4. Satan's rebellion was to be a perpetual lesson to the
                   universe of the nature and results of sin. The working out of
                   Satan's rule, its effects upon both men and angels, would
                   show what must be the fruit of setting aside divine authority.
                   It would testify that with the existence of God's government and
                   His law is bound up the well-being of all the creatures He has
                   made. Only in this way could God's love, righteousness, and
                   authority be vindicated before all His creatures, who would
                   delight in doing His will. Rebellion and sin would not arise a
                   second time. See Nahum 1:9.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I convinced of God's love and righteousness? How
                   does this understanding affect my life?

          Part 5      Where did Satan work havoc and ruin after he was ex-
     WOE TO THE    pelled from heaven?
         EARTH
                      "Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.
                   Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the
                   devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because
                   he knoweth that he hath but a short time." Rev. 12:12.
                      Peter compares Satan to a "roaring lion" searching for food.
                   1 Peter 5:8. Vivid pictures of his work are found in Mark 5:2-13
                   and in Mark 9:17-27. He catches men in snares (2 Tim. 2:26),
                   puts evil thoughts in them (John 13:2; Acts 5:3) and blinds
                   and misguides them (2 Cor. 2:11; 4:4; 11:14).
                      Who assist the devil in his work on earth? Matt. 25:40, 41;
                   Acts 8:7; Rev. 16:14.

                      "Evil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal
                   in nature, power, and glory with the holy beings that are now
                   God's messengers. But fallen through sin, they are leagued
                   together for the dishonor of God and the destruction of men.
                   United with Satan in his rebellion, and with him cast out from
                   heaven, they have, through all succeeding ages, co-operated
                   with him in his warfare against the divine authority."—The
                   Great Controversy, page 513.
THINK IT THROUGH      Are these evil spirits real and still active today? Do I
                   recognize their work?

                       To many people, including many believers, the idea that
                   there are evil spirits at work today seems childish and un-
                   scientific. But does that prove their nonexistence? The Bible
                   consistently makes reference to them and with great force
                   warns us of them. The revival of spirit cults, Satanism, and
                   spiritism are strong evidences that there are realities for which
                   science has no answer. Trust in the Word of God is the safer
                   path.
                       Please consider this: "None are in greater danger from the
                   influence of evil spirits than those who . . . deny the existence
                   and agency of the devil and his angels. So long as we are
                   ignorant of their wiles, they have almost inconceivable ad-
                   vantage; many give heed to their suggestions while they sup-
                   pose themselves to be following the dictates of their own wis-
                   dom. This is why, as we approach the close of time, when
                   Satan is to work with greatest power to deceive and destroy,
                   he spreads everywhere the belief that he does not exist. It is
                   his policy to conceal himself and his manner of working."—

Sin's Beginnings      LESSON 5                                         ❑ Friday
                                                                         May 2


        Part 6        "He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil
   CHRIST AND      sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God
                   was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the
        SATAN      devil." 1 John 3:8.

                      Jesus has been spoken of as "our example," a model of
                   what God intended all of us to be. But that concept, though
                   clearly Biblical, could also be misunderstood and misinter-
                   preted if we did not look carefully at the other roles of Jesus,
                   such as Divine Sacrifice, as the Substitute who died for our
                   sins, and as the Mighty God who has gained the victory over
                   the devil and his host.

                      What has been, and will be, the result to Satan of his
                   defeat by Jesus? John 12:31; Rev. 20:10. See also Gen. 3:15.

                      Some religions conceive of good and evil as two equal
                   powers. The Christian faith teaches that the devil has no power
                   of himself. God created him, and he has been under the control
                   of God from the beginning. The Christian faith and its mission
                   is based on the triumph of Christ over Satan. In this triumph
                   man may participate. It is this message that gives man hope
                   and courage, certainty and strength.
                      How was Christ's power over Satan manifested during His
                   earthly ministry? Matt. 8:16; Mark 1:34; Luke 11:15-20.

                      What assurance of triumph over the devil is given to every
                   child of God? Matt. 28:18-20; Eph. 6:11; 1 John 5:18.

                       "Be submissive then to God. Stand up to the devil and he
                   will turn and run." James 4:7, NEB. A beautiful image of Christ's
                   victorious work for His children in resisting and triumphing over
                   the devil is found also in Zechariah 3:1, 2, RSV: "Then he
                   showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel
                   of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse
                   him. And the Lord said to Satan, 'The Lord rebuke you, 0
                   Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is
                   not this a brand plucked from the fire?' "

THINK IT THROUGH      What effect on me and on my life has the victory of Christ
                   over Satan?
                      "Satan is well aware that the weakest soul who abides in
                   Christ is more than a match for the hosts of darkness, and
                   that, should he reveal himself openly, he would be met and
                   resisted."—The Great Controversy, page 530.

    "More clearly than we do we need to understand
the issues at stake in the great conflict in which we
are engaged. We need to understand more fully the
value of the truths of the word of God and the danger
of allowing our minds to be diverted from them by the
great deceiver.
    "The infinite value of the sacrifice required for our
redemption reveals the fact that sin is a tremendous
evil. Through sin the whole human organism is de-
ranged, the mind is perverted, the imagination cor-
rupted. Sin has degraded the faculties of the soul.
Temptations from without find an answering chord
within the heart, and the feet turn imperceptibly toward
evil.

restoration from the defilement of sin is to be corn-

                                                                            May 4-10




       "Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever commit-
    teth sin is the servant of sin." John 8:34.
         "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23.

        Sin is tyrannical. It works destructively, and it spares no one. The whole
    world and all of life experience its evil effects. It is a power that permeates our
    thinking and our actions; it affects our relationships and our inmost feelings.
    The results of sin abound everywhere. We are touching here on the cause of
    crime and corruption, of aggression and anxiety, of fear and frustration, of sen-
    suality and selfishness. Philosophies abound that seek the cause of this dis-
    ruptive and destructive power in material things, such as property or wealth.
    Some blame man's faulty thinking and lack of education, while others hold
    law and regulations responsible for the havoc and ruin caused by this power.
    All kinds of solutions have been suggested and tried to make an end to this
    tyrannical power: giving wealth and power to the people; rigid mental training;
    education; scientific and cultural discipline; transcendental meditation, et cetera.
    But all the attempts have ended in the desperate cry, "0 wretched man that
    I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" See Rom. 7:14-25.
        The weaknesses of man in spite of his power and greatness, his irrational
•    behavior in spite of his education, his irresponsible conduct in spite of his high
     calling, have boggled all thinking people everywhere. In the most pressing form
     these questions defy logical answers: What is man? What makes him act and
     think and behave the way he does? Science has no answer to these questions
     and neither has philosophy. Even the religious and ethical systems of man offer
     us no clue. It is in God's revelation only that man finds this knowledge about
     himself. There, and there alone, do we find answers to the baffling paradox of
     man's greatness and misery, of man's power and powerlessness. The two key
     ideas here are: man, the image of God; and man, the sinner.

                                                                           May 4

         Part 1        "It was through one man that sin entered the world, and
  DISOBEDIENCE     through sin death, and thus death pervaded the whole human
                   race, inasmuch as all men have sinned. For sin was already
                   in the world before there was law, though in the absence of
                   law no reckoning is kept 'of sin. But death held sway from
                   Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned as
                   Adam did, by disobeying a direct command." Rom. 5:12-14,
                   NEB.

                     What "direct command" had God given to Adam, and
                   why? Gen. 2:16, 17.

                      Sin is lack of conformity to the will (law) of God, either as
                   an attitude, a state of mind, or an act. It is disobedience to
                   God's law. Why would man become disobedient? He was made
                   in the image of God. He was God's representative with full
                   power to rule the earth. Man knew that by disobeying God he
                   would lose it all, for God had made that abundantly clear to
                   him.
                      What prompted Adam to disobey God? Gen. 3:1-6.

                      Although Satan was the instigator and will bear his part in
                   the sin he caused Adam to commit, the man himself was re-
                   sponsible for his disobedience. He was absolutely free to
                   choose to obey or to disobey God.

                      What is the meaning of disobeying God's law? Rom. 2:23.

                       "The law of God is as sacred as God Himself. It is a revela-
                   tion of His will, a transcript of His character, the expression
                   of divine love and wisdom. The harmony of creation depends
                   upon the perfect conformity of all beings, of everything, ani-
                   mate and inanimate, to the law of the Creator. God has or-
                   dained laws for the government, not only of living beings, but
                   of all the operations of nature. Everything is under fixed laws,
                   which cannot be disregarded. But while everything in nature
                   is governed by natural laws, man alone, of all that inhabits the
                   earth, is amenable to moral law. To man, the crowning work
                   of creation, God has given power to understand His require-
                   ments, to comprehend the justice and beneficence of His law,
                   and its sacred claims upon him; and of man unswerving obe-
                   dience is required."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 52.

Man, the Sinner LESSON 6                                                  Monday
                                                                           May 5

        Part 2       "And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
     UNBELIEF      shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" Gen. 3:1.

                      Disobedience began when our first parents no longer fully
                   trusted in the word of God. And sin arises everywhere, and
                   always, out of unbelief. It is the root of sin. See John 16:9.
                      What does the apostle Paul state is the relationship be-
                   tween sin and unbelief? Rom. 14:23.

                     The story of Adam's falling into sin is a repetition of the
                   beginnings of evil in heaven. Unbelief, then defiance of God's
                   word, and then attitudes of pride and jealousy, envy and selfish-
                   ness.
                      What is the means of salvation from sin? John 3:14-16;
                   Acts 16:31.

                      The relationship between unbelief and misery appears on
                   almost every page of the Scripture. Adam and Eve lost their
                   exalted status because of it. The people of God could not enter
                   the Promised Land because of their unbelief. Heb. 3:19. It is
                   when man gives up his full trust in God and in His word that
                   wars, aggression, crime, and corruption arise. On the other
                   hand, man's greatness, happiness, and salvation are restored
                   when he trusts God and believes His word. Let our prayer
                   therefore be, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief." Mark
                   9:24. Yes, Lord, increase our faith.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the basis of our trust in God?

                       "Eve . . . disbelieved the words of God, and this was what
                   led to her fall. In the judgment men will not be condemned
                   because they conscientiously believed a lie, but because they
                   did not believe the truth, because they neglected the oppor-
                   tunity of learning what is truth. Notwithstanding the sophistry
                   of Satan to the contrary, it is always disastrous to disobey
                   God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 55.
                       "It was distrust of God's goodness, disbelief of His word,
                   and rejection of His authority, that made our first parents trans-
                   gressors, and that brought into the world a knowledge of evil.
                   It was this that opened the door to every species of falsehood
                   and error.
                       "Man lost all because he chose to listen to the deceiver
                    rather than to Him who is Truth, who alone has understand-
                   ing."—Education, page 25.

                                                                         May 6

           Part 3      "The serpent said to the woman, 'You will not die. For God
     TO BE EQUAL    knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and
                    you will be like God, knowing good and evil.' So when the
        WITH GOD    woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
                    a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desired to make
                    one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate; and she also
                    gave some to her husband, and he ate." Gen. 3:4-6, RSV.
                        The very essence of the nature of sin is the desire to be
                    independent from God. But man has no life in himself, yet the
                    "pot" revolted against his "potter" and wanted to be like Him
                    and independent of Him. He did not realize that he would thus
                    lose the very ground of his existence, even though God had
                    told him so. See Genesis 2:17.
                        The whole story of Adam's sin looks so foolish, so unrea-
                    sonable. And that is precisely what sin is. There is no reason
                    for it. The Bible speaks of "the mystery of lawlessness." See
                    2 Thess. 2:7, RSV. By dishonoring God, man lost his own self.
                    By wanting to be like God, man became nothing.
                       What terms does the Bible use to describe sin? 1 Sam.
                    12:14; Isa. 1:4; Jer. 11:8-10; Mal. 1:6.
                    What, in essence, is sin? Sin is a denial of God. It is exalt-
                 ing oneself above God (see Isa. 14:12-14), with the inevitable
                 result of a deep, deep fall. This is what the church, throughout
                 the ages, has meant by "the Fall," a term disliked by many
                 modern Christians, but a reality that is continuously experienced
                 by all men.
                    No matter what name one may give it—iniquity, rebellion,
                 transgression, or lawlessness—sin is, in essence, a failure to
                 recognize God as our Maker, that we live and exist only in
                 Him. It is a selfish attitude, since we do not glorify God, but
                 ourselves. It begins when we fail to take God at His word
                 (unbelief) and it leads to pride and covetousness, which are
                 the roots of all evil.
THINK IT THROUGH    How can I overcome the temptations I have to sin?
                       "In what consisted the strength of the assault made upon
                    Adam, which caused his fall? It was no indwelling sin; for God
                    made Adam after His own character, pure and upright. There
                    were no corrupt principles in the first Adam, no corrupt pro-
                    pensities or tendencies to evil. Adam was as faultless as the
                    angels before God's throne. These things are unexplainable,
                    but many things which now we cannot understand will be made
                    plain when we shall see as we are seen, and know as we are
                    known."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

Man, the Sinner LESSON 6                                        ❑   Wednesday
                                                                        May 7

        Part 4        "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall
  SELFISHNESS    not come, except there come a falling away first, and that
                 man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth
                 and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is
                 worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,
                 shewing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.
                     The leader of apostasy, the "man of sin," described by Paul,
                 is the embodiment of the principles that are at the root of sin
                 in every human being. He exalts himself above God; he acts
                 as if he were God. Disobedience, unbelief, and the unholy am-
                 bition to be equal with God find their center in selfishness. Sin
                 is a rejection of God, His love and His law; it is essentially a
                 preference of self over and against God. Instead of making
                 God the center of his life, the sinner makes himself the center;
                 instead of giving glory to God and worshipping Him, the sinner
                 glories in himself and seeks his own interests.
                      Compare the sin of Lucifer with that of Adam and Eve.
                 Whom had they made the center of their life and ambition?
                 Isa. 14:13, 14; Gen. 3:1-7.
                      "Adam understood that his companion had transgressed the
                 command of God, disregarded the only prohibition laid upon
                  them as a test of their fidelity and love. There was a terrible
                  struggle in his mind. He mourned that he had permitted Eve to
                  wander from his side. But now the deed was done; he must be
                  separated from her whose society had been his joy. How could
                  he have it thus? . . . Love, gratitude, loyalty to the Creator—
                  s!l were overborne by love to Eve. She was a part of himself,
                  and he could not endure the thought of separation. . . . He
                  resolved to share her fate; if she must die, he would die with
                  her. After all, he reasoned, might not the words of the wise
                  serpent be true? . . . He seized the fruit and quickly ate."—

                  formed with humility and wisdom. But if in your heart you are
                  jealous, bitter, and selfish, then you must not be proud and
                  tell lies against the truth. This kind of wisdom does not come
                   down from heaven; it belongs to the world, it is unspiritual and
                   demonic. Where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is also
                   disorder and every kind of evil." "As the scripture says, 'God
                   resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.' So then, sub-
                   mit yourselves to God. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from

Man, the Sinner LESSON 6                                            0 Thursday
                                                                            May 8

          Part 5      How widespread is sin in the world?
       ALL HAVE
                       "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
         SINNED    and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
                   all have sinned." Rom. 5:12.

                     "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
                   Rom. 3:23.

                       Sin is, in the words of the apostle John, transgression of
                   the law; i.e., the revealed will of God. "Where no law is, there
                   is no transgression." Rom. 4:15. Also Jesus Himself declared,
                   "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have
                   sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin." John 15:22,
                   RSV. All this raises the question:
                       Have people sinned even where the revealed will of God
                   is not known? Rom. 2:11-15.

                      "The Gentiles will not be judged by a law that they do not
                   possess. Nevertheless, if they transgress the unwritten law of
                   conscience they will be lost just as those who have sinned
                   against greater light. Paul has already explained that the sins
                   of the Gentiles are inexcusable, for they have rejected God's
                   revelation to them in nature and conscience (ch. 1:19, 20, 32).
                   The lack of greater light does not give one the right to sin
                   against lesser light. The heathen who sin will be lost, even
                   though they do not have God's written law. They have sinned
                   against the law they do possess, and punishment follows as
                   the inevitable consequence."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                   Rom. 2:12.
                      How does a person, therefore, become aware that he or
                   she is a sinner? Isa. 6:5; Luke 5:8.

                      "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbear-
                   ance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
                   leadeth thee to repentance?" Rom. 2:4.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is it necessary for men to continue to sin?

                      "Christ came to the earth, taking humanity and standing as
                   man's representative, to show in the controversy with Satan
                   that man, as God created him, connected with the Father and
                   the Son, could obey every divine requirement."—Ellen G. White

Man, the Sinner LESSON 6                                              0 Friday
                                                                           May 9

         Part 6       "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
    GRIEFS AND     sin." 2 Cor. 5:21.
     SORROWS          Read also Isa. 53:2-4.
                      What sin really is—and its effects—we learn only by contem-
                   plating the life of Jesus who had no sin in himself, but who
                   was made sin "for us."
                      From the statements about Christ, the sinless One, what
                   striking difference do you see between Him and Adam, the
                   sinful man? Phil. 2:6-8.
                      Christ was equal with God, yet He did not grasp at equality
                   with God. Adam, who was man and only an image of God, by
                   eating the forbidden fruit sought to be equal with God.
                      Christ made Himself nothing. He humbled Himself, so much
                   so that He could not do anything out of Himself. He made Him-
                   self an obedient slave. He, who is the Author of life, the Holy
                   One of Israel, humbled Himself to die as a criminal. Adam
                   wanted to live forever, and found death. Christ, who has life
                   in Himself, gave up His life so that we need not die. Is greater
                   love possible, greater unselfishness?
                      What striking contrasts are there between Adam's tempta-
                   tion and Christ's? Gen. 3:1-7; Matt. 4:1-11.

                      "The mildest test was given them [Adam and Eve] that could
                   be given; for there was no need of their eating of the forbidden
                   tree; everything that their wants required had been provided."
                   —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 1, p.
                   1083.
                      "Adam stood in his innocence in Eden. But Jesus accepted
                   humanity when the race had been weakened by four thousand
                   years of sin. Like every child of Adam He accepted the results
                   of the working of the great law of heredity."—The Desire of
                   Ages, page 49. See also page 120.
                      How did Christ overcome the temptation, thereby leaving
                   us an example? Matt. 4:4, 7, 10.

THINK IT THROUGH     Consider the griefs and the sorrows Jesus had to bear.
                   What do they tell us concerning the nature of sin?
                      "The sins of men weighed heavily upon Christ, and the sense
                   of God's wrath against sin was crushing out His life. . . .
                      "From His pale lips comes the bitter cry, '0 My Father, if it
                   be possible, let this cup pass from Me.' Yet even now He adds,
                   'Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.' "—The Desire of

                                         LESSON 7
                                         May 11-17
   "The Lord God said, Behold, the man is be-
come as one of us, to know good and evil: and
now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of life and eat, and live for ever:
therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the
garden of Eden. . . . So he drove out the man;
and he placed at the east of the garden of
Eden cherubims, and a flaming sword which
turned every way to keep the way of the tree
of life." Gen. 3:22-24.

    As Lucifer was cast out of heaven, so man,
after he had sinned, was driven out of the gar-
den. Lucifer became Satan. He was no longer
the bright morning star. But what happened to
man? When God drove him out of the garden,
was the image of God in him totally destroyed
and obliterated? Or was it merely tainted or
marred, while the image itself remained essen-
tially unaltered?
    This question is one of the issues most ac-
tively debated in the history of the Christian
church. As a result of the Fall, man became
alienated from God, and Adam's descendants
inherited a bent toward evil. The Scriptures testify
that each person has a sinful nature. In Adam,
therefore, all men die. See Rom. 5:12; 1 Cor.
15:22. On the other hand, through the substi-
tutionary death of Christ all men can receive
eternal life and become new creatures. Through
 Christ's redemptive work all men can be deliv-
 ered from sin and from its consequences. 1 John
2:2. Nobody will be lost because of Adam's sin,
 for in Christ all men can be saved. If a person
 is lost, it is because of his own choice. This
 Scriptural position presupposes, of course, the
 view that Adam's sin did not totally destroy or
 obliterate the image of God in man. It was marred.
     In the next three lessons we will study what
 effect sin has had on the three relationships—
 body, soul, and spirit—that make up the image
 of God, and the provisions that God has made
 for the restoration of each.

         Part 1       After they had sinned, how did Adam and Eve react to the
    A RESTORED     presence of God?
  RELATIONSHIP
                       "And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence
                   of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden." Gen. 3:8.

                       "In his sinless state, man held joyful communion with Him
                   'in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.'
                   Colossians 2:3. But after his sin, he could no longer find joy
                   in holiness, and he sought to hide from the presence of God.
                   Such is still the condition of the unrenewed heart. It is not in
                   harmony with God, and finds no joy in communion with Him.
                   The sinner could not be happy in God's presence; he would
                   shrink from the companionship of holy beings."—Steps to
                   Christ, page 17.

                     Has sin, then, brought an end to God's relationship with
                   man? Gen. 3:9; John 3:16, 17.

                       Immediately after Adam had sinned, God came to him and
                   called out, "Adam, where are you?" God did not reject Adam
                   or leave him in the hands of Satan. No! The tragedy of sin is
                   that man broke off his relationship with God. The glory of grace
                   is that God sought to reinstate the relationship. The image of
                   God was not destroyed, but it was marred and nearly obliter-
                   ated.
                       What would happen if the relationship between God and
                   man would end? The answer is found at the cross in the agony
                   and the death of Christ our Lord. He suffered what Adam would
                   have suffered—and all of us—if God, in His mercy and good-
                   ness had not maintained His connection with man. "Behold
                   Him in the wilderness, in Gethsemane, upon the cross! The
                   spotless son of God took upon Himself the burden of sin. He
                   who had been one with God, felt in His soul the awful separa-
                   tion that sin makes between God and man. This wrung from
                   His lips the anguished cry, 'My God, My God, why hast Thou
                   forsaken me?' "—Steps to Christ, page 13.

THINK IT THROUGH      In which way is my relationship with God still broken?

                      "It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation
                   between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely
                   united to God than if we had never fallen."—The Desire of

Man and God LESSON 7                                                  ❑ Monday
                                                                           May 12

        Part 2        What caused the separation of Judah from God? of us
      BARRIER      from God?
     REMOVED
                      "But your iniquities have separated between you and your
                   God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will
                   not hear." Isa. 59:2.

                      Sin caused the marring of the image of God in man. "All
                   have sinned," says the apostle Paul, "and come short of the
                   glory of God." Rom. 3:23. The image is broken. Man no longer
                   reflects the glory of his Maker. This is a universal condition in
                   man, which he inherited from Adam. This condition keeps man
                   enslaved in a state of mind that prevents him from doing right.
                   See Rom. 6:17, 20; 7:14, 17, 20.

                      Is it necessary for man to continue in his broken relation-
                   ship with God? Rom. 5:18-21; 6:13-18; Eph. 2:12-22; 1 John
                   3:1-9.

                      "Reconciliation means that every barrier between the soul
                   and God is removed, and that the sinner realizes what the par-
                   doning love of God means."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 396.
                      "In the apostasy, man alienated himself from God; earth
                   was cut off from heaven. Across the gulf that lay between, there
                   could be no communion. But through Christ, earth is again
                   linked with heaven. With His own merits, Christ has bridged
                   the gulf which sin had made, so that the ministering angels
                   can hold communion with man."—Steps to Christ, page 20.
                      "Through Christ, restoration as well as reconciliation is pro-
                   vided for man. The gulf that was made by sin has been spanned
                   by the cross of Calvary. . . . Through the merit of Christ, com-
                   munication has been opened between God and man."—Se-
                   lected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 363.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is it possible for me to have an unbroken relationship
                   with God?

                      "Shall we not regard the mercy of God? What more could
                   He do? Let us place ourselves in right relation to Him who
                   has loved us with amazing love. Let us avail ourselves of the
                   means provided for us that we may be transformed into His
                   likeness, and be restored to fellowship with the ministering
                   angels, to harmony and communion with the Father and the

                                                                            May 13

          Part 3      What obvious evidence is there of the broken relationship
     THE CENTER    between man and God?
         OF LIFE      "Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt
                   not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
                   any thing. . . . Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them,
                   nor serve them." Exodus 20:3-5.
                      When God made man in His own image, He made Himself
                   the very center of man's life and thought and action. As soon
                   as the relationship with God was broken, man thereby lost the
                   center of his life, his very point of orientation for which and
                   by which he existed. Social scientists have called man an
                   "animal thrown off balance," precisely because, somehow, he
                   has lost his center. Modern science has tried to help man by
                   identifying his problem, but it has been unable to point out
                   what the center of man's life should be.
                      What has become the center of man's life throughout the
                   ages? Rom. 1:21-25. See also Isa. 44:9-22; Acts 17:22-29.
                      The impairment of the image of God in man is most evident
                   in man's religions. Man's religions are attempts to restore his
                   relationship with God. But all of man's attempts have been
                   futile. The first recorded attempts after the Flood resulted in
                   Noah's descendants building a city and a tower contrary to
                   God's instructions. Ever since that time men have worshipped
                   gods of their own making. Today about 80 percent of the
                   whole world population is non-Christian, and even among
                   Christians there are all too few who have a right relationship
                   with God. Indeed, the image of God is badly marred.
                     Was it necessary for men to be without a knowledge of
                   God? Rom. 1:19, 20; Acts 14:15-17.
                      The religions of man include clear evidences of the power
                   and the will of God, the Father of Jesus Christ. Yet the "broken-
                   ness of the revelation" is in itself a sign of the brokenness in
                   the relationship between man and God.
THINK IT THROUGH      Are there still "other gods" in my life?
                      "God is the great center. From Him all life proceeds. To
                    Him all service, homage, and allegiance belong. For all created
                   beings there is the one great principle of life—dependence
                   upon and co-operation with God. . . . When Adam sinned, man
                   broke away from the heaven-ordained center. A demon became
                   the central power in the world. Where God's throne should
                   have been, Satan had placed his throne. The world laid its
                   homage, as a willing offering, at the feet of the enemy."—Tes-

        Part 4        "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt
        MAN'S      are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none
                   that doeth good. God looked down from heaven upon the
  FOOLISHNESS      children of men, to see if there were any that did understand,
                   that did seek God. Every one of them is gone back: they are
                   altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no,
                   not one." Ps. 53:1-3.
                      See also Ps. 14:1-3.
                      In the denial that God exists, or in the declaration that He
                   is dead, the brokenness in the relationship between man and
                   God is the most ,evident. Whereas man in other religions still
                   recognizes the existence of some power greater than himself,
                   the atheist and the secular man deny the very existence of such
                   a power. Adam and Eve were ashamed to meet God; modern
                   man cannot even recognize the reality of God.
                     What terms does Paul use to describe the condition of the
                   man whose relationship with God is severed? Rom. 8:6, 7;
                   Eph. 4:18; 2:11, 12.
                       Man has become so estranged from God that though he may
                   be rich in material goods, rich in knowledge, and rich in many
                   other ways, yet he doesn't know how poor, naked, and blind
                   he is. The Bible describes this condition of utter brokenness
                   in the relationship between man and God as foolishness. Man,
                   the image of God, has become a fool. See Rom. 1:18-22; 1 Cor.
                   3:19.
THINK IT THROUGH      Since man is blind to his own true condition, how can he
                   become aware of it? Since he is foolish, how can he become
                   wise?
                       "The most difficult and humiliating lesson that man has to
                   learn is his own inefficiency in depending upon human wisdom.
                   ... Sin has obscured his vision... .
                       "In its human wisdom the world cannot know God. Its wise
                   men gather an imperfect knowledge of God from His created
                   works, and then in their foolishness they exalt nature and the
                   laws of nature above nature's God. .
                       "It is impossible to gain a perfect knowledge of God from
                   nature alone; for nature itself is imperfect.... But Christ came
                   as a personal Saviour to the world. He represented a personal
                   God."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                   Vol. 6, p. 1068.
                       "When sinners are compelled to look upon Him who clothed
                   His divinity with humanity, . . . the scales fall from their eyes,
                    and they see that which before they would not see."—Ellen G.

           Part 5      "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power
     THE SABBATH    thereof: from such turn away." 2 Tim. 3:5.

                       The most serious manifestation of the broken relationship
                    with God is seen in those believers who have a form of godli-
                    ness, but who deny the power thereof; in those who claim to
                    serve God, but who in fact have substituted a system of their
                    own making for the true religion.

                        In what ways has the true worship of God been counter-
                    feited? Dan. 7:25. See also Revelation 13.

                        "It is Satan's constant effort to misrepresent the character
                    of God, the nature of sin, and the real issues at stake in the
                    great controversy."—The Great Controversy, page 569.
                        "From the very beginning of the great controversy in heaven
                    it has been Satan's purpose to overthrow the law of God. . . .
                    To deceive men, and thus lead them to transgress God's law,
                    is the object which he has steadfastly pursued... .
                        "In seeking to cast contempt upon the divine statutes, Satan
                    has perverted the doctrines of the Bible, and errors have thus
                    become incorporated into the faith of thousands who profess
                    to believe the Scriptures."—The Great Controversy, page 582.
                        Satan has in particular sought to destroy the Sabbath
                    commandment. Why? The Sabbath is God's seal on His own
                    image. Break it, and the image of God is broken. Throughout
                    the history of God's people there has always been a close rela-
                    tionship between Sabbath-breaking and the breaking of the
                    relationship between man and God. And, vice versa, God's work
                    of restoring the image of God in man goes hand in hand with
                    the restoration of the Sabbath as the day of the Lord.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my Sabbath-keeping a help in restoring the image of
                    God in me?

                       "The great message, combining the first, second, and third
                    angels' messages, is to be given to the world. This is to be the
                    burden of our work. Those who truly believe in Christ will
                    openly conform to the law of Jehovah. The Sabbath is the sign
                    between God and His people; and we are to make visible our
                    conformity to the law of God by observing the Sabbath. It is
                    to be the mark of distinction between God's chosen people and
                    the world."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

                                                                         May 16

        Part 6       "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my
RESHAPING MAN      mother conceive me." Ps. 51:5.

                      "The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray
                   as soon as they be born, speaking lies." Ps. 58:3.

                      One way in which the broken relationship between Adam
                   and God becomes ours is by social inheritance. Our whole
                   environment, culture, and society, from our earliest childhood
                   on, predisposes us toward unbelief, selfishness, pride, inordi-
                   nate desire, unholy ambitions, disobedience. It is because our
                   whole world is in rebellion against God that each individual
                   born in that world is shaped by its unbelief and revolt. "Who
                   can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one." Job 14:4.
                   The whole human race lies under the curse of sin; it is polluted,
                   and it passes its pollution on to each newborn child. "Because
                   of sin his [Adam's] posterity was born with inherent propen-
                   sities of disobedience."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, Vol. 5, p. 1128. .

                     How does the Bible describe the sinful condition of the
                   human race? Jer. 17:9; Rom. 3:10-18; Eph. 2:1-3.

                      "The fall did not create in man new faculties, energies, and
                   passions; for this would have been a reflection upon God. It
                   was through disobedience to God's requirements that these
                   powers were perverted; the affections were misplaced, and
                   turned from the high and holy purpose to a lower aim and to
                   meet a lower standard. . . . Originally man's affections were
                   in perfect obedience to God's will; but they have been per-
                   verted, misused, and degenerated by disobedience."—Ellen
                   G. White, Review and Herald, March 1, 1887.

                      What has been God's attitude toward fallen man? Gen.
                   3:9; John 3:16, 17.

                       " 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten
                   Son.' He gave him not only to live among men, to bear their
                   sins, and die their sacrifice. He gave Him to the fallen race.
                   . . . And all this that man might be uplifted from the ruin and
                   degradation of sin that he might reflect the love of God, and
                   share the joy of holiness."—Steps to Christ, page 14.

LESSON 8
May 18-24


Man and his fellowman
  "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
Gen. 3:7.
    The immediate result of man's changed relationship to God was that man's
relationship to his fellowmen also became distorted, because man's relationship
to his fellowmen rests on his relationship to God. If the latter becomes dis-
torted, man's relationship with other people becomes distorted too. Love to the
neighbor is not an addition to man's love to God; it is part of it. "Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself." Lev. 19:18; Matt. 22:39. The restoration of the
image of God in man, therefore, consists of both a restoration of an individual's
relationship with God and the restoration of man's relationship with his fellow-
men.
    The distorted relationship with God immediately caused a break in the unity
between Adam and Eve. They felt shame for each other, a clear evidence of the
estrangement of the man from his wife. And when God held the man accountable
for his disobedience, Adam responded irresponsibly, "The woman whom thou
gayest to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate." Gen. 3:12, RSV.
The union between husband and wife was broken. See Gen. 2:23-25.
    Already in Adam's son, Cain, the brokenness of the relationship between man
and fellowman, brothers at that, shows itself in its most revolting forms: envy,
jealousy, aggression, violence, murder. And when God called Cain and asked
him where his brother was, Cain answered, "Am I my brother's keeper?" Gen.
4:9. This response betrays the utterly irresponsible attitude of the sinner, who,
because of his lack of love for God, is therefore indifferent toward his own fel-
lowman and brother. It is only because of God's mercy that not every person
is at the throat of every other. In His grace God has restrained men, from the
moment that He promised Cain His care and protection (Gen. 4:13-15), until this
very moment. He tells the four angels stationed at the four corners of the earth
to hold back the four winds. Rev. 7:1-3. But woe unto man when God permits
the angels to "cease to hold in check the fierce winds of human passion." Then
"all the elements of strife will be let loose. The whole world will be involved in
ruin more terrible than that which came upon Jerusalem of old."—The Great
Controversy, page 614.
    Without the mercy of God's restraining power all men would soon be in the
hands of the prince of this world. Praise God that He has not withdrawn His
Spirit from this earth yet so that even sinful men, through love and affection,
still know how to give good gifts to their children (Matt. 7:11) and show kindness
to their fellowmen. As a result of God's Spirit in man the image of God, re-
flected in man's relationship with his fellowmen, was not totally obliterated but
was greatly distorted.

                                                                        May 18

         Part 1    For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,
  THE MARRIAGE and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
                flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ
         UNION and the church. Nevertheless let every one of you in particu-
                   lar so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that
                   she reverence her husband." Eph. 5:31-33.

                      The union between husband and wife, expressed in the
                   words "one flesh," is a reflection of the union between man
                   and his Creator. When man fell into sin, it immediately strained
                   the relationship between the man and his wife, for Adam sought
                   to justify himself by placing blame on Eve. The relationship
                   between God and man and that between husband and wife are
                   closely linked together, and the Bible compares the harmonious
                   relationship between man and God with a marriage (Isa. 54:5;
                   62:4, 5; Eph. 5:23, 27) and the broken relationship with adul-
                   tery.
                     What act is an indication of a broken relationship between
                   husband and wife? Matt. 5:32; Ex. 20:14.

                      Marriage is a socially approved (legal) sexual and economic
                   union of a man and a woman which includes rights and obli-
                   gations between spouses and between spouses and their (fu-
                   ture) children. Jesus insists that it has been God's plan from
                   the beginning that such a union be permanent. Matt. 19:8, 9;
                   5:31, 32.
                      Does the New Testament ever permit divorce? Matt. 5:31,
                   32; 19:3-9; 1 Cor. 7:10-12.

                      Jesus declared that the provision for divorce made in the
                   law of Moses was introduced because of the hardness of the
                   people's hearts, a reference to man's estrangement from God.
                   The law of Deuteronomy 24:1-4 was never intended to be an
                   ideal rule, and Jesus rejected it. From the beginning marriage
                   was intended to be a permanent union, because it is an image,
                   a reflection, of the union between man and God. "For I hate
                   divorce, says the Lord, the God of Israel." Mal. 2:16, RSV.
                      "Men and women, at the beginning of married life, should
                   reconsecrate themselves to God.
                      "Be as true as steel to your marriage vows, refusing, in
                   thought, word, or deed, to spoil your record as a man who
                   fears God and obeys His commandments."—The Adventist

         Part 2       "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make
      ANTIDOTE     him an help meet for him." Gen. 2:18.
FOR LONELINESS
                       Marriage is essential to human life and existence. Not only
                   has the continuation of the human species been dependent on
                   it (see Gen. 1:28), but children can grow up into normal social
                   and cultural beings only if they are nurtured and trained in the
                   setting of marriage and the family.

                      To what does Paul compare marriage? Eph. 5:22-33.

                      As the rituals of the earthly sanctuary were a shadow, a
                   copy of the heavenly, so the marriage relationship is a shadow
                   of the relationship between God and man. The full ideal is
                   seen in God's love for His church and is to be reflected in the
                   brotherhood of its members.
                      But marriage is not an absolute, for it is not the only form
                   in which man can fulfill his high calling in the image of God.
                   Jesus did not marry. He was, indeed, the image of God in
                   reality. Not only did He live in perfect union with God; in Him
                   also was man's partnership with his fellowmen completely
                   realized. He lived for others.

                      How is the Christian to relate to his fellowman? John
                   13:34, 35; 1 John 2:6-11; 4:11-21.

                      "The kind of religion which is without stain or fault in the
                   sight of God our Father is this: to go to the help of orphans
                   and widows in their distress and keep oneself untarnished by
                   the world." James 1:27, NEB. Loneliness is a sign of the im-
                   pairment of the image of God in man. We are made for each
                   other; anything that detracts from fulfilling our calling to help
                   each other, care for each other, live for each other, is con-
                   tinuing the impairment of the image of God.

THINK IT THROUGH       What lonely people can I help?

                       "The pure religion of Jesus is the fountain from which flow
                    streams of charity, love, self-sacrifice.
                       "A Christian is a Christlike man, a Christlike woman, who
                    is active in God's service, who is present at the social meeting,
                    whose presence will encourage others also."—Ellen G. White

        Part 3    "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is
  BRIDGING THE right." "And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath:
               but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the
GENERATION GAP Lord." Eph. 6:1, 4.

                      The disobedience shown by man toward God is reflected in
                   the disobedience of human beings toward the truth (Rom. 2:8),
                   the gospel (1 Peter 4:17), and the law and authorities. Through
                   their upbringing in an "environment of disobedience," family,
                   culture, society, et cetera, children show the same tendencies
                   as their ancestors. Disobedience in children is a trait that is
                   passed on from the sinful generations of the past.
                      In what way can disobedience be overcome? Col. 3:15-21;
                   Prov. 22:6.
                       "Parents have a great work to do in the matter of correcting
                   and training their children, and in bringing them to God and
                   claiming His blessing upon them."—Counsels to Teachers,
                   page 118.
                       "God's method of government is an example of how children
                   are to be trained. There is no oppression in the Lord's service,
                   and there is to be no oppression in the home or in the school.
                   Yet neither parents nor teachers should allow disregard of
                   their word to pass unnoticed. Should they neglect to correct
                   the children for doing wrong, God will hold them accountable
                   for their neglect. But let them be sparing of censure. Let kind-
                   ness be the law of the home and of the school."—Counsels
                   to Teachers, page 155.
                      What example did Jesus leave us as a young child? Luke
                   2:51.
                      The parents of Jesus were poor and dependent upon their
                   daily toil. He was familiar with poverty, self-denial, and priva-
                   tion. This experience was a safeguard to Him. "Jesus was
                   placed where His character would be tested. It was necessary
                   for Him to be constantly on guard in order to preserve His
                   purity. He was subject to all the conflicts which we have to
                   meet, that He might be an example to us in childhood, youth,
                   and manhood."—The Desire of Ages, page 71.

                       "Jesus is our example. There are many who dwell with in-
                   terest upon the period of His public ministry, while they pass
                   unnoticed the teaching of His early years. But it is in His home
                   life that lie is the pattern for all children and youth."—The De-

Man and His Fellowman LESSON 8                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         May 21

        Part 4        "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
    WHO IS MY      with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
                   mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. . . . This do, and thou
    NEIGHBOR?      shalt live." Luke 10:27, 28.

                       Why should a man love his neighbor? Because that is the
                   way God is. Man, made in God's image, reflects that image only
                   when he seeks to love his fellowman as God loves both the
                   man and his neighbor. There are subtle ways in which we all
                   fail to live up to our high calling as persons made in the image
                   of God, such as indifference toward our neighbor, love for some
                   but discrimination against others, or even exalting another per-
                   son as a god.

                     What lessons was Jesus teaching by His parable of the
                   Good Samaritan? Luke 10:29-37.

                      1. The word "neighbor" is not limited to "one of my own
                   people," be it race, nation, culture, or religion; it takes in every
                   individual.
                      2. We are responsible for others—brothers, sisters, country-
                   men, foreigners—those with whom we come into contact and
                   even for those whom we do not know. For man is made for
                   others. Neighborliness is an awareness of the fact that man
                   does not exist by himself or for himself.
                      "Unless there is practical self-sacrifice for the good of oth-
                   ers, in the family circle, in the neighborhood, in the church,
                   and wherever we may be, then whatever our profession, we are
                   not Christians."—The Desire of Ages, page 504.

                     How is love for God related to love for the neighbor?
                   Matt. 22:34-40; 25:31-46; 1 John 5:1-4.

THINK IT THROUGH      Can individualism be a sign of a broken relationship be-
                   tween a man and his fellowmen?

                       "As a people, we lose much by lack of sympathy and socia-
                   bility with one another. He who talks of independence and
                   shuts himself up to himself is not filling the position that God
                   designed he should. We are children of God, mutually depen-
                   dent upon one another for happiness. The claims of God and
                   of humanity are upon us.. . . It is the proper cultivation of the
                   social elements of our nature that brings us into sympathy with
                   our brethren and affords us happiness in our efforts to bless
                   others."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 71.

            Part 5      "He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich
     THE RICH AND    he hath sent empty away." Luke 1:53.
         THE POOR
                        What special problem do rich people have in their relation
                     to God? Luke 18:18-27; Jer. 9:23, 24.

                        Riches tend to make a person independent from God and
                     to isolate him from his fellowmen. That is why the apostle Paul
                     instructs: "As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be
                     haughty, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches but on God
                     who richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy." 1 Tim. 6:17,
                     RSV.

                       In what ways can riches cause a rift between people?
                     Luke 16:19-21; Prov. 18:23; 28:11.

                         It is not the riches, in money only that prevent the fellow-
                     ship and the brotherhood of men to become a reality. The same
                     counsel the Bible gives to the wealthy also applies to those
                     who are rich in education, in wisdom, and even in truth. Riches
                     in truth have given rise to an attitude of pride, arrogance, self-
                     reliance, and lack of concern for others, as is evident from
                     the history of the nation of Israel, and as the warning of Jesus
                     to the Laodicean church indicates. See Rev. 3:17-22.

                        In what ways do the conditions described in James 5:1.6
                     exist in our day?

                        What example has Christ given us to heal the break be-
                     tween the rich and the poor? 2 Cor. 8:9. See also Isa. 58:6-8.

                         "To the rich, God has given wealth that they may relieve
                     and comfort His suffering children; but too often they are in-
                     different to the wants of others. They feel themselves superior
                     to their poor brethren. . . . In costly dwellings and splendid
                     churches, the rich shut themselves away from the poor; the
                     means that God has given to bless the needy is spent in pam-
                     pering pride and selfishness. The poor are robbed daily of the
                     education they should have concerning the tender mercies of
                     God. . . . They are compelled to feel the poverty that narrows
                     life, and are often tempted to become envious, jealous, and
                     full of evil surmisings."—The Desire of Ages, page 639.

                                                                           May 23

       Part 6       "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love
                 thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,
   THE ENEMY
                 Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
                 them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
                 use you, and persecute you." Matt. 5:43, 44.
                       The reason Jesus gave (vs. 45) for believers to relate in
                   love to the enemy and the persecutor is that the believers will
                   thus be children of God, for He relates to the whole world in
                   impartial love.
                       Jesus warned the disciples in Matthew 10:34 and John 16:2
                   that their adherence to His principles would bring upon them
                   the wrath of the world. But the Christian is to relate in love
                   even to the persecutor and is to pray for him.
                       Jesus rejected, and requires His followers to reject, the
                    principle of reciprocity. This principle is expressed in loving
                    only those who love you, and greeting only your "brethren."
                    Matt. 5:46, 47. By contrast the love that Jesus recommends
                    reaches out to all people regardless of whether they love you
                    and treat you well or not.
                     How are the experiences recorded in Matthew 26:49 and
                   Luke 23:32-34 related to the principles of Matthew 5:43, 44?
                        WVIe the soldiers were doing their fearful work, Jesus
                   prayed for His enemies, 'Father, forgive them; for they know
                   not what they do.' His mind passed from His own suffering to
                   the sin of His persecutors, and the terrible retribution that
                   would be theirs. No curses were called down upon the soldiers
                   who were handling Him so roughly. No vengeance was invoked
                   upon the priests and rulers, who were gloating over the accom-
                   plishment of their purpose. Christ pitied them in their ignorance
                   and guilt. He breathed only a plea for their forgiveness."—The
                   Desire of Ages, page 744.
                       "Every true Christian will develop in his life the character-
                   istics of this divine love; he will reveal a spirit of forbearance,
                   of beneficence, and a freedom from envy and jealousy. This
                   character developed in word and act will not repulse, and will
                   not be unapproachable, cold, and indifferent to the interests
                   of others. The person who cultivates the precious plant of love
                   will be self-denying in spirit, and will not yield self-control even
                   under provocation. He will not impute wrong motives and evil
                   intentions to others, but will feel deeply over sin when dis-
                   covered in any of the disciples of Christ."—Testimonies,

    "And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened
unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of
which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it:
cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat
of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it
bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return
unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return." Gen. 3:17-19.
   As a result of man's broken relationship with God not only
was the harmony between husband and wife, between man
and his fellowman, broken, but also a whole new relationship
 between man and the rest of God's creation came about. The
 distortion is clearly reflected in the words of Genesis 3:17-19.
 The ground, with its thorns and its thistles, became an enemy
of man. And so did the animals. Because of sin, man's rela-
tionship with nature became a struggle, and his fight to use
and control nature turned into a goal in itself, instead of a
means to serve God. The curse that came upon man as a
result of his disobedience was not that a new natural scene
came into existence, but rather that the relationship between
man and nature became thoroughly distorted. This distortion
brought about very serious damage to our whole human con-
dition. When man lost his holiness, he thereby also lost his
wholeness, the perfect harmony and oneness of soul, body,
and spirit. He became a disintegrated being, with the body
often controlling the whole person. The apostle Paul charac-
terized this distortion in man by his frequent use of the term
"carnal"; that is, the power of sin in man's life, thought,
actions, and personality. Carnal does not mean that the
body, the flesh, as such, is evil. It means that the whole man
is under the influence of sin as reflected in the fact of man's
disintegration, and in his lack of power to do the right thing
even when he wants 10. Rom. 7:14-25. This is a loss of free-
dom. Not only is he no longer free to implement what he
would like to do, but unaided he has even lost his freedom
to choose the right, because of the power of wrong. The
whole history of man is a history of suppressed freedoms:
social, economic, moral, political, and religious freedom.
And though it seems that mankind has come a long way with
the abolition of slavery and the legal recognition of human
freedoms, it is not until a person's relationship with God has
been restored that there can be real freedom. It is only
where the Spirit of the Lord is that there is freedom. 2 Cor.
3:17.

         Part 1       "And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's
 GOD OF NATURE     house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, be-
                   tween the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty
                   men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and
                   their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun
                   toward the east." Ezek. 8:16.

                      When Judah apostatized, what were their objects of wor-
                   ship? 2 Kings 23:5, 11; Jer. 8:2.
                       Nature worship is a universal sign of the broken relationship
                   between man and God and his consequent changed relation-
                   ship with nature. Man was given dominion over nature, and
                   called to rule over the earth and its surroundings. Worship of
                   the elements of nature, from the sun and the moon to the earth,
                   animals, trees, and rain, shows how deeply man is fallen. From
                   a king he became a slave of the very powers he was called
                   to rule.
                      In what sense is man not dependent upon the powers of
                   nature? Ps. 107:35-43; Prov. 3:1-10.
                      Even after the Fall, man does not have to be dependent on
                   the powers of nature. God is greater than these; He is not only
                   the Creator, but also the sustainer of nature.
                      One of the results of turning away from God was that man
                   lost the insight that God is the Creator and the owner of the
                   earth and its treasures, and that God has given them into man's
                   hands as His stewards. At first, he merely became its slave;
                   his life became determined by its powers. More recently mark
                   has placed himself in control of the earth and all that is in it.
                   But his control becomes destructive when he fails to recognize
                   that God is the owner and that it is only as a steward that he
                   has full control of the earth. The new control by technology is
                   leading to depletion of resources and to life-threatening pollu-
                   tion of air, land, and water.
THINK IT THROUGH     How can modern man give recognition to the fact that
                   God is the owner of the earth and all that is in it?
                      "This world was established and is sustained by the com-
                   passionate love of the Creator. God is the giver of all we have.
                   He calls upon us to return to Him a portion of the abundance
                   He has bestowed upon us. Think of the care He gives the
                   earth, sending the rain and sunshine in their season, to cause
                   vegetation to flourish. He bestows His favors on the just and
                   on the unjust. Shall not the recipients of His blessings show
                   their gratitude by giving of their means to help suffering hu-
                   manity?"—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 50.

Man and Nature         LESSON 9                                        0 Monday
                                                                          May 26

         Part 2       "I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man
    ABUSE AND      to my hurt. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech
                   seventy and sevenfold." Gen. 4:23, 24.
 USE OF POWER
                      One of the baffling questions in our day is: Why cannot man
                   make a responsible use of the powers he has? His invention
                   of nuclear energy could be of tremendous benefit to the whole
                   world and solve a lot of problems. His power over nature has
                   given man the ability to raise crops in areas where that would
                   have been unthinkable before. Yet the new abundance is mis-
                   used, and hunger and poverty continue. The answer to the
                   question lies in the broken relationship between man and
                   God. As a result, even the good things are used to do evil.
                   Take the example of Tubal-cain, the son of Lamech, who in-
                   vented the use of iron and copper. It brought a revolutionary
                   change in early agriculture and was the beginning of industry.
                   Yet the very same elements were used by others to make more
                   deadly weapons of warfare.
                      What lessons can be learned about the abuse of power
                   from some experiences of Noah? Gen. 9:1-3; 20-26. Add other
                   examples from the Scriptures that show the misuse of man's
                   power over the earth.
                      What is the source of man's misuse of power? Luke
                   12:13-21.
                      "By the parable of the foolish rich man, Christ showed the
                   folly of those who make the world their all. This man had
                   received everything from God. ... The Lord had caused vege-
                   tation to flourish, and the fields to bring forth abundantly. . . .
                   He did not think of God, from whom all his mercies had come.
                   He did not realize that God had made him a steward of His
                   goods that he might help the needy. He had a blessed oppor-
                   tunity of being God's almoner, but he thought only of minister-
                   ing to his own comfort....
                       "This man's aims were no higher than those of the beasts
                   that perish. He lived as if there were no God, no heaven, no
                   future life; as if everything he possessed were his own, and
                   he owed nothing to God or man."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                   pages 256-258.
THINK IT THROUGH      How do I use the powers God has given me?
                       "For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world
                   and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his
                   life? For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the
                   glory of his Father, and then he will repay every man for what
                   he has done." Matt. 16:26, 27, RSV.

                   and give glory to Him? Num. 12:1-10.

                       "This manifestation of the Lord's displeasure was designed
                   to be a warning to all Israel. . . . If Miriam's envy and dis-
                   satisfaction had not been signally rebuked, it would have re-
                   sulted in great evil. Envy is one of the most satanic traits that
                   can exist in the human heart, and it is one of the most baleful
                   in its effects....
                       "The judgment visited upon Miriam should be a rebuke to
                   all who yield to jealousy, and murmur against those upon whom

                       "All sickness is the result of transgression. Many are suffer-

                   But it is nevertheless their duty to ascertain wherein their

                   upon their offspring so miserable an inheritance; and wherein
                   their parents' habits were wrong, they should change their
                   course, and place themselves by correct habits in a better

Man and Nature LESSON 9                                           ❑   Wednesday
                                                                         May 28

        Part 4    How does the Bible describe the condition of the human
    THE HEART  heart?
                      "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
                   wicked: who can know it?" Jer. 17:9.
                       "The heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness
                   is in their heart while they live." Eccl. 9:3.
                      What is the meaning of the Biblical term "heart"? See
                   Prov. 15:11-15; Matt. 13:19; 2 Thess. 2:17.
                      The Bible writers use "heart" for the inner man, the way he
                   thinks, feels, and believes—his true character. It stands over
                   and against what people may think he is. "Heart" stands for
                   the whole person and is therefore frequently used interchange-
                   ably with the words "soul" and "spirit." But "heart" is espe-
                   cially used for man in his relationship to God. And since that
                   relationship is broken (the heart is evil), man's will, feelings,
                   thoughts, imaginations, and actions are all affected. The whole
                   man has become depraved.
                      Is this condition of man's heart irreversible? Jer. 24:7;
                   Ezek. 11:19.
                      The plan of salvation can be a reality because man's heart
                   can be changed. If man were irreversibly evil, the concept of
                   redemption would have no meaning. Man is redeemable. Jesus
                   will give the repentant sinner a new heart.
                       Ellen White explains the process in these words: "When
                   Jesus speaks of the new heart, He means the mind, the life, the
                   whole being. To have a change of heart is to withdraw the
                   affections from the world, and fasten them upon Christ. To
                   have a new heart is to have a new mind, new purposes, new
                   motives. What is the sign of a new heart?—a changed life.
                   There is a daily, hourly dying to selfishness and pride."—Ellen
                   G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 4, pp. 1164,
                   1165.
                       The same Scriptures that speak of the evil propensity of the
                   human heart also assure us of the change that God works in
                   us if we choose to "open our hearts" and have them "renewed."
THINK IT THROUGH      What is the primary way by which people become dis-
                   obedient to God?
                       "Without the transforming process which can come alone
                   through divine power, the original propensities to sin are left
                   in the heart in all their strength, to forge new chains, to impose
                   a slavery that can never be broken by human power."—Evan-

                                                                         May 29

          Part 5      "Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
       FREEDOM     Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the ser-
                   vant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth
                   ever. If the Son therefore 4hall make you free, ye shall be
                   free indeed." John 8:34-36.
                      Sin was possible because God created man a free moral
                   being; he was free from fear and coercion and free to choose
                   whom he would serve, glorify, and obey. It was because of
                   this freedom that man could really love God and respond to
                   Him. "Without freedom of choice, his obedience would not have
                   been voluntary, but forced. There could have been no develop-
                   ment of character. Such a course would have been contrary
                   to God's plan in dealing with the inhabitants of other worlds. It
                   would have been unworthy of man as an intelligent being, and
                   would have sustained Satan's charge of God's arbitrary rule."
                   —Patriarchs and Prophets, page 49.
                      But when man sinned, he thereby became a slave.
                      In what ways is man's unfreedom revealed? Rom. 7:14-21.
                      The question has often been raised, If man could not use
                   his freedom the way he wanted to, was he then really free?
                   Freedom that is not oriented toward God, and not safeguarded
                   by His laws, ceases to be genuine freedom because sin in-
                   cludes the drive for each person to control the other. Sin did
                   not rob man of his freedom in the sense that he cannot make
                   choices or decisions anymore. That gift still distinguishes man
                   from the animals, who are guided by instinct and the laws of
                   nature. Man still chooses. In that respect man retains the image
                   of God. But it is an imperfect image, because that freedom,
                   apart from God, has made man a slave of other men, things,
                   and powers over which he has no control.
THINK IT THROUGH      What is the meaning of Paul's statement: "Where the
                   Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty"? 2 Cor. 3:17.
                      "What you need to understand is the true force of the will.
                   This is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of
                   decision, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action
                   of the will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is
                   theirs to exercise. You cannot change your heart, you cannot
                   of yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to
                   serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work in
                   you to will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus
                   your whole nature will be brought under the control of the
                   Spirit of Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him, your
                   thoughts will be in harmony with Him."—Steps to Christ,

                                                                           May 30

        Part 6       "Those who belong to the earth are like the one who was
 MADE OF DUST      made of earth; those who are of heaven are like the one who
                   came from heaven. Just as we wear the likeness of the man
                   made of earth, so we will wear the likeness of the Man from
                   heaven." 1 Cor. 15:48, 49, TEV.
                       After Adam had sinned he heard God say to him, "Dust thou
                   art, and unto dust shalt thou return." Gen. 3:19. Some have
                   tried to estimate the money value of that dust out of which
                   man is formed. But the value of a person does not lie in being
                   dust, but in the fact that God has formed that dust into His own
                   image. Man became a living being—heart, soul, spirit, and
                   flesh. There is love in him and laughter, courage, and strength.
                   He is a person. In spite of all the corruption, hatred, evil, and
                   sin that have reigned in the world ever since Adam first sinned,
                   that image of God has not disappeared. It has been distorted
                   and marred, but the traces of the divine inscription remain on
                   every human being.
                     How has the image of God in some degree remained in
                   man? Ps. 139:13-16.
                      Through the formation of human beings, God is the Creator
                   of all men. "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high,
                   I cannot attain unto it" (Ps. 139:6), but it is Biblical truth. God
                   created Adam in His own image; through Adam God passed it
                   on to Seth, and so on. Out of one blood He formed the whole
                   human race. And there is only one human race; for all ethnic
                   groups, tall or small people, light or heavy build, share alike
                   in the image of God. The imperfection of the image is not re-
                   flected in such physical features as skin color or hair form
                   or bone structure, but in man's broken relationship with God,
                   his fellowmen and the rest of God's creation. As we all share
                   alike in the image of God, so we also all share alike in its
                   impairment.
                      What assurance does the Scripture give us that God has
                   not left men to their own? Luke 19:10; Heb. 13:5, 6.

                       "The lost coin, in the Saviour's parable, though lying in the
                   dirt and rubbish, was a piece of silver still. Its owner sought
                   it because it was of value. So every soul, however degraded
                   by sin, is in God's sight accounted precious. As the coin bore
                   the image and superscription of the reigning power, so man
                   at his creation bore the image and superscription of God."—

   "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the
dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
1 Cor. 15:21, 22.
    All created organisms die. But only man knows about death. He is not only
daily exposed to death, which affects his whole existence, his life and his
thought; but death is to him a daily possibility, and he is constantly aware of it.
    No scientific explanation has as yet been found as to why man should die.
What factor is there in man that he, after a while, grows old and dies? Why do
not his living cells continue to multiply themselves, without end, or without
distortions? It is part of our nature, and we know it. But why?
    Since this question cannot be answered satisfactorily, the question shifts
to, What is the meaning of death? If there is life, why should there be death?
Or if there is death, why should there be life? Does death only prove the fool-
ishness of life, as some maintain, or the futility of all human endeavor? Or
does it, perhaps, give our sixty or seventy years of existence a special meaning,
a special richness, as others have said? But of course no satisfactory answer
can be found to these questions before we have come to grips with these two
basic questions: Why death? And what is death?
     In the discussions on death, a distinction should be made between death
as the ceasing of life, and death as it relates to the whole human person. Is
death, as a cessation of life, also the very end of min? Of course when death
 comes, gone are man's activities as we know them: his laughter, his love, his
 praises, his thoughts. The Biblical testimony on that issue is clear. But is death
 also the end of man? In other words, is death the same as nothingness? Few,
 very few indeed, have considered death to be nothingness. But on the question
 of the condition of man in death no unanimous opinion exists among Christians.
 In fact, they range from the view that at death an entity called "soul" or "spirit"
 leaves the body to be preserved until the resurrection, to the view that man as
 a whole rests until the day when he is called to life again. These views are
 based on the Biblical idea that death is not the end of man, but a time of rest, a
 condition of transition to a new form of existence. Also on the question, Why
 should men die? exists general consensus among Christians. There remains
 only, and in particular, the question therefore, What happens to man at death?
 What is his condition during that period of transition from life to life? In short,
 What is death? Let us, in this lesson, prayerfully consider the Biblical answers
 to these important questions. For not only is it the lot of all men once to die,
 but also man's whole attitude toward life is largely shaped, if not determined,
 by his attitude toward death.

          Part 1        "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
       A RESULT     breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
                    a living soul." Gen. 2:7.
          OF SIN
                      "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the
                   garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God
                   commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden
                   thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of
                   good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that
                   thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Verses 15-17.
                      According to the testimony of Scripture,. man was created
                   with the possibility of living forever. When Adam sinned, he
                   severed himself from God, the source of his existence. At the
                   very moment that the image of God was marred, man became
                   a son of death.
                      Why do all men die? Rom. 5:12-14; 6:20, 21.

                      From the Scriptures it is clear that all men have sinned
                   and, therefore, they die. Man's death is a demonstration of the
                   fact that he has fallen away from God. On the other hand, the
                   fact that all men die, and that there is nobody who is exempt
                   from death, confirms that all men are sinners. Human death
                   points, therefore, to the need for a Redeemer, for Someone
                   who can rescue man from the power of death. Rom. 7:24.
                      Is the first death a punishment for sin? Gen. 2:17; Rom.
                   6:23.
                      Death does not originate with God, and neither was it willed
                   by Him. It is the consequence of sin. It is like the darkness
                   which comes when we shut off the light bulb from its source
                   of electricity. When Adam sinned and thereby broke his rela-
                   tionship with the source of his life, death became inevitable.
THINK IT THROUGH      Since death is a result of man's sin, why should also the
                   other living organisms die?
                       "To Adam, the offering of the first sacrifice was a most
                   painful ceremony. His hand must be raised to take life, which
                   only God could give. It was the first time he had ever witnessed
                   death, and he knew that had he been obedient to God, there
                   would have been no death of man or beast."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, page 68.
                      "Christ never planted the seeds of death in the system.
                   Satan planted these seeds when he tempted Adam to eat of
                   the tree of knowledge which meant disobedience to God."—

                                                                         June 2

        Part 2        "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and
    CONDITION      the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." Eccl. 12:7.
     IN DEATH         "And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the
                   ghost." Mark 15:37.
                      What happens to man at death? Gen. 7:21; Job 14:10; Acts
                   5:5, 10.
                       According to Genesis 2:7, man became a "living soul"
                   (nephesh) only when God breathed into his nostrils the breath
                   of life. At death, this process is reversed: The breath returns
                   to God, who gave it, and man turns to dust again. Death, then,
                   is in essence the cessation of life.
                      How complete is the cessation of life in man at death?
                   Ps. 6:5; 115:17; 146:4; Eccl. 9:5, 6.
                       Man is a total whole, an indivisible unit. When death comes,
                   it affects the whole person, man in his totality, as soul, body,
                   and spirit. At death the whole man, his being, and his con-
                   sciousness cease.
                      Is death for the Christian the same as extinction? Rom.
                   14:8.
                      The apostle Paul was persuaded that nothing, "neither
                   death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
                   things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
                   any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love
                   of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Rom. 8:38, 39. From
                   the texts mentioned—and others—it can be concluded that
                   while death is the cessation of life, something is preserved. In
                   the resurrection the same man who gave up the spirit will be
                   brought to life again. It is he, and not another being. It is the
                   same person. The Bible therefore speaks of death, not as an
                   annihilation of man, but as a time in which he is laid to rest,
                   waiting for the resurrection.

THINK IT THROUGH      What, then, is preserved at death?
                      "Our personal identity is preserved in the resurrection,
                   though not the same particles of matter or material substance
                   as went into the grave. The wondrous works of God are a
                   mystery to man. The spirit, the character of man, is returned
                   to God, there to be preserved. In the resurrection every man
                   will have his own character. God in His own time will call forth
                   the dead, giving again the breath of life, and bidding the dry
                   bones live."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

        Part 3        "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable,

   THE PUNISH-
                   ters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which
  MENT FOR SIN     burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
                   Rev. 21:8.
                     What does the Bible mean by the term "second death"?
                   Rev. 2:11; 20:6, 14.
                       Contrary to the first death—death in general, which is the
                   lot of all men—the second death strikes only those whom the
                   Bible describes as the wicked; that is, those who consciously
                   rejected Christ and His grace and who refused to have Christ
                   restore them into His own image and likeness. This death comes
                   after the thousand years (Rev. 20:2-7) and means not just the
                   end of life, but the total annihilation of the whole person. This
                   second death is the very opposite of eternal life.
                      What other contrasts are there between the first and the
                   second death?
                      1. The first death is the natural outworking on humanity of
                   the degenerative effects of sin. The second death is a divine
                   punishment. Rom. 6:23. What that actually means is this: "He
                   [God] deprives him [the sinner] of the existence which his
                   transgressions have forfeited and of which he has proved him-
                   self unworthy."—The Great Controversy, page 544.
                      2. The first death is compared with a sleep (John 11:11-14;
                   1 Cor. 15:51, 52) out of which all men will awake again. John
                   5:28, 29. The second death is not only a cessation of life and
                   of consciousness, as the first death, but a total annihilation of
                   man. Nothing will be preserved. It means total "nothingness."
                   As the psalmist describes it, "The wicked will be no more; ...
                   he will not be there." Ps. 37:10, RSV. See also verse 20. That
                   destruction is total and everlasting. Acts 3:23; 2 Thess. 1:9.
                   Their lot will be like material that is totally burned up, utterly
                   consumed by fire. 2 Peter 3:10; Matt. 3:12; Ps. 73:19; Mal. 4:1;
                   Rev. 20:15; 21:8.

THINK IT THROUGH      How does the second death relate to God's love?
                      "God has given to men a declaration of His character and
                   of His method of dealing with sin.... 'The transgressors shall
                   be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.'
                   Psalm 37:38. The power and authority of the divine govern-
                   ment will be employed to put down rebellion; yet all the mani-
                   festations of retributive justice will be perfectly consistent with
                   the character of God as a merciful, long-suffering, benevolent
                   being."—The Great Controversy, page 541.

         Part 4      "Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded
     JESUS, OUR   up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in
                  twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake,
    SUBSTITUTE    and the rocks rent; and the graves were opened; and many
                  bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the
                  graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city,

                     "The cross must occupy the central place because it is the

                     "The atonement of Christ is not a mere skillful way to have
                 our sins pardoned; it is a divine remedy for the cure of trans-
                 gression and the restoration of spiritual health. It is the heaven-

                                                                           June 5

        Part 5        "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that
 BAPTIZED INTO     grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead
                   to sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not, that so many
    HIS DEATH      of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into
                   his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into
                   death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by
                   the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in new-
                   ness of life." Rom. 6:1-4.
                      Baptism plunges us into Christ's death. Through baptism,
                   which is a semblance of His death and of His burial—hence
                   also the Biblical requirement for baptism by immersion—we
                   have participated in the death of Christ.
                      Did Christ die the first death only, or did He also die the
                   second death? Matt. 27:46; 1 Thess. 5:9, 10.
                      Christ bore the penalty of our sins, that is, the second death,
                   the utter lostness and forsakenness from God. Christ has ex-
                   perienced the sufferings of the death that is the "wages of
                   sin." Rom. 6:23. "The death referred to [in Rom. 6:23 and
                   Deut. 30:15] . . . is not that pronounced upon Adam, for all
                   mankind suffer the penalty of his transgression. It is 'the sec-
                   ond death' that is placed in contrast with everlasting life."—
                   The Great Controversy, page 544. The believer who accepts
                   Christ's death as a substitution of his own death is thereby
                   saved from destruction and total annihilation, which is the
                   second death.
                      What is the effect of baptism, as a burial with Christ, upon
                   a person's life? Rom. 6:6-14; 7:4-6; Col. 2:12.

                      At baptism the true believer is free: free from the penalty of
                   sin, free to enter life, free to say No to sin and to the tempta-
                   tions of the devil, free to do good and to hate evil, free to love
                   God and his neighbor. Christ set us free, to be free men.

                   there?

                      "Those who do this [receive baptism] are to make all worldly

                                                                          June 6

         Part 6       "1 protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus
  JESUS' DEATH     our Lord, I die daily." 1 Cor. 15:31.
    REENACTED          Death is an objective reality, as well as a personal experi-
                   ence. We know of death; we speak of it, and we experience it
                   daily in us and around us. That is also true about the death of
                   Christ. It happened once in history as an objective fact; and
                   the effects it had for all men—peace, freedom, righteousness,
                   and reconciliation—are an objective reality. Christ died for us
                   while we were yet sinners, and we did not know Him. Rom. 5:8.
                   His death has brought salvation to all men. John 3:16. But His
                   death, and its effects, must also be a daily, personal experience.

                      In what ways do we share in the death of Christ? 2 Cor.
                   4:10-12; Rom. 8:17; Phil. 1:29; 2 Tim. 2:8-11.

                      What is the meaning of the Lord's Supper and foot wash-
                   ing? 1 Cor. 11:23-27; John 13:12-17.

                      In the celebration of the Lord's Supper we are not only an-
                   nouncing the death of Christ and what it means to all men; not
                   only are we declaring ourselves guilty of His death; not only
                   do we experience the joy of having been redeemed from the
                   "wages of sin." We are also to announce our own death in the
                   death of Christ, our death to sin, our death to all pride and
                   jealousy, strife, and evil. We are reminded of the fact that we
                   shall live with Christ only when we have died with Him. 2 Tim.
                   2:11. The Lord's Supper is a celebration in memory of Him who
                   died almost two thousand years ago, and also a celebration of
                   what Jesus has done personally for the believers who die with
                   Him and who are renewed in body, soul, and spirit.

THINK IT THROUGH      What has Jesus done for me that is worthy of celebration?

                      "By the act of our Lord this humiliating ceremony [of the
                   foot washing] was made a consecrated ordinance. It was to be
                   observed by the disciples, that they might ever keep in mind
                   His lessons of humility and service.
                      "This ordinance is Christ's appointed preparation for the
                   sacramental service. While pride, variance, and strife for su-
                   premacy are cherished, the heart cannot enter into fellowship
                   with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the communion of
                   His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus appointed
                   the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed."—The

Eternal Life                                                             LESSON 11
                                                                            June 8-14
    "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them
that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
1 Cor. 15:20-22.
    It is a common belief that death is not the end of man. The most common
concept among the religions and philosophies of man, from ancient times until
today, is that there is something in man that cannot die, that the body may be
laid to rest, but his spirit or soul lives on. But the Bible teaches that man is a
total whole, an indivisible unit. He is flesh, soul, heart, and spirit. None of these
terms stands for a part in man that contrasts it with another part. They stand for
the whole person, as he relates to God, to his fellowmen, and to his environment.
Man lives because God gives him life. Life and all consciousness cease to-
gether. When Christ faced the terror of death, he was utterly troubled, and He
prayed the Father, "All things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from
me." Mark 14:36. When He was in the hands of death, Christ felt totally for-
saken by God. Mark 15:37. Death is the enemy of God, His last enemy, as the
apostle Paul calls it. 1 Cor. 15:26. Death separates man from God, who is Life
and the Creator of all life. The Christian's hope in death lies in the resurrec-
tion. There also lies our comfort and consolation. 1 Thess. 4:13-18. The whole
man will be restored in the resurrection: body, soul, and spirit. It will be a new
creation.
    The Bible asserts that eternal life is bound up with the person of Jesus
Christ, and His death. Eternal life is Christ's gift of grace, acquired by faith
in Him "who gave Himself for us." In this light, the teaching of the natural im-
mortality of the soul is "unchristian," and the deception of antichrist; it detracts
from the Biblical message of salvation by grace through faith. It is a deception
that in essence goes back to the satanic lie, "Ye shall not surely die." Gen.
3:4. Such a teaching, therefore, cannot merely be treated as a harmless error;
it must be attacked as a satanic deception, which, in fact, it is. It covers up
the seriousness of sin, which robs man of eternal life. Christ's work and sacri-
ficial death are wholly misrepresented, and the principles and laws that are
the foundations of God's kingdom are declared null and void. The Biblical mes-
sage of resurrection and immortality is, therefore, not only a source of hope,
joy, and consolation; it is also a bulwark against deception. It is at the very
foundation of the "eternal gospel," that gives us life, freedom, and assurance.

                                                                         June 8

         Part 1    "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body
 THE RESURREC- shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for
                thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out
 TION FORETOLD the dead." Isa. 26:19.
                      Isaiah's teaching of a resurrection contrasts sharply with
                 the idea prevailing in the nations surrounding the people of
                 God that at death man's body is laid at rest, but that his im-
                 mortal soul, or spirit, lives on. This contrast has been a crucial
                 difference between God's people and those whom the Bible
                 refers to as Babel.
                    It has often been noted that there are only a few clear and
                 unambiguous statements in the Old Testament concerning the
                 resurrection. Yet there are passages that lead to the conclusion
                 that Israel had a rather clear concept of the resurrection, and
                 also that this concept was widespread. The combined testimony
                 of the Old and the New Testaments strongly sustains the resur-
                 rection hope.
                     What is the testimony of Job and the psalmist regarding
                 a resurrection? Job 14:13-17; 19:25-27; Ps. 16:8-11.
                    The testimony of the Old Testament is clear:
                     "The Lord kills and he gives life,
                    he sends down to sheol [the grave], he can bring
                          the dead up again." 1 Sam. 2:6, NEB.
                    Death is not to be feared.
                     "Even though I walk through the
                            valley of the shadow of death,
                        I fear no evil;
                    for thou art with me." Ps. 23:4, RSV.
                     "The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righ-
                 teous hath hope in his death." Prov. 14:32.
                     This certainly refers to the day when God's promise of the
                 resurrection would be fulfilled. In the Old Testament the resur-
                 rection is the basis and the only hope of salvation for the dead,
                 as the prophet Daniel clearly testified. Dan. 12:2, 3.
                     Un-Biblical views of man in death have often led Christians
                 into an incorrect doctrine of the resurrection. This combination
                 of error opens a door to spiritism.
                     What attitude did God express toward those who practice
                 the delusion of contacting dead persons? Deut. 18:9-12. See
                 also Lev. 19:31; 20:6; 1 Sam. 28.
                    Belief in spirits was widespread in the ancient East. It was
                 because of the evil of spiritism that the Canaanites were driven
                 out of their land. Spiritism always pollutes; it is abominable in
                 God's sight.
THINK IT THROUGH     Why is belief in and contact with spirits an abomination
                 to God?

        Part 2        Life after death will result from what event, according to
THE RESURREC-      the promise of Jesus?
TION PROMISED           "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and
                   now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God:
                   and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in
                   himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.
                   . . . Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which
                   all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come
                   forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life;
                   and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damna-
                   tion." John 5:25-29.


                       Jesus taught that there would be two resurrections. This is
                   an important part of the Christian message of the resurrection.
                   First, because it stresses again the fact that the resurrection
                   is built on the work of Jesus Christ. He has conquered death,
                   and nobody therefore has to remain in its bondage. He is Lord
                   over the living and the dead. Rom. 14:9. Second, it reaffirms
                   that all men will appear, bodily and literally, before the judg-
                   ment seat of Christ. 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10. People may reject
                   Christ while they are still alive, or make fun of Him. At one time
                   they will see Him to hear His condemnation of their unbelief.
                   And third, this belief in the resurrection of believers and un-
                    believers agrees with the Biblical view that all men owe their
                   life, their whole existence, to Christ. He is the Creator of all
                   men. In Him all live and move and have their existence. Acts
                   17:25. The unbeliever may deny Christ; it does not alter the
                    fact that, as God's creature, he lives only through Him.

                      What experiences confirm Jesus' promise of the resurrec-
                   tion? Luke 7:11-17; 8:49-56; John 11:25, 38-44.


                       These three resurrections affirmed the possibility of ful-
                   fillment of Jesus' promise that all men would be raised from
                   the dead. They literally demonstrated the words of Jesus in
                   John 5:25. The New English Bible reads: "A time is coming,
                   indeed it is already here, when the dead shall hear the voice
                   of the Son of God, and all who hear shall come to life." The
                   resurrections demonstrate that Jesus is the Son of God, who is
                   "the resurrection and the life." John 11:25.

                   from the dead? Matt. 28:5-15; Luke 24:28-31, 36, 50-53.

                       From the three descriptions of the resurrection emerge these
                   significant aspects: On Sunday morning, after Jesus' death at
                   the cross and His burial, the tomb where they laid Him is found
                   empty. This is a fulfillment of Jesus' own words, repeated on
                   three different occasions, that He would be crucified and rise
                   on the third day. Only after Jesus' resurrection did they recall
                   such predictions and understand their meaning.
                      Jesus was seen by many people: the guards, the women,
                   people in Galilee, travelers on the way to Emmaus, the dis-
                   ciples and "the rest of the company" of Jerusalem. See also
                   1 Cor. 15:3-8.
                       Jesus commissioned the people to spread the good news in
                   all the world. And the Lord confirmed their work with signs
                   and miracles, another evidence that the Lord was truly risen.

                      Why is the belief in the resurrection of Christ important?
                   1 Cor. 15:16-20; 1 Thess. 4:14.

                     How does the resurrection of Jesus relate to man's im-
                   mortality? 1 Cor. 15:20, 21, 51-54; 1 Thess. 4:16-18.

                      "As Christ arose, He brought from the grave a multitude of
                   captives. The earthquake at His death had rent open their
                   graves, and when He arose, they came forth with Him.. ..
                      "Those who came forth from the grave at Christ's resurrec-
                   tion were raised to everlasting life. They ascended with Him as
                   trophies of His victory over death and the grave... .
                      "These went into the city, and appeared unto many, declar-
                   ing, Christ has risen from the dead, and we be risen with Him.
                   Thus was immortalized the sacred truth of the resurrection....
                      "At the Saviour's resurrection a few graves were opened,
                   but at His second coming all the precious dead shall hear His
                   voice, and shall come forth to glorious, immortal life."—The

  TION ASSURED
                      When will the resurrection take place? 1 Cor. 15:23.

                      "A distinction is made between the two classes that are
                   brought forth. 'All that are in the graves shall hear His voice,
                   and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
                   resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
                   resurrection of damnation.' John 5:28, 29."—The Great Con-
                   troversy, page 544.
                       The first group will rise from their graves at the coming of
                    Christ and reign with Him for a thousand years. This is the first
                    resurrection. When the thousand years are over, the second
                    resurrection will take place. Then the wicked will be raised
                    and appear before God for the execution of "the judgment writ-
                   ten."
                      What illustrations does Paul give of the resurrection?
                   1 Cor. 15:35-44.

                       We have to watch for two dangers. One is that we spiritual-
                   ize the Biblical notion of a literal and bodily resurrection. The
                   other is that we lose ourselves in a materialistic view of the
                   resurrection that focuses on the question, In what kind of body?
                   To these the apostle Paul says, "How foolish."
                       The certainty of a literal, bodily resurrection lies in the very
                   resurrection of Jesus. He was not a ghost, but a real person of
                   "flesh and bones." Luke 24:36-43.
                       The earthly being must be given a heavenly body and im-
                   mortality. But he remains the same person, just as Jesus said
                   of Himself after His resurrection. See Luke 24:38, 39. People
                    will recognize each other in the same way as the disciples rec-
                   ognized their Lord.

THINK IT THROUGH       What really is the joy of the resurrection?
                       "Here they stand, and the finishing touch of immortality is
                    put upon them, and they go up to meet their Lord in the air.
                    The gates of the city of God swing back upon their hinges, and
                    the nations that have kept the truth enter in. . . . Christ bids
                    them welcome and puts upon them His benediction: 'Well done,
                    thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into the joy of
                    thy Lord.' What is that joy? He sees of the travail of His soul,
                    and is satisfied."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

           Part 5      "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
     GOD ALONE IS   wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
                    1 Tim. 1:17.
       IMMORTAL

                       The word "immortal" is used only twice in the Scriptures.
                    In both instances, the word refers to God. The redeemed re-
                    ceive immortality at the resurrection, and it is a gift of Jesus
                    Christ. In no instance are the terms connected with the present
                    nature of man, or with a part of man. Right from the beginning,
                    as Genesis 2:17 indicates, man was created a mortal being. He
                    has no life in himself. He exists only by the life God gave him.

                       How can man share in the immortality of God? 2 Tim. 1:9,
                    10; 1 Cor. 15:50-54. See also John 3:16, 17.


                        In the Scriptures immortality—that is, the complete freedom
                     from death—is made possible only through the life and death
                     of our Lord Jesus Christ. Throughout all eternity it remains a
                     gift of God, based on the work of Christ. All who believe in
                     Him can be sure of the everlasting life, offered man through
                     grace. Those who reject Him who is the Resurrection and the
                     Life will perish and be no more. The choice between life and
                     death, between immortality and nothingness, is made possible
                     through Christ. Without Him man is doomed to annihilation.
                        Jesus' words on "eternal life" as a gift that comes to the
                     believer in his earthly existence must be taken with utter seri-
                    ousness. Jesus recognized that such words as "Whosoever
                    liveth and believeth in me shall never die" (John 11:26) seemed
                    unbelievable to man, and He therefore added the question,
                    "Believest thou this?" Knowing Christ and Him who sent Him
                    is to participate in everlasting life. John 17:3. With the resur-
                    rection of Christ, the eternal life has already begun in everyone
                    who wholeheartedly accepts Him. We may fall asleep; but this
                    is not final, says the Bible. 1 Thess. 4:14. This is not a euphe-
                    mism, as with the Jews and the Greeks. It is a reality to the be-
                    lieving Christian. Let us be careful that we don't react to this
                    Biblical testimony as the Jews did in Jesus' days; they laughed
                    at Him (Mark 5:39, 40) and declared that He was possessed.
                    John 8:52. But Jesus' words are truth; He is the Resurrection
                    and the Life. To the one who believes in Him, eternal life has
                    already begun; the kingdom is his.

        Part 6        "As Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of
    A NEW LIFE     the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
                   "Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no
                   more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he
                   died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth
                   unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
                   indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
                   Lord." Rom. 6:4, 9-11.


                      How does Jesus' resurrection affect our lives now? Rom.
                   6:1-11; 8:11-17; Col. 3:1-4.


                       Baptism is a sign not only of our death to sin and the wash-
                   ing away of our guilt, but also of a new birth in which the new
                   man lives a life in perfect union with God. It means a re-crea-
                   tion of the image of God in man.
                       "Christ made baptism the entrance to His spiritual king-
                   dom.. . . Those who receive the ordinance of baptism thereby
                   make a public declaration that they have renounced the world,
                   and have become members of the royal family, children of the
                   heavenly king.
                       "Those who do this are to make all worldly considerations
                   secondary to their new relations. Publicly they have declared
                   that they will no longer live in pride and self-indulgence. Christ
                   enjoins those who receive this ordinance to remember that
                   they are bound by a solemn covenant to live to the Lord. They
                   are to use for Him all their entrusted capabilities, never losing
                   the realization that they bear God's sign of obedience to the
                   Sabbath of the fourth commandment, that they are subjects of
                   Christ's kingdom, partakers of the divine nature."—Ellen G.

                      " `If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which
                   are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.'
                      "Let those who received the imprint of God by baptism
                   heed these words, remembering that upon them the Lord has

The                                                                June 15-21




Imasc of God
QcAorcd
  "And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things,
which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world
began." Acts 3:20, 21.
   To understand fully what is meant by restitution or restoration (NEB) one has
to keep in mind five questions: (1) What is it that has to be restored? (2) What
caused the distortion? (3) What were the effects of the marring? (4) By what
means is restoration to be achieved? (5) What are the effects of the work of
restoration?
   From the previous lessons the following insights clearly emerge: Sin has
caused a break between man and God, between man and his fellowmen, be-
tween man and the rest of God's creation, and has distorted the wholeness of
man's heart, soul, body, and spirit. Sin emerged as an attack on the govern-
ment of God, its laws, and its principles. This means that restoration implies
the vindication of God's government, His righteousness, and the principles and
laws upon which His government is based—love, freedom, obedience, and
justice. Restoration implies also a reconciliation between man and God, be-
tween man and his fellowmen, between man and the rest of God's creation,
and the restoration of man's wholeness.
    The restoration of the image of God in man is both an event of the future
as well as an experience man can have today. The Biblical message of the
nature and the destiny of man is one that gives hope for the future, as well as
one that speaks of the restoration of man's high calling and status today. The
restoration of the image of God in man is a promise as well as a fulfillment,
a possibility as well as an actuality. For "the very essence of the gospel is
 restoration."—The Desire of Ages, page 824.
    Let us pray and believe and work that soon the image of Jesus may be fully
 restored in us, and we may soon see Him.

          Part 1       "The plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper
  GOD'S CHARAC-    purpose than the salvation of man. It was not for this alone
                   that Christ came to the earth; it was not merely that the in-
 TER VINDICATED    habitants of this little world might regard the law of God as it
                   should be regarded; but it was to vindicate the character of
                   God before the universe. . . . The act of Christ in dying for the
                   salvation of man would not only make heaven accessible to
                   men, but before all the universe it would justify God and His
                   Son in their dealing with the rebellion of Satan. It would estab-
                   lish the perpetuity of the law of God and would reveal the
                   nature and the results of sin."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
                   68, 69. (Emphasis supplied.)

                       "From the very beginning of the great controversy in heaven
                   it has been Satan's purpose to overthrow the law of God."—The
                   Great Controversy, page 582.
                       "He [Jesus] gave His life as a sacrifice, not to destroy God's
                   law, not to create a lower standard, but that justice might be
                   maintained, that the law might be shown to be immutable, that
                   it might stand fast forever."—Christ's Object Lessons, page
                   314.
                     What event began the restoration of God's government
                   and the vindication of His laws? Eph. 1:19-23; Rev. 12:9, 10.

                      "When Christ died, the destruction of Satan was made cer-
                   tain. . . . The very fact that Christ bore the penalty of man's
                   transgression is a mighty argument to all created intelligences
                   that the law is changeless; that God is righteous, merciful, and
                   self-denying; and that infinite justice and mercy unite in the
                   administration of His government."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

                   and the death of Jesus Christ, what is the meaning of our
                   prayer and expectation, "Thy kingdom come"?

                       "The warfare against God's law . . . will be continued until
                   the end of time. Every man will be tested. Obedience or dis-
                   obedience is the question to be decided by the whole world.
                   All will be called to choose between the law of God and the
                   laws of men. Here the dividing line will be drawn."—The De-

         Part 2       "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,
RECONCILIATION     not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed
                   unto us the word of reconciliation. . . . For he hath made him
                   to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made
                   the righteousness of God in him." 2 Cor. 5:19-21.
                       "Adam, in his innocence, had enjoyed open communion with
                   his Maker; but sin brought separation between God and man,
                   and the atonement of Christ alone could span the abyss and
                   make possible the communication of blessing and salvation
                   from heaven to earth."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 67.
                       "Reconciliation means that every barrier between the soul
                   and God is removed, and that the sinner realizes what the par-
                   doning love of God means. By reason of the sacrifice made by
                   Christ for fallen men, God can justly pardon the transgressor
                   who accepts the merits of Christ."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1,
                   p. 396.
                       "Through the merit of Christ, communication has been
                   opened between God and man."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1,
                   p. 363.
                       By what means is the restoration of the relationship be-
                   tween God and man accomplished? Rom. 3:23-28; Eph. 2:4-19.
                     What is the character of the new relationship between
                   God and man? John 1:12, 13; Rom. 8:14-21.
                       When God forgives men their sins, they are then called sons
                   and daughters of God. How easily do we talk about this grace
                   of God, sing about it, and pray about it. But do we ever stop
                   to realize by what means it was made possible for God to
                   forgive sins? The forgiveness of our sins cost God the sacrifice
                   of His own Son. Do we take sin too lightly, and fail to consider
                   the cost to God? We speak of God as a gracious God. And
                   He is. But grace is a right, a privilege that was earned by
                   Christ only when he became "as one of us," "was tempted in
                   all things like we are," and went through the pain and the
                   agony of death, the wages of sin. We may never quite fully
                   understand such love by which Christ earned our grace, by
                   which we may call God "our Father." But we should never stop
                   meditating about it.
THINK IT THROUGH      What is my personal relationship to God?
                        "Forgiveness has a broader meaning than many suppose.
                   . . . God's forgiveness is not merely a judicial act by which He
                   sets us free from condemnation. It is not only forgiveness for
                   sin, but reclaiming from sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love
                    that transforms the heart."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-

The Image of God Restored LESSON 12                                       Tuesday
                                                                           June 17

         Part 3        "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond
ALL ONE PERSON     nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one
                   in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:28.

                      Sin brought about a break in the relationships between man
                   and his fellowmen. The union between husband and wife be-
                   came broken: Adam accused his wife; they felt shame for each
                   other; Eve's desire went out to her husband, and the man
                   became the master of the woman. See Gen. 3:7, 12, 16. And
                   ever since that time pride, prejudice, envy, and jealousy have
                   wrought havoc and ruin to interpersonal relationships, from
                   slavery and racial discrimination, alienation and indifference
                   toward our brother or neighbor, to estrangement in marriage.
                   In Christ these broken relationships can be healed and re-
                   stored. This restoration of the union among men does not
                   mean, as some have concluded, that now the characteristics
                   of male and female, or the identities of national or ethnic
                   groups have been abolished in Christ. No, not at all. They are
                   rather affirmed. But in Christ a new relationship has been
                   brought about between blacks and whites, the rich and the
                   poor, employees and employers, male and female. That new
                   relationship is one of equality, of togetherness, and of partner-
                   ship, as was intended before man fell into sin.

                      How is the restoration of man's relationship to his fel-
                   lowmen related to the restoration of his relationship with
                   God? Matt. 6:12-15; 18:21, 22.

                       Man's relationship to his fellowmen is not an addition to
                   his relationship with God; it is an integral part of it. Love to
                   God and love to one's fellowmen are not like two pillars; they
                   are like the two sides of one coin. Neither can exist without
                   the other. Christianity centers in the presence of Jesus in the
                   believer which results in a loving relationship with God and
                   fellowmen.
                       At the judgment not only will we find out that what we have
                   done to the least of men will be accounted as having been
                   done to Jesus (Matt. 25:31-46), the Lord will also ask us:
                   "Where is the flock that was given thee?" Jer. 13:20. For we
                   all are our brothers' keepers.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do my relationships with others reflect the restoration of
                   the image of God in me?

        Part 4   "1 beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold I
   POWER OVER give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and
               over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any
      NATURE means hurt you." Luke 10:18, 19.

                       Snakes, scorpions, illnesses, mental disturbances, droughts,
                   floods, passions, appetites, unholy desires and ambitions, et
                   cetera—all are evidences of the effects of sin, a broken rela-
                   tionship between man and God. The final restoration of the
                   relationship between man and God will result in a new rela-
                   tionship between man and the natural world. Some first steps
                   in this direction can take place even now.
                      What Biblical promises and evidences show that a restored
                   relationship with God gives man a whole new relationship
                   also to nature? Ex. 15:26; Acts 28:1-9; James 5:13-18.
                        When the image of God has been fully restored in man, a
                   little child will lead the young lion, an infant will play over the
                   hole of the asp, and the young child will put his hand on the
                   adder's den. See Isa. 11:6-8, RSV. And all this because the
                   land is filled with the knowledge of the Lord (verse 9), which
                   will come about when "the root of Jesse shall stand as an
                   ensign to the peoples" (verse 10).
                      What other aspects of man's existence are under his con-
                   trol when his relationship with God has been restored?
                   Rom. 8:1-13; Gal. 5:16-25.
THINK IT THROUGH      What happens to a person's nature when the relationship
                   with God is restored?
                      "The truths of God's word are not mere sentiments, but the
                   utterances of the Most High. He who makes these truths a
                   part of his life becomes in every sense a new creature. He is
                   not given new mental powers, but the darkness that through
                   ignorance and sin has clouded the understanding is removed."
                   —Counsels to Teachers, page 452.
                      "Originally man's affections were in perfect obedience to
                   God's will; but they have been perverted, misused, and de-
                   generated by disobedience. In returning to God, the inclina-
                   tions, the taste, the appetite, and the passions are brought into
                   higher, holier channels. The bias to evil is overcome through
                   man's determined effort, aided by the grace of Christ. The
                   faculties that have been warped in a wrong direction are no
                   longer misused, perverted, and misapplied. . . . The truth has
                   been accepted, has convicted the soul, transformed the char-
                   acter, and there is a purification and elevation of all the powers
                   of the being, and the God-given powers are no longer de-
                   based."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, March 1, 1887.

The Image of God Restored LESSON 12                                  ❑   Thursday
                                                                            June 19

         Part 5       "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
 A FREE PERSON     free."
                      "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
                   indeed." John 8:32, 36.
                      Man created in the image of God is free; he is free to re-
                   spond to God and to his fellowmen, free to exercise control
                   over nature, free from tendencies or inclinations that would
                   limit his freedom of choice. But this freedom rests in God, his
                   Creator. God always makes provision for man to change his
                   relation to either God or Satan. Satan is a tyrant who makes
                   provision only for change from God to Satan. Christ came to
                   restore in man the image of his Maker, and that includes the
                   restoration of freedom.
                     What is the nature of man's freedom restored in Christ?
                   Rom. 6:18, 22; 7:5, 6.
                      Christ has liberated us from the power of sin. We are no
                   longer carnal, sold under sin, having to give in to our natural
                   inclinations, jealousies, appetites, pride, ambitions, et cetera.
                   Christ has given us back the freedom from our "lower nature,"
                   and the freedom to follow Him. Because of Adam's sin, our
                   destiny was determined for us. At the cross man's power of
                   choice over his own destiny was restored. This choice deter-
                   mines whether we shall bear again the image of God or remain
                   a slave.
                      What appeal does Paul make to those who are free? Gal.
                   5:13-16.
                       Though the person whose relationship with God has been
                   restored has the capability of overcoming the power of sin
                   which acts in the flesh—that is, our minds, our feelings, our
                   desires, et cetera—the power of sin has not yet disappeared.
                   It often continues in our lives in subtle ways. But we can over-
                   come it by living in the Spirit by faith in Jesus who has set us
                   free. Gal. 2:20.
THINK IT THROUGH      How am I using my freedom?
                      "Everyone may place his will on the side of the will of God,
                   may choose to obey Him, and by thus linking himself with
                   divine agencies, he may stand where nothing can force him to
                   do evil. In every youth, every child, lies the power, by the help
                   of God, to form a character of integrity and to live a life of
                   usefulness."—Education, page 289.
                      "The truth of God will so act upon your natural tempera-
                   ment, that its transforming agency will be revealed in a changed
                   character."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, page 263.

         Part 6       "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
 AN INDIVISIBLE    God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blame-
                   less unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Thess. 5:23.
         WHOLE
                       Man is an indivisible whole, a total unit. The brokenness sin
                   caused to the image of God is therefore shown not only in the
                   weaknesses, illnesses, and death that have plagued mankind
                   since Adam, but especially in the fact that man became a dis-
                   integrated being. Philosophy and science have cut him into
                   two or three different components, such as mind and soul and
                   body. One part of man is often greatly exalted over the other
                   parts. An example of this is the almost exclusive emphasis in
                   some quarters on the development of the human mind, to the
                   neglect of the "soul" and the body. Man is then evaluated by
                   his I.Q., the grades he makes in school, and his academic
                   degrees. According to the Scripture, however, man does not
                   consist of two or three or more parts or components; he is an
                   indivisible whole, one total unit. Though this view and expe-
                   rience in man has been marred and distorted, Christ came to
                   restore man to that harmonious and well-integrated being he
                    was when he was made in the image of God. "As the sacrifice
                    in our behalf was complete, so our restoration from the defile-
                    ment of sin is to be complete."—The Ministry of Healing, page
                   451.
                      What did Jesus teach about the wholeness of man? Mark
                   12:30-34.

                      "The love which Christ diffuses through the whole being
                   is a vitalizing power. Every vital part—the brain, the heart,
                   the nerves—it touches with healing."—Ministry of Healing,

THINK IT THROUGH     The holiness of man consists in his wholeness. See "The
                   Desire of Ages," page 556.

                       "Through sin the divine likeness was marred, and well-nigh
                   obliterated. Man's physical powers were weakened, his mental
                   capacity was lessened, his spiritual vision dimmed. He had
                   become subject to death. Yet the race was not left without
                   hope. By infinite love and mercy the plan of salvation had been
                   devised, and a life of probation was granted. To restore in man
                   the image of his Maker, to bring him back to the perfection in
                   which he was created, to promote the development of body,
                   mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in his creation might
                   be realized—this was to be the work of redemption. This is
                   . . . the great object of life."—Education, pages 15, 16.

                                                                    June 22-28



  "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are
passed away; behold, all things are become new." 2 Cor. 5:17.

    The restoration of the image of God in man is both an actual reality and an
unrealized aim. Our relationship with God has been restored; yet why do we
continue in sin? Why do we lack power to overcome? Why do we not have the
love and faith and works that go with such a restored relationship?
     What this means is that the restoration of the image of God in man is both
a reality and a challenge to achieve it more fully; it has been accomplished
once, and it is at the same time a continuing process. By the gift of God's grace
the image of God has verily been restored in us, but we must continue to co-
operate with God to receive it more fully and to keep it.
     This dual aspect of the restoration of the image of God in man creates a
tension. It is the same tension we experience also between the salvation al-
ready received in Christ and the one yet to be received; between the kingdom
of God that God has already established in us and around us and the kingdom
that Christ will establish when He returns in great glory. But it is a creative
 tension. The more we already reflect the image of God, the harder we will work
 to possess it fully and to demonstrate its effects on our lives and those of
 others. But let us make no mistake here. The sanctified life and the perfecting
 of our character are not the work of man, but of God. He has created in us a
 new heart, a new mind, and a new spirit. He has reconciled us to Himself, in
 Jesus Christ our Lord. All we can do is to acknowledge that fact and accept
 it by faith. The more we realize what great work Christ has wrought for us, and
 in us, the more we desire to become like Him. That is our work, even though
 that desire itself comes from God, who inspires us both to will and to work for
 His own chosen purpose. See Phil. 2:13.
     As a people living under the judgment and preparing for the coming of
 Christ, we are urged to afflict our souls "by repentance of sin and humiliation
  before the Lord, lest . . . [we] be cut off. . . . There must be deep, faithful
 searching of heart. . . . Everyone must be tested, and found without spot or
  wrinkle or any such thing. . . .
     "At this time above all others it behooves every soul to heed the Saviour's
  admonition: 'Watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.' Mark 13:33."
 —The Great Controversy, page 490.
     The restoration of the image of God in man is intimately related to the work
  of judgment and the coming of Christ. May this last lesson help us to acquire
  more fully the restoration of the image of God in us so that Christ may soon
  come.

                                                                       June 22

        Part 1        "But now you must yourselves lay aside all anger, passion,
 A NEW NATURE    malice, cursing, filthy talk—have done with them! Stop lying
                 to one another, now that you have discarded the old nature
                 with its deeds and have put on the new nature, which is
                 being constantly renewed in the image of its Creator and
                 brought to know God." Col. 3:8-10, NEB.
                     Two aspects of the restoration of the image of God in man
                 stand out very clearly in this text. First, the change that makes
                 possible the restoration of the image of God in man, on the
                 one hand, is a one-time act, brought about by Christ. On the
                 other hand, it is a continuing process. The change that oc-
                 curred once is "being constantly renewed in the image of its
                 Creator."
                     The second aspect of the restoration of the image of God
                 in man is that it is not an event or an experience that takes
                 place without some form of human involvement. In the text
                 (Col. 3:8-10) human activity stands out very clearly from such
                 expressions as: "Lay aside," "have done withi" "stop lying,"
                 "discard," "put on," et cetera. The renewal of our nature into
                 the image of God is based on the fact that Christ has already
                 begun His work in us. We cooperate with Christ in remaking
                 us in the image of God. The restoration of the image of God
                 in man does not take place without human involvement. We
                 must want to be changed, desire to have a new nature, let
                 Christ work in us and live in us. But even that desire is created
                 by God, so that the new man is a creation of God, created out
                 of nothing.
                     How does man acquire the new nature? Rom. 13:12, 14;
                 Eph. 4:24.
                     The key term is "to put on." But the new nature, compared
                 here with a garment, is not put on over the old one. The new
                 nature is not a cover. The restoration of the image of God in
                 man is an exchange of natures. In fact, in the words of the
                 apostle Paul, the old nature is crucified with Christ and buried,
                 and the new nature is a new creation that has come to life
                 by the Word of God.
THINK IT THROUGH     Am I constantly renewed in the image of God? In what
                 ways am I not?
                     "Those who are indeed purifying their souls by obeying the
                 truth will have a most humble opinion of themselves. The more
                 closely they view the spotless character of Christ, the stronger
                 will be their desire to be conformed to His image, and the less
                 will they see of purity or holiness in themselves. But while we
                 should realize our sinful condition, we are to rely upon Christ
                 as our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption."

A New Creature LESSON '13                                            0j   Monday
                                                                          June 23

        Part 2         What are some characteristics of the new being, re-created
   A HOLY LIFE     in the image of God?

                      "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is
                   created in righteousness and true holiness. Wherefore put-
                   ting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour:
                   for we are members one of another." Eph. 4:24, 25.

                      The characteristics of the person who is re-created in the
                   image of God are the character of Jesus Christ. The life of
                   Christ was characterized by a union with God, on whom His
                   whole life and person depended, and by love for His fellowmen,
                   for whom He sacrificed Himself. Christ invites us to follow Him.
                       What power has God made available to men to live a holy
                   life? 2 Thess. 2:13, 14. See also Acts 10:38.
                      "In the plan of restoring in men the divine image, it was
                   provided that the Holy Spirit should move upon human minds,
                   and be as the presence of Christ, a molding agency upon hu-
                   man character."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Feb. 12,
                   1895.
                      Can a person re-created in the image of God avoid sin-
                   ning? 1 John 3:5, 6.

                      Each child of God is called to be pure, as Christ is pure. As
                   His child we will be able to say No to sin. Sin has put its mark
                   on us; but, re-created in God's image through Christ our Lord,
                   we should stop committing sins. "We need not retain one sinful
                   propensity....
                      "As we partake of the divine nature, hereditary and culti-
                   vated tendencies to wrong are cut away from the character,
                   and we are made a living power for good."—Ellen G. White
                   Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 943.

THINK IT THROUGH      How does the restoration of the image of God in man
                   relate to the coming of Christ?
                      "Are we striving with all our power to attain to the stature
                   of men and women in Christ? Are we seeking for His fullness,
                   ever pressing toward the mark set before us—the perfection
                   of His character? When the Lord's people reach this mark,
                   they will be sealed in their foreheads. Filled with the Spirit,
                   they will be complete in Christ, and the recording angel will
                   declare, 'It is finished.' "—Our High Calling, page 150.

      OF CHRIST

                      The heart of the Pauline teaching on the new life is that the
                   believer is a part of Jesus Christ.
                      The apostle Paul uses the term "body of Christ" in his
                   epistles to four different churches. The new creature is united
                   to the person and the life of Jesus Christ. It does not mean
                   primarily that the person belongs to a body of believers, as the
                   term has been interpreted later. What counts primarily is that
                   the new creature is spiritually linked with Christ. His fellowship
                   with others is a result of that union, not the other way around.
                   Notice that the Bible speaks of that union with Christ as being
                   "one flesh," much the same as husband and wife are one
                   flesh. See 2 Cor. 11:2; 1 Cor. 6:15-20; Eph. 5:22-32.

                     How does a person become—and remain—a part of the
                   body of Christ? Rom. 6:3-11; 1 Cor. 11:24-32.



                      Christ Himself instructed His followers to be baptized as a
                   sign of the new life with Him. Mark 16:15, 16. And Christ Him-
                   self, likewise, instituted the sacred ordinance of the Lord's
                   Supper to nurture that holy union with Him. Participation in the
                   Lord's Supper aids the new creature in remaining part of the
                   very life and personality of the risen Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH      How is benefit gained from the Lord's Supper? See Further
                   Study reference.



                      "When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united
                   with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind becomes
                   one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to
                   Him; we live His life. This is what it means to be clothed with
                   the garment of His righteousness."—Christ's Object Lessons,

                                                                        June 25

        Part 4         "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in
   FELLOWSHIP      darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the
                   light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with an-
  WITH OTHERS      other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
                   all sin." 1 John 1:6, 7.

                       Participation in the body of Christ means also participation
                   in the life of other people. The closer one comes to Christ, the
                   closer one also grows in fellowship with others. If a person
                   says, I am in Christ, and lives a life in isolation from others, he
                   deceives himself and others. The meaning of fellowship, how-
                   ever, is not that as individuals we have relationships with oth-
                   ers, but a life in communion with others.
                      What is the nature of our fellowship with others? 1 John
                   4:7-12, 20, 21.

                      There is an indissoluble connection between the restoration
                   of man's union with God and love toward others. As the apostle
                   Peter says, "Now that by obedience to the truth you have puri-
                   fied your souls until you feel sincere affection towards your
                   brother Christians, love one another whole-heartedly with all
                   your strength." 1 Peter 1:22, NEB.

                     How all-inclusive is this love for our fellowmen to be?
                   Matt. 5:38-48. See also Acts 7:60.

                      The restoration of the image of God shows itself in a per-
                   son's attitude toward others. Following Christ's example, the
                   new creature is to relate to others as God has related to us.
                   The love of Christ that compels us has nothing to do with the
                   question whether the other person arouses affection in me or
                   not. To love him—as Christ loved us—means this: to be for
                   him and not against him, to help him, to forgive him, to do
                   good and not evil to him. It is obvious that such a love is not
                   spontaneously generated in us. It is a gift of God, who re-cre-
                   ates us in His own image.

THINK IT THROUGH      Meditate on 1 Corinthians 13.

                       "Love is the evidence of . . . discipleship. 'By this shall all
                   men know that ye are My disciples,' said Jesus, `if ye have
                   love one to another.' When men are bound together, not by
                   force or self-interest, but by love, they show the working of an
                   influence that is above every human influence. Where this
                   oneness exists, it is evidence that the image of God is being
                   restored in humanity, that a new principle of life has been im-
                   planted."—The Desire of Ages, page 678. (Emphasis supplied.)

         Part 5   "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:
   AN AMBASSA- old things are passed away, behold, all things are become
                new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to
   DOR FOR GOD himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
                   reconciliation." 2 Cor. 5:17, 18.

                      Anyone who is united to Christ is also united to the work
                   of Christ, "for the love of Christ controls us." 2 Cor. 5:14, RSV.
                      What did Jesus commission His followers to do? Matt.
                   28:18-20.

                      "The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the
                   believers. It includes all the believers in Christ to the end of
                   time. . . . For this work the church was established, and all
                   who take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged
                   to be co-workers with Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 822.

                       By what means is the mission of the new creature accom-
                   plished? Mark 16:15-20.

                      Mission consists of proclamation (evangelism, teaching), ser-
                   vice (healing, helping, education, et cetera) and communion
                   (church, worship, fellowship). Proclamation without service and
                   communion is like "sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal." To
                   have service and communion without proclaiming the Word
                   of God with clarity and conviction is like giving a pain reliever
                   to a person who needs surgery. It is, in fact, not a service at all.
                      What is the relationship between mission and the restora-
                   tion of the image of God in man? 2 Cor. 5:18 through 6:2.

                        "Millions upon millions have never so much as heard of God
                   or of His love revealed in Christ. It is their right to receive this
                   knowledge. They have an equal claim with us in the Saviour's
                   mercy. And it rests with us who have received the knowledge
                   . . . to answer their cry."—Education, page 263.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why can only the person in whom the image of God has
                   been restored be a good missionary?

                       "As Christ is the channel for the revelation of the Father, so
                   we are to be the channel for the revelation of Christ. . . . The
                   church of Christ, every individual disciple of the Master, is
                   heaven's appointed channel for the revelation of God to men.
                   Angels of glory wait to communicate through you heaven's
                   light and power to souls that are ready to perish."—Thoughts

A New Creature LESSON 13                                                  ❑ Friday
                                                                            June 27

        Part 6  In view of salvation, what elements should the Christian's
     AWAITING manner of life include?
     THE LORD   "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath ap-
                   peared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and
                   worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly,
                   in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the
                   glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
                   Christ." Titus 2:11-13.

                      When Adam sinned, he hid himself from God. That attitude
                   is characteristic of all people who do not bear the image
                   of God. And worse: Some scoff at the idea that the coming of
                   Christ is at hand. 2 Peter 3:3, 4. The more we bear the image of
                   our Maker, the stronger will be the desire to be wholly united
                   with Him and to know Him as we have been known.
                      In six parables Jesus emphasized the importance of readi-
                   ness and watchfulness: the porter (Mark 13:34-37), the master
                   of the house (Matt. 24:43, 44), the faithful and unfaithful ser-
                   vants (Matt. 24:45-51), the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1-13), the talents
                   (Matt. 25:14-30) and the sheep and the goats (Matt. 25:31-46).

                      How is Christ preparing the world today for His return to
                   earth? Rev. 14:6, 7.

                      "At the time appointed for the judgment—the close of the
                   2300 days, in 1844—began the work of investigation and blot-
                   ting out of sins. . . . Both the living and the dead are to be
                   judged 'out of those things which were written in the books,
                   according to their works.'
                      "Sins that have not been repented of and forsaken will not
                   be pardoned and blotted out of the books of record, but will
                   stand to witness against the sinner in the day of God."
                      "Those who would share the benefits of the Saviour's media-
                   tion should permit nothing to interfere with their duty to perfect
                   holiness in the fear of God."
                      "We are now living in the great day of atonement. . . All
                   who would have their names retained in the book of life should
                   now, in the remaining days of their probation, afflict their souls
                   before God by sorrow for sin and true repentance."—The Great
                   Controversy, pages 486-490.
                      "Watch ye therefore: . . . lest coming suddenly He find you
                   sleeping." Mark 13:35, 36.

THINK IT THROUGH      What do I lack in the work of restoring God's image to be
                   ready for the judgment?

                 The Promise of Power
                   By DeWITT S. OSGOOD
                        Pastor Osgood clearly and concisely presents the Biblical teachings
                   about the Holy Spirit, the least understood member of the Godhead. In ad-
                   dition, he presents practical advice on how you can receive the power the
                   Spirit offers—power to overcome sin, power to overcome discourage-
                   ment, power to have a living Christian experience, power tote!! others of
                   Christ.                                                            $2.95




                   And Other Signposts of the Spirit
GOL                     By LESLIE HARDINGE
     Dove of Gold ipproaches the vast subject of the Holy Spirit by viewing the
  Spirit's functions through illustrations He Himself has selected as vehicles for the
  revelation of His character and work. In both the Old and the New Testament
  several carefully chosen and highly suggestive symbols—including manna, salt, oil,
  and dew—picture His activities. Dr. Hardinge outlines eighteen symbols, covering
  every aspect of the Holy Spirit's ministry.                                        $3.95

                       LATTER RAIN
                    Author Osgood continues his probing study of the work of the Holy
                Spirit, begun in his book The Promise of Power, in this carefully prepared
                book. He answers many questions about the latter rain and outlines the steps
                leading up to this exciting last-day event, predicted by Scripture. Included
                are forty-nine Ellen G. White quotations on the Holy Spirit's ministry,
                never previously released.                                             $3.95
