      Dear Fellow Believers Around the World:

     Inter-America has grown to be the second largest division in the world
     church. During the last ten years the membership has more than
     doubled--an increase of 129 percent--or a membership of about 430,000.
     The churches are literally bursting at the seams. An ever-increasing
     number of young people, comprising more than half the church member-
     ship, are knocking at the doors of our church schools, day and board-
     ing academies and colleges. Administrators are straining every nerve
     and stretching every dollar, trying to open the way for this new genera-
     tion and to prepare them for future responsibilities in the church. But
     because the financial resources of the church do not keep pace with the
     growth of the membership and the need for new facilities, Inter-America
     is looking forward to the generous offering of our faithful Sabbath
     school members around the world, to help meet its most pressing needs.

     This Thirteenth Sabbath, Caribbean Union College, located near Port-of-
     Spain, Trinidad, which suffered from two fires in 1973, is at the top of
     the list to benefit from your liberal offering, along with Andrews
     Memorial Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, the oldest hospital in Inter-
     America.

     When Andrews Memorial Hospital was first built, the work was small, but
     over the years it has helped to create a favorable climate for the preach-
     ing of the gospel. Today, Seventh-day Adventists are well respected
     there for what they do as well as for what they believe. This institu-
     tion has exerted a tremendous influence in Jamaica far in excess of its
     size, but the time has come to expand before it becomes outdated.

     We are very grateful for your contributions in the past, and we are con-
     fident that our brothers and sisters around the world will respond
     sacrificially during this Thirteenth Sabbath in answer to our urgent call.

     Yours for a liberal Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow,

      the opportunities of the Sabbath are
      invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school les-

      at the lesson scripture on Sabbath
      morning, but by careful study for the
      next week on Sabbath afternoon, with
      daily review or illustration during the
      week. Thus the lesson will become
      fixed in the memory, a treasure never
      to be wholly lost."

                          FAITH IN ACTION
                                 Introduction
    The letters known as First and Second Timothy and Titus are among the few
examples in the New Testament which describe how one generation passes on
the Christian witness to the next. Other New Testament writings, such as the
letters to the Romans or to the Galatians, emphasize the content of Christian
theology and its ethical applications. Rare, however, is the occasion in the Bible
where the nature and problems of evangelical communication are elaborated.
    Christianity is more than mental belief in unique theological doctrines; Chris-
tianity is a new way of life that has been made possible by the personal interven-
tion of God Himself into the affairs of men and women.
    But who would believe such an unthinkable thought? Only those who had
personally met such a Person and discovered that everything He said about
man's problems, his hopes and fears and weaknesses, was true. More than that,
such people would also discover that His solutions to these fears and weak-
nesses really worked and that Jesus, in fact, had the truth and everything He
said rang true. Wherever His words were relayed, from person to person, from
country to country, the same human discoveries were made. Jesus spoke the
truth about life, His solutions worked, lives were changed, the awareness of
more than human help was evident.
    But Jesus met relatively few people in Palestine during His short ministry, and
fewer yet of this circle actually discovered that He was worth trusting and obey-
ing. But those who made the discovery passed it on. They were concerned that
the facts concerning Jesus, who He was, what He said, how He lived, be kept
free from addition or subtraction. Though Jesus was no longer on earth, His
 story leaped from continent to continent. The credibility of the good news rested,
not primarily in the strange message His followers proclaimed but in their own
 personal witness of what this message had done for them. A new life-style was
 born. Love as never before imagined now motivated whole communities of
 believers. The impact was unavoidable. It forced a response. As their Lord
 predicted, the life of love became a rebuke and a judgment to those who were
 settled into their self-indulging, self-justifying ways. Alienation, ridicule, and
 finally physical harm became the common lot of Christians. How could they
 survive such unfair treatment? Those who did had learned that their Lord was
 close by, always providing the strength needed to bear any hardship.
    What we have just described is the life of faith doing what comes naturally
 for those who have learned the peace that comes from trusting and obeying their
 Lord Jesus. Such living, dynamic faith has never been needed more than it is
 today. The study of the letters to Timothy and Titus has never been more
 timely. We are living at a time when the work so nobly begun by Paul and his
 colleagues should be completed. The coming of their Lord to earth in great
 glory that they preached so convincingly is long overdue. The solution to the
 urgent problems of an unfinished task and of a delayed advent may be seen in
 the passionate concern for authentic evangelism which permeates these three
 letters which will be the source of our study during this quarter.
    Before beginning the verse-by-verse study of each book it would greatly
 assist the student in understanding the book's message if he would read the
 whole book through once, or several times, at one sitting.

                                          these two young men provided the
                                          human support that Paul, Christian-
                                          ity's greatest man of faith, needed
                                          as he planted the seeds of faith
                                          across two continents. Eventually
                                          Paul came to the place when he
                                          could die, confident that the flicker-
                                          ing lamp of faith would continue to
                                          burn brightly in the lives of second
                                          generation Christians such as his two
                                          younger colleagues. They proved
                                          that genuine faith could bridge the
                                          generation gap and keep the mean-
                                          ing of Christianity alive though its
                                          pioneers would die.

         Part 1     Under what conditions did Timothy first meet Paul?
      TIMOTHY         "But Jews came there [to Lystral from Antioch and Ica-
    MEETS PAUL   nium; and having persuaded the people, they stoned Paul
                 and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
                 But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and
                 entered the city; and on the next day he went on with Barna-
                 bas to Derbe." Acts 14:19, 20, RSV.
                      "And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was
                 there, named Timothy." Acts 16:1a, RSV.
                      Timothy, a Lystran, probably saw Paul mercilessly stoned
                 and dragged through the streets of Lystra during Paul's first
                 missionary journey. Yet, young Timothy did not flinch before
                 his neighbors while he took his position beside the bloody body
                 of his spiritual hero. Paul's miraculous recovery coupled with
                 his forgiving spirit gave authenticity to the amazing message
                 that he had been proclaiming.
                      During the approximately three years between Paul's first
                 and second visit to Lystra, the meaning of Christian faith be-
                 came a matter of personal experience for Timothy. He had
                 come to know the Lord that Paul had proclaimed. Paul left no
                 New Testament book for Timothy to read, for none had been
                 written. Timothy based his faith on the Old Testament and the
                 personal witness of an itinerant preacher who taught that God
                 had become man in Jesus Christ, and that this Jesus is alive
                 forevermore to restore power and dignity to all men through
                 His Holy Spirit.
THINK IT THROUGH      What is the real basis for Christian faith? On what does
                 Christian faith build today?
                      "Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven's chosen
                 agency for revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge
                 His grace as made known through the holy men of old; but that
                 which will be most effectual is the testimony of our own expe-
                 rience. We are witnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves
                  the working of a power that is divine. Every individual has a
                  life distinct from all others, and an experience differing essen-
                  tially from theirs. God desires that our praise shall ascend to
                 Him, marked by our own individuality. These precious acknowl-
                  edgements to the praise of the glory of His grace, when sup-
                  ported by a Christlike life, have an irresistible power that works
                  for the salvation of souls."—The Desire of Ages, page 347.
                      Timothy's faith was not the result of philosophical logic or
                  scientific evidence; he heard the voice of God talking to him
                  through Paul's witness of faith. Timothy responded to Paul and
                  through Paul to Jesus, just as Paul himself had earlier re-
                  sponded to Jesus.

Introducing Two Young Men of Faith LESSON 1                        ❑ Monday
                                                                        June 30

        Part 2        What divisions seemed likely in Timothy's home?
    TIMOTHY'S
   FAMILY LIFE        "A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish
                   woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek."
                   Acts 16:1 b, RSV.

                       "I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt
                   first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and
                   now, I am sure, dwells in you." 2 Tim. 1:5, RSV.

                      Timothy grew up in a divided home. We do not know if his
                   father ever became a Christian. We can surmise that family
                   peace was not complete even under the best of conditions as
                   long as Timothy's mother worshiped the crucified Jesus of the
                   Jews and his father, through Greek eyes, saw the whole story
                   as foolishness. "For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks
                   seek after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified, unto the
                   Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness."
                   1 Cor. 1:22, 23.
                      Timothy's experience gives hope and courage to all who find
                   themselves in a divided home—whether the Christian be a
                   parent or a child. Much credit must be given to godly Lois
                   and Eunice. They knew how to keep Jesus before Timothy as
                   a child and later as a teen-ager so that He was loved and not
                   resented.

                       What can young parents today learn from Timothy's home
                   life? 2 Tim. 3:15.

THINK IT THROUGH      What relationship do you see between a Bible-centered
                   home and a faithful teen-ager? Is there always a direct
                   cause and effect? Why? Is the Bible enough?

                      "From a child he had known the Scriptures. The piety that
                   he saw in his home life was sound and sensible. The faith of
                   his mother and his grandmother in the sacred oracles was to
                   him a constant reminder of the blessing in doing God's will.
                   The word of God was the rule by which these two godly women
                   had guided Timothy. The spiritual power of the lessons that
                   he had received from them kept him pure in speech and un-
                   sullied by the evil influences with which he was surrounded.
                   Thus his home instructors had co-operated with God in pre-
                   paring him to bear burdens."—The Acts of the Apostles, page

          Part 3      What can be said about Timothy's reputation?
      TIMOTHY'S
     CHARACTER        "He [Timothy] was well spoken of by the brethren at
                   Lystra and Iconium." Acts 16:2, RSV.

                      Paul's second missionary journey convinced him that the
                   gospel was winning the hearts of men and women wherever it
                   was preached. The need for trained workers who would nur-
                   ture the growing groups that Paul would leave behind became
                   one of the veteran apostle's chief concerns. Strong pastoral
                   leadership was needed as well as more evangelistic teams.
                      On Paul's second visit to Lystra he was encouraged by the
                   steadfastness of the young church and especially with the de-
                   velopment of young Timothy.
                       "In Timothy Paul saw one who appreciated the sacredness
                   of the work of a minister; who was not appalled at the prospect
                   of suffering and persecution; and who was willing to be taught.
                   Yet the apostle did not venture to take the responsibility of
                   giving Timothy, an untried youth, a training in the gospel min-
                   istry, without first fully satisfying himself in regard to his char-
                   acter and his past life."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 203.
                       Paul did not want any more experiences such as he had
                   with John Mark. See Acts 12:25; 13:13; 15:37-40. Youth were
                   needed to carry the burden, but he wanted young men who
                   were experienced in faith, men who had earned the respect
                   of their peers as well as older members of the community. Such
                   a young man he found in Timothy.

THINK IT THROUGH       In choosing leaders for the church, regardless of the level
                   of responsibility, what qualifications are the most important?

                       "As the lessons of the Bible are wrought into the daily life,
                   they have a deep and lasting influence upon the character.
                   These lessons Timothy learned and practiced. He had no spe-
                   cially brilliant talents, but his work was valuable because he
                   used his God-given abilities in the Master's service. His knowl-
                   edge of experimental piety distinguished him from other be-
                   lievers and gave him influence."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                   page 205.
                       Nothing can compensate for genuine faith that is recog-
                   nized alike by colleagues and by non-Christians. Platform skill,
                   persuasive eloquence, mental brilliance—all such abilities may
                   be useful and do permanent good only when used by the man
                   of faith who truly witnesses to the converting power of the Lord
                   Jesus.

         Part 4   How did Paul emphasize the influence of youthful be-

   OF TIMOTHY     "Let no one despise your youth, but set the believers an
                   example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."
                   1 Tim. 4:12, RSV.

                       From one standpoint Timothy was an untried youth. He was
                   "little more than a boy" when Paul took him as his understudy.
                   See Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7,
                   p. 918. Yet his character pattern had become well established;
                   he had satisfied Paul's investigation.
                        "In the history of Timothy are found precious lessons. He
                   was a mere lad when chosen by God as a teacher; but so fixed
                   were his principles by a correct education that he was fitted
                   for this important position. He bore his responsibilities with
                   Christlike meekness. He was faithful, steadfast, and true, and
                   Paul selected him to be his companion in labor and travel. Lest
                   Timothy should meet with slights because of his youthfulnesi,
                   Paul wrote to him, 'Let no man despise thy youth.' He could
                   safely do this, because Timothy was not self-sufficient, but con-
                   tinually sought guidance."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                   Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 915.
                        Read 1 Tim. 5:23.
                        Here is a suggestion that Timothy may not have enjoyed
                   robust health. But nevertheless Timothy plunged into the very
                   demanding life that Paul's schedule called for. Paul knew, how-
                   ever, that, unless Timothy placed a high priority on his physical
                   strength and general health habits, he would soon become use-
                   less as a leader. Mental and moral alertness are largely de-
                   pendent upon a healthy body.
                        Although some believe that Paul here advocates the moder-
                   ate use of fermented wine for medicinal purposes, others con-
                   tend that Paul refers to unfermented wine and was not likely
                   to give advice inconsistent with Scriptural warnings against in-
                   toxicating beverages. The main point to consider is that Timothy
                   needed to be reminded that optimal health was a major asset
                   in his role as a church leader.
                         Read 2 Tim. 1:7, 8.
                        Paul's admonition intimates that his young co-worker may
                   have been, by natural temperament, tilted more toward being
                   an introvert than an extrovert.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is there a particular kind of personality that God can
                   best use as a Christian worker? If so, how would you de-
                   scribe that person? What about those who don't fit the pat-
                   tern?

Introducing Two Young Men of Faith LESSON 1                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                          July 3

          Part 5    What became Timothy's clearest teaching manual on how
         PAUL'S to become a faithful pastor?
     CO-WORKER      "Now you have observed my teaching, my conduct, my
                   aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,
                   my persecutions, my sufferings, what befell me at Antioch, at
                   Iconium, and at Lystra, what persecutions I endured; yet from
                   them all the Lord rescued me." 2 Tim. 3:10, 11, RSV.

                       Four times in the two letters to Timothy (two in each) Paul
                   called him "son" (KJV) (in RSV two of these are rendered
                   "child"). Although Paul probably had no son after the flesh, his
                   relationship with Timothy seemed to compensate. The bond
                   between these two men, one in his middle forties and the other
                   yet in his teens, melded almost immediately; the mutual trust
                   developed beyond the normal co-worker cordiality.
                       Read 2 Tim. 2:2.
                      Timothy learned by watching and doing. His information was
                   not rented or second-hand, not merely academic but thoroughly
                   experiential. Truth became more than an intellectual experi-
                   ence, more than a knowing; Timothy saw what Paul had early
                   realized, that truth is a matter of doing the will of God.
                       "The great apostle often drew the younger disciple out,
                   questioning him in regard to Scripture history, and as they
                   traveled from place to place, he carefully taught him how to
                   do successful work. Both Paul and Silas, in all their association
                   with Timothy, sought to deepen the impression that had al-
                   ready been made upon his mind, of the sacred, serious nature
                   of the work of the gospel minister."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                   page 204.
THINK IT THROUGH      Does Paul's advice to Timothy, as well as His method of
                   developing his effectiveness as a soul winner, apply only to
                   young ministers? Is there any difference between the way a
                   minister witnesses to the power of the gospel and that ex-
                   pected of an ordinary church member?
                      "Christ has given to the church a sacred charge. Every
                   member should be a channel through which God can commu-
                   nicate to the world the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable
                   riches of Christ. There is nothing that the Saviour desires so
                   much as agents who will represent to the world His Spirit and
                   His character. There is nothing that the world needs so much as
                   the manifestation through humanity of the Saviour's love. All
                   heaven is waiting for men and women through whom God can
                   reveal the power of Christianity."—The Acts of the Apostles,

                                                                              July 4

        Part 6        How did Paul regard Titus?
    TITUS, THE
    OTHER SON         "To Titus, mine own son after the common faith." Titus 1:4.

                      Little is known of Titus: He is not mentioned in the book of
                   Acts. References to him in Paul's letters however indicate
                   that, like Timothy, Paul had found in Titus a remarkable young
                   man who could be trusted, not only with the doctrinal content
                   Paul had taught him, but also as a reliable co-worker. He be-
                   came the leader of the church's expansion into the area now
                   known as Yugoslavia. See 2 Tim. 4:10.
                      Read 2 Cor. 8:23, 16, 17.
                      Titus had been sent to Corinth on one of the most sensitive
                   missions ever undertaken in the Christian church. The Chris-
                   tian community in this influential port city was in great danger
                   of destroying itself and bringing doubt into the minds of many
                   regarding the genuine effectiveness of the gospel.
                       "Pride, idolatry, and sensualism were steadily increasing
                   among those [in Corinth] who had once been zealous in the
                   Christian life.
                       "As this picture was presented before him, Paul saw that
                   his worst fears were more than realized. . . . Gladly would he
                   have visited Corinth at once, had this been the wisest course
                   to pursue. But he knew that in their present condition the be-
                   lievers would not profit by his labors, and therefore he sent Titus
                   to prepare the way for a visit from himself later on."—The Acts
                   of the Apostles, pages 300, 301.
                       After sending the letter and Titus, Paul could only hope for
                   the best. As time passed and not hearing from Corinth or Titus,
                   Paul left for Troas on his way to Macedonia, hoping to find
                   Titus. "I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus
                   my brother." 2 Cor. 2:13.
                      Read 2 Cor. 7:6, 7.
                      This remarkable incident tells us much about Titus. He was
                   young but effective. He was a bridge builder and not one who
                   delighted in polarizing a group. He was more committed to
                   building up a program than taking advantage of misunderstand-
                   ings between a leader and his followers. Titus could have
                   subtly alienated Corinth from Paul and built himself up as a
                   more understanding, up-to-date leader. If Titus had not been
                   a man of faith, the situation at Corinth could possibly have
                   become a complete disaster.

THINK IT THROUGH      What dangers does a conciliator face? How differently could
                   the Corinth problem have turned out if Titus were self-serving?
                                                                                   13

                                         want to finally end up in, Paul's
                                         counsel to Timothy is very real and
                                         clear. No amount of theology under-
                                         stood, no great service record of
                                         talking about it with others, no com-

                                         and not a means to refine the char-
                                         acter until it finally reflects Jesus
                                         Himself, if an outstanding service
                                         record merely reflects human ac-
                                         tivity and enthusiasm rather than
                                         Christ's approach, the terrible mo-
                                         ment of truth will come when Jesus
                                         says, "I never knew you." Matt. 7:23.

   OF EPHESUS     "As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain
                 at Ephesus." 1 Tim. 1:3, RSV.
                     Timothy fulfilled many difficult assignments as Paul's rep-
                 resentative, but going to Ephesus was perhaps his most impor-
                 tant. He had spent more than two years in Ephesus during
                 Paul's third evangelistic tour, followed by a special assignment
                 to Corinth, some time with Paul in Greece, and then the last
                 journey to Jerusalem where Paul was arrested.
                     During the first imprisonment in Rome, Timothy remained
                 with Paul; after the release Paul and Timothy journeyed to Asia
                 Minor, with Timothy staying in Ephesus while Paul moved on.
                 Ephesus became a key base for the expansion of Christianity,
                 and a clear thinking leader was needed to consolidate the
                 work that Paul and others had developed. That Timothy was
                 accounted capable of fulfilling this assignment is eloquent
                 testimony of his ability and also unqualified vindication of
                 Paul's earlier judgment to train Timothy as his close associate.
                     Read Acts 19:26, 27.
                     Along with being one of the great commercial capitals of
                 the ancient world, Ephesus was also a center for the various
                 schools of Greek and Oriental philosophy as well as most
                 forms of pagan religion. Acts 19 refers to the great temple of
                 the goddess Diana, or Artemis, that attracted vast multitudes
                 of pilgrims and brought much wealth and fame to Ephesus.
                 Besides being the swirling center of philosophy and pagan
                 religion, Ephesus also had a strong Jewish community with
                 its teaching and influence.
                     "Ephesus was not only the most magnificent, but the most
                 corrupt, of the cities of Asia. Superstition and sensual pleasure
                 held sway over her teeming population. Under the shadow of
                 her temples, criminals of every grade found shelter, and the
                 most degrading vices flourished."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                 page 286.
THINK IT THROUGH      If you had been Paul or Timothy, how would you have be-
                 gun preaching the gospel in such a city as Ephesus? Are
                 there similar challenges today? What evangelistic approaches
                 do you think would be most effective?
                     "Those who belong to the higher ranks of society are to be

                                                                        July 7

        Part 2  What made Paul's credentials authentic?
    AUTHENTIC   "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of
  CREDENTIALS God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope."
                   1 Tim. 1:1.
                       Paul's opening words sound out a note of authority, making
                   it clear to all who would read this letter in Ephesus and else-
                   where that he was not merely writing a personal letter to
                   his old friend Timothy. After many years of watching young
                   churches develop, knowing first-hand where the unseen dan-
                   gers would be, Paul sent this very explicit pastoral letter to
                   Ephesus through its chief pastor.
                       Paul spoke forcefully, knowing to whom he owed his first
                   loyalties. Since those early days with Ananias in Damascus
                   when he first heard the call to the Christian ministry, Paul had
                   lived under the "commandment of God." In holy boldness and
                   humility he took his place with the Twelve as one of Christ
                   Jesus' special emissaries—the apostles.
                      In what way would God (the Father) be our Saviour? Is
                   Christ our hope only in the sense that He is coming again?
                   Or that He as a Person has become the ground of hope be-
                   cause of what He did as a human being?

                       All members of the Godhead have participated in the work
                   of saving mankind although they may have had different func-
                   tions. In emphasizing God as our Saviour, Paul stresses the
                   deliverance from the guilt and power of sin that the Godhead
                   provides; in emphasizing Jesus as our hope, we are reminded
                   that without God becoming incarnate in Jesus, there would be
                   no meaning to life, no reason to hope that anything could truly
                   get better. Life without hope is a depressing, suffocating ex-
                   perience.
                       The pagan world had been calling some of their chief gods
                   "Savior" for some time. Great men, such as Alexander the
                   Great, were called "Savior," as were the Roman emperors. But
                   all these applications never rose higher than the economic or
                   political spheres; only Christianity, building on the rich back-
                   ground of the Old Testament, applied the concept of Saviour to
                   the spiritual and eternal.

THINK IT THROUGH      If you were Timothy, would you have wanted Paul to
                   begin this important letter on church management any dif-
                   ferently? What responsibility would you feel if you had re-
                   ceived a letter such as this?

                     For us living in the twentieth century, this letter to Timothy
                   carries as much authority as it did to the church members at
                   Ephesus. It contains priceless guidance for the church today.

           Part 3  What is the danger of theological speculation?
       FAITH MIS-  "Nor to occupy themselves with myths and endless gene-
     UNDERSTOOD alogies which promote speculations rather than the divine
                   training that is in faith." 1 Tim. 1:4, RSV.
                       Paul moves directly to the point: anything that does not
                   lead to faith is pure waste and, worse, destructive. God designs
                   that faith should be the beginning and end of divine training.
                       Faith is a dynamic way of life—a personal relationship with
                   God wherein man cheerfully demonstrates his trust in God
                   by a life habit of obedience. He says Yes to God in prosperity
                   and adversity. Faith is the opposite of sin. A sinner is a rebel;
                   he distrusts God and does not make Him Lord of his life.
                       When the man of faith turns to his neighbor and witnesses
                   to his Lord, he begins to theologize, to explain doctrinally who
                   it is that he trusts and for what reasons. The quality of his
                   faith, his trusting, obedient relation with God, does not neces-
                   sarily depend upon how much formal theology he knows.
                       In what way can you see doctrine (or theology) becoming
                   a handicap to faith? In what way can faith make it possible
                   to understand doctrine?
                      "The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere intellectual
                   assent to the truth. He who waits for entire knowledge before
                   he will exercise faith cannot receive blessing from God. It is
                   not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in Him.
                   The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him
                   as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to our-
                   selves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a trans-
                   action by which those who receive Christ join themselves in
                   covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith
                   means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the
                   soul becomes a conquering power."—The Desire of Ages,
                   page 347.
                      Strange as it may seem, many people enjoy the bizarre, the
                   mystical, the novel, rather than the simple message of the
                   gospel. They feel they are on the "inside" when they share
                   some novel speculation, and the excitement is often misunder-
                   stood for genuine religion. Here Paul makes it clear that a mis-
                   understanding of faith can open the door to many kinds of
                   useless activity often done under the cloak of respectable
                   Christianity.
THINK IT THROUGH       Do I substitute the confidence I have in doctrine for the
                   daily confidence I should have in the empowering guidance
                   of a living Saviour?

The Purpose of Theology          LESSON 2                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       July 9

        Part 4    In what way can even Bible study become a substitute for
       AIM OF faith?
     DOCTRINE     "Whereas the aim of our charge is love that issues from a
                   pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith. Certain
                   persons by swerving from these have wandered away into
                   vain discussion." 1 Tim. 1:5, 6, RSV.

                      The aim of the Christian ministry (the "charge" given to
                   Timothy) is to present before the world a truly loving people, a
                   community of Christians that reflects the love and faith of the
                   Lord Jesus Christ. It is for this that Christ lingers.
                      "Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation
                   of Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall
                   be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to
                   claim them as His own.
                      "It is the privilege of every Christian not only to look for
                   but to hasten the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. . . . Were
                   all who profess His name bearing fruit to His glory, how
                   quickly the whole world would be sown with the seed of the
                   gospel."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 69.
                       If faith does not produce love, it is not genuine faith. So
                   Paul said: "For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth
                   any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
                   Gal. 5:6.
                      Paul's chief concern is that the gospel should make clear
                   the new kind of life possible in Christ Jesus. We have often
                   found it easier to learn doctrine than to make a life habit out
                   of truly loving others. Thus some swerve from the purpose of
                   the gospel, finding their security in knowing about the truth,
                   rather than living in the truth, loving as Christ loved.

THINK IT THROUGH      What internal connection do you see between a pure heart,
                   a good conscience, sincere faith, and love? Are they synony-
                   mous or sequential?

                      "It is contrition and faith and love that enable the soul to
                   receive wisdom from heaven. Faith working by love is the key
                   of knowledge, and everyone that loveth `knoweth God.' 1 John
                   4:7."—The Desire of Ages, page 139.
                      A good conscience depends upon the source of the infor-
                   mation that it is guided by. An ignorant conscience will not
                   produce a sincere faith any more than a sincere faith can func-
                   tion alongside an impure heart or an unintelligent conscience.
                   Faith is the key that awakens conscience, purifies the heart,
                   and prompts genuine love.

       THE LAW
                      How can a good law be misused and lead to bad religion?
                      Paul hastens to distinguish between teachers who misuse
                   the law and the law itself. Neither academic credentials, ob-
                   vious literary skills, or a wealth of information will guarantee
                   that a theologian rightly understands the law of God.
                      For example, how to apply the Ten Commandments has
                   been the point of contention between well-trained theologians
                   for centuries. Some say it applied only to the literal Jews,
                   others contend that Christians under grace are no longer under
                   the law. The problem gets even more difficult when earnest
                   Christians are deluded into thinking that outward conformance
                   to the law (a necessary and commendable objective) somehow
                   provides security and satisfies God's expectations for His
                   people.
                       Only genuine faith can rightly understand the purpose of the
                   law. The scribes and other teachers of the law in Christ's day
                   misunderstood this purpose and were rebuked by our Lord.
                   See Matt. 22:29. As Paul said in Romans 7:12, "The law is
                   holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." So he
                   reminds the church through Timothy that "the law is good."
                   The man of faith knows that without the law no man would
                   know God's will or how far man has strayed; faith says Yes
                   to whatever God has commanded because faith knows that
                   the law tells the truth about God and man.
                      What relationship is there between the law and love?

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I find it easier to keep the law than to have faith?
                   Easier to keep the law than to love? See Matt. 19:16-22.
                      It is possible to emphasize the law and become recognized
                   as commandment keepers and still miss the mark and swerve
                   from love, a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.
                   See 1 Tim. 1:5. One does not have to dismiss the law as Jewish
                   or outdated to be guilty of misusing the law.
                      "The life of Christ on earth was a perfect expression of
                   God's law, and when those who claim to be children of God
                   become Christlike in character, they will be obedient to God's
                   commandments. Then the Lord can trust them to be of the num-

        Part 6    Where do faith and love begin?
     PAUL, AN     "I thank him who has given me strength for this, . .
   EXAMPLE OF because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of
    FAITH AND our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are
               in Christ Jesus." 1 Tim. 1:12-14, RSV.
         LOVE
                     Read also 1 Tim. 1:15-17.
                     Paul was his own best illustration of what the gospel is all
                 about. He had been guilty of misunderstanding the law—not
                 as a vain speculator as some, not as others who diminished
                 the importance of the law, but as one who confused the pur-
                 pose of the law. He had trusted in external obedience and had
                 missed the spiritual intent of the law. In serving God with this
                 misguided understanding of the law, he had overlooked the
                 principle of love and mercy that God Himself was showing to
                 all men.
                     When Paul finally accepted Jesus as his Lord, he saw the
                 law in a completely new setting. Instead of a burden, it be-
                 came a friend—it showed him how much he truly needed grace.
                     Instead of viewing verses 12 to 17 as a digression, we
                 should see them as a beautiful snapshot of what the gospel
                 will do for anyone who lets the grace of God overflow in his
                 life. Gratitude for salvation, for knowing Jesus as a personal
                 Friend and Saviour, becomes as spontaneous as breathing. If
                 thankfulness does not spring forth naturally, something very
                 serious has happened to the spiritual life of a professed Chris-
                 tian.
                      Instead of his former "unbelief" (literally, "unfaith"), verse
                 13, Paul was a model of living faith (verse 14). Genuine love
                 had replaced a merciless self-righteousness that had once
                  driven a rabid bigot to kill men in the service of God. What
                  greater example could be given of the power of God in Jesus
                 Christ? If Paul could be changed, should any man doubt what
                  God could do for him?
THINK IT THROUGH       If Saul of Tarsus heard the gospel only as interpreted by
                  the teachers of the law described in verse 7, do you think
                  that there would have been Paul, the converted Pharisee?
                  What is the only appropriate response to the gospel? What
                  alone proves that Jesus indeed saves sinners?
                       "Satan had claimed that it was impossible for man to obey
                  God's commandments; and in our own strength it is true that
                  we cannot obey them. But Christ came in the form of humanity,
                  and by His perfect obedience He proved that humanity and
                  divinity combined can obey every one of God's precepts. . . .

                                                                         July 13

          Part 1   What was the source of Timothy's continued inspiration?
 PUBLIC RECOG-
    NITION AND     "This charge I commit to you, Timothy, my son, in accord-
                 ance with the prophetic utterances which pointed to you, that
 CONFIRMATION inspired by them you may wage the good warfare." 1 Tim.
                   1:18, RSV.

                      Every Christian is by definition a witness to Christ. In addi-
                   tion the church has always recognized that certain persons are
                   called to a specific work in Christian service. Such recognition
                   has usually been confirmed by public ordination.
                       Timothy had a general charge and a specific task that
                   changed frequently over the years. Paul had sent Timothy to
                   Ephesus specifically to stabilize the doctrinal foundation in a
                   time of conflict. See verse 3. While emphasizing the specific
                   assignment and how to handle it, Paul also reminded Timothy
                   of his ordination and of the ringing words of support from sea-
                   soned elders of the church.
                      Every Christian worker will have occasions when his im-
                   mediate assignment is difficult and foreboding and the fear of
                   failure seems crushing. Paul knew all this from experience and
                   here does for Timothy what he would have been grateful for
                   during some of his perplexing days. Today the young pastor,
                   like Timothy, should remember the confidence expressed in
                   being selected by wise church leaders and realize that such
                   public sanction was a recognition of basic qualifications for
                   hard duties. Thus he will often find his courage greatly strength-
                   ened and his mind cleared for fresh action.
                       "God foresaw the difficulties that His servants [Paul and
                   Barnabas] would be called to meet, and, in order that their
                   work should be above challenge, He instructed the church by
                   revelation to set them apart publicly to the work of the min-
                   istry. Their ordination was a public recognition of their divine
                   appointment to bear to the Gentiles the glad tidings of the
                   gospel....
                       "It was an acknowledged form of designation to an ap-
                   pointed office and a recognition of one's authority in that of-
                   fice."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 161, 162.

THINK IT THROUGH      Have you fulfilled the expectations of those who had much
                   confidence in your abilities to serve Jesus in a specific man-
                   ner? What can you yet do to recover lost opportunities or to
                   assure yourself and the Lord that you will be prepared for
                   the next opportunity to lead someone heavenward?

                                                                            July 14

        Part 2     What are the two weapons that guarantee the Christian's
 RELATIONSHIP victory over evil?
     BETWEEN       "This charge I commit to you, Timothy, my son, . . . that
    FAITH AND . . . you may wage the good warfare, holding faith and a
  CONSCIENCE good conscience." 1 Tim. 1:18, 19a, RSV.
                       Paul states that living, genuine faith and a good conscience
                   rests firmly on the conviction that God has spoken through
                   inspired men (verses 18, 19). Faith is not built on human logic
                   or philosophy; conscience is not safe or consistent if it gets
                   its directions from human reasoning or feeling.
                       Conscience enables a person to pass judgment on his own
                   acts or thoughts, but it acts only according to the light it has.
                   This inner moral monitor is only as dependable as the stan-
                   dards it sets up for itself. Thus a conscience can be over-
                   scrupulous (1 Cor. 10:25) or seared by abuse (1 Tim. 4:2).
                       The man of faith admits the truth about himself and God
                   when he confesses that he is the rebel and wants forgiveness.
                   Those who do not admit themselves to be rebels do not ac-
                   knowledge Jesus as Lord. Thus their understanding of truth
                   is profoundly distorted. Such distortion directly affects the
                   quality of conscience. The conscience can be no sharper and
                   safer than the information it calls truth.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is it possible for two people to look at and hear the very
                   same truth and yet for only one to respond in faith? What
                   keeps the other person from faith when the information re-
                   ceived is equal?
                      "God does not conceal His truth from men. By their own
                   course of action they make it obscure to themselves. Christ
                   gave the Jewish people abundant evidence that He was the
                   Messiah; but His teaching called for a decided change in their
                   lives. They saw that if they received Christ, they must give up
                   their cherished maxims and traditions, their selfish, ungodly
                   practices. It required a sacrifice to receive changeless, eternal
                   truth. Therefore they would not admit the most conclusive
                   evidence that God could give to establish faith in Christ."—
                   Christ's Object Lessons, page 105.
                       It is impossible to have a seared or bad conscience if one
                   has genuine faith. The conscience of a man of faith may be
                   immature and need enlightenment (Rom. 14:22, 23); yet it must
                   not be violated even though it may need education. The man
                   of faith makes a life habit out of knowing as much about God
                   and himself as is humanly possible under the help of God. Such
                   faith is the only guarantee that the conscience is rightly direct-
                   ing the Christian.

        Part 3        What erosion usually precedes the collapse of faith?
  HOW TO SHIP-
  WRECK FAITH        "By rejecting conscience, certain persons have made ship-
                   wreck of their faith." 1 Tim. 1:19, RSV.

                      In verse 18 Paul uses the analogy of strategic warfare as
                   the original language suggests. In verse 19 Paul uses another
                   graphic metaphor, that of the shipwrecked vessel.
                      Hymenaeus and Alexander (verse 20) were leaders among
                   those who were teaching strange doctrine and confusing the
                   Ephesian church regarding the real aim of the Christian gos-
                   pel. Paul struck at the heart of the problem when he noted
                   that the faulty concience precedes a shipwrecked faith.
                      This sequence is as old as the apostolic church and as fresh
                   as tomorrow. It is a pity but true that those who "thrust away"
                   or "reject" a good conscience find things divine less and less
                   appealing. In fact, justifying excuses pampers the indulged
                   conscience, and a strange blindness sweeps over the soul until
                   the blinded one no longer sees or lives in reality.
                      "The Lord requires us to obey the voice of duty, when
                   there are other voices all around us urging us to pursue an
                   opposite course. It requires earnest attention from us to dis-
                   tinguish the voice which speaks from God. We must resist and
                   conquer inclination, and obey the voice of conscience without
                   parleying or compromise, lest its prompting cease and will and
                   impulse control. The word of the Lord comes to us all who have
                   not resisted His Spirit by determining not to hear and obey....
                      "Let no man flatter himself that he is a successful man
                   unless he preserves the integrity of his conscience, giving
                   himself wholly to the truth and to God."—Testimonies, Vol. 5,
                   pp. 69, 70.

THINK IT THROUGH      Have you noticed in your own life the subtle connection
                   between a compromised conscience and a fading faith? Have
                   you also noticed that peace of mind and heart return only
                   when you have squared your life habits with the will of God,
                   regardless of earthly consequences?

                      Compromise does not always involve gross sins; it may
                   easily be cloaked with the approval of one's peers. Pride of
                   education and superior skills, pride of popularity, desire to
                   please those who are in power—all such unseen drives can
                   argue a good conscience into a self-serving one. The end of
                   such compromise is a shipwrecked faith that no longer hears
                   the voice of God in either the Bible or conscience.

                       In this second chapter Paul begins his specific counsel re-
                   garding matters that needed emphasis in Ephesus and perhaps
                   in all the young churches: (1) the importance of intelligent
                   prayer (verses 1-8); (2) the part women were to take in public
                   worship (verses 9-15).
                       When small in numbers and misunderstood, Christians in
                   any age have found it easy to feel detached from the larger
                   world about them. But Paul attacked this natural inclination to
                   withdraw from civic responsibilities. Especially in public wor-
                   ship, Christians are consciously to recognize their involvement
                   with all men, high and low. Christianity was to enlighten pro-
                   vincial attitudes and to strengthen civil cooperation wherever
                   such could be done in good conscience.
                       Public prayer was to include petitions, intercessions, and
                   thanksgiving for all men; all men needed the moral lifting
                   power of Christians. To pray for another is the first step in
                   recognizing another's need and how it can be cared for. Inclu-
                   siveness in public prayer would keep the face of the church
                   turned toward the world.
                       But what may have been surprising was Paul's counsel to
                   pray for Nero and other government leaders who had made life
                   difficult for the early Christians. If Paul commanded early Chris-
                    tians to pray for such a despot, surely no leader of any govern-
                   ment is beyond the circle of Christian sympathy and interces-
                   sion.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is Paul's reason for prayer offered on behalf of public offi-
                   cials basically selfish? If not, what would be the desired
                   result of such prayers?

                      We are reminded of Paul's counsel in Romans 13. Christians
                   are not to be known as unpatriotic; that is, they should always
                   be working to support the common good and not be identified
                   with any particular political faction.
                      "We are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether
                   spoken or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place
                   ourselves on record as uttering that which would make us ap-
                   pear antagonistic to law and order. We are not to say or do
                   anything that would unnecessarily close up our way."—The

        Part 5  Why should Christians pray for all men everywhere?
   MOTIVATION   "This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our
 FOR MISSIONS Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the
                   knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and there is
                   one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
                   who gave himself as a ransom for all." 1 Tim. 2:3-6, RSV.

                      The instruction already given in this chapter was given
                   for two reasons: (1) it would reflect how God has always re-
                   lated to all men; (2) such open concern for the welfare of all
                   men, regardless of their rank or race, was the only way that
                   Christians could please God and do His bidding.
                      Neither prayer nor church activity in general should be lim-
                   ited to personal interests. The Christian is global in thought
                   and act; he does not interest himself in only part of mankind
                   any more than his Lord limited Himself to only a segment of
                   mankind.
                      Salvation is not limited by God's willingness but by man's
                   reluctance "to come to the knowledge of the truth." Coming
                   to "the knowledge of the truth" is the act of faith. Accepting
                   "the truth" means that a person recognizes the fact that he
                   is a sinner, that he needs divine forgiveness and help, that he
                   finds such in accepting Jesus as the Lord of his life, and that
                   obedience to truth is hereafter his chief goal in life.

                      What fundamental fact makes Christianity unique and not
                   just another useful religion among many others? Verse 5.

                      Probably the most awesome thought expressed in the history
                   of man is here reaffirmed by Paul: "There is one God." But
                   even more than that: "There is one mediator between God and
                   men, the man Christ Jesus." Other religions have emphasized
                   monotheism (the oneness of God), but no other religion has
                   developed the concept of a God-man mediator, historically
                   manifested.
                      Can a more beautiful, moving, powerful thought be uttered
                   and contemplated? God, for man's sake, laid aside the security
                   of divine rights and became man in order that He could speak
                   and act in terms that man could understand. Jesus revealed
                   to mankind how God still thought about sinners and what He
                   desired to do for them, if they would only be willing to co-
                   operate with Him.

THINK IT THROUGH       How is the Christian church to convey to the world today
                   this magnificent truth about God who became Man and make
                   it convincing? Would merely telling this story be enough?

                 . . . if she continues in faith and love and holiness, with
                 modesty." 1 Tim. 2:8-15, RSV.

                     After giving his counsel regarding the universal scope of
                   public worship in the Christian congregation, Paul now em-
                   phasizes the spirit and behavior of the worshipers. Paul was
                   speaking to specific problems that emerged in these emerging
                   churches: (1) the need for order and purpose, and (2) the
                   need to reduce misunderstanding regarding the. new role for
                   women that Paul encouraged at a time when such freedoms
                   would have been greatly misinterpreted by the general public.

                      Is Paul more interested in the posture of prayer or the
                   spirit in the one who prays? Verse 8.

                      The Ephesus congregation apparently had a number of mem-
                   bers who wanted the privilege of being spiritual leaders but
                   were more interested in public recognition of their leadership
                   skills than in the spirit of the gospel they tried to teach. They
                   misunderstood the central feature of Christianity.

                      Why do you think Paul was so explicit in his counsel re-
                   garding women in public worship?

                      In Paul's day the rights of women, both private and public,
                   were, relatively speaking, nonexistent. Perhaps no one man
                   or group of men has surpassed Paul in radically altering the
                   status of women. His writings have fostered the emancipation
                   of women in securing social, civil, and political rights.
                      But Paul knew the dangers of misunderstanding in a day
                   when women of ill repute were easily identified by both their
                   extravagant adornment and cosmetics on one hand, and their
                   public assertiveness on the other. Paul expected that the sim-
                   ple principles of the gospel that cut through all self-indulgence
                   and self-assertiveness would be clearly manifested in both
                   Christian men and women.

     HOLD OF GOD structions to you so that, if I am delayed, you may know how
                   one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the
                   church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth."
                   1 Tim. 3:14, 15,115V.

                      Here Paul gives his reason for writing not only the specific
                   instructions regarding elders and deacons but also the gen-
                   eral summary of his important teachings that we now call
                   1 Timothy.
                      Paul planned to visit Timothy in Ephesus soon. But knowing
                   the uncertainty of travel and other hazards, Paul wanted to be
                   certain that Timothy had in his hands authoritative guidelines
                   for the organization of the Ephesians into a model church for
                   Asia Minor. Every church since has had the privilege of check-
                   ing its own procedures against the inspired instruction given by
                   Paul.
                      The church is not a human institution even though it must
                   be humanly administered. This fact has been hard to remember
                   for many innovators throughout the history of the church. Even
                   though the church is a living fellowship, organized by and for
                   the general welfare of its members, it is also the "pillar and
                   bulwark of the truth."
                      What relationship exists between the behavior of Chris-
                   tians and the fact that they are to function as the "pillar and
                   bulwark of the truth"? Verse 15.
                      Worshiping and representing a living God requires a living
                   dynamic faith that is easily distinguished from the anxious, self-
                   indulging men and women living without Christ. The Christian
                   church has more assigned to it than merely to proclaim infor-
                   mation—even if that information were without error. To be
                   the "bulwark" or the buttress of the truth means that truth is
                   believable only when the lives of the professing church mem-
                   bers back up and clearly give visible structure to the word
                   that is preached.
                      The central truth of the gospel is that God is able (Jude 24)
                   to keep Christians from sin. Paul proclaims that "we are more
                   than conquerors through him that loved us." Rom. 8:37.
                      Only when Christians reveal this power and manifest God's
                   purposes will God be rightly represented and vindicated.

THINK IT THROUGH       What relationship is there between a clear, living witness
                   to the truth about the living God and the end of the world?

         Part 2 What is the great mystery of the universe that could be
  THE MYSTERY made known only through revelation?
        OF OUR
      RELIGION  "Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of our religion:
                     He was manifested in the flesh,
                     vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels,
                     preached among the nations,
                     believed on in the world, taken up in glory."
                                                               1 Tim. 3:16, RSV.
                     Why does Paul call Christianity a mystery?

                       In the New Testament frequent references are made to the
                   mysteries of certain aspects of the gospel and to the gospel
                   generally. See Rom. 16:25; 1 Cor. 2:7; Eph. 3:3, 4. But mystery
                   is not used here to suggest that something is covered up and
                   kept secret. Although Paul uses "mystery" often, he always
                   refers to divinely revealed truth that God wants all men to know.
                   It is a mystery in the sense that it could be known in no other
                   way than by God's revelation.
                       How else, except through revelation, could anyone under-
                   stand the incarnation of Jesus or His resurrection?
                       The greatness that Paul stresses is not the mysterious nature
                   of the gospel but its importance, its earthshaking possibilities.
                   Any genuine Christian reading Paul's letter would quickly say
                   Amen!

THINK IT THROUGH       Would you confess with Paul that the central fact and
                   inspiration of your personal understanding of the gospel is
                   the incarnation of Jesus? How would you answer the ques-
                   tion: What is the great uniqueness of the Christian religion?
                       In verse 9 Paul emphasizes that church officers must pos-
                   sess "the mystery of faith with a clear conscience." In verse
                   16 he discloses the grounds for faith, the substance that faith
                   believes, "the mystery of our religion."
                       Six tremendous facts (verse 16) about Jesus, God who be-

                   The tragedy is that the Christian church has been most respon-
                   sible over the years for diluting the meaning of the incarnation
                   by not recognizing that He became truly man. By fearing to
                   suggest that the Holy God should know the tug of temptation,
                   they have minimized His actual feat of being the first man to
                   live without sin.

        Part 3     What high standards were to guide the church in the selec-
  THE ELDER-1  tion of its leaders?

                       "A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one
                   wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality,
                   apt to teach; not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of
                   filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous." 1 Tim.
                   3:2, 3.

                       The word "bishop" is the translation for the Greek word
                   that literally means "overseer"; in the New Testament this
                   word and another translated "elder" are used interchangeably,
                   one referring to the scope of his work and the other to the dig-
                   nity that befits such a leader.
                       The emphasis on the leader's irreproachable character as
                   known among people outside the church as well as by fellow
                   Christians is placed in proper perspective. The word "must" is
                   strongly emphasized in the Greek as it should be. By the very
                   nature of the case, Christian leaders must be living illustrations
                   of the truth they profess to teach, not only for the sake of the
                   community in general but also as a model for fellow members.
                       Also interesting in Paul's requirements of the elder is that
                   there is nothing about this list, except perhaps "apt to teach,"
                   that is any different from that expected of all church members.
                   Paul does not recognize two spiritual divisions within the
                   church: first-class being the clergy, and second-class, the
                   laity.
                       "Husband of one wife" means that the church leader must
                   be a man who is irreproachable in the area of sexual conduct.
                   Although marital fidelity was taken very lightly in Paul's day,
                   this instruction has never grown out-of-date. Perhaps it is
                   needed to be said today as much as Paul needed to say it then.
                       "Vigilant" means literally, "an abstainer from wine." The
                   elder should refrain from all that is harmful and use all else
                   judiciously.
                       "Sober" suggests prudence; every church needs sound-
                   minded leaders who can detect imbalance and fanaticism on
                   one hand and devious liberalism on the other.
                       "Good behaviour" calls for leaders who are true Christian
                   gentlemen. They exhibit a fitness and propriety that, sum up
                   the previously mentioned traits.
                       "Apt to teach" does not mean merely that the elder should
                   be willing to teach but that he be able to teach with a certain
                   measure of skill.

THINK IT THROUGH      Paul lists five negatives that must not be a part of the
                   leader's reputation or character. Is there often a correlation
                   between some or all five of these negative characteristics?

                                                                      July 23

        Part 4        How closely do a leader's children affect his church work?
  THE ELDER-2
                    "He must manage his own household well, keeping his
                 children submissive and respectful in every way; for if a man
                 does not know how to manage his own household, how can
                 he care for God's church?" 1 Tim. 3:4, 5, RSV.

                       For two reasons ill-mannered children are a liability to a
                   church leader, whether he be a minister or local elder; they
                   are a poor exhibit of the power of Christianity, and they give
                   evidence that the father is incompetent for church leadership.
                   Paul is using the argument of the less to the greater—if a man
                   fails in a smaller task (that of managing his own family), he is
                   incapable of successfully managing the many families that
                   compose a local congregation.
                       Although a man may possess all the other qualities that
                   Paul lists, a recent convert or a hopeful beginner should not
                   be elevated to important church responsibilities. Age is not
                   Paul's point; spiritual maturity is.
                      What are some of the dangers that may overtake a man
                   who has been prematurely placed in a position of heavy re-
                   sponsibility? Verse 6.

                      Paul mentions how subtle conceit may be, even in a man of
                   good intentions. Pride loses perspective; the affected one
                   makes hasty decisions, not realizing the implications of the
                   problem. The ability to listen to others is not a mark of a proud
                   man or of many inexperienced men. Falling into the same con-
                   demnation that Satan has received may sound harsh, but Paul
                   was realistic.
                      In determining the qualifications of church leaders, how
                   high a premium should be placed on the opinion of persons
                   outside the church? Verse 7.

                      Again Paul uses the strong emphasis in the Greek: "He must
                   be well thought of by outsiders." RSV. The potential church
                   leader should enjoy a favorable reputation. Apparently, he
                   should be someone who is already recognized as a man of
                   integrity in his community.

THINK IT THROUGH      Have you ever heard that a member was put into leader-
                   ship in order to encourage him, showing that the church was
                   interested in him? Why might this be a disaster for that
                   person?

        Part 5  How does Paul describe the qualities expected of a dea-
THE DEACON-1 con?
                       "Deacons likewise must be serious, not double-tongued,
                   not addicted to much wine, not greedy for gain; they must
                   hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. And
                   let them also be tested first; then if they prove themselves
                   blameless let them serve as deacons." 1 Tim. 3:8-10, RSV.

                       The precise nature of the deacon's responsibility is not
                   made clear in the New Testament, and about all we know is
                   found in the above text and Philippians 1:1. In Rom. 16:1 refer-
                   ence is made to a woman called a deaconess. (See RSV.)
                   Although the seven men, including Stephen, who were ap-
                   pointed to aid widows in the Jerusalem church (Acts 6) were
                   not called deacons, it seems that their great assistance in re-
                   lieving the apostles for preaching caused early leaders like
                   Paul to think seriously about such a group in every church.
                       About the only difference between the qualifications for the
                   deacon and the elder is that the deacons are not expected to
                   be especially trained as official teachers of the church. Paul
                   expected the same spiritual and moral standards to be upheld
                   by both levels of leadership.
                       Being double-tongued is a serious problem for anyone, but
                   it is a grave problem indeed for someone who has the respon-
                   sibility of making the rounds of visitation as expected of a
                   deacon or an elder. They would hear much that would require
                   careful discernment; instead of a peacemaker, a double-
                   tongued leader would be a troublemaker.
                       The warning against greed does not indicate that money-
                   making is evil. It is a warning against dishonorable gain such
                   as tripped up Judas as he handled the disciples' funds. The
                    deacon in his personal business should plan to be successful,
                    but it should be earned honestly. Certainly the deacon should
                   not use his office for personal gain, even though he might not
                   do anything legally dishonest.
THINK IT THROUGH      Why does Paul again join faith and conscience? Is it be-
                   cause Paul demands more than "a good conscience"? Can a
                   person have a good conscience and do some very bad acts?

                      Every potential candidate for church office should ask him-
                   self whether his conscience can approve his life-style when
                   compared with the expectations of God's will.
                      As for the elder, so with the deacon—no one should be
                   hurried into church office. There must be a record of mature
                   Christian living. Church offices were not made so that the
                   careless may be given a chance to prove themselves.

        Part 6   What are the legitimate rewards for those who serve well
THE DEACON-2 in church office?
                      "Let deacons be married only once, and let them manage
                   their children and their households well; for those who serve
                   well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also
                   great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus." 1 Tim.
                   3:12, 13, RSV.

                      Again, as with the elders (verse 2), Paul places a high pre-
                   mium on a deacon's marital fidelity and his ability to manage
                   his own household. All Christians should be faithful to their
                   marital vows; if there is reason to question, that person should
                   never be appointed a deacon or an elder.
                      Apparently Paul feels that ill-tempered, disobedient chil-
                   dren are sufficient evidence that a man, in spite of other ex-
                   ecutive abilities, is disqualified to assume the function of a
                   church leader.
THINK IT THROUGH      What satisfactions and compensations await a church offi-
                   cer who performs his duties conscientiously?

                      Certainly men and women who do their church duties faith-
                   fully will enjoy the respect and confidence of their fellow
                   church members. More than that, their commitment will be
                   noticed by people outside the church and could become an
                   avenue of blessing to such.
                      More than the well-deserved commendation and respect of
                   others is the church worker's growing confidence in his Lord's
                   guidance. He knows that without the assurance of his Lord's
                   care and power many would be the occasions for 'defeat and
                   discouragement. Nothing prepares a man for largertasks more
                   than the settled confidence that God is always able to provide
                   the wisdom and strength needed, regardless of the duty as-
                   signed. Developing such boldness of faith is the highest form
                   of compensation that any Christian could hope for.
                      "The humble worker who obediently responds to the call of
                   God may be sure of receiving divine assistance. To accept
                   so great and holy a responsibility is itself elevating to the
                   character. It calls into action the highest mental and spiritual
                   powers, and strengthens and purifies the mind and heart.
                   Through faith in the power of God, it is wonderful how strong
                   a weak man may become, how decided his efforts, how prolific
                   of great results. . .. The more one tries to explain the word of
                   God to others, with a love for souls, the plainer it becomes to
                   himself. The more we use our knowledge and exercise our

          Part 1  What special apostasies within the Christian church were
     DEPARTURE predicted by Paul?
          FROM    "Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some
     DOCTRINAL will depart from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits
      INTEGRITY and doctrines of demons, through the pretensions of liars
                   whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and en-
                   join abstinence from foods which God created to be received
                   with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth."
                   1 Tim. 4:1-3, RSV.
                      "Later times" means in the days to follow, and does not
                   especially refer to the last days. In the previous three chapters
                   Paul has emphasized that one of the chief responsibilities of
                   church leadership is to guard the sacred truth as first pro-
                   claimed by the apostles. But, even with such watchfulness,
                   apostasies would occur.
                       When Paul left Ephesus some years before writing this
                   letter to Timothy (now at Ephesus), what were some of his
                   warnings? Acts 20:29, 30.

                      Paul here is more explicit regarding these leaders of deceit
                   and some of their false doctrines. They sail under false colors,
                   giving the impression that they are the most loyal to the
                   church's mission and that what they teach is the deeper mean-
                   ing of what the church has always believed, et cetera.
                      Sad but true, a person's conscience can become so seared
                   by rationalization and habit that all sensitivity to the voice of
                   the Holy Spirit is lost.
                      Some of these devilish doctrines that would appear logical,
                   and in a strange way desirable in attaining Christian goals,
                   were in the area of asceticism, a visible form of self-denial.
                   Self-denial was central to Christian thought, and any promotion
                   to encourage a person's self-denial seemed praiseworthy.
                      But in compulsory celibacy and programmed fasting from
                   certain foods a strange spirit entered the church. Nowhere in
                   the Bible is marriage condemned. In fact in chapter 3, Paul
                   declared it proper for church elders and deacons to be faithful
                   husbands and the heads of godly families. Likewise, nowhere
                   is abstinence from food suggested as a means of developing
                   character. The only prohibition of foods in the Bible (Lev. 11;
                   Deut. 14) refers to unclean foods, and such food was never
                   "created to be received with thanksgiving."

THINK IT THROUGH      What other ways can you think of that Christians have
                   devised whereby through self-denial or even self-affliction
                   they have sought the praise of men and the pleasure of God?

                                                                            July 28

          Part 2   What particular characteristics distinguish a good church
    PORTRAIT OF leader?
 A GOOD LEADER     "If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things,
                   thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up
                   in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou
                   Nast attained." 1 Tim. 4:6.

                      The reference to a "good minister" does not necessarily
                   mean a clergyman; in fact, any church member who jealously
                   guards the truths of Christianity from the false teachings that
                   so easily creep in would be a "good minister of Jesus Christ."
                      What is at stake is how men are saved and how God dis-
                   poses of the sin problem. The evil one will do anything to keep
                   this issue confused, especially in the church. The essence of
                   genuine faith is that men recognize Jesus to be man's Saviour
                   and Example, that there is no good thing that man can do by
                   his own effort without the empowering Spirit of God, and that
                   God's goal for the Christian is to develop a character like his
                   Lord's. Genuine faith and correct doctrine are two sides of
                   the same coin.
                      Christianity is more than accepting a list of doctrines. If it
                   were only this, the best Christians would be those with the
                   sharpest intellect.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what way did Paul make clear that there is more to
                   Christianity than memorizing good doctrine?

                      "It is not enough for us to believe that Jesus is not an
                   impostor, and that the religion of the Bible is no cunningly de-
                   vised fable. We may believe that the name of Jesus is the
                   only name under heaven whereby man may be saved, and yet
                   we may not through faith make Him our personal Saviour. It
                   is not enough to believe the theory of truth. It is not enough
                   to make a profession of faith in Christ and have our names
                   registered on the church roll. . . . Whatever our profession, it
                   amounts to nothing unless Christ is revealed in works of righ-
                   teousness."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 312, 313.
                      Genuine faith, Paul's theme here and elsewhere, is con-
                   cerned about man's relationship with God. Aware of how
                   subtle pride is, the man of faith takes no credit for his good
                   deeds.
                       "The faith that is unto salvation is not a casual faith, it is
                   not the mere consent of the intellect, it is belief rooted in the
                   heart, that embraces Christ as a personal Saviour, assured
                   that He can save unto the uttermost all that come unto God
                    by Him."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 391.

          Part 3    What kind of discipline is necessary for Christian growth?
     CHRISTIAN
                   "Train yourself in godliness; for while bodily training is
     DISCIPLINE of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds
                   promise for the present life and also for the life to come."
                   1 Tim. 4:7, 8, RSV.

                      The striving of the false teachers and the pretentious liars
                   was worse than useless—it led to a false sense of security and
                   a self-centered character that misrepresented Christianity.
                      There is a kind of physical exercise that is useful, Paul says
                   —the kind that builds up health and provides the best possible
                   condition for the spiritual man to grow.
                      But Paul is more concerned about the discipline that the
                   Christian applies to his attitudes, habits, and desires. The
                   genuine Christian concentrates on those habit patterns that
                   are fitting him to live with the redeemed forever.
                      "We can never be saved in indolence and inactivity. There
                   is no such thing as a truly converted person living a helpless,
                   useless life. It is not possible for us to drift into heaven. No
                   sluggard can enter there. If we do not strive to gain an en-
                   trance into the kingdom, if we do not seek earnestly to learn
                   what constitutes its laws, we are not fitted for a part in it. Those
                   who refuse to co-operate with God on earth would not co-oper-
                   ate with Him in heaven. It would not be safe to take them to
                   heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 280.

                      How does Paul vouch for the rewards of godliness in the
                   present life? Verse 9.

                       What is one of the chief motivations that spurs on the
                   faithful Christian worker? Verse 10.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what sense can it be said that the Christian is to "make
                   the best" of both worlds? List the differences between the
                   Christian's life-style and that of the worldling. Can it be said
                   that, even if there were not a heaven to come, the Christian
                   does not forfeit the best things of this life and enjoys them
                   more than the worldling?

                       Godliness does have value in this life; it may or may not
                   accompany prosperity, but its blessings are worth more than
                   a rich man's fortune. What lies ahead when Jesus sets up His
                   kingdom is beyond man's imagination, but the reality of such
                   promises is as sure as the promises that have been fulfilled
                   in the present life.

         Part 4  What challenge did Paul give to young Timothy?
   SETTING THE
                 "These things command and teach. Let no man despise
      EXAMPLE thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word,
                   in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity." 1 Tim.
                   4:11, 12.

                       Verses 11-16 are filled with wise counsel for which Timothy
                   and every successful pastor since has been very grateful.
                   Probably equally significant is the heightened awareness that
                   every church member has of the pastor's responsibilities, lead-
                   ing to intelligent understanding and sympathy after reading
                   these verses. Paul did not make the mistake of believing that
                   a blameless life would be sufficient in fulfilling the responsibil-
                   ities of Christian leadership. There would be times when firm,
                   clear instruction and direction would have to be given in order
                   to correct evil conduct or subversive teachings.
                       The one factor that could have persuaded Timothy to be
                   less forceful was his comparative youthfulness, although at
                   the time he received this letter he must have been in his mid-
                   thirties. He had to contend with sophisticated men, strong and
                   influential, who had won their way partly because of their
                   apparent piety. But Timothy was commanded to deal forth-
                    rightly with the subtle deceptions of the ascetic crowd, regard-
                    less of their prestige and his own age.
                       The young leader's best credentials will be to live above
                    reproach, an example of those Christian graces that are much
                   easier to talk about than to live.

THINK IT THROUGH      From generation to generation, through the history of the
                   Christian church, responsibilities have had to be passed on
                   from the older to the younger. What can be done to guaran-
                   tee continuing fidelity to doctrine and ethical standards?
                   Should youth be given the opportunity to restructure the
                   church program as they see fit?

                      "Those who are older must educate the youth, by precept
                   and example, to discharge the claims that society and their
                   Maker have upon them. Upon these youth must be laid grave
                   responsibilities. The question is, Are they capable of govern-
                   ing themselves, and standing forth in the purity of their God-
                   given manhood, abhorring everything that savors of wicked-
                   ness?...
                      "Not for one moment should the youth think that they can
                   acceptably fill any position of trust without possessing a good
                   character. Just as well might they expect to gather grapes of
                   thorns, or figs of thistles."—Counsels to Teachers, page 536.

          Part 5    What high premium did Paul place on the Christian lead-
SKILL IN PUBLIC er's performance in public?
 PERFORMANCE        "Till I come, attend to the public reading of scripture,
                   to preaching, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift you have,
                   which was given you by prophetic utterance when the elders
                   laid their hands upon you. Practice these duties, devote your-
                   self to them, so that all may see your progress." 1 Tim. 4:13-
                   15, RSV.

                        Although Paul turns specifically to the public work that
                    constitutes - the major task of a Christian preacher, his counsel
                    should be considered by anyone who is called to lead out in a
                   public meeting.
                        Preaching, teaching, and reading the Scriptures is a diffi-
                    cult art and must be practiced. The novice, or one who has
                   little idea of the sacredness of his work, considers sincerity
                   to be enough. How sad, for their sake and for the many who
                   have a right to hear the gospel given in a clear, meaningful
                   manner.
                        "The man who accepts the position of being mouthpiece
                   for God should consider it highly essential that he present the
                   truth with all the grace and intelligence he can, that the truth
                   may lose nothing in his presentation of it to the people. Those
                   who consider it a little thing to speak with an imperfect utter-
                   ance dishonor God."—Evangelism, page 665.
                        Reading the Scriptures in public is no easy task and should
                   be done only after practice and in such a way that will "charm
                   the hearers."—Evangelism, page 666.
                        "The science of reading correctly and with the proper em-
                   phasis, is of highest value.' No matter how much knowledge
                   you may have acquired in other lines, if you have neglected to
                   cultivate your voice and manner of speech so that you can
                   speak and read distinctly and intelligently, all your learning
                   will be of but little profit; for without voice culture you can-
                   not communicate readily and clearly that which you have
                   learned....
                        "The tones of the voice have much to do in affecting the

        Part 6  What relationship exists between the Christian's character
 THE GREATEST and the doctrine he believes and shares?
      SERMON    "Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue
                   in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and
                   them that hear thee." 1 Tim. 4:16.

                       The genuine Christian first prepares himself before he tries
                   to convince others. He is his greatest sermon. The effective-
                   ness of Christianity rests not on brilliant theological reasoning
                   but on the disarming gracefulness, forbearance, and integrity
                   of its representatives.
                       God is waiting for a generation who will take Paul's counsel
                   seriously. The doctrine is very important; without it Christian
                   conviction melts into personal feeling that shifts with the cir-
                   cumstances. But doctrine without a demonstration misrepre-
                   sents the Lord of the doctrine.
                       The Bible is a light only when it is translated into living
                   color in the lives of genuine Christians. "Through the Holy
                   Spirit, God's word is a light as it becomes a transforming power
                   in the life of the receiver. By implanting in their hearts the
                   principles of His word, the Holy Spirit develops in men the
                   attributes of God. The light of His glory—His character—is to
                   shine forth in His followers."—Christ's Object Lessons, page
                   414.
                       The Greek indicates that Paul is not prodding Timothy into
                   more exactitude in his personal development or in pastoral
                   skills. "Keep on taking heed" would be a better translation.

THINK IT THROUGH      If God alone saves, why does Paul tell Timothy that by
                   constant improvement he will save both himself and his
                   hearers?

                      "'Thyself' needs the first attention. First give yourself to

                      LESSON 6                                         August 3

         Part 1       How should a Christian admonish a fellow church member?
  BASIC HUMAN          "Do not rebuke an older man but exhort him as you would
 RELATIONSHIPS     a father; treat younger men like brothers, older women like
                   mothers, younger women like sisters, in all purity." 1 Tim.
                   5:1, 2, RSV.

                      Church leadership involves personal care for individuals as
                   well as developing skills in preaching and in the public read-
                   ing of the Scriptures. See chapter 4:13.
                      Some will think they need more attention than truly re-
                   quired; others will complain about what they think to be unfair
                   practices and attitudes on the part of fellow church mem-
                   bers. Always there will be some who will be overlooked be-
                   cause they are undemanding, although their need for help will
                   be very great.
                      When a younger person must admonish an older, respect for
                   age must temper the rebuke. However, age itself does not
                   make rebuke unnecessary. But wise is the young man or woman
                   who deals gently, even when firmness is required, with the
                   person who is older. The counsel is explicit: Do not run
                   roughshod over those who are older.
                      No matter how correct one is, a person's usefulness is
                   greatly limited by the manner in which he reprimands. Timothy
                   was to be an example of Christian love, showing respect and
                   deference to all who needed to be admonished.
                      What added caution did Paul give to men as they per-
                   formed their church duties among young women? Verse 2.
                      Any breach of propriety may injure or destroy years of ex-
                   cellent reputation of even the most devoted, energetic pastor
                   or church officer.
                      "The subject of purity and propriety of deportment is one
                   to which we [those called to the ministry] must give heed. We
                   must guard against the sins of this degenerate age. Let not
                   Christ's ambassadors descend to trifling conversation, to fa-
                   miliarity with women, married or single. Let them keep their
                   proper place with becoming dignity; yet at the same time
                   they may be sociable, kind, and courteous to all. They must
                   stand aloof from everything that savors of commonness and
                   familiarity. This is forbidden ground, upon which it is unsafe
                   to set the feet. Every word, every act, should tend to elevate,
                   to refine, to ennoble. There is sin in thoughtlessness about
                   such matters."—Gospel Workers, page 125.
THINK IT THROUGH      Is there anything in my deportment that could be inter-
                   preted as an enticement that would appeal to someone else's
                   weakness?

                     LESSON 6                                          August 4

        Part 2   How does Paul distinguish between widows who deserve
RESPONSIBILITY special church support and those who do not?
    TO "REAL"     "Honor widows who are real widows. If a widow has
      WIDOWS children or grandchildren, let them first learn their religious
                 duty to their own family and make some return to their par-
                 ents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. She who is a
                 real widow, and is left all alone, has set her hope on God
                 and continues in supplications and prayers night and day;
                 whereas she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she
                 lives. Command this, so that they may be without reproach."
                 1 Tim. 5:3-7, RSV.

                       Paul gives considerable counsel regarding the care of
                   widows—a problem with many aspects. Such care for wid-
                   ows must have been a new concept in the first century A.D.
                   If not properly handled, however, it could have rent the young
                   church. Not only would it disrupt local church budgets, but
                   hazy thinking would divide congregations in endless arguments.
                       Paul knew how sensitive church members would be regard-
                   ing the allocation of their funds for the care of needy members.
                   His criteria for the widows who truly deserved church help
                   were as follows: They were not able to support themselves;
                   they had no relatives upon whom they had the right to depend;
                   they were worthy—a credit to the church's name—as well as
                   needy.
                      How strongly did Paul feel regarding those who did not
                   care for the needs of their relatives? Verse 8.

                      The care for widowed parents or grandparents is a respon-
                   sibility resting upon all children and is required by the fifth
                   commandment. Returning the care given to them in their young
                   years of helplessness should be the young's ready response of
                   gratitude to those who are entering their older years of relative
                   helplessness. No amount of Christian service can possibly ex-
                   cuse the abandonment of needy parents or others in the im-
                   mediate family.
                      What added qualification does Paul expect of a widow
                   past sixty years of age who demonstrates financial need?
                   Verses 9,10.

THINK IT THROUGH      As one who is younger, have I done all that I could to
                   make the last years of my parents as pleasant as possible?
                   As a parent, am I a credit to my church and an honor to my
                   children, making it a pleasure for them to help me if I should
                   become helpless?

          Part 3   What was Paul's counsel regarding young widows?
     GUIDELINES
     FOR YOUNG     "But refuse to enrol younger widows; for when they grow
                 wanton against Christ they desire to marry, and so they incur
        WIDOWS
                   condemnation for having violated their first pledge. Besides
                   that, they learn to be idlers, gadding about from house to
                   house, and not only idlers but gossips and busybodies, saying
                   what they should not. So I would have younger widows
                   marry, bear children, rule their households, and give the
                   enemy no occasion to revile us. For some have already strayed
                   after Satan." 1 Tim. 5:11-15, RSV.

                       Paul is adamant; young widows (apparently those under 60)
                   were not to be placed on the list of those for whom the church
                   should feel responsible. Such a practice seemed to have al-
                   ready proved dangerous for both the woman and the good name
                   of the church.
                       Paul is certainly not against remarriage; in fact, he strongly
                   urges it. But he is against giving up the Christian faith in order
                   to be married once again. Paul's chief concern here is for
                   the spiritual welfare of young widows. See also verse 6. The
                   loss of a husband creates a problem that unmarried women
                   do not experience. Paul wants widows to remarry if possible
                   but not for the wrong reasons.
                       To "wax wanton" means to cast off self-restraint, no longer
                   restrained even by Christ. Such a person intends to satisfy
                   personal desires, regardless; easy it is to rationalize a mar-
                   riage with a pagan, becoming pagan again in order to satisfy
                   the life-3tyle of the new husband.
                       For Paul nothing is more important than the image of the
                   church before a pagan world. Nothing should be done, even
                   the formation of a new home, that would "give the enemy . . .
                   occasion to revile us."

                      How does Paul stress the inherent responsibility resting
                   upon members of the young widow's family, to assist her
                   until she finds a way to support herself? Verse 16.

                      Paul's principle is that relatives have first responsibility in
                   the care of needy widows. Men are to care for the needs of
                   widowed mothers and grandmothers (verse 4), and Christian
                   women who have means should assist relatives who are widows
                   and need help.

THINK IT THROUGH      What are the various ways that anyone can help a needy
                   widow? Are you doing all you can for those in your own
                   family? Are there those in the church who could use your
                   encouragement and material assistance?

                    LESSON 6                                            August 6

         Part 4  What special considerations should be given to those who
  RESPECT FOR labor full time in the preaching-teaching ministry?
       CHURCH    "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of
      LEADERS double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and
                 teaching; for the scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle an ox
                 when it is treading out the grain,' and, 'The laborer deserves
                 his wages.' " 1 Tim. 5:17, 18, RSV.

                    The care necessary in selecting church elders has already
                 been emphasized in chapter 3. They are to be exceptional in
                 spiritual matters as well as model fathers and homemakers. In
                 return for their dedication to church affairs, they deserve double
                 honor and respect.
                    Those elders who devote themselves exclusively to the up-
                 building of the church, the full-time pastor or evangelist, de-
                 serve a living wage. In 1 Corinthians 9:9-11 Paul elaborates
                 the principle of remuneration that he briefly touches here. Paul
                 bases his instruction on a simple principle that settles every-
                 thing: "The scripture says." He places an Old Testament state-
                 ment (Deut. 25:4) alongside of a New Testament statement
                 (Luke 10:7), indicating that the principle is one of long stand-
                 ing and has been validated by our Lord Himself. This may be
                 the first instance where the words of Jesus are quoted as
                 "scripture."

                     How did Paul indicate that the church elder may get the
                   opposite of honor as he faithfully pursues his duties? Verse 19.

                      It is a serious matter to charge a church elder with mis-
                   conduct—much is at stake. Not only is a man's reputation
                   questioned but the good name of the Christian community is
                   endangered. III will has often trumped up charges against a
                   minister who has had to be firm in rebuking wrongdoing. Not
                   a few ministers and other church officers have had their in-
                   tegrity questioned by unscrupulous persons.
                      Paul's caution is wise counsel even today. The honor due
                   to the office demands that extreme care be given to accusa-
                   tions demeaning a church leader. There may be times when
                   the accusations are true and the offender must be dealt with.
                   But with the indictment must come the credible witness of two
                   or three persons or else the accusation is not to stand.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do you know of instances where men or women in church
                   office have been hurt by unsupported accusations? What
                   would be your response today if you should hear damaging
                   information regarding a church leader?

Responsibilities of the Church Toward Its Members                      ❑ Thursday
                      LESSON 6                                            August 7

         Part 5   How did Paul order that wrongdoing by church officers be
     IMPARTIAL dealt with?
       JUSTICE    "As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the pres-
                   ence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear." 1 Tim. 5:20,
                   RSV.

                       Paul considers the charge of wrongdoing, especially against
                   church officers, a very serious occasion. He rejects unsup-
                   ported accusations on one hand, and cover-up of sin on the
                   other.
                       The public exposure would remind fellow officers that sin
                   is a terrible enemy wherever found and must be handled as
                   a poisonous snake; otherwise, the end of unrecognized and
                   unpunished sin is a demoralized congregation. Even though
                   the offender is to be publicly rebuked, Paul would want it done
                   in compassion and tenderness. See 2 Cor. 2:6-8.
                      Paul surely is not referring to gross sins such as stealing,
                   adultery, Sabbath breaking, et cetera. These sins would require
                   more than a rebuke. Elders who have committed grave sins
                   should not continue to hold their office, and the congregation
                   itself should be properly informed and be responsible for ap-
                   propriate discipline. Paul would not excuse an elder for an
                   offense for which he recommended disfellowshipping regular
                   members. See 1 Cor. 5:9-13.
                      Against what practice did Paul warn? Verse 21.
                      When guilt has been established, the church leader must be
                   given no favors; nothing would sour the spirit of a congrega-
                   tion quicker. The younger members would feel cause to ques-
                   tion the integrity of all leaders and the organization itself. Paul
                   emphasized the importance of this principle by reminding
                   Timothy and all other leaders that we all stand under the
                   searching eyes of a righteous God.
                      What special counsel does Paul give regarding the qualifi-
                   cations of church leaders? Verse 22.
                       If members are elected for church leadership prematurely,
                   before they have made a consistent record of unimpeachable
                   conduct, the church members have a responsibility for the
                   mistakes of these untried leaders. Furthermore, if the mistakes
                   of leaders are overlooked for reasons of friendship or timidity,
                   again such fellow members are participating in those sins.

THINK IT THROUGH       Are you doing all you can to keep the image of the church
                   pure before the world? Are you reluctant to become involved
                   in rebuking sins that have become, to some extent, a public
                   spectacle?

Responsibilities of the Church Toward Its Members                   ❑ Friday
                    LESSON 6                                         August 8

        Part 6    How does Paul make clear that selecting men and women
   TRUTH WILL for church office, widow privileges, et cetera, is not an impos-
               sible task?
    ALWAYS BE
     REVEALED      "The sins of some men are conspicuous, pointing to judg-
               ment, but the sins of others appear later. So also good deeds
               are conspicuous; and even when they are not, they cannot
               remain hidden." I Tim. 5:24, 25, RSV.


                   These verses on sins and good deeds close Paul's discus-
               sion on making decisions about people for office, assistance,
               or misconduct. Timothy is told that judging the qualifications
               of men and women is not an impossible task because both sin
               and good deeds are sometimes conspicuous, and when not,
               they will be so eventually. Therefore, delay may be necessary
               in making some decisions. See verse 22.
                   There are always three classes: those whose life record is
               clearly unworthy of sacred trust, those whose character invites
               trust, and those who keep you wondering about their real loy-
               alty. For the last class, many good points could be added up
               in their favor, but the discriminating observer also recognizes
               that there is inconsistency, that their good works and a peace-
               able spirit cannot be relied on for all occasions. Don't hurry
               this group into office until the general tenor of the life can be
               more clearly revealed.
                   Sin has a way of leaving tracks. "Be sure your sin will find
               you out." Num. 32: 23. Paul restates this almost matter-of-
                factly: "the sins of others appear later." If a person is by-
                passed in a church election, or even if a ministerial ordination
                is postponed, the true character of that person will be revealed
                as time goes on. If quality is there, it will be exposed; but if a
                wrong spirit has been present, it cannot be hid.
                    Possibly the ambiguity will always be there—not bad enough
                to censure and not good enough to entrust with sacred office.
                Ellen White said of such: "Some men's sins are open before-
                hand, confessed in penitence, and forsaken, and they go before-
                hand to judgment. Pardon is written over against the names of
                these men. But other men's sins follow after, and are not put
                away by repentance and confession, and these sins will stand
                registered against them in the books of heaven."—Ellen G.
                 White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 916.


THINK IT THROUGH       In what way are good deeds conspicuous? Suppose you
                   want to do good without others knowing about it except the
                   person helped. What then? Is there not a record in the face
                   of the one doing good?
                                                                               53

                                          LESSON OUTLINE
    In this last chapter of his first

men, the blend was perfect. After         6.   Challenge to a Victorious Life,
Jesus ascended, the success of the             1 Tim. 6:14
Christian church depended upon
how effectively each member could
blend his life and his words so that
others could believe that something
special and appealing was happen-
ing. The church has been most ef-
fective when this blend of life and
words most nearly reflected the life
and words of Jesus.
    The faith experience that kept our
Lord from sinning is the faith that
can keep the life of the Christian
"unstained and free from reproach."
1 Tim. 6:14, RSV. The object of faith
is to keep saying Yes to God. The
fruit of faith is righteousness; or, to
say it another way, the goal of the
Christian is to seek righteousness
by faith. The standard of righteous-
ness is "the sound words of our
Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching
which accords with godliness"—the
doctrine that Timothy was to guard
carefully.
   Today the church must proclaim
sound doctrine at a time when
much spurious teaching exists. Yet,

How to Keep the Faith          LESSON 7                                    Sunday
                                                                        August 10

         Part 1   What reason does Paul give for some rejecting the gospel
  MORBID CRAV- and craving religious controversy?
       ING FOR    "If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree with
  CONTROVERSY the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching
                   which accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit, he
                   knows nothing; he has a morbid craving for controversy and
                   for disputes about words, which produce envy, dissension,
                   slander, base suspicions." 1 Tim. 6:3, 4, RSV.

                       Paul chose his words carefully and boldly. The first motive
                   which he ascribed to those in the church who teach contrary
                   to "sound doctrine" (as measured by the "words of our Lord"
                   and apostolic teaching "which accords with godliness") is
                   vanity, conceit, and pride. In fact, such a person is not only
                   conceited, he is really ignorant concerning what he thinks he
                   knows most about. He has missed the whole point of the life
                   of faith.
                       Paul was not only talking about heretics, for there have
                   always been those within the church who have put more em-
                   phasis on word battles than on Christlike living. Correct doc-
                   trine is intended to lead to a godly life. If doctrinal disputes,
                   about even correct doctrine, take precedence over godly liv-
                   ing, then the doctrine is misused, and the disputes are afflicted
                   with a spiritually dangerous and sometimes fatal disease.
                       But Paul did not here depreciate diligent study and the
                   need to keep the doctrine pure as the years go by. Often the
                   need would arise for true soldiers of faith to dispute, in a
                   Christlike manner, with those who may be improperly handling
                   the "sound words of our Lord."

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the final test that determines whether a person
                   has the truth?

                      "A profession of faith and the possession of truth in the
                   soul are two different things. The mere knowledge of truth is
                   not enough. We may possess this, but the tenor of our thoughts
                   may not be changed. The heart must be converted and sancti-
                   fied."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 97.
                      The tragedy set forth in the parable of the bridegroom
                   (Matthew 25) is that the five foolish bridesmaids were not lost
                   because they did not know the facts about the advent and the
                   kind of people their Lord was waiting for. On the contrary,
                   they possessed the lamp of doctrine even as the five wise—but
                   the five wise allowed the lamp to be the instrument whereby
                   the light of truth was reflected in their lives. The five foolish
                   made the lamp of doctrine into an end in itself.

         Part 2  What other motivation could impel church members to
USING RELIGION make a habit out of controversy in religious matters?
   AS A MEANS
                    . . and wrangling among men who are depraved in
     TO AN END mind and  bereft of the truth, imagining that godliness is a
                   means of gain." 1 Tim. 6:5, RSV.

                       A most insidious motivation for many within the church was
                   to use church employment chiefly for financial security and
                   personal status rather than an opportunity to work full time
                   in Christian witness. The motivation here is greed, whereas
                   others were using their religious activity to puff up their con-
                   ceit. The two motives are not mutually exclusive. Avaricious
                   people watch the clock, personal comfort, and the fringe bene-
                   fits more than they watch for the opportunities, in season and
                   out, to represent their Lord.
                       These wrong motivations, in other forms, can be a problem
                   to the volunteer church worker as well as to the vocational
                   church worker.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why do you do church work? What personal rewards do
                   you seek? Is there a time when you may be more concerned
                   that others think well of you rather than that you can bring
                   permanent good to persons hungry for truth?

                      In what way is there gain in godliness? Verse 6.

                      When godliness (God-likeness) is made the objective of all
                   one's religious activity, there is great gain indeed. The fruits
                   of the Spirit cannot be bought, but the one possessing them
                   could hope for nothing more. Pseudogodliness can easily be-
                   come a means of gain, but such is not the life of peace, joy,
                   and integrity. Only when godliness is the end, and not the
                   means to something else, is it even found. "Seek ye first the
                   kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things
                   shall be added unto you." Matt. 6:33.
                      But wise Paul added "with contentment" because he knew
                   that there are many ways that man can convince himself that
                   he is godly. However, if he has found genuine contenment,
                   seeking no additional material advantage, completely indepen-
                   dent from all outward circumstances, yet completely dependent
                   upon his Lord, such a person may know the "peace . . . which
                   passes all understanding," one of the gains of true godliness.

           Part 3      What is the root of all evil and why?
        THE LOVE
     OF MONEY-1        "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a
                    snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown
                    men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is
                    the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have
                    erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with
                    many sorrows." 1 Tim. 6:9, 10.

                        Nowhere did Paul declare it a crime to own property or to
                    be rich, any more than he declares it a virtue to be poor. Paul
                    is against discontentment of mind and soul, whether it be in
                    the rich or the poor, because real contentment is independent
                    of either poverty or wealth. See Phil. 4:11-13.
                        But Paul did fear the special temptations that can over-
                    whelm the wealthy if they do not maintain a constant guard.
                    The temptation is always there to use wrong means for further
                    gain or even to maintain their holdings. Wealth has become a
                    trap when the whole life is wrapped up in expectations of things
                    that wealth can provide: new things, visits to new places, and
                    diversions. Paul calls these "foolish and hurtful lusts" that
                    plunge men into ruin and destruction.
                        Paul is being practical, not theoretical; he is recording what
                    is too often true, examples of which almost everyone has
                    known.
                        Money, land, investments become the extension of one's per-
                    sonality. Frugality, diligence, foresight are commendable vir-
                    tues and will produce material gain, given the right circum-
                    stances. But there is something sinister about the human heart
                    when unconverted—it wants to make itself self-sufficient.
                    Money in civilized lands is merely the means by which self-
                    sufficiency is measured. For this reason the "love of money
                    is the root of all evil." Out of this soul-soil a bitter root grows,
                    and the end of such growth is a diseased, self-centered spirit.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is there about the craving for riches that leads
                    people to wander "from the faith"? Jesus used the phrase,
                    "the deceitfulness of riches." Where is the deceit?

                       "The love of riches has an infatuating, deceptive power. Too
                    often those who possess worldly treasure forget that it is God
                    who gives them power to get wealth. . . . Their riches, instead
                    of awakening gratitude to God, lead to the exaltation of self."

  OF MONEY-2
                      "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
                   highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living
                   God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do
                   good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute,
                   willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a
                   good foundation against the time to come, so that they may
                   lay hold on eternal life." 1 Tim. 6:17-19.

                       It has been difficult for Christian churches, it seems, to
                   deal with wealth. On one hand, some churches have, without
                   question, in many lands identified with the aristocracy and en-
                   joyed their favors. On the other, some churches have supported
                   in varying degrees those who would deny the rights of private
                   property, almost intimating that a man is sinful or dangerous
                   if he is wealthy.
                       Paul fell into neither trap. He knew that circumstances and
                   individuals vary and that sin itself has something to do with
                   the distressing inequalities in every period of world history.
                       Paul's concern was the same as his Lord's: Rich men are
                    to be condemned only if they put their trust in their wealth and
                    do not use their opportunities to help others. Furthermore, he
                    knew that it would be difficult to identify precisely those who
                   were the rich and the poor, for the next question is obvious:
                   Compared to whom? Everyone, to some extent, needs to heed
                   Paul's counsel not "to set their hopes on uncertain riches."
                       The rich are strongly charged to be humble, not "haughty."
                   Not only is flaunting money vulgar; for the Christiartit is sinful.

THINK IT THROUGH       Are you taking your material assets seriously? Does it
                   really matter how much you own? Are there ways in your
                   life where you can more constructively take Paul's counsel?

                        "The Bible condemns no man for being rich, if he has ac-
                    quired his riches honestly. Not money, but the love of money,
                    is the root of all evil. It is God who gives men power to get
                    wealth; and in the hands of him who acts as God's steward,
                   using his means unselfishly, wealth is a blessing, both to its
                    possessor and to the world. But many, absorbed in their in-
                    terest in worldly treasures, become insensible to the claims of
                    God and the needs of their fellow men. They regard their wealth
                   as a means of glorifying themselves."—The Ministry of Heal-

          Part 5 What higher motivations than conceit and lust for material
     THE GOOD possessions did Paul set before Timothy?
 FIGHT OF FAITH
                 "But thou, 0 man of God, flee these things; and follow
                   after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meek-
                   ness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal
                   life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a
                   good profession before many witnesses." 1 Tim. 6:11, 12.

                       Eternal life is again held up before Timothy, not only as
                   the steady light at the end of the road, but also as a living
                   reality to be experienced all the way down that road. Grasp
                   eternal life, don't let go, Paul urges all Christians as does his
                   colleague, John. See 1 John 5:12.
                       This quality of life is not given to man without cooperation
                   and much effort on his part. Christianity is more than a matter
                   of learning doctrine, or even "leaving it all to Jesus." Indeed,
                   Jesus will supply all the needed prompting and power to live the
                   righteous life (that is, the life without sin) but man must choose
                   to accept this power from above and to fight the power from
                   below. This is the "good fight of faith."
                      The Greek is specific: "Keep on contending; make a life
                   habit of contending." The time will never come, while on earth,
                   when the Christian can say that he is beyond the possibility of
                   sinning. Our perfect Lord had to contend with the alternatives
                   even into Gethsemane; but His victory was always in His will
                   to choose "Thy will be done." The choice every day is Yes or
                   No to God. The Christian finds his peace and strength in a daily
                   Yes to whatever God wants him to do.

THINK IT THROUGH       How do you feel about the thought that the life of faith
                   is considered as a fight? How else could it be?

                       "It is no part of His plan that souls shall be sustained in the
                   battle of life by human sympathy and praise; but He means
                   that they shall go without the camp, bearing the reproach,
                   fighting the good fight of faith, and standing in His strength
                   under every difficulty. God has opened to us all the treasures
                   of heaven through the precious gift of His Son, who is fully
                   able to uplift, ennoble, and fit us, through His perfection of
                   character, for usefulness in this life and for a holy heaven. He
                   came to our world and lived as He requires His followers to
                   live. His was a life of self-denial and constant self-sacrifice."

                                                                      August 15

         Part 6    What expectation did Paul hold up before Timothy?
   CHALLENGE
   TO A VICTO-     "I charge you to keep the commandment unstained and
                free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus
    RIOUS LIFE Christ." 1 Tim. 6:14, RSV.

                   The natural bent of even Christians is to think God is ex-
               pecting something less than an "unstained" life "free from
               reproach" of all who live the life of faith. But God clearly says
               that sin and faith are incompatible. Faith says Yes to God
               and sin says No.
                   How can you live a life of victory over sin? Just as Jesus
               lived it—by faith. "Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised
               no powers, that men may not have through faith in Him. His
               perfect humanity is that which all His followers may possess,
               if they will be in subjection to God as He was."—The Desire
               of Ages, page 664.
                    This emphasis on the victorious life of faith is a major con-
               cern of New Testament writers. God's power to save is not
               limited or only half effective. See 1 John 5:4.
                   Jude said it nicely: "Now unto him that is able to keep you
               from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence
               of his glory with exceeding joy." Jude 24.
                    This power to change lives so that sin no longer is in con-
               trol is what the good news—the gospel—is all about. Mankind
               no longer needs to be shackled by hereditary or cultivated
               tendencies to sin. "The gospel is to be presented, not as a
               lifeless theory, but as a living force to change the life. God
               desires that the receivers of His grace shall be witnesses to
               its power. . . . He would have His servants bear testimony to
                the fact that through His grace men may possess Christlikeness
               of character, and may rejoice in the assurance of His great
                love. He would have us bear testimony to the fact that He can-
               not be satisfied until the human race are reclaimed and rein-
                stated in their holy privileges as His sons and daughters. . . .
                    "Words alone cannot tell it. Let it be reflected in the char-
                acter and manifested in the life. Christ is sitting for His portrait
                in every disciple."—The Desire of Ages, pages 826, 827.




THINK IT THROUGH      Why must this demonstration of faith be clearly set before
                   the world before Jesus can come? Do you see a connection
                   between Revelation 14:12 and this challenge to Timothy?

  END OF FAITH to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of
 AND DOCTRINE the truth which accords with godliness, in hope of eternal
                   life which God, who never lies, promised ages ago and at
                   the proper time manifested in his word through the preach-
                   ing with which I have been entrusted by command of God
                   our Savior; to Titus, my true child in a common faith." Titus
                   1:1-4, RSV.

                      Paul's consistency and foresight in handling this letter to
                   Titus revealed his understanding of the task that they both
                   faced. After Paul left Crete, when others joined the congre-
                   gation who thus were not present when Titus was appointed
                   to leadership, the question of authority would surely arise. This
                   letter constituted Titus's credentials, providing great authority
                   for the strong counsel that Paul gave in specific areas.
                       The Greek word, here translated "knowledge," refers to
                   the understanding that comes through experience. More than
                   mere theological information is meant. "Man's advantages for
                   obtaining a knowledge of the truth .. . will prove of no benefit
                   to him unless the heart is open to receive the truth, and there
                   is a conscientious surrender of every habit and practice that
                   is opposed to its principles. To those who thus yield themselves
                   to God, having an honest desire to know and to do His will,
                   the truth is revealed as the power of God for their salvation."
                   —The Desire of Ages, pages 455, 456.
                       In his salutation Paul keeps the priorities straight and the
                   uniqueness of Christianity clear. The Cretans seemed to have
                   had their share of theological speculators and philosophical
                   charlatans (1:9-16). The whole point of Christianity, the theme
                   that permeates all of Paul's epistles, is that God wants to con-
                   demn "sin in the flesh" (Rom. 8:3) by developing the life of
                   faith that produces godliness (God-likeness).

THINK IT THROUGH       Am I living up to all the knowledge I now have? Do I note
                   that the desire to study spiritual matters is closely linked
                   with my willingness to apply the truth I already know in my
                   daily experience?

                      "A knowledge of the truth depends not so much upon
                   strength of intellect as upon pureness of purpose, the simplicity
                   of an earnest, dependent faith."—Christ's Object Lessons,

         Part 2      How is error to be met in the Christian church?
      HOW TO
 REFUTE ERROR        "He [the bishop] must hold firm to the sure word as taught,
                  so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine
                  and also to confute those who contradict it. For there are
                  many insubordinate men, empty talkers and deceivers . . . ;
                  they must be silenced." Titus 1:9, 10, RSV.

                     Here Paul amplifies what he had said regarding elders in
                  Timothy's instruction, that is, "apt to teach." 1 Tim. 3:2. In addi-
                  tion to a character beyond reproach, the elder should be rec-
                  ognized for his intellectual grasp of the gospel and the chief
                  arguments against the gospel.
                      "Some think that an education or a thorough knowledge of
                  the Scriptures is of little consequence if only a man has the
                  Spirit. But God never sends His Spirit to sanction ignorance."
                  —Gospel Workers, pages 105, 106.
                      Paul is here concerned, not about open and free discussion
                  which has always been the atmosphere in which the church
                  has flourished best, but about deceivers whose end product is
                  not godliness. Differences of opinion there will always be.
                  Those who must be silenced are those whose teachings lead
                  to lowered ethical standards and worldly accommodation.
                      The most effective method to silence such disrupters who
                  would tailor the church after their own image is to let truth
                  be seen in its simplicity and adequacy. The authority of truth
                  is far more impressive than the authority of mere office.
                      "We are on dangerous ground when we cannot meet to-
                  gether like Christians, and courteously examine 'controverted
                  points. I feel like fleeing from the place lest I receive the mold
                  of those who cannot candidly investigate the doctrines of the
                  Bible.
                      "Those who cannot impartially examine the evidences of a
                  position that differs from theirs, are not fit to teach in any de-

           Part 3   Why is sin self-deceiving?
THE PSYCHOLOGY
       OF TRUTH     "Unto the pure all things are pure: but to them that are
     AND ERROR defiled   and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
                  and conscience is defiled. They profess that they know God;
                   but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobe-
                   dient, and unto every good work reprobate." Titus 1:15, 16.

                       A very helpful psychological truth is here emphasized: When
                   the heart (or spirit of man) is right with God, contact with what
                   man has declared unclean cannot make the pure in heart im-
                   pure. Conversely, when the heart is not right with God, no
                   amount of religious activity can make the heart pure. See
                   Matt. 15:10-20.
                       The Greek word for "unbelieving" would better be trans-
                   lated "those without faith." The man of faith discerns truth and
                   error because he has his eye on the external word of Scripture
                   and his heart open to the internal word of the Spirit.
                       The kind of knowledge these teachers (without faith) have
                   is different than the knowledge learned by "God's elect." Titus
                   1:1. These church members without genuine faith possess only
                    information. It never seems to get to the heart so that the life
                   is changed.
                       "Many profess to know God, and yet deny Him in their
                    works. They reckon themselves among God's peculiar, chosen
                   people, who have a special, solemn message entrusted to their
                    keeping to sanctify their lives and to give to the world, and
                   yet the power of the truth is scarcely felt or manifested in our
                   midst in zealous work for God. . . .
                       "What greater delusion can deceive the human mind than
                   that in which individuals flatter themselves that they have the
                   truth, that they are on the only sure foundation, and that God
                   accepts their works because they are actively engaged in
                    some work in the cause of God, when they are sinning against
                   Him by walking contrary to the expressed will of God? They
                   work mechanically, like machinery; but preparation of heart,
                   the sanctification of the character, is wanting."—Testimonies

Making Character a Credit to Doctrine           LESSON 8         ❑   Wednesday
                                                                      August 20

         Part 4      How does Paul connect doctrine and behavior?
  LIVING A LIFE
  THAT HONORS        "But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
                  that the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
      TRUTH-1
                  in charity, and in patience. The aged women likewise, that
                  they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers,
                  not given to much wine, teachers of good things." Titus 2:1-3.

                      Paul never tires of this theme that is stressed many times
                  in his letters to Timothy and Titus—the truth of the gospel will
                  refine a person, both in character and in the externals that
                  reveal his character.
                      "The truth should be presented in a manner which will make
                  it attractive to the intelligent mind. . . . How important that
                  the cause of truth be stripped of everything like a false and
                  fanatical excitement, that the truth may stand upon its own
                  merits, revealing its native purity and exalted character.
                      "The truth of God will never degrade but will elevate the
                  receiver, refine his taste, sanctify his judgment, and perfect him
                  for the company of the pure and holy angels in the kingdom
                  of God."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp. 414, 415.
                      Older men and women in the congregation are here given
                  specific counsel. Paul chooses his words carefully. "Temper-
                  ate," for example, is a translation of a Greek word that means
                   self-mastery. Excess, although not to be condoned, may be
                  understood easier when observed in youth. But adult Christians
                  give evidence of their real maturity when they consistently
                  exhibit self-control in physical, mental, and emotional behavior.
                      Older women are specifically counselled to be examples of
                   reverent behavior, as befitting sacred persons (as the Greek
                   clearly states). Such recognition of women was a new day in
                   the world and provided the basis for the elevation of woman-
                   hood by the Christian church as time passed.
                       Christian women, whose children may be grown, have a sec-
                   ond responsibility almost as great—the training by example
                   and precept of the young women in the church.


THINK IT THROUGH      Does my dress, my speech, my home, my choice of TV
                   programs and books, et cetera, reflect the quality of the
                   truth that I profess?

                                                                        August 21

            Part 5   What special counsel does Paul give young women and
     LIVING A LIFE men?
     THAT HONORS
                     "Train the young women to love their husbands and chil-
         TRUTH-2
                   dren, to be sensible, chaste, domestic, kind, and submissive
                   to their husbands, that the word of God may not be dis-
                   credited. Likewise urge the younger men to control them-
                   selves." Titus 2:4-6, RSV.

                       An interesting feature of Paul's counsel is that he delegates
                   to the older women in the church, not to Titus, the task of train-
                   ing the young women. Male counsel might be helpful to a de-
                   gree, but genuine Christian women older in years should be
                   the most effective in helping young women establish their
                   homes so that they are a credit to the church in the commu-
                   nity.
                       The young married women should be devoted to their hus-
                   bands and children. Some will have great difficulty understand-
                   ing Paul's counsel, thinking that such an appeal for domestic
                   leadership would be restricting their rights as persons. But
                   Paul's words here have often been understood only after great
                   regret.
                       The attribute, "domestic," emphasizes the high stress placed
                   on the wife and mother as the queen of the home. Proverbs 31
                   comes to mind.
                       Paul's fullest presentation regarding the relationship of
                   Christian wife and husband is found in Ephesians 5:22, 23; he
                   wants no mistake made—Christianity does not alter the mar-
                   riage relationship—only enhances it.
                       Paul's counsel to younger men seems brief, but not so when
                   we think of the extended counsel to Titus and to Timothy who
                   were to be living models for young men in their churches.
                   Self-mastery is the goal set for all; the sooner it is learned, the
                   happier that person will be.

THINK IT THROUGH     How much care do I devote to finding self-mastery? Am I
                   more often the solution seeker or the problem maker when
                   something goes wrong at home or work?

                       "Forbearance and unselfishness mark the words and acts of
                   all who live the new life in Christ. As you seek to live His life,
                   striving to conquer self and selfishness and to minister to the
                   needs of others, you will gain victory after victory. Thus your
                   influence will bless the world."—The Ministry of Healing, page

          Part 6 Why should Titus and every other church member be a
 LIVING MODELS model of good behavior?
  OF GOD'S WAY
                     "Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds, and
                 in your teaching show integrity, gravity, and sound speech
                 that cannot be censured, so that an opponent may be put to
                 shame, having nothing evil to say of us." "So that in every-
                 thing they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior." Titus
                 2:7, 8, 10, RSV.

                      The unbelieving world has the right to expect something
                   exceptionally different and distinctly better from those who
                   proclaim that they have the only gospel and know the world's
                   only Saviour.
                      The Greek construction emphasizes that Titus has already
                   been a good model, and that he should "keep on" being such.
                   Probably the best lesson that could be taught in pagan Crete
                   would be the living model of young Titus; self-restrained man-
                   hood is always a welcome sight.
                      Every Christian is being closely watched by the youth and
                   others, in the church and without. Opponents of the truth are
                   undone when they are up against a life-style that indeed reflects
                   "integrity, gravity, and sound speech." The world is waiting,
                   not primarily for new methods or even a new message, but new
                   men.

THINK IT THROUGH      How seriously do I consider my speech, my everyday con-
                   versation, to be an index of my character?

                      "As followers of Christ we should make our words such as
                   to be a help and an encouragement to one another in the
                   Christian life. Far more than we do, we need to speak of the
                   precious chapters in our experience. We should speak of the
                   mercy and loving-kindness of God, of the matchless depths of
                   the Saviour's love. Our words should be words of praise and
                   thanksgiving. If the mind and heart are full of the love of God,
                   this will be revealed in the conversation. It will not be a difficult
                   matter to impart that which enters into our spiritual life. Great
                   thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth, unself-
                   ish purposes, yearnings for piety and holiness, will bear fruit
                   in words that reveal the character of the heart treasure. When
                   Christ is thus revealed in our speech, it will have power in
                   winning souls to Him."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 338.

                                          He made clear that God makes the
                                          first move toward man, that love
                                          does not wait for lovable objects
                                          before there is an invitation to share
                                          fellowship; at His second coming
                                          He will open wide the gate to eter-

                                          "zealous for good deeds." Titus
                                          2:14. In other words, the seeds of
                                          the kingdom planted at His first
                                          coming will be harvested at His
                                           second coming.

                                           will depend upon how soon that
                                           harvest will mature. "'When the

         Part 1   Do all men have an opportunity to be saved?
GRACE PROVIDES
       REASON     "For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of
     FOR HOPE all men, training us to renounce irreligion and worldly pas-
                   sions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world,
                   awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our
                   great God and Savior Jesus Christ." Titus 2:11-13, RSV.

                       It is difficult to understand how the perverted doctrine of
                   predestination and kindred errors arose in view of this text and
                   others such as John 1:9 and 1 Timothy 2:3-6. "The Spirit of
                   God is freely bestowed to enable every man to lay hold upon
                   the means of salvation. . . . Men fail of salvation through their
                   own willful refusal of the gift of life."—The Great Controversy,
                   page 262. Every person in his quiet, honest moments will ac-
                   knowledge that the light of a better way to live has often flashed
                   in his life.
                       The light that grace brings to the heart opens up a way of
                   life that is contrary to selfish indulgence. It says No to all
                   that is self-centered and this-world oriented. It says Yes to a
                   totally different life-style which is characterized by self-mastery,
                   piety, and harmony with God's expectations.
                       This dramatic triumph of grace is motivated in part by the
                   happy hope that Jesus is returning to this earth and will invite
                   all those who have been changed by grace to live in His king-
                   dom. The return of Jesus is the double blessing adding to the
                   rewards a godly life provides even in this life.
                       The Greek is colorful: "Make a habit of watching." Keeping
                   the return of Jesus ever before us will provide proper perspec-
                   tive as we go about our daily decision making.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my life very different from the respectable people
                   around me who do not include the return of Jesus in their
                   thinking? Is my difference in the world more a matter of
                   words than of behavior?

The Fruitage of Grace LESSON 9                                        ❑ Monday
                                                                       August 25

          Part 2  Did Jesus come to save us in our sins or from our sins?
GRACE DISPOSES
    OF THE SIN    "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from
      PROBLEM all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zeal-
                   ous of good works." Titus 2:14.

                      These few words summarize how God intends to dispose of
                   the sin problem. He will not pretend we're good when we really
                   aren't. In the last analysis those who truly want their sins for-
                   given will be those who have forsaken them.
                      "The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of
                   sin; it means taking away our sins, and filling the vacuum with
                   the graces of the Holy Spirit. . . . When Christ reigns in the
                   soul, there is purity, freedom from sin. The glory, the fullness,
                   the completeness of the gospel plan is fulfilled in the life."—
                   Christ's Object Lessons, pages 419, 420.
                      The chief purpose of Christ's incarnation was to prove that,
                   even after thousands of years of sin, men and women could
                   live without sin by the power of the indwelling Spirit. His per-
                   fect life in human flesh broke the spell of Satan. No longer
                   could Satan claim that God was asking too much from His
                   creation.
                      Further, Jesus promised all men that if they would place
                   their trust in Him, He would help them to be purified from all
                   iniquity. Ellen White wrote: "He did not consent to sin. Not
                   even by a thought did He yield to temptation. So it may be with
                   us. Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He was fitted
                   for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He
                   came to make us partakers of the divine nature. So long as
                   we are united to Him by faith, sin has no more dominion over
                   us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to lay
                   fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to
                   perfection of character."—The Desire of Ages, page 123.

THINK IT THROUGH      Have I made Christ's sacrifice worthwhile? Has He really
                   redeemed me from all iniquity?


                      "The world needs a practical demonstration of what the
                   grace of God can do in restoring to human beings their lost
                   kingship, giving them mastery of themselves. There is nothing
                   that the world needs so much as a knowledge of the gospel's
                   saving power revealed in Christlike lives."—The Ministry of

         Part 3    How serious is Paul regarding the quality life expected, of
       GRACE IS Christians?
     PRACTICAL
                       "Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all author-
                   ity. Let no one disregard you. Remind them to be submissive
                   to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for any
                   honest work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to
                   be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all men." Titus
                   2:15 to 3:2, RSV.

                      Paul's command to the church is to "declare . . . ; exhort
                   and reprove. . . . Let no one disregard you." The church must
                   be kept pure if the young within are to have good reason to
                   stay in. Otherwise, the lack of integrity and courage to call
                   sin by its right name will confuse them, causing some to feel
                   that there is no place except within their own feelings where
                   they can decide right from wrong.
                      Paul reminds Titus that Christians have civic responsibili-
                   ties; that Christians, in applying Christ's way of life, should be
                   examples of right conduct to those outside the church, begin-
                   ning with civil officials.
                      "It is not wise to find fault continually with what is done by
                   the rulers of government. It is not our work to attack individ-
                   uals or institutions. We should exercise great care lest we be
                   understood as putting ourselves in opposition to the civil au-
                   thorities....
                      "We should not work in a manner that will mark us out as
                   seeming to advocate treason. We should weed out from our
                   writings and utterances every expression, that, taken by itself,
                   could be so misrepresented as to make it appear antagonistic
                   to law and order. Everything should be carefully considered,
                   lest we place ourselves on record as encouraging disloyalty
                   to our country and its laws."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 394.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I seek for ways to assist others in providing commu-
                   nity services? Or do I receive more from others than I put in
                   personally? Am I known for being courteous and constructive?

                      "You [our ministers] may be true to principle, you may be
                   just, honest, and religious; but with it all you must cultivate
                   true tenderness of heart, kindness, and courtesy. If a person is
                   in error, be the more kind to him; if you are not courteous, you
                   may drive him away from Christ."—Testimonies to Ministers,

The Fruitage of Grace         LESSON 9                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      August 27

         Part 4 How do all members of the Godhead cooperate in saving
      GODHEAD man?
     UNITED IN
                "But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our
        GRACE Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of deeds done by
                   us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the
                   washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit, which
                   he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior."
                   Titus 3:4-6, RSV.

                       The loving-kindness of God is in contrast to the malice,
                   envy and hatred that dominates the unconverted man (verse 3).
                   The only logical response when a person learns of Him is the
                   life of faith that breaks forth in obedience to all that God wants
                   him to do. See Titus 2:12.
                       This God appeared to men. He wasn't thought up by wise
                   men, nor does He pervade nature so that it is as natural as
                   breathing to think religious thoughts. God is a Person who has
                   made many contacts with mankind, the chief encounter being
                   the incarnation.
                       Paul summarized the cooperation of the Godhead by noting
                   the historical witness of Jesus and the internal work of the
                   Holy Spirit. The historical, external witness is joined with the
                   always current, internal witness, joining the head and the heart
                   in unshakable conviction. See John 15:26.
                       God does not wait for any man to make the first move. God's
                   love comes first, awakening the response of faith. Both the
                   miracle of regeneration (second birth) and the renewing process
                   that lasts until every un-Christlike habit is completely worked
                   out of the life are results of the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.
                   Man's task is to cooperate, willing every day to conform his
                   choices to the will of God.

THINK IT THROUGH      Have I allowed God to do everything that He has wanted
                   to do in my life? Am I completely renewed?

                       "His love received, will make us, in like manner, kind and
                   tender, not merely toward those who please us, but to the
                   most faulty and erring and sinful.
                       "The children of God are those who are partakers of His
                   nature. It is not earthly rank, nor birth, nor nationality, nor re-
                   ligious privilege, which proves that we are members of the
                   family of God; it is love, a love that embraces all humanity."

         Part 5   If grace is not thwarted, where will it finally lead any

  STORES RIGHT
                  "So that we might be justified by his grace and become
 RELATIONSHIPS
                   heirs in hope of eternal life. The saying is sure." Titus 3:7, 8a,
                   RSV.
                      As a result of the Holy Spirit's work in the new birth and
                   the beginning of a new life (new creation, 2 Cor. 5:17), the
                   new Christian stands as a restored son in the family of God.
                   He is now in the right relation with his Father when before
                   he was in a "far country."
                      Being a restored son makes him also an heir, looking for-
                   ward to the day when the inheritance will indeed be his.
                     What part does faith play when man is justified by grace?
                   Eph. 2:8.

                      "Faith is the condition upon which God has seen fit to prom-
                   ise pardon to sinners; not that there is any virtue in faith
                   whereby salvation is merited, but because faith can lay hold
                   of the merits of Christ, the remedy provided for sin."—Ellen
                   G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1073.
                      What is the real test that genuine faith has truly allowed
                   grace to have its way?

                       "Justification by faith in Christ will be made manifest in
                   transformation of character. This is the sign to the world of
                   the truth of the doctrines we profess. The daily evidence that
                   we are a living church is seen in the fact that we are prac-
                   ticing the Word. A living testimony goes forth to the world in
                   consistent Christian action."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                   Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1071.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the evidence I have that I have been justified by
                   grace? Am I more of a renewed person today than I was a
                   year ago?

                      In order that his personal witness about justification would
                   not be misunderstood, Paul emphatically concluded: "The
                   saying is sure." See 1 Tim. 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; 2 Tim. 2:11. This
                   should be the quiet, dynamic witness that every Christian, by
                   speech and life, can tell to his child or to his nonbelieving
                   neighbor.The peace promised when a man is in the right rela-
                   tion with God (Rom. 5:1) is one of the blessings that confirms
                   this great truth.

                   have believed in God may be careful to apply themselves to
                   good deeds; these are excellent and profitable to men."

                      "Let our people learn to apply themselves to good deeds,
                   so as to help cases of urgent need, and not to be unfruitful."
                   Titus 3:8, 14, RSV.

                       Paul will soar in theological explanation of what God has
                   done for man, but he never forgets the earthly reality of man's
                   responsibility in accepting grace. God does not force grace on
                   anyone. He will only stand at the door and knock. His purpose
                   is to assist man in changing his ways; man's part is to will to
                   change, and God's part is to provide the power to change.
                       Grace is inoperative where there is no faith that leads to
                   good works. There is more to Christianity than "only believe."
                       "The religion of Christ is something more than talk. The
                   righteousness of Christ consists in right actions and works
                   from pure, unselfish motives. Outside righteousness, while the
                   inward adorning is wanting, will be of no avail."—Testimonies,

                       The object of sowing gospel seed is to produce a harvest—
                   a fruitful response of people who have allowed the truth to
                   assume complete control in their habit patterns.
                       "The divine Husbandman looks for a harvest as the reward
                   of His labor and sacrifice. Christ is seeking to reproduce Him-
                   self in the hearts of men; and He does this through those who
                    believe in Him. The object of the Christian life is fruit bearing
                   —the reproduction of Christ's character in the believer, that
                   it may be reproduced in others."—Christ's Object Lessons,

            Part 1  What simple fact anchored Paul during this dreary moment
     PORTRAIT OF in his life?
       A VETERAN    "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, ac-
                   cording to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, to
                   Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace,
                   from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. I thank God
                   whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that
                   without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers
                   night and day." 2 Tim. 1:1-3.
                       Truly a matchless farewell! How would you have addressed
                   your beloved friend for the last time?
                       Here was Paul, humiliated by men, in a dreary dungeon re-
                   served for criminals, yet he held his head high—he was still
                   an apostle of our Lord Jesus. No Nero could take that away
                   from him.
                       The essence of the gospel is chiseled here in few words—
                   "the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus." Sin had opened
                   the door to death. Everything about sin destroys. The end of
                   sin is bitterness even though the first sip may be exhilarating.
                   But the good news about Jesus is that He is Life, and He came
                   to give man life "more abundantly." John 10:10. This life
                   changes man now, gives him a whole new reason to live now,
                   gives him new energy and new hope in this life. But there is
                   life beyond—a thought very high on Paul's mind at that mo-
                   ment. The end was near for Paul but not really; the promise of
                   his Lord was that there was eternal life ahead.
                       What prayerful wish does Paul ask for Timothy? Verse 2.
                      Paul's tender prayer for Timothy sums up the blessedness
                   of genuine Christian living: Grace, mercy, and peace to you,
                   dear Timothy. Only in his two letters to Timothy does Paul
                   unite these three terms. They are ready to be enjoyed by any-
                   one who, like Timothy, is committed to God the Father and
                   Christ Jesus our Lord.
THINK IT THROUGH      When I am in a difficult place, lonely and perhaps mis-
                   understood, do I find reason to give thanks as did Paul?

                       Paul is no complainer. He lets the happy memories that line
                   life's hallway flood over the present. He recounts the occasions
                   wherein he and Timothy have seen the intervening hand of
                   God. He has seen new churches spring up out of unlikely
                   places. He has seen young men dream and hope when they
                   had lost their courage before Jesus came into their lives.
                       Every Christian should be lining the hall of memory now so
                   that there will be many occasions to give thanks in the days
                   ahead.

         Part 2  What is the common bond that tied Paul, Timothy, and
  PORTRAIT OF Timothy's family together?
    A BELOVED
                 "When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is
      DISCIPLE
                   in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy
                   mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also." 2 Tim.
                   1:5.

                      Here Paul is saying that every person is, to a large extent,
                   the product of his family background. That is why a good biog-
                   raphy does not begin with the featured person's birth but with
                   the parents and grandparents as well.
                      Paul thanks God for his own parents (verse 3) who must
                   have taught him well regarding the God of Israel; he now
                   recognizes in Timothy the same faith that animated Lois and
                   Eunice. Faith is a total life response to God. It can best be
                   taught by example. How grateful both Paul and Timothy were
                   to their parents.
                      The bond between Paul and Timothy, between the aged
                   veteran and the stalwart younger disciple, was their common
                   faith. They recognized this "sincere," unpretending faith in
                   each other, and mutual confidence was the result.


THINK IT THROUGH      Am I doing all that I can to transmit faith to those who
                   are closest to me? Is it easy for them to have faith in God by
                   watching how I live?

                      Without actually stating the fact, how could Paul emphasize
                   more the importance of parental responsibility and privilege?
                   Paul points every child or recipient of faith to the simple fact
                   that faith is usually a gift which we owe to someone else's
                   steadfast example.

                      What kind of spirit did the faith of Paul and Timothy
                   create? Verse 7.

                      What a remarkable combination of words—how easy it is
                   to have power without love, power without self-control, or self-
                   control without love, et cetera. Paul knew what it took to face
                   up to earth's toughest challenges and not flinch; he knew how
                   to turn every difficulty into a way to preach Jesus Christ, by
                   example if not by word.

          Part 3   What great facts kept Paul and Timothy from being
     A POWERFUL ashamed of Jesus?
         GOSPEL
                       "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our
                   Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflic-
                   tions of the gospel according to the power of God; who hath
                   saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according
                   to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
                   which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
                   but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour
                   Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought
                   life and immortality to light through the gospel." 2 Tim.
                   1:8-10.

                      Paul and Timothy had learned through experience that God
                   was very near, in peace and crisis. They had seen their own
                   spirit made bold when faithless men would have capitulated.
                   They had seen power, love, and self-control develop in their
                   own character. Such is the greatest proof of the existence and
                   power of God.
                      The time may come for every Christian, as it did for Timothy,
                   when it will be a social disgrace to identify with command-
                   ment keepers. Paul's call still rings: Join me in suffering dis-
                   grace if need be because we represent the God of the gospel!
                      The gospel is the story of Jesus who banished the fear of
                   death because He demonstrated that He held the keys of the
                   grave. That is power! The gospel also proclaims that Jesus can
                   banish those destructive forces that kill the spirit, such as
                   envy, fear, pride, and covetousness. That is power! Such a
                   gospel is far more than only the forgiveness of sins.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I live as though the power of the gospel is real? What
                   evidence is there in my life that such a God as Paul talks
                   about truly exists?

                      "The work of pruning and purifying to fit us for heaven is a
                   great work and will cost us much suffering and trial, because
                   our wills are not subjected to the will of Christ. We must go
                   through the furnace till the fires have consumed the dross and
                   we are purified and reflect the divine image. . . .
                      "No cross, no crown. . . . Our Saviour was tried in every
                   possible way, and yet He triumphed in God continually. It is

         Part 4   What was Paul's anchor that empowered him to be such
       REALITY a remarkable Christian witness?
  OF PERSONAL
                  "For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and apostle
   KNOWLEDGE
                   and teacher, and therefore I suffer as I do. But I am not
                   ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and I am sure
                   that he is able to guard until that Day what has been en-
                   trusted to me." 2 Tim. 1:11, 12, RSV.

                       Paul was not ashamed even when the whole world was cry-
                   ing, Shame! Why? Because Paul knew something and Someone
                   that his accusers did not know. That made all the difference.
                   Even though the preaching of the gospel will always incite op-
                   position and hatred, the Christian knows that he will get no
                   better treatment than his Master received.
                       Paul's religion centered in a Person whom he knew through
                   experience not merely in information about that Person. "The
                   one great purpose of his Christian life had been to serve Him
                   whose name had once filled him with contempt; and from this
                   purpose no opposition or persecution had been able to turn
                   him aside. His faith, made strong by effort and pure by sacri-
                   fice, upheld and strengthened him."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                   page 500.
                       There is some uncertainty regarding the exact meaning of
                   verse 12: The King James version reads "to keep that which I
                   have committed unto him against that day." The Greek reads
                   literally "to guard my deposit unto that day" and could be
                   referring to something Paul has entrusted to God or something
                   that God has entrusted to Paul.
                       The context suggests strongly the latter meaning. God was
                   able to guard the gospel that Paul above all others had spear-
                    headed throughout the Mediterranean world.
                       At this bleak moment when the great teacher was about to
                    be killed in disgrace, Timothy was reminded that this deposit
                    of truth was in greater hands than Paul's. Jesus would guard
                    the preaching of the gospel. Men die, but Jesus guards their
                    work and hands it to faithful men who carry on until "that
                    Day" when such labor will be forever over.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do I live as if the gospel's future lies in the hands of men
                   or in the hands of God? Is there a limit to how much God
                   can do if men fail Him?

                                                                     September 4

        Part 5        What did Paul urge Timothy to do?
RESPONSIBILITY
     OF FAITH         "Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard
                   of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. That good
                   thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost
                   which dwelleth in us." 2 Tim. 1:13, 14.

                      Paul knew that the temptation would always be there to
                   trim the truth, to leave out the unpopular. Why create a crisis?
                   Paul knew also that this would lead to spiritual defeat and
                   eventual disaster.
                      "Sound" words could be literally translated, "healthy"
                   words. Anything other than Paul's straight, clear teaching
                   leads to spiritual infection and moral disease.
                      Although intelligent people know that truth must always be
                   communicated in a modern way, the "healthy" words of Paul
                   are still relevant and can be quickly understood. If Paul were
                   discussing chemistry or astronomy, there would be no ques-
                   tion regarding the necessity of bringing him up to date. But
                   Paul is concerned with faith and sin, responsibility and rebel-
                   lion, and these categories have not changed. Man still needs
                   a Saviour, not only from the penalty of sin but from its power
                   as well.
                      Men, in listening to Paul, could see that his message had
                   been produced by a brilliant mind and a great heart of love.
                   Such was Timothy's challenge—to carry on now in Paul's stead,
                   linking faith and love to a wonderful gospel.
                      In verse 12 the gospel is considered a valuable treasure,
                   committed to Paul and now to Timothy, as a great and sacred
                   trust. So it has been given to everyone who has ever truly
                   called Jesus Lord. What a trust! How few know how valuable
                   this knowledge is! How easily this deposit gets marred in the
                   hands of proud men!
                      Paul and Timothy had already spent many days contending
                   with those who considered themselves teachers of the gospel.
                   "Guard the deposit" has been one of the highest duties resting
                   on the Christian church for 2,000 years.
                      The guarding cannot be done in human wisdom alone. Only
                   the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth, can provide the insight and
                   perseverence such a duty demands.


THINK IT THROUGH      Do I guard the truth so that others are not confused when
                   they watch my life pattern or hear what I say?

                                                                     September 5

        Part 6  What disappointment did Paul face in his closing days?
     SHADOWS
       BEFORE   "This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be
     NOONDAY turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermo-
                   genes. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for
                   he oft refreshed me. . .. The Lord grant unto him that he may
                   find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things
                   he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."
                   2 Tim. 1:15-18.

                       Paul knew the pain of humiliation by enemies and rejec-
                   tion by brethren. Because he could write with such candor and
                   courage, many thousands in the years to follow have been
                   made strong as they were reminded of his spiritual resources.
                       Jesus understood what it meant to be forsaken by professed
                   followers. See John 6:66; Mark 14:50.
                       The glimpse of Onesiphorus is refreshing and worthy of
                   much study. When he heard of Paul's plight, his family appar-
                   ently made it possible for Onesiphorus to leave their Ephesus
                   home and make his way to troubled Rome. Paul had done so
                   much for them—it was now their turn.
                       Far from being ashamed of Paul's predicament, he searched
                   from Christian to Christian until he discovered where Paul had
                   been imprisoned. Somehow he managed to get through, risking
                   all the hazards that could easily have befallen him as he iden-
                   tified himself with Paul, indicted as a criminal.
                       Paul did not forget such mercies, and he wanted Timothy
                   to do all he could for this man's family back in Ephesus. More
                   than that, Paul's prayer was that Onesiphorus would be granted
                   a merciful entrance into the kingdom of our Lord "in that day."
                       For Paul "that day" was about all he had left to look forward
                   10. How many Christians in the centuries that followed took
                   courage because of Paul's courage and the gospel that he
                   faithfully proclaimed.
                       True friendship cannot be bought; it lasts through hardship,
                   suffering, and disgrace.

THINK IT THROUGH      How reliable has my friendship been to those who have
                   been wrongfully spoken against? Have I treated with mercy
                   those who have borne the heat of the day?

wholly to resist."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 511. In this second
chapter of the last letter he would
write before his execution he
stressed the importance of quality
control as the gospel treasure is
passed on from one generation to
another.
   He made it clear that every gen-
uine Christian will suffer misunder-
standing and outright hardship,
even as had his Lord and Paul him-
self. He calls for the fortitude of the
soldier, the discipline of the trained
athlete, and the perseverance of a
good farmer.
    He expects no shoddy work from
those who will carry on where he
leaves off. Christianity is not primar-
ily a wonderful feeling but a great
response of complete dedication to
the Lord of glory. This complete
dedication will be evident in the
Christian's fervent attention to self-
development so that he will be
ready for whatever needs may arise
in the work of serving his Lord.

         Part 1       What are the particular characteristics of a good soldier?
 THE CHRISTIAN
       SOLDIER        "Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ
                   Jesus. No soldier on service gets entangled in civilian pur-
                   suits, since his aim is to satisfy the one who enlisted him."
                   2 Tim. 2:3, 4, RSV.

                       In a world where sin abounds suffering is inevitable. Paul,
                   however, refers to the added suffering that anyone who follows
                   the example of Jesus will experience. See 3:12.
                       The comparison of a Christian life with that of a soldier's
                   suggests that, for both, achievement requires fortitude, often
                   under distressing circumstances. Soldiers do not expect a safe
                   or easy time.
                       The forces of evil do all that is possible to destroy the be-
                   liever's spirit. These forces do not come labeled as evil; they
                   may be close loved ones or long-time friends as well as jealous,
                   conniving associates. Ellen G. White wrote of the youth: "They
                   should be taught that this world is not a parade ground, but
                   a battlefield. All are called to endure hardness, as good sol-
                   diers. . . . Let them be taught that the true test of character
                   is found in the willingness to bear burdens, to take the hard
                   place, to do the work that needs to be done, though it brings
                   no earthly recognition or reward."—Education, page 295.
                       Furthermore, good soldiers concentrate on what they have
                   committed themselves to do; they are wholly at their com-
                   manding officer's disposal. In fact, concentration on their main
                   task would probably do much to protect their own life as well
                   as those around them. This admonition, directed especially to
                   the ministry, surely applies to all Christians in the larger sense.
                      The full-time denominational employee who is wholly con-
                   secrated to his calling should engage in no outside activities
                   that drain his energies or his time from the possibilities and
                   challenges of his task for which he is already paid. See The
                   Acts of the Apostles, pages 365, 366.
                      The nondenominational employee must also sort out the
                   priorities in his life so that ample time and energy may be de-
                   voted to his Christian calling.

THINK IT THROUGH       How much time do I devote each week to personal Chris-
                   tian witnessing? Am I letting the good things of life rob me
                   of the best that I may be doing?

         Part 2     What are the special characteristics of successful athletes?
 THE CHRISTIAN
       ATHLETE     "An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according
                to the rules." 2 Tim. 2:5, RSV.
   AND FARMER
                      Paul carries through the concept of fortitude begun in his
                   soldier illustration. The successful athlete also must win ac-
                   cording to the rules; he must compete honestly and be so
                   recognized by his associates.
                      A successful athlete determines long before he wins his
                   victories not only that he will abide by the rules during the
                   contest, but that he will rigorously train by the rules that lead
                   to success. Great accomplishment is not happenstance; dis-
                   cipline and personal sacrifice are the predominating aspects
                   of his life.
                      "The object of discipline is the training of the child for self-
                   government. He should be taught self-reliance and self-control.
                   Therefore as soon as he is capable of understanding, his
                   reason should be enlisted on the side of obedience. . . . Help
                   him to see that all things are under law, and that disobedience
                   leads, in the end, to disaster and suffering."—Education, page
                   287.

                      What is the special characteristic of the successful farmer?
                   Verse 6.

                       The concepts of fortitude, discipline, and patience are‘car-
                   ried through from the soldier and athlete. Who questions the
                   hard work of the farmer on whom all the world depends for
                   food, and thus life itself?
                       Paul's spiritual lesson is this: Those who toil to bring salva-
                   tion to others should be partaking of that salvation themselves.
                   If Christians are not partaking of this spiritual harvest in their
                   own lives, their influence will become barren.
                       "It is our own character and experience that determine our
                   influence upon others. In order to convince others of the power
                   of Christ's grace, we must know its power in our own hearts
                   and lives. The gospel we present for the saving of souls must
                   be the gospel by which our own souls are saved."—The Min-

           Part 3   What connection do you see between the lessons to be
     THE WILLING learned from the soldier-athlete-farmer illustration and Jesus?
       SUFFERER     "Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended
                  from David, as preached in my gospel, the gospel for which
                  I am suffering and wearing fetters, like a criminal. But the
                  word of God is not fettered. Therefore I endure everything for
                  the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation
                  which in Christ Jesus goes with eternal glory." 2 Tim. 2:8-10,
                  RSV.
                     The main concept so far in the second letter to Timothy is
                  that the genuine Christian will face suffering, especially be-
                  cause he is a Christian. Now Timothy is told (as a parting re-
                  minder) never to forget our Lord. When you are tempted to
                  avoid pain and hard times, Paul tells him, remember Jesus
                  and think again. When you fully understand the experience of
                  Jesus, then you will realize that Christians are called to suffer
                 also.
                     Before the victory, there is the cross! Suffering is the road
                  to glory. Paul is here speaking not only doctrinally but also
                 experientially when he holds up Christ's death and resurrec-
                 tion.
                     In reference to his Lord's example, Paul included the
                 thought that Jesus had descended from David. Jesus was not
                 a make-believe man. Although He mysteriously entered the
                 human stream, He did become part of the flow of heredity and
                 faced life as every other baby has had 10. "Like every child
                 of Adam He accepted the results of the working of the great
                 law of heredity.... He came with such a heredity to share our
                 sorrows and temptations, and to give us the example of a sin-
                 less life....
                     "He [the Father] permitted Him to meet life's peril in com-
                 mon with every human soul, to fight the battle as every child
                 of humanity must fight it, at the risk of failure and eternal
                 loss."—The Desire of Ages, page 49.
                     When Jesus hung on the cross, it seemed that all was lost.
                 The gospel seemed not only fettered but defeated. When Paul
                 was locked up in that dismal Roman prison soon to be ex-
                 ecuted, the gospel seemed doomed. Who could carry on in
                 Paul's stead? Paul answered the question forthrightly: "The
                 word of God is not fettered"!
                     Jesus, Paul, Timothy, and all the others who have suffered
                 for righteousness' sake through the years have had to leave
                 the scene—but the gospel moves on in the men and women
                 of faith.
THINK IT THROUGH     Do I act as if the gospel is unfettered and God still lives
                 even when hard times come into my life?

                                                                     September 10

         Part 4       What responsibility rested upon Timothy?
  THE EARNEST
      STUDENT         "Remind them of this, and charge them before the Lord to
                   avoid disputing about words, which does no good, but only
                   ruins the hearers. Do your best to present yourself to God as
                   one approved, a workman who has no need to be ashamed,
                   rightly handling the word of truth." 2 Tim. 2:14, 15, RSV.

                       There is always the danger that, for some, Christianity
                   should become a matter of doctrine only. The essentials of
                   Christianity, for such people, rest in religious information that
                   can be argued about among those who hold different view-
                   points. Even arguments that support Biblical truth may fall
                   short and ruin the hearers if Christianity is left only to the world
                   of information and logic.
                       Paul appeals to Timothy to hold high before the young men
                   whom he will train that God's genuine workmen move from
                   the head to the heart in "handling the word of truth."
                       "God requires the training of the mental faculties. He de-
                   signs that His servants shall possess more intelligence and
                   clearer discernment than the worldling, and He is displeased
                   with those who are too careless or too indolent to become
                   efficient, well-informed workers. The Lord bids us love Him
                   with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the
                   strength, and with all the mind. This lays upon us the obligation
                   of developing the intellect to its fullest capacity, that with all
                   the mind we may know and love our Creator.
                       "If placed under the control of His Spirit, the more thoroughly
                   the intellect is cultivated, the more effectively it can be used
                   in the service of God. . . .
                       "The Lord desires us to obtain all the education possible,
                   with the object in view of imparting our knowledge to others.
                   . . . We should not let slip even one opportunity of qualifying
                   ourselves intellectually to work for God. . . .
                        "Self-discipline must be practiced by everyone who would
                   be a worker for God. This will accomplish more than eloquence
                   or the most brilliant talents. An ordinary mind, well disciplined,
                   will accomplish more and higher work than will the most highly
                   educated mind and the greatest talents without self-control."

THINK IT THROUGH      Am I using all the advantages I have to improve my un-
                   derstanding of the Bible and my awareness of what is hap-
                   pening to people today? Do I find myself merely skimming
                   the surface, hoping to get by?

Portrait of Men and Women of Faith LESSON 11                        ❑ Thursday
                                                                   September II

          Part 5 What are the external evidences of a pure heart?
  EVIDENCES OF   "Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
  A PURE HEART charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure
                   heart." 2 Tim. 2:22.
                        This admonition follows several verses that appeal to every
                   Christian to be fit vessels for the Master's use. The chief con-
                    dition, no matter how or where one serves, is that each person
                   purify himself—a personal work is required before that church
                   member can be useful to others.
                        The Greek is very instructive: "Keep on fleeing . . . keep
                   on pursuing." Timothy was not being reprimanded but encour-
                   aged to maintain his already exemplary life.
                        The emphasis is not on bodily passions but on a deeper
                   level where all kinds of unholy passions reside. Think about
                   those immature passions that beset everybody, regardless of
                   age, when Jesus is not in control of feelings and ambitions.
                   With all the advantages that Christians have, there is the pos-
                   sibility that immature members will yield to the temptations of
                   pride, conceit, dogmatism, contentiousness, and inordinate
                   ambition. Keep on fleeing from such immaturity.
                        We should not make excuses for these sins of immaturity;
                   we must not negotiate with them or linger in their presence.
                   We are to flee as Joseph and Mary fled with Jesus from Her-
                   od's wrath—the same Greek word is used to describe their
                   haste.
                       There is a spiritual law about fleeing and pursuing; one
                   cannot flee sin unless he is actively pursuing righteousness.
                   Paul described this law in several ways; for example, in Colos-
                   sians 3 he talks about putting off sinful practices and putting
                   on the characteristics of Jesus.
                        There is no other way to please God and have the sanctified
                   life.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do I pick my friends because they are pursuing righteous-
                   ness, faith, love, and peace? Are these traits that which
                   attract others to me?

                      "Not all who profess to be workers for Christ are true dis-
                   ciples. Among those who bear His name, and who are even
                   numbered with His workers, are some who do not represent
                   Him in character. They are not governed by His principles.
                   These persons are often a cause of perplexity and discourage-
                   ment to their fellow workers who are young in Christian experi-
                   ence; but none need be misled. Christ has given us a perfect
                   example. He bids us follow Him."—The Ministry of Healing,

Portrait of Men and Women of Faith LESSON 11                          ❑   Friday
                                                                  September 12

         Part 6  What characteristics distinguish a person who presents
    THE KINDLY Christianity to others?
      TEACHER     "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly
                to every one, an apt teacher, forbearing, correcting his op-
                ponents with gentleness." 2 Tim. 2:24, 25, RSV.

                    Here Paul erects a measuring stick by which the Christian
                may measure his Christlikeness in dealing with others. Know-
                ing the doctrine is important and basic, but not enough.
                    The Christlike teacher is not a debater who loves the heat
                of battle; in fact, he will avoid a quarrel, knowing that Chris-
                tianity wants to win the heart as well as the head. Such a
                teacher wins by a sweet reasonableness and a gracious cour-
                tesy that disarms his opponent. The Christlike teacher can
                do it no other way.
                    "Those who are handling the great, grand, ennobling truths
                of the Word, must ever reveal a spirit deep, earnest, fervent,
                 but calm and full of sound sense that the mouths of gainsayers
                may be stopped.
                     "Those who are close students of the Word, following Christ
                in humility of soul, will not go to extremes. The Saviour never
                went to extremes, never lost self-control, never violated the
                laws of good taste. He knew when to speak and when to keep
                 silent. . . . He silenced the voice of the caviling priests by
                 penetrating beneath the surface and reaching the heart, flash-
                 ing light into the mind and awakening the conscience."—Gos-
                pel Workers, page 317.
                    Not being prepared to handle the truth properly is another
                 form of rudeness. Paul wants Timothy to stress the quality of
                 teaching skills that every church member should acquire—"apt
                 to teach."
                     Being right is important; being right with meekness is in-
                  dispensable. Such a quality is a result of the "pure heart."
                 Verse 22.
                       What is the final goal of Christian teachings? Verse 25,
                    last part.

                       Paul says that Christian teachers should do more than an-
                    swer all opposers and prove them wrong; they are to be brought
                    to repentance. There is a moral element in believing or reject-
                    ing truth. Behind the rejection of the gospel there is a rebel
                    heart unwilling to concede to God.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Do I look upon "preaching the truth" as a chance to vin-
                    dicate my position or as an opportunity to introduce another
                    to the open arms of Jesus? Do I make it easy for the other to
                    admit his error?
                                                                                93

          FORM
       WITHOUT         "But understand this, that in the last days there will come
                   times of stress. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money,
        POWER
                   proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, un-

                   fierce, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with
                   conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding
                   the form of religion but denying the power of it. Avoid such
                   people." 2 Tim. 3:1-5, RSV.

                       Paul declares under inspiration that the moral climate of
                   this world will not improve as time goes on. This simple pre-
                   diction could have saved the Western world much unfounded
                   and wishful optimism during the nineteenth century and the
                   first third of the twentieth.
                       Although every age could be described by Paul's list, he
                   seems to suggest here that the last days will be especially
                   difficult for those who prize righteousness. These times will be
                   perilous because of the kind of men and women who will bring
                   stress into the church. These are not obvious worldlings but
                   rather those who try to pass off what they do under the cloak
                   of religion. They are people whom Christians should be careful
                   about associating with—"avoid such people."
                       The characteristics of the five foolish virgins (Matt. 25) are
                   reflected in Paul's list, and Ellen White closes her description
                   of the foolish virgins with the observation that "their service
                   to God degenerates into a form. . . . The apostle Paul points
                   out that this will be the special characteristic of those who
                   live just before Christ's second coming. [2 Tim. 3:1-5, quoted]."
                   —Christ's Object Lessons, page 411.

THINK IT THROUGH      Does any one of Paul's appalling list apply to me? Do I
                   enjoy the reputation of being a Christian without enjoying
                   the power of a Spirit-filled life?

                      "Shall the selfishness and the ease of those who have
                   earthly comforts and attractive homes allure us? Shall we
                   cease as moral agencies to use our powers to the saving of
                   souls? Shall our voices be indistinct? Then God will put His
                   curse upon us who have had so great light, and inscribe upon
                   the walls of our homes: 'Lovers of pleasures more than lovers
                   of God.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 55.

                                                                   September 15

        Part 2       What are some of the marks of a counterfeit faith?
  COUNTERFEIT
        FAITH       "For among them are those who make their way into
                 households and capture weak women, burdened with sins
                 and swayed by various impulses, who will listen to anybody
                 and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth.. . . These
                 men also oppose the truth, men of corrupt mind and coun-
                 terfeit faith; but they will not get very far, for their folly will
                 be plain to all." 2 Tim. 3:6-9, RSV.

                     The astonishing aspect of Paul's summary is that among
                 these self-loving, pleasure-seeking church members would be
                 some who would actively propagate their own brand of reli-
                 gion. Their methods, however, are not open and direct; they
                 are secretive and cunning. Methods often are the first clue to
                 the authenticity of religious doctrine that sounds acceptable
                 on the surface. Another interesting feature of these tradesmen
                 of heresy is that they would rather sneak up on a certain class
                 of women than on men. Somehow they would sell their ideas
                 to souls burdened down with guilt and self-pity.
                    A tragedy of life is that so many, young and old, would
                 rather spend years searching "new thought," while shying away
                 from commitment. Gospel truth is not palatable to them, be-
                  cause it requires decision and repentance. Large indeed is
                 the amount of money collected each year by merchants of the
                 occult, secret wisdom, and "new" light.
                     The problem of ever learning without finding the truth is
                  not always the result of insincerity; it may just as easily be the
                 problem of not making a strong attempt to practice it. Such
                 people "need an experience in the truth that will enable them
                  to comprehend the elevated character of the work."—Testimo-
                 nies, Vol. 3, p. 53.
                     But Paul gave some timely advice that would help those
                  concerned with keeping the faith pure; it would save some
                  premature heresy hunting. Give them time, Paul counseled.
                  There is something clearly false about counterfeit faith as there
                  is something clearly right about truth. Error may spread for
                  a while—but it will not get far before exposing itself.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is truth for me more a matter of knowing something than
                   doing something? Does my faith bring forth the fruits of the
                   Spirit?

         Part 3    What characteristics set Paul apart from those he has
 GENUINE FAITH  described earlier in the third chapter?

                       "But thou host fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
                   purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, persecutions,
                   afflictions . . . ; what persecutions I endured: but out of them
                   all the Lord delivered me. Yea, and all that will live godly
                   in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." 2 Tim. 3:10-12.

                       In absolute contrast to the sorry description of those with
                   a counterfeit faith (verses 1-9) stands Paul's record. Timothy
                   and all his hearers, and their hearers down to the end of time,
                   should not be overwhelmed by unscrupulous, insincere church
                   members who will be responsible for great stress in the church.
                   Paul lived through no less stress, and his example is there for
                   all men to follow.
                       But Timothy, remember, he said, the Lord rescued me! He
                   and all genuine Christians would endure similar experiences if
                   they were loyal to the truth and lived a godly life. But through
                   it all, the Lord would preserve. The Greek for "thou hast fully
                   known" is literally, "you have followed." Timothy not only
                   watched, he followed just as one man would follow another
                   down a street. He had allowed Paul's faith to become his own.
                       In this summary of his life, Paul was not telling Timothy
                   anything new. With only a few hours to live, he was talking like
                   a father to his son. His faith in Jesus has made the difference
                   —the contrast between his life and that described in verses
                   1-5 is self-evident.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it that there is so little persecution in the lives of
                   church members today?

                       "The only reason is that the church has conformed to the
                   world's standard and therefore awakens no opposition. The
                   religion which is current in our day is not of the pure and holy
                   character that marked the Christian faith in the days of Christ
                   and His apostles. It is only because of the spirit of compromise
                   with sin, because the great truths of the word of God are so
                   indifferently regarded, because there is so little vital godliness
                   in the church, that Christianity is apparently so popular with
                   the world. Let there be a revival of the faith and power of the
                   early church, and the spirit of persecution will be revived, and
                   the fires of persecution will be rekindled."—The Great Con-

        Part 4   How only can the Scriptures become a basis for faith?
  SCRIPTURES,
    THE BASIS    "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned
               and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast
     OF FAITH
                   learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the
                   holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto sal-
                   vation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." 2 Tim. 3:14, 15.

                      This is a remarkable exhortation, one that many Christians
                   have overlooked or rejected. As time goes by, there will always
                   be those who feel embarrassed or dissatisfied with the old
                   truths. They must innovate. They are not satisfied with that
                   which is revealed—they must go beyond. They argue for a new
                   theology, a new morality, a new image. It may be necessary to
                   adapt methods to the changing needs and current thought
                   framework as the generations pass—but Paul's counsel is
                   "continue in [remain in] what you have learned and have
                   firmly believed." Verse 14, RSV.
                       It is one thing to have passed all examinations on the doc-
                   trines with a perfect record and quite another to allow them to
                   control the desires and decisions of life. People may know
                   doctrinal truth and yet not be firm believers. Such is the tragedy
                   of the five foolish virgins in Matthew 25.
                       The chief reasons for any man's stability and deep assur-
                   ance were also Timothy's: He knew from whom he had learned
                   the truth and he knew the Scriptures which formed the basis
                   for whatever Paul had taught him in word and example.
                       When Timothy heard Paul for the first time, he recognized
                    the voice that he had heard when he read the Scriptures. Paul
                    was no innovator; he was consistent with the Old Testament.
                    Paul claimed before Agrippa (Acts 26) that he preached nothing
                    other than what had already been predicted by the prophets.
                        Knowing about the Messiah was not enough. Timothy had
                    to recognize his need for a Saviour, repent of self-will and
                    self-indulgence, and commit his life completely to the God he
                    heard speaking to him in the Old Testament and in Paul's
                    preaching. Timothy's response to Jesus was the beginning of
                    the life of faith.

THINK IT THROUGH      Am I more concerned about what Paul said than I am con-
                   cerned about doing what Paul did? Do I memorize Paul, or
                   do I see what Paul saw and hear what Paul heard?

          Part 5    For what purpose was the Bible given to man?
    SCRIPTURES
      TRAIN IN      "All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teach-
                 ing, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteous-
RIGHTEOUSNESS
                   ness." 2 Tim. 3:16, RSV.

                       Timothy had no need to fear for the future even though
                   Christianity's chief spokesman and his dearest friend was about
                   to be executed. No false teacher need cause him dismay. No
                   matter what happened to men, the Holy Scriptures remained as
                   the unerring guide to Christian faith and practice.
                       "Profitable for teaching." In verse 15, Timothy was reminded
                   that the Scriptures "are able to instruct you for salvation." RSV.
                   Such teaching is salvation knowledge, full of God's invitation
                   and mercy, full of Jesus Christ as man's example and substi-
                   tute. The purpose of the Bible is not merely to teach facts that
                   men can discover by their own personal investigation; rather
                   it is to teach spiritual truths that can be learned only by divine
                   revelation.
                       "For reproof, for correction." Another translation for "re-
                   proof" is "refutation." The Scriptures are profitable for the
                   refuting of every error and religious fiction; they are the only
                   writings in the world that can change sinners into believers
                   and commandment keepers. The results of sincere Bible study
                   are unsurpassed.
                       "For training in righteousness." The chief purpose of the
                   Bible is to lead men to a right relation with God, to that quality
                   of life that God can point to as examples of His way of life.

THINK IT THROUGH     Has the Bible been for me the voice of God speaking to
                   my soul? What was the last passage that spoke to me?

                      "God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the
                   world by human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit,
                   qualified men and enabled them to do this work. He guided
                   the mind in the selection of what to speak and what to write.
                   The treasure was intrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, none
                   the less, from Heaven. The testimony [of the Bible] is con-
                   veyed through the imperfect expression of human language,
                   yet it is the testimony of God; and the obedient, believing child
                   of God beholds in it the glory of a divine power, full of grace
                   and truth."—The Great Controversy, Introduction, pages vi, v11.

         Part 6 What is the ultimate purpose in studying the Bible?
   SCRIPTURES
    MAKE MAN    "That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished
    COMPLETE unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3:17.
                     "Perfect" should be understood as fitted or equipped. The
                 man or woman who chooses to identify with God will use His
                 divinely revealed writings to teach, to refute, to help restore
                 men and women to upright living, and to educate young and
                 old in the ways that will produce righteousness of character.
                      In other words, the Christian who wants to find victory over
                 sin in his life and who wants a clear statement of what truth
                 is so that he can encourage others to accept Jesus as Lord
                 will find that the Bible lacks nothing and the Christian will be
                 wanting in nothing. All that is needed and more is in the Bible.
                      All the equipment necessary to live victoriously, ceasing to
                 sin, is available through the record of Holy Scripture. The
                 Christian learns about these divine resources when he studies
                  the Bible with the right motives in mind.
                      The study of God's Word is not an end in itself; it should
                 always lead to action, to moral restoration, to a change in
                 ethics.
                      The man of faith is the only person who can read the Bible
                 correctly.
                       "Through faith they [Bible students] come to know God by
                  an experimental knowledge. They have proved for themselves
                  the reality of His word, the truth of His promises. They have
                  tasted, and they know that the Lord is good.

                  bear witness to that which he himself has seen and heard and
                   felt of the power of Christ. He can testify:
                       "'I needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was sup-
                   plied, the hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me
                   the revelation of Christ. I believe in Jesus because He is to me
                   a divine Saviour. I believe the Bible because I have found it to

                   characteristics that will make me a loyal child of God? Am I

                   ing and his kingdom; preach the word, be instant in season,
                   out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering
                   and doctrine." 2 Tim. 4:1, 2.

                        The charge to all Christians, especially the ministry, is to
                   "preach the word." In verse three, the equivalent word is
                    "sound doctrine"; in verse four, "the truth." This "word" con-
                   sists of the Scriptures (2 Tim. 3:15, 16) and all that Timothy
                   had heard and learned from Paul and the other apostles. The
                   "word" Christians are to proclaim is not their own invention.
                   The Christian's duty is to hear the word and to obey it, guard
                   it from heresy, and proclaim it wherever men are found without
                   embarrassment and without tempering it to curry favor.
                        Such preaching is clothed in urgency. Hearts are not warmed
                   and broken by listening to a listless, drowsy witness. The judg-
                   ment is coming, and time is uncertain. Half-hearted witnessing,
                   lazy presentations, give the lie to the Christian message.
                        Paul added relevancy to urgency—God's word fits the
                   needs of all men—convincing argument for the doubtful, re-
                   buke for the sinful, and encouragement for the weary or fearful.
                        The Biblical message must be taught in an intelligent man-
                   ner. Teaching and preaching need not be separate duties. Pity
                   the church that hears not a compassionate witnessing appeal
                   in its teaching and a logical, intelligent presentation of truth
                   in its preaching.
                       So that Timothy might remember who is behind all proclama-
                   tion of the word, Paul pointed him to the One who is ultimately
                   responsible for its success—the ever-present God and the com-
                   ing Jesus, the Judge of the living and the dead.

                                                                    September 22

         Part 2  Why was Paul greatly concerned that the gospel be
        TEACH preached with unfailing urgency?
    THE TRUTH
                    "For the time will come when they will not endure sound
                 doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to them-
                 selves teachers having itching ears; and they shall turn away
                 their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But
                 watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an
                 evangelist." 2 Tim. 4:3-5a.

                     Already in Paul's day (chap. 3:6, 7) the church was plagued
                 by those who would seek to remake the gospel after their own
                 whims.
                     Paul focused on a strange condition called "itching ears."
                 Such people are attracted to certain teachers and preachers
                 who find peculiar satisfaction in serving up novelties and con-
                 centrating on the curious and sensational. The pity is that such
                 people close their ears against the clear, old-fashioned gospel,
                 chiefly because the gospel always asks for commitment when
                 it promises its blessings.
                     By what standards do some church members judge their
                 teachers and preachers? "The apostle does not here [2 Tim.
                 4:3, 4] refer to the openly irreligious, but to the professing Chris-
                 tians who make inclination their guide, and thus become en-
                  slaved by self. Such are willing to listen to those doctrines only
                  that do not rebuke their sins or condemn their pleasure-loving
                  course. They are offended by the plain words of the faithful
                  servants of Christ and choose teachers who praise and flatter
                  them."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 504, 505.
                     Paul's advice to Timothy was simply this: Don't take your
                  lead from the prevailing theological fashions of the moment;
                  don't quietly leave the scene to the gratifiers of "itching ears."
                  When people are unstable, that is the time for the man of faith
                  to stand his ground. When people would rather hear anything
                  but the sober word, that is the time for conscientious Chris-
                  tians to be even more persevering. The deafer the people, the
                  more forceful and clear must be the proclamation.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I tend to back away and wait for a more favorable
                   opportunity when people show greater interest in side issues
                   and novelties, or do I think of more effective ways to gain
                   their attention and respect?

                                                                    September 23

        Part 3   What pressing reason did Paul give for Timothy to fulfill
      KEEPING his ministry?
  THE FAITH-1
                      "Make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to
                   be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have
                   fought a good fight." 2 Tim. 4:5b-7a.

                       Here Paul gives the chief reason for the importance of Tim-
                   othy's ministry—Paul was at the point of being executed. Paul
                   uses the language of the temple—sacrificial language. The New
                   English Bible reads, "My life is being poured out on the altar."
                       "Departure" suggests in the Greek the loosening of a ship's
                   mooring rope, or the loosening of a tent's cords as the tent
                   goes down. How can anyone read these lines without a lump
                   in the throat?
                       But there is a total absence of self-pity or regret in Paul's
                   last words. This kind of death he did not deserve. Nevertheless,
                   he maintained triumphant hope, and cheer for all, as he showed
                   his converts everywhere how the man of faith faces death.
                       What kind of fight was Paul referring to? "The life of the
                   apostle Paul was a constant conflict with self. He said, 'I die
                    daily.' 1 Corinthians 15:31. His will and his desires every day
                   conflicted with duty and the will of God...
                       "At the close of his life of conflict, looking back over its
                   struggles and triumphs, he could say, 'I have fought a good
                   fight....'
                       "The Christian life is a battle and a march. In this warfare
                   there is no release; the effort must be continuous and per-
                   severing. It is by unceasing endeavor that we maintain the
                   victory over the temptations of Satan. Christian integrity must
                   be sought with resistless energy and maintained with a resolute
                   fixedness of purpose."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 452,
                   453.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I depend more on the Bible promises of forgiveness
                   than on the promises of power to overcome sin? If so, might
                   this not tell me how much I am willing to struggle with sin?

                      "Each one has a personal battle to fight. Not even God can
                   make our characters noble or our lives useful, unless we be-
                   come co-workers with Him. Those who decline the struggle lose
                   the strength and joy of victory."—The Ministry of Healing, page

Faith Faces Death LESSON 13                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  September 24

        Part 4   What settled assurance did Paul have when he faced
      KEEPING death?
  THE FAITH-2    "1 have finished the race, I have kept the faith." 2 Tim.
                   4:7, RSV.
                       Every Christian has his personal race to run—not against
                   anyone else, but on a course that has only one goal, to reflect
                   the character of Jesus. Paul likens this course to the public
                   footraces that were very familiar to his readers.
                       Timothy had been by his side when Paul had run against
                   stiff winds of hostility and misunderstanding. Timothy knew
                   well what that course would be like after Paul was gone. Paul's
                   record was plain and for all the world to examine—he had not
                   faltered. He didn't run halfway and become satisfied with his
                   progress. He died growing and running.
                       In what way did Paul keep the faith? Throughout the Timothy
                   letters Paul contrasted faith with a counterfeit religious expe-
                   rience. Genuine faith produces love and does not mistake
                   theological knowledge for true Christian experience. See 1 Tim.
                   1. But Paul does not depreciate doctrine when he emphasizes
                   faith. Although it is true that a church member may have sound
                   doctrine without faith, he cannot have faith without the founda-
                   tion of the truth about God and how He saves men. The pur-
                   pose of doctrine is to lead men to have a trusting, obedient
                   relationship with God—the experience of faith. See 1 Tim. 6;
                   2 Tim. 3.
                       Jesus on Calvary also faced death alone. No doubt his
                   Lord's experience provided the courage that kept Paul strong.
                   "Amid the awful darkness, apparently forsaken of God, Christ
                    had drained the last dregs in the cup of human woe. In those
                    dreadful hours He had relied upon the evidence of His Father's
                   acceptance heretofore given Him. . . . By faith He rested in
                    Him whom it had ever been His joy to obey. And as in sub-
                    mission He committed Himself to God, the sense of the loss
                    of His Father's favor was withdrawn. By faith, Christ was vic-
                    tor."—The Desire of Ages, page 756.
THINK IT THROUGH       In the minor distresses of life has my faith been strong?
                   What is the foundation on which faith for tough times is
                   built?
                      "If Christ is my Saviour, my sacrifice, my atonement, then
                   I shall never perish. Believing on Him, I have life forevermore.
                   Oh, that all who believe the truth would believe in Jesus as
                   their own Saviour. I do not mean that cheap faith unsupported
                   by works, but that earnest, living, constant, abiding faith, that
                   eats the flesh and drinks the blood of the Son of God."—

           Part 5       To whom will the eternal rewards be given?
        LOVE HIS
                       "Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteous-
      APPEARING
                    ness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me
                    on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have
                    loved his appearing." 2 Tim. 4:8, RSV.

                         Paul never doubted that Jesus would return the second
                     time. He believed Jesus' promises as relayed to him through
                     the other apostles. Furthermore, these firsthand witnesses were
                     corroborated by personal revelation. See 1 Cor. 15:8.
                         The second advent gives meaning and an end to history.
                     Life on earth will not merely repeat itself endlessly, generation
                     after generation, subject to the whims of man or the mysterious
                     forces of nature. There is a goal toward which all mankind
                     moves—the judgment of all and the reward of life everlasting
                     to those who were comfortable and settled into God's way of
                    living.
                        The crown (literally, a garland of olive leaves) symbolized
                     victory for those who had identified with righteousness. In this
                    text Paul is emphasizing that the reward of eternal life is a
                    reward for being righteous, for a life-style that was loyal to
                    God. "In the kingdom of God, position is not gained through
                    favoritism. It is not earned, nor is it received through an arbi-
                    trary bestowal. It is the result of character. The crown and
                    the throne are the tokens of a condition attained; they are the
                    tokens of self-conquest through our Lord Jesus Christ."—The
                    Desire of Ages, page 549.
                        Eternal life awaits all who have made it clear that they are
                     willing to say Yes to whatever God wants them to do—the way
                    of righteousness. Such a commitment has fitted them for the
                    family of heaven and "the Lord can trust them" to be of that
                    number. See Christ's Object Lessons, page 315.
                        Every Christian should feel the confidence of a victor, know-
                    ing all the while that each victory was made possible by the
                    indwelling Christ. Faith carries within itself the assurance that
                    God will open wide the door to those who have trusted and
                    obeyed Him.
                        Although we must live life to the full each day, the real
                    cause for enthusiasm and meaning to life lies in the Chris-
                    tian's love for the advent. It remains for the genuine Christian,
                    the "blessed hope."

                    few things that you want to do before He returns?

Faith Faces Death LESSON 13                                             Friday
                                                                  September 26

        Part 6       What was Paul's reason for peace and assurance?
     THE LORD       "But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength to pro-
      GAVE ME    claim the word fully, that all the Gentiles might hear it. . . .
    STRENGTH     The Lord will rescue me from every evil and save me for his
                 heavenly kingdom." 2 Tim. 4:17, 18, RSV.

                       In times of loneliness and impending death, where did Paul's
                   thoughts go? Cut off and virtually abandoned, he longed for
                   the touch of an old friend's hand. For a variety of reasons
                   everyone who had been ordinarily by his side were gone, ex-
                   cept faithful Luke (verse 11). (In a way this information tells
                   us as much about the heroism of Luke as about the loneliness
                   of Paul.)
                       He urged Timothy to come before winter (verses 9, 21); to
                   bring Mark also (the young man he had written off as a coward
                   some years before) (verse 11); to bring a winter cloak; and to
                   bring books and parchments (verse 13). Here was a man with
                   his heart set on the great return of His Lord, but also with a
                   hearty longing for Timothy.
                        Although Paul rested his confidence in the Lord, who always
                   stood by him, he did not despise the earthly means by which
                    the Lord works. When we are lonely, we need friends; when
                    we are cold, we need clothing; when we are bored, we need
                   books.
                        Nevertheless, there are times when even the best of friends
                    cannot provide what the spirit needs. No one can give a per-
                    sonal witness for another, especially in times of great stress.
                    By Paul's side, unseen by the curious spectators and malicious
                    persecutors, was One as real to Paul as his own self: "The
                    Lord stood by me."
                        SuchA a Presence was not imagination. He helped Paul to
                    witness boldly and convincingly to the truth about Jesus and
                    on numerous occasions He delivered Paul from his impas-
                    sioned foes.
                        Paul was not so naive as to believe that God would always
                    deliver him from physical harm; but he did know that none of
                    his enemies could inflict any lasting harm. Evil would not con-
                    quer his spirit. In God's time, there would be a place for him
                    beyond the reach of suffering about which he knew so much.
                    No wonder Paul, in the shadow of the executioner's sword,
                     could sing out, "To him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen."
                     Verse 18, RSV.

THINK IT THROUGH       When you face the lonely moment when no earthly friend
                   can spare you from responsibility and suffering, even death
                   itself, how do you think you will respond?
