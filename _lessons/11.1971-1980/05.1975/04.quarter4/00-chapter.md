   Dear Sabbath School Members Around the World:

   Christian greetings from your fellow Sabbath School members in the Aus-
   tralasian Division! We salute you from the home bases of Australia and
   New Zealand, and from the thousands of South Pacific islands that com-
   prise the mission field of this Division.

   We thank you most sincerely for the great liberality shown by you in your
   giving of Sabbath School offerings which have done so much to build the
   work of the Church in the South Pacific. Papua New Guinea's Mt. Diamond
   Adventist High School and Fiji's Fulton College are two outstanding tes-
   timonies of your past 13th Sabbath overflowing generosity.

  Three very needy projects, located in our Western Pacific Union Mission,
  have been selected to benefit from your 4th Quarter, 1975, 13th Sabbath
  Offering overflow. In the far north of this Union the people of the
  Gilbert and Ellice Islands have established their senior school on the re-
  mote island of Abemama. Built largely of native materials which have not
  stood the test of time, this, our most isolated South Pacific school, MUST
  be rebuilt. The second project needing your support is the Aore mission
  station in the New Hebrides, where Parker school, our senior educational in-
  stitution in the New Hebrides, needs to be partially rebuilt, and the Aore
  Adventist Hospital desperately needs new facilities. The third project we
  commend to you for support is the commencement of Adventist educational work
  in our New Caledonia Mission. We must provide Christian education for the
  children and youth of this fast expanding French mission field, but without
  your help it would be financially impossible for us to fund this project.
  We invite you to join us in this challenging venture.

  We are most grateful for all that you have done to assist us with past pro-
  jects, and we know that we can look to you with confidence this coming 13th
  Sabbath as we plan for the consolidation and expansion of the work of God
  in the South Pacific.

  With cordial Christian greetings,

                                                           Yours very sincerely,




                                                           Robert R. Frame,
                                                           President.

         JEREMIAH-A MESSAGE FOR OUR TIME
                                  Introduction
     This quarter's lessons are based on the book of Jeremiah.
    Jeremiah's prophetic ministry spanned more than 40 years. It embraced the
period immediately preceding the captivity of Judah by Babylon as well as the
first years of its exile by the Euphrates. Three times during Jeremiah's ministry
the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar came from the north and subdued
his country; namely, in 605, 598, and 586 B.C., culminating in the utter destruction
of Jerusalem.
     The kingdom of Israel no longer existed in Jeremiah's day. Israel had been
carried into Assyrian captivity in 722 B.C., or more than 100 years before the
major portion of Jeremiah's prophetic ministry. At times. Jeremiah contrasts
Judah with Israel. Sometimes he applies the term Israel to all the tribes.
     The messages and experiences recorded in the book of Jeremiah are not.
arranged in the order in which they occurred. The lessons for this quarter are
arranged by subjects and thus may bring together in any one lesson passages
from throughout Jeremiah's book.
     The life of Jeremiah is intimately interwoven with the history of the kingdom
of Judah during its declining years. His book to a large extent recites the adver-
 sities that befell his country and himself. He lived amid a people who did not
 want to heed God's counsel and who perished in rebellion against His will, as
foretold to them by the prophet.
     We have more information about Jeremiah than about any other Hebrew
prophet. A large portion of his book is autobiographical. From these passages
 we gain an insight into Jeremiah's inner life and catch glimpses of his very soul.
He is the most tenderhearted of all the prophets. His heart nearly breaks because
of the fate that befalls his people. He wishes that his eyes were a brook that
 would never run dry. See Jer. 9:1, 2. Even after Judah and Jerusalem had reaped
 their fateful doom, his sorrow did not abate. The book of Lamentations consti-
 tutes Jeremiah's dirge over unrepentant and ruined Judah.
     To Judah its fall before Babylon was the day of the Lord, or the day of God's
 judgment upon them because of their infidelity to Him and their disastrous diver-
 gence from His will. The steadfastness of Jeremiah amid the adversity and per-
 secution prior to the fall of Judah before the Babylonians serves as a tacit
 admonition to God's children on the verge of their final deliverance to remain
 loyal and true to God. Jeremiah was labeled and treated as a traitor to his
  country because of his loyalty to God. In the last conflict prior to the final deliver-
 ance, God's people will also be treated as traitors to their respective nations
 because of their loyalty to the King of heaven. Through his living example the
  prophet Jeremiah encourages you and me to retain our loyalty to God even
 through persecution and threat of death under the trying and difficult circum-
 stances ahead of us.
      The whole Bible is the Word of God to man. But it contains special books
  replete with lessons for a specific time or period of earth's history. The writings
 of the prophet Jeremiah have special importance to us who are living at the end
 of time.
      In studying the book of Jeremiah this quarter may God grant that we may
  find guidance for personal living and decision making today. May we build into
  our characters principles that will keep us joyfully loyal to God under all circum-
  stances in the future.

The Times of Jeremiah LESSON 1                                           ❑   Sunday
                                                                      September 28

           Part I     Jeremiah began his prophetic work in about G26 B.C. and
              THE   continued until some time after 586. B.C.
    INTERNATIONAL       What two superpowers were predominant in international
            SCENE   affairs during Jeremiah's life as reflected in Ezekiel 17:12, 15?

                        Study a map of the Near East in Old Testament times in a
                    Bible atlas or in the back of your Bible. Note the geographical
                    position of Judah in relation to the two superpowers noted
                    above.
                        The Assyrian Empire was in decline at the beginning of
                    Jeremiah's ministry and was nearly ended with the fall of
                    Nineveh in 612 B.C. The Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nabo-
                    polassar, father of the Biblical Nebuchadnezzar, filled the power
                    vacuum in the area of Judah left by the decline and fall of the
                    Assyrians. Thus during Jeremiah's ministry the Babylonian Em-
                    pire began and reached its peak of power.
                        Egypt, under four successive kings during Jeremiah's min-
                    istry, sought to reestablish its power in the area of Judah and
                    plotted the overthrow of Babylon.
                        The internal politics of Judah depended largely in those
                    years on the way the king of Judah viewed the prospects for
                    military success by Babylon or Egypt. Thus there developed in
                    Judah a pro-Babylonian party and a pro-Egyptian party, with
                    Judah pinning its hope for survival on making alliance with the
                    superpower most likely to be victorious.
                      In an earlier period, what counsel was given to Judah
                    about alliances and armaments? Isa. 8:12-14; 31:1.

                        The following quotation from Ellen G. White refers especially
                    to Israel, but reflects Judah's experience also:
                       "The alliances made by the Israelites with their heathen
                    neighbors resulted in the loss of their identity as God's peculiar
                    people. They became leavened by the evil practises of those
                    with whom they formed forbidden alliances. Affiliation with
                    worldlings caused them to lose their first love, and their zeal
                    for God's service. The advantages they sold themselves to
                    gain, brought only disappointment, and caused the loss of many
                    souls.
                       "The experience of Israel will be the experience of all who
                    go to the world for strength, turning away from the living God.
                    Those who forsake the mighty One, the source of all strength,
                    and affiliate with worldlings, placing on them their dependence,
                    become weak in moral power, as are those in whom they trust."

The Times of Jeremiah LESSON 1                                     ❑ Monday
                                                                  September 29

       Part 2       "The word of the Lord came [to Jeremiah] in the days of
       JOSIAH    Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year
                 of his reign." Jer. 1:2.

                    The thirteenth year of Josiah was about 626 B.C. Josiah had
                 become king when only eight years of age and was thus about
                 21 at the time of Jeremiah's call. Jeremiah described himself
                 as a youth, probably under 21. Both the king and the new
                 prophet were very young men.

                    What significant work did Josiah do? 2 Chron. 34:3-8.

                    Note that this destruction of shrines took place just one year
                 before Jeremiah's call. The time was right for a prophetic voice
                 to call men to repentance.
                    "The reformation under Josiah had cleansed the land of the

                 Another such backsliding would be fatal; and the Lord sought

                    "When Josiah heard the words of warning and condemnation
                 because Israel had trampled upon the precepts of heaven, he
                 humbled himself. He wept before the Lord. He made a thorough
                 work of repentance and reformation, and God accepted his
                 efforts. The whole congregation of Israel entered into a solemn
                 covenant to keep the commandments of Jehovah. This is our
                 work today. We must repent of the past evil of our doings, and
                 seek God with all our hearts. We must believe that God means
                 just what He says, and make no compromise with evil in any
                 way. We should greatly humble ourselves before God, and con-

                   2 Chron. 36:1.
                       "Belonging probably to the anti-Egyptian party, Jehoahaz
                   [also called Shallum] continued his father's policies, and after
                   a reign of 3 months was summoned to Riblah in Syria by Necho,
                   who replaced him by his older brother Jehoiakim. He was then
                   deported to Egypt, where he died."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p.
                   537.

                      How did Jehoiakim become king? 2 Chron. 36:4.
                      "Jehoiakim seems to have belonged to the pro-Egyptian
                   party, as indicated by the fact that Necho considered him a
                   trustworthy candidate for the kingship in Judah. In order to pay
                   the heavy tribute laid upon him by Necho, Jehoiakim taxed the
                   whole population (2 Ki 23:35). He is described as a wicked
                   king (2 Ki 23:37; 2 Chr 36:5), who quickly undid everything his
                   pious father Josiah had achieved in religious reforms."—SDA
                   Bible Dictionary, p. 539.

                       What event occurred three years later? Dan. 1:1. How long
                   was Jehoiakim loyal to Nebuchadnezzar? 2 Kings 24:1.
                      Jehoiakim apparently counted on Egyptian superiority over
                   Babylon and changed his allegiance back to Egypt, the power
                   that enthroned him.

                      What insight into Jehoiakim's character is given by the
                   incident recorded in Jeremiah 36? Read Jeremiah 36:2, 9, 10,
                   21, 23. See also Jer. 26:20-23.
                        Jehoiakim's defection from Babylon brought, in 598 B.C., the
                   second invasion of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar. The Babylonians
                   captured him, but he died before removal from Judah.
                        "From the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign, Jeremiah had
                   little hope of saving his beloved land from destruction and the
                   people from captivity. Yet he was not permitted to remain silent
                   while utter ruin threatened the kingdom. Those who had re-
                   mained loyal to God must be encouraged to persevere in right-
                   doing, and sinners must, if possible, be induced to turn from
                   iniquity."—Prophets and Kings, p. 412.

                 which might be anglicized 'Jauchin.' This and the related forms
                 Jehoiachin and Joiachin probably represent his throne name,
                 given to him when he became king, while Jeconiah (Coniah)
                 was his personal or private name. Compare how his father
                 Eliakim became Jehoiakim (II Kings 23:34) and his uncle Shal-

                 22:11)."—The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, vol. 2, p. 811.
                    Jehoiachin reigned for a period of only three months and
                 ten days. At the close of his reign, March 16, 597 B.C., he, his
                 family, and the members of his court were taken into exile to
                 Babylon.


                    What other people and treasure were removed to Babylon?
                 2 Kings 24:13-16.

                     There is historical evidence that sustains the Bible account
                 of Jehoiachin's captivity.
                     "Several tablets found in the ruins of Babylon, dated in the
                 year 592 B.C.—five years after Jehoiachin's surrender—contain
                 lists of foodstuff provided by the royal storehouse for certain
                 persons who were fed by the king. Among them Jehoiachin is
                 repeatedly mentioned as 'king of Judah,' together with five of
                 his sons and their tutor Kenaiah. These facts—that Jehoiachin
                 is called king, that he received 20 times as much ration as any
                 other person mentioned in these records, and that any reference
                 to his imprisonment is lacking—seem to indicate that he was
                 held by Nebuchadnezzar for the time, in anticipation of the day
                 when he should be restored to his throne, if and when condi-
                 tions in Judah might make such a course of action advisable.
                     "At a later time, either in connection with the incidents
                  described in Jer. 29 or at the time of Zedekiah's rebellion,
                 Jehoiachin was definitely imprisoned. This imprisonment con-

                       "Zedekiah had a weak character. Though he was occa-
                   sionally inclined to follow Jeremiah (Jer 38:14-26), he did not

                   around him. . . . Zedekiah finally succumbed to the pressure
                   of the anti-Babylonians among his citizens, and trusting in the
                   help of Egypt, rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. The result of
                   this faithlessness was an invasion of Judah by Nebuchadnez-

                       "The siege of Jerusalem began in earnest on Jan. 15, 588
                   B.C. (2 Kings 25:1), and lasted until July 19, 586 B.C. (2 Kings
                   25:2; Jer. 39:2), when the Chaldean army finally broke through
                   the walls into the city, where unspeakable famine conditions
                   prevailed. Once the 30-month-long siege was interrupted briefly
                   by the unsuccessful attempt of the Egyptian army to defeat the
                   Babylonians (Jer. 37:5). When the break-through came, Zede-
                   kiah made an attempt to escape. In the confused fighting that
                   followed the break-through he managed to leave the city and
                   reach the plain of Jericho, but was overtaken there. Carried
                   to Nebuchadnezzar's headquarters at Riblah, Zedekiah saw his
                   sons killed; then his eyes were put out, and he was sent to
                   Babylon in chains. His chief ministers were executed, and all
                   others were carried into captivity (2 Kings 25:4-7, 19-21; Jer.

       Part 6      What future prophet was among the first group of captives
   JEREMIAH'S   taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar? Dan. 1:1, 3, 4, 6.
      FELLOW      Jeremiah's prophetic career had begun (626 B.C.) about 21
    PROPHETS    years previous to the first captivity (605 B.C.). In 605 B.C. Jere-
                miah was probably approaching 40 years of age, while Daniel
                was 18. See Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 570.

                   What prophet was captured in the second siege of Jeru-
                salem? Ezek. 1:1-3; 33:21.
                    Ezekiel is thought to have been about 25 years of age at
                this time. See SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 335. Thus he was of
                approximately the same age as Daniel.
                    During the final years of the kingdom of Judah, when it was
                harrassed by Nebuchadnezzar and there were Jewish exiles in
                Babylon, God had one of His representatives in each of three
                critical places. Jeremiah bore his messages to the people of
                Jerusalem and Judah. Ezekiel communicated his prophecies
                to the exiled Jews in Babylon. Daniel's mission was carried out
                in the _court of the king who conquered Judah. Thus God had
                human instruments communicating His messages in three stra-
                tegic spheres during the early years of the exile.
                    "The messages of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were de-
                signed to make cleth'i the nature and purpose of the Captivity
                and to hasten the return of the exiles to their homeland."—
                SDA Bible Dictionary,'p. 546.
                    These three men chosen by God served Him in widely vary-
                ing circumstances. Jeremiah, living in war-torn Judah, was
                looked upon as a traitor to his nation. Ezekiel, living in a set-
                tlement of exiled Jews in Babylon, was not regarded seriously
                by the exiles. The Lord told him that the people 'looked upon
                him as an entertainer. See Ezek. 33:32, RSV. Daniel, living at
                Nebuchadnezzar's palace, was honored by the monarch who
                had captured him.
                    "The dark years of destruction and death marking the end
                 of the kingdom of Judah would have brought despair to the
                 stoutest heart had it not been for the encouragements in the
                 prophetic utterances of God's messengers. Through Jeremiah
                 in Jerusalem, through Daniel in the court of Babylon, through
                 Ezekiel on the banks of the Chebar, the Lord in mercy made
                 clear His eternal purpose and gave assurance of His willingness
                 to fulfill to His chosen people the promises recorded in the
                 writings of Moses. That which He had said He would do for
                 those who should prove true to Him, He would surely bring to
                 pass."—Prophets and Kings, p. 464.

         Part 1      "The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests
 CALLED BY GOD    that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: to whom the
                  word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon
                  king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign." Jer. 1:1, 2.

                      Jeremiah made clear that the words he spoke and wrote
                  were not his own; they were the words of the Lord. He did not
                  venture to speak his own ideas. His messages were inspired
                  by God and were sent to His people and the surrounding nations
                  of that time.
                      The year of Jeremiah's call, the thirteenth year of Josiah,
                  was 627/626 B.C. Five years later Josiah began his great reli-
                  gious reform, sparked by the finding of the book of the law in
                  the temple. At this time the Jews were living in forgetfulness
                  of God. They had been led into apostasy by King Manasseh
                  and his son Amon.



                    For how long did Jeremiah continue as spokesman for
                  God? Verse 3.

                     Jeremiah's ministry stretched over the period from 627/626
                  B.C. down past the fall of Jerusalem and Judah's last exile to
                  Babylon in 586 B.C. A precise date for the close of his ministry
                  cannot be determined, but he recorded the establishment of a
                  Jewish government in Judah by Gedaliah, Gedaliah's murder,
                  and the subsequent flight of many Jews to Egypt. Jeremiah was
                  compelled to flee with this group, and he spent some time in
                  Egypt. See Jeremiah 43. His ministry consequently lasted well
                  over 40 years. During this period he saw the utter ruin of his
                  nation and its loss of political independence.
                      "Yet amid the general ruin into which the nation was rapidly
                  passing, Jeremiah was often permitted to look beyond the dis-
                  tressing scenes of the present to the glorious prospects of the
                  future, when God's people should be ransomed from the land
                  of the enemy and planted again in Zion. He foresaw the time
                  when the Lord would renew His covenant relationship with
                  them. 'Their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall
                  not sorrow any more at all.' Jeremiah 31:12."—Prophets and

                                                                   October 6

        Part 2       "Now the word of the Lord came to me saying,
   FOREKNOWN         'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.' " Jer. 1:4,
                 5, RSV.
       BY GOD
                     God knows the end from the beginning. His knowledge is
                 absolute. His foreknowledge is immediate and unlimited. Just
                 as God had a plan for Jeremiah's life, so He has a plan for the
                 life of every person. "Each has his place in the eternal plan
                 of heaven. Each is to work in co-operation with Christ for the
                 salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place prepared for
                 us in the heavenly mansions than is the special place desig-
                 nated on earth where we are to work for God."—Christ's Object
                 Lessons, pp. 326, 327.

                   On the basis of God's foreknowledge of the character of
                 Jeremiah, for what work did God set Jeremiah apart?
                 Verse 5.

                    When we human beings appoint people to office or select
                 them for certain positions, we do so on the basis of their past
                 experience and performance. God does not need to go by past
                 performances; He can judge us just as well by what we are
                 going to do as by what we have already done. He need not
                 hold an unfavorable past against us, as men of necessity must
                 do. He can take a persecutor like Saul and appoint him a
                 spokesman for Himself. As men, we would have needed to see
                 a change in Paul after his Damascus road meeting with Jesus
                 before we could have chosen him to be a minister. Not so with
                 God. He saw into the future and noticed that Paul would be
                 true and reliable as His spokesman.
                    God, through His foreknowledge, has experience in advance.
                 The same was true in His relationship to Jeremiah; and on the
                 basis of this He called him to the prophetic office. God knew
                 before Jeremiah was born that he would choose to develop a
                 submissive attitude toward His will. On the basis of Jeremiah's
                 foreseen loyalty God ordained him to be His prophet.
                    "God knows the end from the beginning. He knew, before
                 the birth of Jacob and Esau, just what characters they would
                 both develop. He knew that Esau would not have a heart to
                 obey Him. He answered the troubled prayer of Rebekah and
                 informed her that she would have two children, and the elder
                 should serve the younger. He presented the future history of
                 her two sons before her, that they would be two nations, the
                 one greater than the other, and the elder should serve the
                 younger."—The Story of Redemption, p. 87.

         Part 3      "Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I
 OVERWHELMED       am a child." Jer. 1:6.
 BY GOD'S CALL
                       "A member of the Levitical priesthood, Jeremiah had been
                   trained from childhood for holy service. In those happy years
                   of preparation he little realized that he had been ordained from
                   birth to be 'a prophet unto the nations;' and when the divine
                   call came, he was overwhelmed with a sense of his unworthi-
                   ness. 'Ah, Lord God!' he exclaimed, 'behold, I cannot speak:
                   for I am a child.' "—Prophets and Kings, p. 407.
                      Jeremiah was overwhelmed by God's call. He felt entirely
                   unable to fulfill God's commission. He gave this reason for feel-
                   ing unequal to the task God was laying upon him: "I am a child."
                   "The Hebrew near [translated child] could be used of an in-
                   fant, as of Moses in the ark of bulrushes (Exod. 2:6); at the
                   other extreme, it was used of a young man of marriageable age,
                   as of Absalom during his revolt against David (II Sam. 18:5; cf.
                   Gen. 34:19). We cannot therefore derive from this verse the
                   exact age of Jeremiah at the time of his call. The LXX [Septua-
                   gint] renders, 'I am too young.' "—The Interpreter's Bible
                   (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1959), vol. 5, pp. 801, 802.
                      But even though Jeremiah at his call might have been in
                   his late teens or his early twenties, he was baffled by the burden
                   God was laying on him. His thought was, Who am I, a mere
                   youth without experience and reputation to go and tell my
                   people, the priests, the civil leaders, and the king himself as
                   well as other nations the words of God? Lord, I am but a child
                   compared with these men of experience.


THINK IT THROUGH      Might inexperience sometimes be a valid reason to seek
                   release from a task? If it is, in what ways would the assign-
                   ment of necessity differ from Jeremiah's commission?

                       "The path of men who are placed as leaders is not an easy
                   one. But they are to see in every difficulty a call to prayer.
                   Never are they to fail of consulting the great Source of all
                   wisdom. Strengthened and enlightened by the Master Worker,
                   they will be enabled to stand firm against unholy influences and
                   to discern right from wrong, good from evil. They will approve
                   that which God approves, and will strive earnestly against the
                   introduction of wrong principles into His cause."—Prophets and

         Part 4      "But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou
GOD'S ENABLING    shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I com-
                  mand thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for
                  I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord." Jer. 1:7, 8.
                     Offering excuses to God's call only betrays our lack of trust
                  or confidence in Him. When a person trusts God, he accepts
                  His call, realizing that God never calls a man to failure but only
                  to success, since "all His biddings are enablings."—Christ's
                  Object Lessons, p. 333. Jeremiah was to go forth undauntedly,
                  because God gave him the assurance that He would go with
                  him to deliver him.

                    What did God do symbolically to assure Jeremiah that He
                  Himself would give him the message to proclaim? Verse 9.
                      "After the call of the prophet, came this solemn act of con-
                  secration, symbolizing the communication of new powers of
                  thought and utterance. Thus touched upon the lips (see Isa.
                  6:6, 7), Jeremiah was assured that there would be no uncer-
                  tainty as to his message. He was to go forth to speak the words
                  put into his heart by the Spirit of God (see Jer. 5:14; 15:16;
                  cf. Isa. 51:16; 59:21; Matt. 10:20; 2 Peter 1:21)."—SDA Bible
                  Commentary, on Jer. 1:9.
                      The very fact that he was not to speak his own words, but
                  God's, must have given Jeremiah reassurance in his call. It is
                  easier to take abuse and censure when we know that we are
                  not doing the work for ourselves, but that we are ambassadors
                  for God.

                    To whom was Jeremiah commissioned to communicate
                  God's message? Verse 10.
                     God is not partial. His messages through Jeremiah were to
                  go to surrounding nations as well as to Judah. Babylon was to
                  receive assurance of stability in Jeremiah's day; others were
                  doomed to fall before Babylon, as was his own country. But
                  the present Babylonian victory was no guarantee of permanent
                  security. Babylon's continued prosperity depended on its rela-
                  tionship to God's revelation of truth.

                      In addition to prophesying destruction and gloom, what
                  hopeful element did Jeremiah's message contain? Verse 10
                  (last part).
                    "Thank God for the words, 'to build, and to plant.' By these
                  words Jeremiah was assured of the Lord's purpose to restore
                  and to heal."—Prophets and Kings, p. 409.

         Part 5      "Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
     HIS FIRST    Jeremiah, what seest thou? And 1 said, I see a rod of an al-
                  mond tree. Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen:
        VISION    for I will hasten my word to perform it." Jer. 1:11, 12.

                      After God had called Jeremiah, He gave him a vision as a
                  beginner's test at the start of his prophetic career. As a spokes-
                  man for God he was to receive other visions as in Jeremiah
                  1:13 and 24:3. Visions were a common method employed by
                  God in speaking to His prophets. See Num. 12:6; Amos 7:8;
                  8:2; Zech. 4:2. God commended Jeremiah for correctly having
                  seen an almond tree.
                      "There is an interesting word play in vs. 11, 12. The follow-
                  ing is an attempt to reproduce this literary device: 'I see the
                  twig of a wake-tree. . . . You have seen aright, for I am wakeful
                  over my word to perform it'; or, 'I see the rod of a watch-tree
                  . . . for I am watching over my word to fulfill it.' "—SDA Bible
                  Commentary, on Jer. 1:12.

                     What other vision did God immediately give Jeremiah?
                  Verse 13.

                     "This vision is closely connected on the one hand with the
                  call of Jeremiah, and on the other with the early prophecies
                  which warn of the approach of an enemy from the north (4:6;
                  6:1; 10:22). It indicates primarily the direction or source from
                  which the evil is to come."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 5, p.
                  807.

                     From where was destruction or evil to overtake Judah?
                  Verses 14-16.

                      "Although Babylon was east of Judea, military roads and
                  invasion routes to Palestine approached Judah from the north.
                  It was impracticable for armies to cross the desert directly
                  east of Palestine. Hence the Hebrews frequently referred to
                  Babylon in connection with the north. The direction has ref-
                  erence, not to the location of the home of the invader, but to
                  the route he would follow in entering the land, for invaders
                  from both east and north came from the north. The captives
                  were spoken of as taken to the north country, and it was thence
                  the Lord would cause them to return (see Jer. 3:18; 23:8; 31:8;

       Part 6          What reassurance did God give Jeremiah as he was about
        GOD'S      to assume his prophetic ministry?
 REASSURANCE          "And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not pre-
                   vail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver
                   thee." Jer. 1:19.
                      God gave Jeremiah no assurance of an easy, peaceful life.
                   But more reassuring than deliverance from conflict was God's
                   promise that He Himself would be with His servant so that his
                   enemies would not prevail against him.
                      How. securely did God promise to fortify Jeremiah against
                   his assailants? Verse 18.
                      What God was willing to do for Jeremiah in his prophetic
                   work He is willing to do for each of us spiritually. It is God's
                   plan and purpose that His followers be victorious. Only over-
                   comers will finally be found among the redeemed (see Rev.
                   21:7); there will be no ultimately defeated or vanquished in-
                   dividuals in the city of God.
                       In view of this divine assurance, what was Jeremiah to
                   do? Verse 17.
                      Amid fierce opposition Jeremiah would be enabled to stand
                   firm in the proclamation of God's message. He knew he was
                   God's mouthpiece to his people. In this faith he became an
                   immovable rock of truth and steadfastness. "Often the Chris-
                   tian life is beset by dangers, and duty seems hard to per-
                   form....
                       "The dealings of Providence bring to the unbelieving, dark-
                   ness and despair, while to the trusting soul they are full of light
                   and peace. The path where God leads the way may lie through
                    the desert or the sea, but it is a safe path."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 290.

THINK IT THROUGH       What can I do today to develop a character that will en-
                   able me to stand for God's truth when the storm of opposition
                   rages against me?
                       "Now is the time for God's people to show themselves true
                   to principle. When the religion of Christ is most held in con-
                   tempt, when His law is most despised, then should our zeal be
                   the warmest and our courage and firmness the most unflinching.
                   To stand in defense of truth and righteousness when the major-
                   ity forsake us, to fight the battles of the Lord when champions
                   are few—this will be our test. At this time we must gather
                   warmth from the coldness of others, courage from their coward-
                   ice, and loyalty from their treason. The nation will be on the
                    side of the great rebel leader."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 136.

                                           major portion of his messages was
                                           given after his reign. (Probably only
                                           chapters 1-6 and 14-16 were given
                                           during Josiah's reign. See the intro-

                                           The bulk of the messages constitut-
                                           ing his book was given during the
                                           reigns of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah.
                                              Jeremiah recorded no specific
                                           messages from God to Josiah as an
                                           individual. On the other hand his

          Part 1      How inevitable was God's judgment on Judah even in the
     INEVITABLE    days of Josiah?
          DOOM         "Then said the Lord unto me, Though Moses and Samuel
                   stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people:
                   cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth. . . . And I
                   will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth,
                   because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for
                   that which he did in Jerusalem." Jer. 15:1, 4.
                      The die had been cast. Doom and destruction of Judah was
                   unavoidable. Due to Josiah's humility before God and his zeal
                   for regeneration and reformation, it was but postponed. See
                   Prophets and Kings, p. 399.
                      What were God's specific charges against His people?
                   Jer. 15:6; 16:18.
                       "What is sin?—It is the result of Satan's administration. It
                   is his work to make of no effect the law of God. He is deter-
                   mined that men shall do what God has forbidden him to do....
                       "Sin lies at the door of those who do not allow their igno-
                   rance to be expelled by the rays of light from God's word. ...
                       "Sin is the most fearful thing in the whole universe. So fear-
                   ful is it that it could be pardoned only by the sacrifice of the
                   Son of the infinite God. If unpardoned, it must be followed by
                   eternal death."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, August 9,
                   1898.
                       What was the general sentiment of the people in Judah
                   toward the sinful conditions prevalent? Jer. 14:10.
                       "Satan is continually seeking to overcome the people of
                   God by breaking down the barriers which separate them from
                   the world. Ancient Israel were enticed into sin when they ven-
                   tured into forbidden association with the heathen. In a similar
                   manner are modern Israel led astray. 'The god of this world
                   hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the
                   light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,
                   should shine unto them.' 2 Corinthians 4:4."—The Great Con-

THINK IT THROUGH       What is my true inner attitude toward that which God con-
                   demns?
                      "Has your character been transformed? Has darkness been
                   exchanged for light, the love of sin for the love of purity and
                   holiness? Have you been converted, who are engaged in teach-
                   ing the truth to others? Has there been in you a thorough, radi-

                                                                       October 13

        Part 2       What was God's admonition to Jehoiakim as leader of
     JEHOIAKIM     God's people? Jer. 22:2, 3.

                      For years Jeremiah had been extending God's call of re-
                   pentance to the people. Now the prophet went to the king and
                   invited him to lead out in repentance and regeneration with
                   resultant reformation. Although the leader is only one person,
                   he usually occupies a pivotal influence for good or for bad.
                   "The people will seldom rise higher than their minister. A
                   world-loving spirit in him has a tremendous influence upon
                   others. The people make his deficiencies an excuse to cover
                   their world-loving spirit. They quiet their own consciences,
                   thinking that they may be free to love the things of this life
                   and be indifferent to spiritual things because their ministers
                   are so."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 645, 646.
                      If no change was effected, what would become of the
                   temple and the nation? Verses 5, 6.
                      It had been God's purpose that Judah would prosper and
                   that Jerusalem and the temple would stand forever. See Jer.
                   17:25. God's own people were now frustrating His plan for them.
                       When all the prophecies of Jeremiah, up to that time, were
                   read to Jehoiakim, how did the king react to God's message
                   to him through his prophet?
                       "And it came to pass, that when Jehudi [the representative
                   of the princes] had read three or four leaves, he [the king] cut
                   it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the
                   hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on
                   the hearth." Jer. 36:23.
                      "King Jehoiakim and his lords, in their arrogance and pride,
                   refused the invitation of God. They would not heed the warn-
                   ing, and repent. The gracious opportunity proffered them at
                   the time of the burning of the sacred roll, was their last. God
                   had declared that if at that time they refused to hear His voice,
                   He would inflict upon them fearful retribution."—Prophets and
                   Kings, p. 436.
THINK IT THROUGH     How do I relate to the messages in God's Word that con-
                   demn certain of my practices and call upon me to reform?
                      "Those who refuse to receive reproof and to be corrected,
                   will manifest enmity, malice, and hatred against the instrument
                   that God has used. They will leave no means untried to cast
                   stigma upon the one who bore to them the message."—Ellen

             Part 3      Who tried to lead King Zedekiah into rebellion against God
     THE KING AND     very early in his reign?
           A FALSE        "And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of
                      the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and
         PROPHET
                      in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet,
                      which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the
                      Lord, in the presence of the priests and of all the people,
                      saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,
                      saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. Within
                      two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels
                      of the Lord's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
                      took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: and
                      I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim
                      king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into
                      Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king
                      of Babylon." Jer. 28:1-4.
                         "Against determined opposition Jeremiah stood firmly for
                      the policy of submission. Prominent among those who pre-
                      sumed to gainsay the counsel of the Lord was Hananiah, one
                      of the false prophets against whom the people had been
                      warned. Thinking to gain the favor of the king and of the royal
                      court, he lifted his voice in protest, declaring that God had
                      given him words of encouragement for the Jews."—Prophets
                      and Kings, pp. 444, 445.
                          According to an earlier pronouncement from the Lord by
                      Jeremiah, what was the alternative to submission to Babylon?
                      Jer. 27:13, 14.
                         "Jeremiah, in the presence of the priests and people, ear-
                      nestly entreated them to submit to the king of Babylon for the
                      time the Lord had specified. He cited the men of Judah to the
                      prophecies of Hosea, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and others whose
                      messages of reproof and warning had been similar to his own.
                      He referred them to events which had taken place in fulfillment
                      of prophecies of retribution for unrepented sin. In the past the
                      judgments of God had been visited upon the impenitent in
                      exact fulfillment of His purpose as revealed through His mes-
                      sengers."—Prophets and Kings, p. 445.
THINK IT THROUGH         To whose counsel do I prefer to listen: the counsel of him
                      who presents my own cherished plans, or to the person who

"Is There Any Word From the Lord?" LESSON 3                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 15

         Part 4    What was Zedekiah's traditional attitude toward Jere-
    ZEDEKIAH'S  miah's prophecies?
      ATTITUDE     "But neither he [Zedekiah], nor his servants, nor the people
       TOWARD of the land, did hearken unto the words of the Lord, which he
                spake by the prophet Jeremiah." Jer. 37:2.
   GOD'S WORD
                      "Zedekiah at the beginning of his reign was trusted fully by
                  the king of Babylon and had as a tried counselor the prophet
                  Jeremiah. By pursuing an honorable course toward the Baby-
                  lonians and by paying heed to the messages from the Lord
                  through Jeremiah, he could have kept the respect of many in
                  high authority and have had opportunity to communicate to
                  them a knowledge of the true God. Thus the captive exiles al-
                  ready in Babylon would have been placed on vantage ground
                  and granted many liberties; the name of God would have been
                  honored far and wide; and those that remained in the land of
                  Judah would have been spared the terrible calamities that
                   finally came upon them."—Prophets and Kings, p. 440.

                      What request did Zedekiah nevertheless present to Jere-
                    miah through two messengers? Verse 3.
                       In view of Zedekiah's reaction to Jeremiah's messages, his
                    request is at least interesting. The human mind is a puzzling
                    entity. Although it is capable of logical reasoning, we do not
                    always employ it in a rational way. The mind is under the direc-
                    tion of the will which sometimes chooses not to think from
                    cause to effect, or choose to pursue a reasonable line of
                    thought. Zedekiah's behavior appears illogical to us; neverthe-
                    less, many of us undoubtedly act in the same way, refusing to
                    heed God's voice or counsel to us, while we expect Him to
                    help us in our predicaments.

                       What was Jeremiah's reply to the king's request? Verses
                    7, 8.
                        The hope that the approach of the Egyptian army had raised
                    in the heart of the king and his people was quashed by God's
                    message to Zedekiah through Jeremiah. The king and the peo-
                    ple persisted in clinging to their own hopes, rather than heeding
                    the revealed will of God.
                       How inevitable was Judah's doom before the Babylonians?
                    Verse 10.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Do you and I also, like Zedekiah, ask God for guidance,
                    help, and protection, while we deliberately refuse to comply
                    with His will on points that are dear to us? Note Prov. 28:9;
                    Ps. 66:18.

          Part 5       Why did God advise the people of Judah to surrender to
     JEWS SAFER     the Babylonians?
     IN BABYLON       "And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord;
                   Behold, 1 set before you the way of life, and the way of
                   death. He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and
                   by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out,
                   and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live,
                   and his life shall be unto him for a prey." Jer. 21:8, 9.

                      In mercy to the people God asked them to surrender. In the
                   councils of heaven Jerusalem had filled its cup of iniquity. Its
                   destruction was determined. But its inhabitants might still save
                   their lives if they surrendered to the Babylonians.

                      Who was actually fighting against Jerusalem and stubborn
                   Judah? Verses 4-6.
                        "God has revealed in His law the principles that underlie
                    all true prosperity both of nations and of individuals. 'This is
                    your wisdom and your understanding,' Moses declared to the
                    Israelites of the law of God. 'It is not a vain thing for you; be-
                    cause it is your life.' Deuteronomy 4:6; 32:47. The blessings
                    thus assured to Israel are, on the same conditions and in the
                    same degree, assured to every nation and every individual un-
                    der the broad heavens."—Education, p. 174.
                        "The desolation of Jerusalem in the days of Jeremiah is a
                   solemn warning to modern Israel, that the counsels and ad-
                   monitions given them through chosen instrumentalities cannot
                   be disregarded with impunity."—Prophets and Kings, p. 417.
                       "I have been looking over the Testimonies given for Sab-
                   bathkeepers and I am astonished at the mercy of God and His
                   care for His people in giving them so many warnings, pointing
                   out their dangers, and presenting before them the exalted posi-
                   tion which He would have them occupy. If they would keep
                   themselves in His love and separate from the world, He would
                   cause His special blessings to rest upon them and His light to
                   shine round about them. Their influence for good might be felt
                   in every branch of the work and in every part of the gospel field.
                   But if they fail to meet the mind of God, if they continue to
                   have so little sense of the exalted character of ,the work as they
                   have had in the past, their influence and example will prove
                   a terrible curse."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 483.

"Is There Any Word From the Lord?" LESSON 3                          ❑ Friday
                                                                     October 17

        Part 6      During the final siege of Jerusalem what did King Zede-
    THE WORD     kiah again want to know?
FROM THE LORD       "Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the
                 king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any
                 word from the Lord?" Jer.37:17.
                    Zedekiah wanted to know what was going to happen. To that
                 end he inquired from Jeremiah secretly without his counselors
                 and princes knowing about it. "The king dared not openly mani-
                 fest any faith in Jeremiah. Though his fear drove him to seek
                 information of him privately, yet he was too weak to brave the
                 disapprobation of his princes and of the people by submitting
                 to the will of God as declared by the prophet."—Prophets and
                 Kings, p. 455.

                    What was Jeremiah's answer from God to the king's in-
                 quiry? Jer. 37:17 (last part).
                    "From the court of the prison Jeremiah continued to advise
                 submission to the Babylonian rule. To offer resistance would
                 be to invite sure death."—Prophets and Kings, p. 455.
                    Zedekiah had a desire to follow God's will as unveiled to
                 him by the prophet. But he was weak in moral character and
                 did not have fortitude and moral stamina to stand up before his
                 counselors and the people who were thoroughly pro-Egyptian.
                 The leaders and the people hoped that through an alliance
                 with Egypt, Judah would still regain its independence and past
                 power and glory.
                    "Those who stand in defense of the honor of God and main-
                 tain the purity of truth at any cost will have manifold trials, as
                 did our Saviour in the wilderness of temptation. While those
                 who have yielding temperaments, who have not courage to
                 condemn wrong, but keep silent when their influence is needed
                 to stand in defense of the right against any pressure, may avoid
                 many heartaches and escape many perplexities, they will also
                 lose a very rich reward, if not their own souls. Those who are
                 in harmony with God, and who through faith in Him receive
                 strength to resist wrong and stand in defense of the right, will
                 always have severe conflicts and will frequently have to stand
                 almost alone. But precious victories will be theirs while they
                 make God their dependence. His grace will be their strength.
                 Their moral sensibility will be keen and clear, and their moral
                 powers will be able to withstand wrong influences. Their in-
                 tegrity, like that of Moses, will be of the purest character."—

        Part 1    What had God's people originally been like in His sight?
     ZION LIKE    "I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and deli-
               cate woman." Jer. 6:2.
     A WOMAN
                    Zion originally was the name of a part of Jerusalem. Later it
                referred to all of Jerusalem and sometimes it is used to refer
                to the whole nation. Hence "the daughter of Zion" here and
                also in Micah 4:8 refers to God's redeemed people.
                    In both the Old and the New Testaments the church is often
                portrayed under the symbol of a woman, "a virtuous woman
                representing a pure church, a vile woman an apostate church."
                —The Great Controversy, p. 381.
                    At first Israel was aptly represented by a beautiful, pure
                woman. Such a woman God found to be a suitable representa-
                tion of His church.


                  In another figure of speech to what does Jeremiah compare
                God's people during their wilderness days? Jer. 2:2, 3.

                   "In her youth Israel had responded to the wooing of God's
                love. In poetic figure God is represented as the Lover and
                Israel as His betrothed."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 2:2.


                  How does God, through Jeremiah, portray His people's
                departure from Him? Jer. 3:20.

                    No neglect on God's part had caused His people's degener-
                acy. His work for them had been noble and flawless. But through
                their own choice degeneracy had set in.
                    "The unfaithfulness of the church to Christ in permitting her
                confidence and affection to be turned from Him, and allowing
                the love of worldly things to occupy the soul, is likened to the
                violation of the marriage vow. The sin of Israel in departing
                from the Lord is presented under this figure; and the wonder-
                ful love of God which they thus despised is touchingly por-
                trayed: 'I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with

                wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a king-

        Part 2    In what did the Jews, under the leadership of the priests
               and false prophets, apparently trust as the source of their

               security and wisdom?
   WITH JUDAH
                      "How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is
                   with us?" Jer. 8:8 (first part).

                       Under the leadership of the priests and false prophets, the
                   Jews in Jeremiah's time did not pretend to have put aside the
                   law of God. Rather they confidently asserted that they had the
                   law of God among them. Indeed, Hilkiah the high priest had
                   discovered the book of Deuteronomy in the temple and brought
                   it to the attention of King Josiah. As a result of this, a formal
                   reformation and a return to the law had taken place.
                       The priests represented the people before God. They func-
                   tioned as spokesmen and mediators of the sacrificial system.
                   They led in worship. But the priests concerned themselves
                   largely with the ceremonies and rituals of the sanctuary. This
                    centered in public worship and in the maintenance of an
                    alleged right relationship between God and the people through
                   various offerings and other performances.

                      Despite the objections of the priests and prophets, what
                   charge did God level against them and the people at large?
                   Jer. 6:10, 19; 8:9; 9:13.
                      Previous to the reformation under Josiah, "through Huldah
                   the Lord sent Josiah word that Jerusalem's ruin could not be
                   averted. Even should the people now humble themselves before
                   God, they could not escape their punishment. So long had their
                   senses been deadened by wrongdoing that, if judgment should
                   not come upon them, they would soon return to the same sinful
                   course....
                      "But because the king [Josiah] had humbled his heart before
                   God, the Lord would acknowledge his promptness in seeking
                   forgiveness and mercy."—Prophets and Kings, p. 399.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what way may we pride ourselves in knowing the law
                    of God and yet not really keep it?
                       "Our standing before God depends, not upon the amount of
                    light we have received, but upon the use we make of what we
                    have. Thus even the heathen who choose the right as far as
                    they can distinguish it are in a more favorable condition than
                    are those who have had great light, and profess to serve God,
                    but who disregard the light, and by their daily life contradict
                    their profession."—The Desire of Ages, p. 239.

          Part 3        Besides trusting in their possession of the law of God for
     SECURITY IN    their security, in what else did the Jews place their confidence
                    for safety?
     THE TEMPLE
                       "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the
                    Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are
                    these." Jer. 7:4.
                      The Jews felt secure from all calamity since they had the
                   temple of Solomon, the dwelling place of God, among them.
                      "Theirs was a formal religion that was satisfied to substitute
                   external conformity for inner righteousness and truth. They
                   deceived themselves into thinking that because they had the
                   Temple of Jerusalem they had the guarantee of the divine pres-
                   ence and favor and a defense against harm."—SDA Bible Com-
                   mentary, on Micah 3:11.
                      Into what had the Jews in their ritualistic worship changed
                   the temple, and what did God propose to do to the temple
                   because of their wickedness? Jeremiah 7:10-14.
                      Shiloh, about 18 miles north of Jerusalem, was the place
                   where the tabernacle had first been erected upon Israel's
                   occupation of the Promised Land. "The ark remained at Shiloh
                   for three hundred years, until, because of the sins of Eli's
                   house, it fell into the hands of the Philistines, and Shiloh was
                   ruined. The ark was never returned to the tabernacle here, the
                   sanctuary service was finally transferred to the temple at Jeru-
                   salem, and Shiloh fell into insignificance. There are only ruins
                   to mark the spot where it once stood. Long afterward its fate
                   was made use of as a warning to Jerusalem."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 514.
THINK IT THROUGH      What is the modern equivalent of trusting in the temple
                   as evidence of God's favor and presence? What lessons do
                   you see in Judah's temple trusting?
                      "From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every created
                   being, from the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a
                   temple for the indwelling of the Creator. Because of sin, hu-
                   manity ceased to be a temple for God. Darkened and defiled
                   by evil, the heart of man no longer revealed the glory of the
                   Divine One. But by the incarnation of the Son of God, the pur-
                   pose of Heaven is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity, and through
                   saving grace the heart of man becomes again His temple. God
                   designed that the temple at Jerusalem should be a continual
                   witness to the high destiny open to every soul."—The Desire of

A Religious People       LESSON 4                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    October 22


        Part 4       "And all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the
    PRACTICED      heart." Jer. 9:26.
 CIRCUMCISION        Compare Jer. 6:10; 4:4; Deut. 30:6.
                      The Jews were set apart from the surrounding nations. One
                   distinguishing feature of this separateness was circumcision,
                   which God gave as a sign to Abraham and his descendants. To
                   Abraham it was given as "a seal of the righteousness of the
                   faith which he had yet being uncircumcised." Rom. 4:11. It
                   was a sign of the covenant that God entered into with Abraham.
                      During the history of Israel, when had the males in Israel
                   not been circumcised according to the Lord's direction? Joshua
                   5:5.
                       "In the rebellion at Kadesh they had rejected God, and God
                   had for the time rejected them. Since they had proved unfaith-
                   ful to His covenant, they were not to receive the sign of the
                   covenant, the rite of circumcision."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   p. 406.
                      What command did God give to Joshua after Israel had
                   crossed the Jordan River? Joshua 5:2.
                       "A short distance from Jordan the Hebrews made their first
                   encampment in Canaan. Here Joshua 'circumcised the children
                   of Israel;' and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and
                   kept the Passover.' The suspension of the rite of circumcision
                   since the rebellion at Kadesh had been a constant witness to
                   Israel that their covenant with God, of which it was the ap-
                   pointed symbol, had been broken."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   p. 485.
                      Because the circumcision of the Jews was of no avail,
                   what did God through Jeremiah say He would do with them?
                   Jer. 9:25.
                      Circumcision came to be a cultural symbol, rather than a
                   personal sign of commitment to God's will. To the Jews in
                   Jeremiah's day it had, in most instances, become an entirely
                   physical act and state rather than a sign of the particular Jew's
                   loyalty and devotion to God and His ways, as it had been in
                   the case of Abraham. Thus there was no difference between
                   them and the heathen, and they would together reap punish-
                   ment from God.
THINK IT THROUGH     What is the Christian counterpart to Jewish circumcision,
                   and what implications do you see in this lesson for church
                   members today?

A Religious People LESSON 4                                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                      October 23

         Part 5       In their apostasy what were the Jews still practicing in
     OFFERINGS     connection with their temple worship?
                      "To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba,
                   and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings
                   are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me." Jer.
                   6:20.
                      That the Jews were faithfully burning incense and bringing
                   animal offerings to the temple is clear. Although Jeremiah 7:21,
                   22 can be interpreted two ways; the prophet is not invalidating
                   the sacrificial system. This is evident from other verses like
                   Jeremiah 17:26; 33:11, 17, 18. He is only trying to impress upon
                   the ritualistically correct Jews the worthlessness of external
                   obedience apart from holiness of heart. At best a sin offering
                   or a trespass offering was only an admission of failure and
                   recognition of the need for a sinless substitute.

                      What did the prophets teach about animal offerings?
                   1 Sam. 15:22; Isa. 1:11; Micah 6:7.
                      " `To obey is better than sacrifice.' The sacrificial offerings
                   were in themselves of no value in the sight of God. They were
                   designed to express on the part of the offerer penitence for sin
                   and faith in Christ and to pledge future obedience to the law
                   of God. But without penitence, faith, and an obedient heart,
                   the offerings were worthless."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 634.

                      How does the prophet Micah sum up the desires of God
                   with reference to His people? Micah 6:8.
                      "The many sacrifices of the Jews and the flowing of blood
                   to atone for sins for which they felt no true repentance was ever
                   repugnant to God. He spoke through Micah saying, [Micah
                   6:6-8 quoted]."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                   mentary, vol. 4, p. 1174.

THINK IT THROUGH       How may we today, without ceremonial offerings like those
                   of the Jews, engage in worthless religious services?
                       "Costly gifts and a semblance of holiness cannot win the
                   favor of God. He requires for His mercies a contrite spirit, a
                   heart open to the light of truth, love and compassion for our
                   fellow men, and a spirit refusing to be bribed through avarice
                   or self-love. The priests and rulers were destitute of these es-
                   sentials to God's favor, and their most precious gifts and
                   gorgeous ceremonies were an abomination in His eyes."—Ellen

                 Jer. 8:11.
 ALL WAS WELL
                    The religious leaders and the false prophets assured the
                 Jews in the days of Jeremiah that all was well. This concept is
                 comprehended in the Hebrew word shalom, from which the
                 word "peace" is translated in the above verse. Shalom was
                 used to describe far more than absence of war and was "fre-
                 quently used to comprehend all the good things of life. Shalom
                 has been defined as meaning not only 'peace,' but also 'com-
                 pleteness,' prosperity,"welfare,"health,"friendship,' etc."
                 —SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 6:14.

                    What was the thinking and conviction of the people of
                 Judah regarding their own moral state? Jer. 2:35. See also
                 Jer. 5:31.
                    The Jews were not conscious of any guilt before God. Had
                 not good King Josiah through his religious reformation rectified
                 any mistakes and made amends for any sins that his grand-
                 father Manasseh and his father Amon had made and perpet-
                 uated? They were sure that they deserved God's grace.

                   At what did the unfortunate Jews express their amaze-
                 ment? Jer. 5:19 (first part); 16:10.
                    In sheer astonishment they would ask, "When you tell .this
                 people all these things they will ask you, 'Why has the Lord
                 decreed that this great disaster is to come upon us? What
                 wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the
                 Lord our God?' " Jer. 16:10, NEB.
                    Theirs was the common justification, What wrong have we
                 done? That very question itself, common though it may be even
                 among us, puts the emphasis on the wrong place. Stress should
                 not be placed on what is wrong with something. If there is
                 nothing wrong with what we do, we still have done nothing
                 right. Such an attitude is negative at best. Neither does a corpse
                 do anything wrong.

                    In which respect is the attitude of the Jews in Jeremiah's
                 day similar to the Laodicean attitude expressed in Revelation
                 3:17?
                     "There is nothing so offensive to God or so dangerous to the
                 human soul as pride and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the
                 most hopeless, the most incurable."—Christ's Object Lessons,

  "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the      God ever since they entered the
God of Israel, Amend your ways and        Promised Land. Israel deserted her
your doings, and I will cause you to      God and upon her entry into

   In the first discourse, or series of      The first part of the Temple Ser-

that Israel's history has been one of     similar to Jeremiah 26. If it is based

                                          it was first given in the early part
                                          of Jehoiakim's reign. See Jer. 26:1;

                                          to Judah in the days of Jeremiah.
                                          But even here God's people or the
                                          Jews were occasionally addressed as
                                          Israel as for instance in Jeremiah
                                          10:1 and also occasionally through-
                                          out the remainder of the book, since•
                                          the Jews in Jeremiah's day were the
                                          remnant of the original nation of
                                          Israel.

         Part 1       What indictment did God bring against His people?
    ISRAEL AND       "Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods?
         JUDAH    but my people have changed their glory for that which doth
 CHANGED GODS     not profit." Jer. 2:11.

                      God's professed people, Israel, early changed their gods
                  and worshiped both their own gods of gold and heathen idols.
                  At Sinai they made and worshiped a golden calf (see Ex. 32:1-6);
                  in the Shittim valley across Jordan from Jericho on the very
                  borders of the Promised Land Israel worshiped the gods of the
                  Moabites. See Num. 25:1, 2. In spite of this departure "In every
                  age, . . . because of His infinite love for the erring, God has
                  borne long with the rebellious, and has urged them to forsake
                  their course of evil and return to Him."—Prophets and Kings,
                  pp. 324, 325.

                     How did the loyalty of the heathen nations compare with
                  Judah's loyalty to God? Jer. 2:11.
                     "Only in extraordinary cases would an idolatrous nation dis-
                  card its ancestral religion. Even today many adherents of
                  heathen religions are truer to their gods than are nominal Chris-
                  tians to the one true God."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer.
                  2:11.

                     As God's ancient people turned away from the Lord, how
                  deep did they sink? Jer. 2:33.
                      "Judah had become so vile that even wicked women could
                  learn from her. The wickedness of God's chosen people not
                  only confirmed the heathen in their idolatry but also taught
                  them new ways of practicing it."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                  Jer. 2:33.
                      "Israel's sin at Beth-peor brought the judgments of God
                  upon the nation, and though the same sins may not now be
                  punished as speedily, they will as surely meet retribution. 'If
                  any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.'
                  1 Corinthians 3:17. Nature has affixed terrible penalties to these
                  crimes,—penalties which, sooner or later, will be inflicted upon
                  every transgressor. It is these sins more than any other that
                  have caused the fearful degeneracy of our race, and the weight
                  of disease and misery with which the world is cursed. Men
                  may succeed in concealing their transgression from their fellow
                  men, but they will no less surely reap the result, in suffering,
                  disease, imbecility, or death. And beyond this life stands the
                  tribunal of the judgment, with its award of eternal penalties."

                                                                       October 27

         Part 2       How had God's chosen people repeatedly tried to bolster
     SPIRITUAL     their political position among the nations?
   AND LITERAL        "And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to
     ADULTERY      drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way
                   of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?" Jer. 2:18.
                      Earlier prophets (see Isa. 30:1-7; Hosea 5:13; 7:11, 16; 12:1)
                   had warned God's people against alliances with heathen na-
                   tions. "But instead of turning away from those practices which
                   had brought weakness to the kingdom [of Israel], they con-
                   tinued in iniquity, flattering themselves that when occasion
                   arose, they would attain to the political power they desired by
                   allying themselves with the heathen."—Prophets and Kings,
                   p. 280.
                       "It was by departure from the Lord, and alliance with the
                   heathen, that the Jewish church became a harlot."—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 382.

                      What often accompanied the worship of heathen deities?
                   Jer. 2:20; 5:7; 9:2.
                      While God condemned Judah's worship of heathen gods as
                   adultery in a spiritual sense, the rites of these false religions
                   frequently included literal adultery with "holy" priestesses in
                   groves consecrated to the god.
                       Although Judah had observed the idolatry of Israel and
                   its resultant Assyrian captivity, what did the Jews still do?
                   Jer. 3:6-9.
THINK IT THROUGH       What is an idol? Is it possible that even today we might
                   be worshiping idols? How?
                       Ellen G. White wrote about the Seventh-day Adventists back
                   in 1865: "They have other gods before the Lord. Their taste,
                   their appetite, is their god; and when the ax is laid at the root
                   of the tree and those who have indulged their depraved appe-
                   tites at the expense of health are touched, their sin pointed
                   out, their idols shown them, they do not wish to be convinced;
                   and although God's voice should speak directly to them to
                   put away those health-destroying indulgences, some would
                   still cling to the hurtful things which they love. They seem
                   joined to their idols, and God will soon say to His angels: Let
                    them alone."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 486.
                       "They [some men and women] worship their earthly treasure,
                    as the ignorant heathen does his idols."—Testimonies, vol. 1,

        Part 3      What abominable practice of worship had God's people
 ABOMINATIONS    adopted from their heathen neighbors?
    PRACTICED
                     "And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is
                 in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and
                 their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not,
                 neither came it into my heart." Jer. 7:31.

                     The valley of Hinnom was southwest of Jerusalem. During
                 the time of the kingdom of Judah the valley became identified
                 with the worship of Molech.
                     "To put an end to these abominations Josiah 'defiled' the
                 valley (2 Kings 23:10, 14), making it, according to tradition, the
                 receptacle of carcasses and filth. . . .
                     "The sacrificing of children formed part of the idolatrous
                 worship of the Phoenicians, Moabites, Ammonites, and others.
                 This horrid practice was taken over by Ahaz ... and Manasseh.
                 . . . It is not certain whether the children were burned alive
                 or first slain. Since they were offered to Molech as a burnt offer-
                 ing (see Jer. 19:5; Eze. 16:20, 21), it has been argued that the
                 children were first slain."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 7:31.
                     Before their entry into the Promised Land, God had strictly
                 forbidden His people to engage in these idolatrous rites under
                 severe penalties. See Lev. 18:21; 20:1-5; Deut. 12:31; 18:9, 10.
                 For this and other abominations the Canaanites were dispos-
                 sessed.


                     What would be the result of God's own people descending
                 to these idolatrous practices? Jer. 19:4-9.

                     "Children are not to be trained to be the devotees of society.
                 They are not to be sacrificed to Molech, but they are to become
                 members of the Lord's family. Parents are to be filled with the
                 compassion of Christ, that they may work for the salvation of
                 the souls that are placed under their influence. They are not to
                 have their minds all engrossed in the fashions and practices of
                 the world. They are not to educate their children to attend par-
                 ties and concerts and dances, to have and attend feasts, be-
                 cause after this manner the Gentiles walk."—Child Guidance,

God's People on Trial LESSON 5                                   11] Wednesday
                                                                     October 29

        Part 4      What challenging rhetorical question does God address to
  TOTAL MORAL    His people in view of their departure from His will for them?
  DEGRADATION       "Thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers
                 found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked
                 after vanity, and are become vain?" Jer. 2:5.

                    Against the background of the original purity and intimacy
                 of the bride's relationship to a loyal husband (verse 2), the
                 present state of degeneration of that relationship into infidelity,
                 adultery, and harlotry appears incomprehensible.

                   What charge of basic corruption does God repeatedly make
                 against His people? Jer. 5:2, 31; 6:13; 7:8; 8:5, 6; 9:5, 8.

                    Lying—falsehood, deceit, guile, et cetera—is a foundational
                 sin. There is hope for a thief, an adulterer, a Sabbath breaker,
                 and other violators of God's law, if they are truthful. Such
                 persons can be helped and rebuilt into rectitude. But a liar who
                 covers his fault cannot be redeemed, because he will not admit
                 to reality. He refuses to see things as they are. Lying is the
                 very antithesis of the nature of God, who is truth. See John
                 14:17; 1 John 5:6. Consequently any type of lying or dishonesty
                 —unconfessed and unrepented—will make us unfit for heav-
                 enly companionship. See Rev. 21:27; 22:15.

                    What were some other sins rampant among God's pro-
                 fessed people in the days of Jeremiah? Jer. 3:2; 6:28.

                    The spiritual life of God's people had bectme utterly de-
                 graded.

                    What would result from Judah's sinfulness? Jer. 7:32-34.

                    Spiritual degradation with self-deception had advanced so
                 far that nothing short of the great calamity seen by Jeremiah
                 in vision coming from the north would open their eyes to reality.
                    "Truth is of God; deception in all its myriad forms is of
                 Satan, and whoever in any way departs from the straight line
                 of truth is betraying himself into the power of the wicked one.
                 Those who have learned da Christ will 'have no fellowship with
                 the unfruitful works of darkness.'
                                            rkness.' Ephesians 5:11. In speech,
                 as in life, they will be simple, straightforward and true, for they
                 are preparing for the fellowship of those holy ones in whose
                 mouth is found no guile."—Prophets and Kings, p. 252.

                                                                     October 30

         Part 5     How had the eunuch Ebed-melech manifested his loyalty to
  EBED-MELECH,    God amid the apostate Jews? Jer. 38:7-13.
 THE ETHIOPIAN       Ebed-melech was a stranger by race in Jerusalem. He was
                  an Ethiopian in the service of King Zedekiah at the court. Ac-
                  cording to ordinary human considerations, a man in that station
                  would conform to the sentiments of the court and the country
                  in which he lived and served.
                     But higher considerations than timeserving ruled this man.
                  He trusted not in man; God Himself through Jeremiah testified
                  of him, "Thou hast put thy trust in me." Jer. 39:18. Thus he was
                  a servant of God, and he was unafraid and boldly went to the
                  king and presented Jeremiah's predicament to him, after the
                  princes had put the prophet into the dungeon, which was really
                  a muddy cistern.
                     To Jeremiah in his apparently futile ministry to his people,
                  Ebed-melech's faithfulness must have been a source of encour-
                  agement. As the ministry of Jesus was drawing to a close and
                  His chosen people rejected Him as their Saviour, a group of
                  Greeks sought Him. See John 12:20-22; The Desire of Ages,
                  p. 621. As Jesus saw the request of the Greeks as "an earnest
                  of the results of His great sacrifice," so Jeremiah through
                  Ebed-melech realized that at least some, although heathen,
                  would accept the call to repentance and salvation.

                     Just before Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians and King
                  Zedekiah was taken captive, what message came to Jeremiah
                  concerning Ebed-melech? Jer. 39:15-18.

                      "Because of his loyalty toward Jeremiah, God promises the
                  Ethiopian that his life will be spared from 'the hand of the
                  princes of Judah, who were angered by his action regarding
                  the prophet (ch. 38:7-13), and that he will 'not fall by the
                  sword' (ch. 39:18) of the Babylonians, since Jeremiah will un-
                  doubtedly intercede for him."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                  Jer. 39:17.
                      "Whatever may be their profession, it is only those who are
                  world servers at heart that act from policy rather than principle
                  in religious things. We should choose the right because it is
                  right, and leave consequences with God. To men of principle,
                  faith, and daring, the world is indebted for its great reforms.
                  By such men the work of reform for this time must be carried
                  forward."—The Great Controversy, p. 460.

        Part 6        To what test did Jeremiah submit the Rechabites?
THE RECHABITES        "And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites
                   pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye
                   wine. But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the
                   son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall
                   drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever." Jer. 35:5, 6.
                       The Rechabites were a faithful remnant in Judah. They were
                   descendants of Jonadab who was associated with Jehu in
                   his destruction of the descendants of Ahab. See 2 Kings 10:
                   15-17. From Jonadab they had received strict principles of
                   living that they still loyally adhered to after more than 200
                   years.
                       "To illustrate the importance of yielding implicit obedience
                   to the requirements of God, Jeremiah gathered some Recha-
                   bites in to one of the chambers of the temple and set wine
                   before them, inviting them to drink. As was to have been ex-
                   pected, he met with remonstrance and absolute refusal."—
                   Prophets and Kings, p. 423.
                     What contrast did the Rechabites present to the Jews in
                   general in Jeremiah's time? Jer. 35:12-14.
                       "God sought thus to bring into sharp contrast the obedience
                   of the Rechabites with the disobedience and rebellion of His
                   people. The Rechabites had obeyed the command of their
                   father and now refused to be enticed into transgression. But
                   the men of Judah had hearkened not to the words of the Lord,
                   and were in consequence about to suffer His severest judg-
                   ments."—Prophets and Kings, p. 424.
THINK IT THROUGH       In what particular ways do we today need to realign our
                   lives in order to be in harmony with God's will?
                       "If the directions of a good and wise father, who took the
                   best and most effectual means to secure his posterity against
                   the evil of intemperance, were to be so strictly obeyed, God's

                   If they will continue to disregard the reproofs He sends them,
                   and act contrary to His declared will, ruin must follow; for
                    God's people are kept in prosperity only by His mercy, through
                   the care of His heavenly messengers. He will not uphold and

          Part 1      How does Jeremiah ordinarily introduce his messages or
     GOD'S WORD    sermons?
        CAME TO        "Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying." Jer.
       JEREMIAH    2:1
                      In chapter 1 alone Jeremiah mentions seven times that he
                   was not speaking his own words but only presenting what had
                   been given him by God (see verses 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).
                   In introducing his first message in chapter 2 he again makes
                   clear that the words he is going to speak are not his words
                   but God's.
                      How is the intimacy between God and Jeremiah revealed?
                   Jer. 12:1.
                      Jeremiah does not limit himself to the mechanical proclama-
                   tion of the messages God conveys to him. He feels free to dis-
                   cuss problems with God that he fails to understand and to
                   argue propositions with his heavenly Parent that perplex and
                   trouble him. In other words he levels with God. This is an in-
                   dication of his intimate friendship with God.
                      What intimate, personal advice did God give Jeremiah?
                   Jer. 16:1, 2.
                      God's restriction on Jeremiah touches the very vitals of
                   human life and desire. Jeremiah learns God's will for him. As
                   a committed believer he chooses to obey God's will rather
                   than follow his natural human inclinations.
                      "Vss. 1-9 clearly document the prophet's loneliness, here
                   spelled out in biographical detail. Like Paul, Jeremiah refrains
                   from marriage 'for the present distress' (I Cor. 7:26). So as-
                   sured is Jeremiah of the coming catastrophe and of his pro-
                   phetic mission that he forgoes the desirable and normal plea-
                   sures of family and home. So universal is the calamity bearing
                   down upon the people that he will not . . . [beget] children to
                   suffer its outrages."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 5, p. 946.

THINK IT THROUGH      How does God's word come to us today?
                       "God's work of refining and purifying must go on until His
                   servants are so humbled, so dead to self, that, when called into
                   active service, their eye will be single to His glory. He will then
                   accept their efforts; they will not move rashly, from impulse;
                   they will not rush on and imperil the Lord's cause, being slaves
                   to temptations and passions, and followers of their own carnal
                   mind set on fire by Satan. Oh, how fearfully is the cause of God
                   marred by man's perverse will and unsubdued temper! How
                   much suffering he brings upon himself by following his own
                   headstrong passions!"—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 86.

        Part 2      "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word
                 was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am
     JEREMIAH
                 called by thy name, 0 Lord God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
    FINDS THE
        WORD         God desires to speak to every individual. Very seldom, how-
                 ever, does He speak to men in an audible voice as He appar-
                 ently did often to Jeremiah. But He longs to speak to us through
                 His Written Word, His providences, through other people, and
                 through His Holy Spirit.
                     But God's speaking does not necessarily imply that we hear.
                 God is constantly trying to speak to us, but it is necessary for
                 us to be close to Him in order that we might hear and under-
                 stand. Jeremiah's closeness to God consequently enabled him
                 both to hear and to understand God's word to him. Neither is
                 it sufficient to hear God's voice speaking to us through different
                 media. It is possible to hear words but fail to understand. The
                 message conveyed must register in our personal understanding
                 of it. Jeremiah did not merely hear God's voice and message;
                 he understood it and accepted it. He also brought his will into
                 conformity to God's will and obeyed God.
                     As Jeremiah found the word of God, what did he do with
                 it? Verse 16 (first part).
                    Eating the word symbolizes, not merely reading the word,
                 but taking it into the mind and meditating upon it. As food
                 eaten is useless unless one's digestive organs can prepare it
                 for assimilation by the blood, so the word of God is also useless
                 unless it is taken into the mind and becomes a subject for
                 meditation. As the nutrients of digested food are assimilated
                 by the blood and carried to different parts of the body to be
                 used either as building material or energy, so the word, pre-
                 pared by meditation, will be implemented in actions and deci-
                 sions of daily life.
                     As Jeremiah ate and digested the word, how did he react
                 to it? Verse 16 (middle part).
                    As he symbolically ate the word, it became the joy and re-
                 joicing of his heart. He embraced God's word with love.
                    "Let not the days pass by and precious opportunities be
                 lost of seeking the Lord with all the heart and mind and soul.
                 If we accept not the truth in the love of it, we may be among
                 the number who will see the miracles wrought by Satan in
                 these last days, and believe them. Many strange things will
                 appear as wonderful miracles, which should be regarded as
                 deceptions manufactured by the father of lies."—Selected Mes-

          Part 3     As Jeremiah contemplated the opposition and rebuffs his
       TRIED TO    message aroused, what was he tempted to believe?
     FLEE FROM        "0 Lord, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou
      THE WORD     art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily,
                   every one mocketh me. For since I spake, I cried out, I cried
                   violence and spoil; because the word of the Lord was made a
                   reproach unto me, and a derision, daily." Jer. 20:7, 8.
                      Jeremiah had just spent a night of pain and humiliation in
                   the stocks. He was tired and prone to be discouraged. See
                   verses 2 and 3.
                      When God called Jeremiah to the prophetic office, He had
                   promised to defend and protect him. See ch. 1:18, 19. On this
                   occasion this promise had apparently not been fulfilled. This
                   perplexed Jeremiah. The temptation assailed him that a de-
                   monic spirit had deceived him, since the word of the Lord was
                   made a reproach unto him and a daily derision.

                      Facing these adversities and haunting doubts, what did
                   Jeremiah decide to do? Jer. 20:9 (first part).
                       Jeremiah was not the last one trying to flee from his gospel
                   commission. John Mark left it temporarily because he failed
                   to endure the hardships encountered. See Acts 13:13. The
                   apostle Paul preached since necessity was laid upon him. See
                   1 Cor. 9:16.
                       Luther confessed, "Nothing is keeping me in the ministry
                   of the Word except my obedience to the will of another, namely,
                   the will of God. Of my own free will I would never have gone

THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways am I shunning God's will for me, because it
                   appears too difficult or impossible?
                      "The Duke of Wellington was once present where a party of
                   Christian men were discussing the possibility of success in
                   missionary effort among the heathen. They appealed to the
                   duke to say whether in his judgment such efforts were likely
                   to prove a success commensurate to the cost. The old soldier
                   replied:
                      "'Gentlemen, what are your marching orders? Success is
                   not the question for you to discuss. If I read your orders aright,
                   they run thus, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel
                   to every creature." Gentlemen, obey your marching orders.' "

Jeremiah and the Word LESSON 6                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  November 5

       Part 4    How was Jeremiah affected when he tried to refrain from
    THE WORD preaching God's message?
       A FIRE    "But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up
   WITHIN HIM in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could
                 not stay." Jer. 20:9.

                    Jeremiah thought he would free himself from the divine com-
                 mission he had received. He had taken all he could endure of
                 humiliation, of scorn, and of mockings; he did not want to be
                 a laughingstock any longer. He resolved to proclaim the word
                 no more. But to his utter amazement he found he was unable
                 to leave his prophetic ministry. He was a captive of the word
                 of God.

                     What promise had God earlier given Jeremiah as to the
                 effectiveness of his words in contradiction to the words of the
                 false prophets? Jer. 5:14.

                     God's words through Jeremiah were not to be lightly dis-
                 counted, although now laughed at by the people. "Instead of
                 proving to be wind, God's word in the mouth of Jeremiah is
                 represented as becoming a fire that would suddenly and irre-
                 sistibly consume the scoffers as fire consumes dry wood (see
                 Jer. 1:9, 10; 23:29; cf. Ps. 83:14, 15; Isa. 9:18, 19)."—SDA
                 Bible Commentary, on Jer. 5:14.
                      "It is time that the watchmen upon the walls of Zion under-
                 stood the responsibility and sacredness of their mission. They
                 should feel that a woe is upon them if they do not perform the
                 work which God has committed to them. If they become un-
                 faithful, they are endangering the safety of the flock of God,
                 endangering the cause of truth, and exposing it to the ridicule
                 of our enemies."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 379.
                      "God will move upon men in humble positions to declare
                 the message of present truth. Many such will be seen hastening
                 hither and thither, constrained by the Spirit of God to give the
                 light to those in darkness. The truth is as a fire in their bones,
                 filling them with a burning desire to enlighten those who sit in
                  darkness. Many, even among the uneducated, will proclaim the
                 word of the Lord. Children will be impelled by the Holy Spirit
                  to go forth to declare the message of heaven. The Spirit will
                  be poured out upon those who yield to His promptings. Casting
                  off man's binding rules and cautious movements, they will join
                  the army of the Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 7, pp. 26, 27.

        Part 5   How were the Jews apparently keeping the Sabbath in the
URGES SABBATH days of Jeremiah? Jer. 17:19-22.
       REFORM
                   "On one occasion, by command of the Lord, the prophet
                took his position at one of the principal entrances to the city
                and there urged the importance of keeping holy the Sabbath
                day. The inhabitants of Jerusalem were in danger of losing
                sight of the sanctity of the Sabbath, and they were solemnly
                warned against following their secular pursuits on that day."
                —Prophets and Kings, p. 411.

                   What would have been the reward of following Jeremiah's
                counsel and keeping the Sabbath commandment?

                    "And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto
                me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of
                this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to
                do no work therein; then shall there enter into the gates of
                this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David,
                riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the
                men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city
                shall remain for ever." Jer. 17:24, 25.

                  What did God foretell would befall Jerusalem if the people
                continued to break the Sabbath commandment? Jer. 17:27.

                   "This promise of prosperity as the reward of allegiance was
                accompanied by a prophecy of the terrible judgments that
                would befall the city should its inhabitants prove disloyal to
                God and His law. If the admonitions to obey the Lord God of
                their fathers and to hallow His Sabbath day were not heeded,
                the city and its palaces would be utterly destroyed by fire."
                —Prophets and Kings, pp. 411, 412.
                   Jeremiah's contemporary, Ezekiel, a captive in Babylon
                when Jeremiah wrote this, said that one of the chief offenses
                God held against Israel after their deliverance from Egypt was
                that Israel "despised my judgments, and walked not in my
                statutes, but polluted my sabbaths." Ezek. 20:16.
                   "Every nation upon the earth was watching the people for
                whom God had done so much. If they had followed him, he
                would have exalted them, and made them a praise in the earth.
                They would have been regarded as a nation that did righteous-
                ness, and forsook not the ordinances of their God."—Ellen G.

         Part 6       How did the Jews at large regard the will of God as ex-
                   pressed in His law in contrast to Jeremiah's attitude toward it?
  GOD'S PEOPLE
     REJECTED
     THE WORD         "To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may
                   hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot
                   hearken: behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach;
                   they have no delight in it." Jer. 6:10.


                       Compare Jer. 7:26; 16:12; 19:15.
                        "Jeremiah appears to be overcome with a sense of the futility
                   of his mission. Because of the obstinacy of the people all his
                   preaching seemed vain."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 6:10.
                        "But Jeremiah protests. To whom could he speak, or give
                   warning? The people were so far gone in the induration of their
                   wills and hearts that they could no longer heed the word even
                   if it were spoken. Just as they were uncircumcised of heart
                   (4:4), so also were they uncircumcised of ear....
                        "This callousness and indifference on the part of the people,
                   not to say their scorn, was undoubtedly disconcertingly frustrat-
                   ing to a young man of Jeremiah's sensibilities and prophetic
                   temper."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 5, pp. 859, 860.


                      As God through Jeremiah showed them His will, what was
                   the reaction on the part of God's people? Jer. 6:16.


                      Righteous indignation welled up within Jeremiah. "Zeal for
                   God's cause was figuratively consuming the prophet."—SDA
                   Bible Commentary, on Jer. 6:11.


THINK IT THROUGH      What is my attitude if someone points out my shortcom-
                   ings or divergence from God's will?

                      "It is true there is an indignation that is justifiable, even in
                   the followers of Christ. When they see that God is dishonored,
                   and His service brought into disrepute, when they see the in-
                   nocent oppressed, a righteous indignation stirs the soul. Such
                   anger, born of sensitive morals, is not a sin. But those who at
                   any supposed provocation feel at liberty to indulge anger or
                   resentment are opening the heart to Satan. Bitterness and ani-
                   mosity must be banished from the soul if we would be in har-
                   mony with heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 310.

                                         Jeremiah these two loyalties clashed,
                                         because neither the kings—after
                                         Josiah's death—nor the people were
                                         inclined to heed the will of God.
                                             Jeremiah was a servant of God and
                                         a citizen of the kingdom of Judah.
                                         Thus he had a dual citizenship: his
                                         first and primary citizenship was in
                                         heaven and his second on earth. But
                                         he resided on earth.

Jeremiah, a Traitor? LESSON 7                                          ❑ Sunday
                                                                      November 9

         Part 1      What fate did Jeremiah predict for Jerusalem and the
     JUDAH AND    temple because of Judah's unrepentant sinfulness?
        SHILOH       "Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make
                  this city a curse to all the nations of the earth." Jer. 26:6.

                     This prediction was part of Jeremiah's Temple Sermon in
                  chapters 7 to 10, which is briefly summarized in chapter 26.
                  The prediction amounted to a prophecy of defeat and destruc-
                  tion of Judah before her enemies.
                     "They [the people of Jerusalem] understood this reference
                  to Shiloh and the time when the Philistines overcame Israel and
                  the ark of God was taken....
                     "The sons of Eli were slain, Eli himself lost his life, the ark
                  of God was taken from Israel, and thirty thousand of the people
                  were slain. All this was because sin was lightly regarded and
                  allowed to remain among them."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 166.
                  See 1 Sam. 4:10-22.

                     What was the reaction of the people, the priests, and the
                  prophets to Jeremiah's speech? Jer. 26: 8, 11.
                      "When the priests and the people heard the message that -
                  Jeremiah delivered to them in the name of the Lord, they were
                  very angry and declared that he should die. They were bois-
                  terous in their denunciations of him, crying: 'Why hast thou
                  prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall
                  be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an in-
                  habitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah
                  in the house of the Lord.' Thus was the message of God de-
                  spised and the servant with whom He entrusted it threatened
                  with death. The priests, the unfaithful prophets, and all the
                  people turned in wrath upon him who would not speak to them
                  smooth things and prophesy deceit."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p.
                  167.

                     Who intervened and saved Jeremiah on this occasion?
                  Jer. 26:16.
                     "God's chosen servants should meet with courage and pa-
                  tience the trials and sufferings that befall them through re-
                  proach, neglect, and misrepresentation. They should continue
                  to discharge faithfully the work God has given them to do, ever
                  remembering that the prophets of old and the Saviour of man-
                  kind and His apostles also endured abuse and persecution for
                  the Word's sake."—Prophets and Kings, p. 437.

Jeremiah, a Traitor? LESSON 7                                              Monday
                                                                     November 10

        Part 2   For what did Jeremiah at the command of God reprove the
 PLOT AGAINST people of Judah? Jer. 11:1-4, 8.
     JEREMIAH   "Wherever he ministered he met the people with the earnest
                   plea, 'Hear ye the words of this covenant,' words which would
                   bring them a full understanding of God's purpose to extend to
                   all nations a knowledge of saving truth."—Prophets and Kings,
                   p. 466.

                      What did God apparently reveal to Jeremiah? Jer. 11:18,
                   19, 21.
                      "Anathoth had been assigned to the priests (Joshua 21:18)
                   and was the home of Jeremiah (Jer. 1:1). The 'men of Anathoth'
                   were therefore priests; even more, they were close relatives of
                   Jeremiah (see ch. 12:6). It had been difficult for Jeremiah to
                   realize the depth of Judah's apostasy (ch. 11:9-11 . . .). Now,
                   God warns Jeremiah of the secret plot on his life (ch. 11:18,
                   19, 21), and as the prophet learns of their conspiracy against
                   him personally he begins to understand their attitude toward
                   God (v. 20; see chs. 12:1; 17:18)."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                   on Jer. 11:21.
                      Why did the people of Anathoth want to kill Jeremiah?
                      "Therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth, that
                   seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord,
                   that thou die not by our hand." Jer. 11:21.

                      Jeremiah had accepted God's commission and was a true
                   spokesman for Him regardless of consequences. He was a true
                   prophet, and prophets are a strange brand of people. They do
                   not hesitate to do the will of God or proclaim His purpose
                   because of possibly disastrous consequences. They are con-
                   scious of a job to be done for God, and they do it, leaving the
                   consequences with God.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what way do you see Jeremiah as a prototype of God's
                   people in the last days?

                      "Conscientious obedience to the word of God will be treated
                   as rebellion. Blinded by Satan, the parent will exercise harsh-
                   ness and severity toward the believing child; the master or
                   mistress will oppress the commandment-keeping servant. Af-
                   fection will be alienated; children will be disinherited and driven
                   from home."—The Great Controversy, p. 608.

Jeremiah, a Traitor? LESSON 7                                         ❑ Tuesday
                                                                    November 11

        Part 3      In chapter 19, under the symbol of a broken earthen vessel,
     JEREMIAH    Jeremiah foretold the total destruction of Judah due to her sins.
       BEATEN       How did Pashur, the priest, express his hatred of Jeremiah
                 on account of his message?

                    "Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in
                 the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was
                 by the house of the Lord." Jer. 20:2.
                    "The prophet's words, instead of leading to confession and
                 repentance, aroused the anger of those high in authority, and
                 as a consequence Jeremiah was deprived of his liberty. Impris-
                 oned, and placed in the stocks, the prophet nevertheless con-
                 tinued to speak the messages of Heaven to those who stood by.
                 His voice could not be silenced by persecution."—Prophets
                 and Kings, p. 432.

                    Not being intimidated by Pashur's cruel treatment, how did
                 Jeremiah reiterate his doleful message to him privately? Jer.
                 20:3-6.

                     The average individual in Jeremiah's position might have
                  deemed himself fortunate to escape the stocks and further beat-
                 ing. But Jeremiah was not primarily concerned to save his skin.
                 His first concern was to deliver God's warning message that the
                 people of Judah—in this particular case, the priest Pashur—
                 might repent and turn away from their perverse ways. Thus they
                 would spare themselves and their country from the awful calam-
                 ity Jeremiah envisioned as a result of continued sinful obsti-
                 nacy.
                     "The spirit of opposition to reproof, that led to the persecu-
                 tion and imprisonment of Jeremiah, exists today. Many refuse
                 to heed repeated warnings, preferring rather to listen to false
                 teachers who flatter their vanity and overlook their evil-doing.
                 In the day of trouble such will have no sure refuge, no help from
                 heaven."—Prophets and Kings, p. 437.
                     "The fearful and unbelieving, who are punished with the
                 second death, are of that class who are ashamed of Christ in
                 this world. They are afraid to do right and follow Christ, lest
                 they should meet with pecuniary loss. They neglect their duty,
                 to avoid reproach and trials, and to escape dangers. Those who
                 dare not do right because they will thus expose themselves
                 to trials, persecution, loss, and suffering are cowards, and, with
                 idolaters, liars, and all sinners, they are ripening for the second
                 death."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 630.

Jeremiah, a Traitor? LESSON 7                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                 November 12

         Part 4      While the Babylonians were besieging Jerusalem, "the Egyp-
                  tians endeavored to come to the rescue of the beleagured city;
     JEREMIAH     and the Chaldeans, in order to keep them back, abandoned for
   IMPRISONED     a time their siege of the Judean capital."—Prophets and Kings,
                  p. 452.
                      During this temporary withdrawal of the Babylonian army
                  from Jerusalem, what did Jeremiah plan to do? Jer. 37:11, 12.
                      "For many years Jeremiah had stood before the people as a
                  faithful witness for God; and now, as the fated city was about
                  to pass into the hands of the heathen, he considered his work
                  done and attempted to leave, but was prevented by a son of
                  one of the false prophets."—Prophets and Kings, p. 453.
                     Of what was Jeremiah accused and with what result? Jer.
                  37:13-15.
                     The son of the false prophet "reported that Jeremiah was
                  about to join the Babylonians, to whom he had repeatedly
                  urged the men of Judah to submit. The prophet denied the
                  lying charge, but nevertheless 'the princes were wroth with
                  Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison.' "—Prophets
                  and Kings, pages 453, 454.
                     Why did King Zedekiah keep Jeremiah in prison?
                     "For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying,
                  Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord,
                  Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Baby-
                  lon, and he shall take it; and Zedekiah king of Judah shall
                  not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely
                  be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall
                  speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold
                  his eyes; and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there
                  shall he be until I visit him, saith the Lord: though ye fight
                  with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper." Jer. 32:3-5.
                     In trying to defend Jerusalem against the attacking Baby-
                  lonians, Zedekiah, from a strictly human viewpoint, did not
                  want a prophet at large inside its walls proclaiming daily the
                  futility of the city's defense against the attackers.
                     During the battle of Britain during World War II the British
                  likewise isolated individuals who did not have faith in its suc-
                  cessful defense.
                     Ellen White has counseled the church that "we should not
                  work in a manner that will mark us out as seeming to advocate
                  treason."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 394. And yet the time will
                  come when "those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be de-
                  nounced as enemies of law and order . .. causing anarchy and
                  corruption."—The Great Controversy, page 592.

Jeremiah, a Traitor? LESSON 7                                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                        November 13

        Part 5        After Jeremiah had announced God's judgment on Judah,
  READY TO DIE     and thereby aroused the animosity of the people toward him,
                   what was his attitude?

                       "As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as
                   seemeth good and meet unto you. But know ye for certain,
                   that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood
                   upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants
                   thereof: for of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto you to speak
                   all these words in your ears." Jer. 26:14, 15.
                       Jeremiah was not what we usually call diplomatic in his
                   pronouncements. His message was clear and direct. All his
                   listeners understood it. Hence their hatred of him and their
                   determination to put him to death. Verse 8.

                      Although prepared for his fate, what was Jeremiah's warn-
                   ing to the people? Verse 15.

                       "Had the prophet been intimidated by the threatening atti-
                   tude of those high in authority, his message would have been
                   without effect, and he would have lost his life; but the courage
                   with which he delivered the solemn warning commanded the
                   respect of the people and turned the princes of Israel in his
                   favor. They reasoned with the priests and false prophets, show-
                   ing them how unwise would be the extreme measures they
                   advocated, and their words produced a reaction in the minds
                   of the people. Thus God raised up defenders for His servant."
                   —Prophets and Kings, p. 418.

                      Who interceded for Jeremiah's life? Verse 16; cf. verse 24.

                      "The elders also united in protesting against the decision
                   of the priests regarding the fate of Jeremiah. They cited the
                   case of Micah, who had prophesied judgments upon Jerusalem,
                   saying, 'Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall
                   become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high
                   places of a forest.' "—Prophets and Kings, p. 418.

THINK IT THROUGH       What am I personally doing today to develop a fortitude
                   like Jeremiah's that will enable me to stand staunchly for God
                   even in the face of threatened death for my loyalty to Him?
                       "It is better to die than to sin; better to want than to defraud;
                   better to hunger than to lie."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 495.
                       "Those who would rather die than perform a wrong act are
                   the only ones who will be found faithful."—Testimonies, vol. 5,

Jeremiah, a Traitor? LESSON 7                                             ❑ Friday
                                                                        November 14

        Part 6        Why did Jeremiah advise his king and countrymen to sur-
 LOYAL TO GOD      render to the Babylonians?

                      "For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chal-
                   deans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded
                   men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his
                   tent, and burn this city with fire." Jer. 37:10.

                     To Jeremiah God had unveiled some of His omniscience.
                   Jeremiah knew the futility of trying to resist the Babylonians;
                   God had given to them both Judah and the surrounding nations.

                     In view of this divinely granted insight, what was his
                   advice to both king and countrymen? Jer. 21:8, 9; 38:2, 17.

                       "Here was exhibited the long-suffering mercy of God. Even
                   at that late hour, if there were submission to His requirements,
                   the lives of the people would be spared and the city saved from
                   conflagration. But the king thought he had gone too far to re-
                   tract. He was afraid of the Jews, afraid of becoming a subject
                   of ridicule, afraid for his life. It was too humiliating, at that late
                   day, to say to the people: 'I accept the word of the Lord as
                   spoken through His prophet Jeremiah. I dare not venture to
                   war against the enemy in the face of all these warnings.'
                       "With tears Jeremiah entreated the king to save himself and
                   his people. With anguish of spirit he assured him that he could
                   not escape with his life, and that all his possessions would fall
                   to the king of Babylon. He could save the city if he would."
                   —Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 183.
                      Jeremiah was not a traitor, since he openly advised both
                   king and people to surrender rather than continue the unequal
                   struggle, but without a doubt he did weaken "the hands of the
                   men of war that remain in this city [Jerusalem], and the hands
                   of all the people, in speaking such words unto them." Jer. 38:4.


THINK IT THROUGH      How will I relate myself to God's entrusted message if its
                   proclamation will entail suffering?

                      "There will come a time when, because of our advocacy of
                   Bible truth, we shall be treated as traitors; but let not this time
                   be hastened by unadvised movements that stir up animosity
                   and strife."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 394.

                      God, through Jeremiah. wanted to point out to His people
                   that the usefulness of their political wisdom and human fore-
                   sight were coming to an end. Their own military prowess would
                   collapse, and in vain would they hope for help from Egypt. Their
                   wealth of gold, silver, and brass accumulated in the temple
                   would turn into liabilities, attracting the greedy Babylonians
                   rather than being assets to be used for the purposes for which
                   they were accumulated.
                      Name one particular person in the Bible who did glory in
                   his wisdom, wealth, and power as displayed in his capital
                   and kingdom. Dan. 4:29, 30.
                      "It is not surprising that the successful monarch [Nebuchad-
                   nezzar], so ambitious and so proud-spirited, should be tempted
                   to turn aside from the path of humility, which alone leads to
                   true greatness. In the intervals between his wars of conquest he
                   gave much thought to the strengthening and beautifying of his
                   capital, until at length the city of Babylon became the chief
                   glory of his kingdom, 'the golden city,' the praise of the whole
                   earth.' His passion as a builder, and his signal success in mak-
                   ing Babylon one of the wonders of the world, ministered to his
                   pride, until he was in grave danger of spoiling his record as
                   a wise ruler whom God could continue to use as an instru-
                   ment, for the carrying out of the divine purpose."—Prophets
                   and Kings, p. 515.

THINK IT THROUGH      On what do I as a person usually base my confidence and
                   security, or in what do I glory?
                       "We need to shun everything that would encourage pride
                   and self-sufficiency; therefore we should beware of giving or
                   receiving flattery or praise. It is Satan's work to flatter. He deals
                   in flattery as well as in accusing and condemnation. Thus he
                   seeks to work the ruin of the soul. Those who give praise to
                   men are used by Satan as his agents. Let the workers for Christ
                   direct every word of praise away from themselves. Let self be
                   put out of sight. Christ alone is to be exalted. 'Unto Him that
                   loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood,' let
                   every eye be directed, and praise from every heart ascend."—

                   in these things I delight, saith the Lord." Jer. 9:24.

                      Ellen G. White comments thus on this verse: "Scarcely can
                   the human mind comprehend the breadth and depth and height
                   of the spiritual attainments of him who gains this knowledge."—
                   The Acts of the Apostles, p. 531.
                       The knowledge referred to here Ellen G. White calls experi-
                   mental knowledge. It consists of a personal experience with
                   God rather than in theories or abstractions. Such is the knowl-
                   edge only of the person who has tried the Lord and learned that
                   He is good. Such knowledge God values. "The value of man is
                   estimated in heaven according to the capacity of the heart to
                   know God."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 354, 355.
                       "So we have nothing in ourselves of which to boast. We
                   have no ground for self-exaltation. Our only ground of hope is
                   in the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought
                   by His Spirit working in and through us."—Steps to Christ,

                     How does the apostle Paul reiterate Jeremiah's inspired
                   counsel? 1 Cor. 1:31; 2 Cor. 10:17; Gal. 6:14.
                        "Paul realized that his sufficiency was not in himself, but
                   in the presence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious influence
                   filled his heart, bringing every thought into subjection to Christ.
                   He spoke of himself as 'always bearing about in the body the
                   dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be
                   made manifest in our body.' 2 Corinthians 4:10. In the apostle's
                   teachings Christ was the central figure."—The Acts of the

                   in my experience?
                      "Are you in Christ? Not if you do not acknowledge yourselves
                   erring, helpless, condemned sinners. Not if you are exalting and
                   glorifying self. If there is any good in you, it is wholly attribu-

         Part 3      How did Jeremiah express his inability even to order his
     GOD'S WAY     own life in a way prudent and pleasing to God?

                      "0 Lord, I know that the way of man is net in himself: it
                   is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." Jer. 10:23.
                     Growth in Christian experience is a growth in maturity. A
                   committed Christian is willing to ask God for direction and
                   submit to His leading rather than insist on his own way.
                       How was this growth to be illustrated in the experience
                   of the apostle Peter, according to the words of Jesus? John
                   21:18, 19.
                      "Jesus thus made known to Peter the very manner of his
                   death; He even foretold the stretching forth of his hands upon
                   the cross. Again He bade His disciple, 'Follow Me.' Peter was
                   not disheartened by the revelation. He felt willing to suffer any
                   death for his Lord....
                      "To Peter the words 'Follow Me' were full of instruction.
                   Not only for his death, but for every step of his life, was the
                   lesson given. Hitherto Peter had been inclined to act independ-
                   ently. He had tried to plan for the work of God, instead of
                   waiting to follow out God's plan. But he could gain nothing by
                   rushing on before the Lord. Jesus bids him, 'Follow Me.' Do not
                   run ahead of Me. Then you will not have the hosts of Satan to
                   meet alone. Let Me go before you, and you will not be over-
                   come by the enemy."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 815, 816.
                      How had Isaiah expressed the same thought as Jeremiah?
                   Isa. 55:8, 9.
THINK IT THROUGH      To what extent have I in my experience acknowledged
                   that I am unable to order the course of my life in a way
                   acceptable and pleasing to God? Have I been willing to ac-
                   cept His guidance?
                       "Christ in His life on earth made no plans for Himself. He
                   accepted God's plans for Him, and day by day the Father un-
                   folded His plans. So should we depend upon God, that our
                   lives may be the simple outworking of His will. As we commit
                   our ways to Him, He will direct our steps.
                       "Too many, in planning for a brilliant future, make an utter
                   failure. Let God plan for you. As a little child, trust to the
                   guidance of Him who will 'keep the feet of His saints.' 1 Samuel
                   2:9. God never leads His children otherwise than they would
                   choose to be led, if they could see the end from the beginning

        Part 4        "1 the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
                   every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit
 THE SEARCHER
                   of his doings." Jer. 17:10.
    OF HEARTS
                      Jeremiah here points up God's mysterious penetration into
                   the hidden secrets and motives of man. God knows our inmost
                   selves.
                      How does Jeremiah describe man's heart? Jer. 17:9.
                       Among the ancient Hebrews the heart was looked upon as
                   the seat of mental activity, as is the brain in modern times. The
                   seat of emotion on the other hand was to them the reins [kid-
                   neys], or the bowels. As the New Testament was also written
                   by Hebrews, the New Testament writers carry this Hebrew
                   idiom even into their Greek writings. The only exceptions to
                   this are the apostles Paul and Peter in Romans 12:2 and 2 Peter
                   3:1, where they speak of the mind rather than the heart as the
                   seat of mental activity.
                        "When Jesus speaks of the new heart, He means the mind,
                   the life, the whole being. To have a change of heart is to with-
                   draw the affections from the world, and fasten them upon
                   Christ. To have a new heart is to have a new mind, new pur-
                    poses, new motives. What is the sign of a new heart?—A
                    changed life. There is a daily, hourly dying to selfishness and
                    pride."—Messages to Young People, p. 72.
                        "There is a record also of the sins of men. 'For God shall
                    bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether
                    it be good, or whether it be evil.' Every idle word that men
                    shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judg-
                    ment.' Says the Saviour: `By thy words thou shalt be justified,
                    and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Ecclesiastes 12:14;
                    Matthew 12:36, 37. The secret purposes and motives appear in
                    the unerring register; for God 'will bring to light the hidden
                     things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the
                    hearts.' 1 Corinthians 4:5."—The Great Controversy, p. 481.

THINK IT THROUGH     God searches our hearts. As we search our own hearts,
                   what do we find in them?
                       "No man can of himself understand his errors. 'The heart
                    is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can
                    know it?' Jer. 17:9. The lips may express a poverty of soul that
                    the heart does not acknowledge. While speaking to God of
                    poverty of spirit, the heart may be swelling with the conceit of
                    its own superior humility and exalted righteousness. In one
                    way only can a true knowledge of self be obtained. We must
                    behold Christ."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 159.

     BLESSED MAN       "As a wise master builder, Jeremiah at the very beginning
                    of his lifework sought to encourage the men of Judah to lay
                    the foundations of their spiritual life broad and deep, by making
                    thorough work of repentance. Long had they been building with
                    material likened by the apostle Paul to wood, hay, and stubble,
                    and by Jeremiah himself to dross. 'Refuse silver shall men call
                    them,' he declared of the impenitent nation, 'because the Lord
                    hath rejected them.' Jeremiah 6:30, margin. Now they were
                    urged to begin building wisely and for eternity, casting aside
                    the rubbish of apostasy and unbelief, and using as foundation
                    material the pure gold, the refined silver, the precious stones
                    —faith and obedience and good works—which alone are ac-
                    ceptable in the sight of a holy God."—Prophets and Kings,
                    pp. 409, 410.

                       Whose ideas were the majority of the Jews still following
                    rather than trusting God and submitting to His guidance and
                    direction for both personal and political life? Jer. 11:8.

                        The Jews were God's covenant people. They belonged to
                    God in a special and different way than the surrounding na-
                    tions. They had pledged God their obedience. But they thought
                    they could enjoy the privileges of the covenant apart from their
                    compliance with their promises. They foolishly claimed the
                    fulfillment of God's promises irrespective of their conduct. At
                    times they would fall into the insidious error of regarding ex-
                    ternal obedience to the law, irrespective of the inner disposi-
                    tion of the heart, as a satisfactory response to God's will. But
                    often they went beyond that and openly rebelled against God
                    by walking after "the imagination of their evil heart."

                      To what is the person likened who has put his trust in
                    God? Jer. 17:7, 8. See also Ps. 1:1-3.

                       The person who trusts God may enjoy constant peace of
                    mind. Naturally, as human beings limited in knowledge, we

                    ask us primarily to understand; He asks us to trust Him. As we
                    trust God, we may grow in grace and bear fruit "as a tree
                    planted by the waters." The Jews in Jeremiah's day, by not
                    trusting God, suffered the reverse of this experience.

        Part 6        "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith
      GOD CAN      the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
                   expected end." Jer. 29:11.
     BE FOUND
                      God desires to do us good. Even in this life He likes to lead
                   us beside still waters and let us rest on green meadows, as far
                   as this will contribute to our eternal welfare.
                      If we wholeheartedly have committed our lives to God and
                   vowed in our inmost souls that our desire is to be found in the
                   place of His choice for us, He will direct us in such a way that
                   we shall reach our ultimate goal of a home in His kingdom.
                      Ellen G. White wrote of an experience of Abraham:
                      "The Lord in His providence had brought this trial [famine]
                   upon Abraham to teach him- lessons of submission, patience,
                   and faith—lessons that were to be placed on record for the
                   benefit of all who should afterward be called to endure afflic-
                   tion."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 129.
                      How did Jeremiah express his willingness to be corrected
                   by God? Jer. 10:24.
                      There is hope for any one of us when we are willing to be
                   corrected. This attitude expresses humility and teachableness.

THINK IT THROUGH      When trials assail a believer, what is the evidence that he
                   believes God's choice is the best for him?
                       Ellen White wrote to a brother enduring trials:
                       "You know the history of Joseph and of Daniel. The Lord
                   did not prevent the plottings of wicked men; but He caused
                   their devices to work for good to those who, amidst trial and
                   conflict, preserved their faith and loyalty.
                       "The furnace fires are not to destroy, but to refine, ennoble,
                   sanctify. Without trial we should not feel so much our need of
                   God and His help; and we should become proud and self-suffi-
                   cient. In the trials that come to you I see evidence that the
                   Lord's eye is upon you and that He means to draw you to
                   Himself....
                       "Jesus loves you, and I am made glad as I read of the ex-
                   perience through which you are passing, not because you are
                   a sufferer, but because this is an evidence to me that the Lord
                   Jesus is testing and proving you, to see if you will come to Him,
                    to see if you will put your trust in Him and find peace and rest
                   in His love. I am praying for you, that you may come to Him,
                    the Fountain of living water. This is the experience that every
                    one of us must have if we ever dwell with Christ in the man-
                    sions that He has gone to prepare for us."—Testimonies, vol.

        Part 1      "Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with
     BABYLON,    thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I
                 destroy kingdoms." Jer. 51:20.
A "BATTLE AXE"
                     Read also Jer. 51:21-23; 50:23.
                    By divine inspiration Jeremiah calls Babylon a "battle axe"
                 or a "hammer" (RSV). God used this hammer for the accom-
                 plishments of His purposes. About one hundred years earlier
                 the prophet Isaiah had spoken of Assyria as "the rod of mine
                 anger" (Isa. 10:5), "used by God for a season as the rod of His
                 anger for the punishment of the nations."—Prophets and Kings,
                 p. 349.

                   To what does Inspiration liken Babylon's greatest ruler,
                 Nebuchadnezzar? Dan. 4:20-22.
                    "To Nebuchadnezzar the king the true object of national
                 government was represented under the figure of a great tree,
                 whose height 'reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to
                 the end of all the earth: the leaves thereof were fair, and the
                 fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all;' under its shadow
                 the beasts of the field dwelt, and among its branches the birds
                 of the air had their habitation. Daniel 4:11, 12. This representa-
                 tion shows the character of a government that fulfills God's
                 purpose—a government that protects and upbuilds the nation."

                     "An idolater by birth and training, and at the head of an
                 idolatrous people, he [Nebuchadnezzar] had nevertheless an
                 innate sense of justice and right, and God was able to use him
                 as an instrument for the punishment of the rebellious and for
                 the fulfillment of the divine purpose."—Prophets and Kings,

        Part 2        By what term does God, through the prophet Jeremiah,
   NEBUC HAD-      refer to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon?
    NEZZAR AS
                      "And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
GOD'S SERVANT      Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the
                   beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him." Jer.
                   27:6.

                      God gives opportunities to men to do work for Him. Nebu-
                   chadnezzar, like Cyrus (see Isa. 44:28 to 45:4), was a ruler
                   whom God used and hence called him His servant here and
                   also in Jeremiah 25:9.

                      What had God given into the hands of Babylon, or to
                   Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled Babylon at its height of power?
                   Jer. 27:3-6.

                      "Ambassadors came from the various nations named to con-
                   sult with the king of Judah as to the matter of engaging in
                   battle with the king of Babylon. But the prophet of God, bear-
                   ing the symbols of subjection, delivered the message of the
                   Lord to these nations, commanding them to bear it to their
                   several kings."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 169.

                      Besides these heathen nations surrounding Judah, which
                   nation had God also given to Nebuchadnezzar? Jer. 25:8, 9.

                      "The history of nations speaks to us today. To every nation
                   and to every individual God has assigned a place in His great
                   plan. Today men and nations are being tested by the plummet
                   in the hand of Him who makes no mistake. All are by their
                   own choice deciding their destiny, and God is overruling all
                   for the accomplishment of His purposes."—Prophets and Kings,
                   p. 536.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what respect did Nebuchadnezzar fulfill God's plan for
                   him, and in which respect did he not?

                      "The terms 'My servant,' Israel,"the Lord's servant,' mean
                   anyone that the Lord may select and appoint to do a certain
                   work. He makes them ministers of His will, though some who
                   are selected may be as ignorant of His will as was Nebuchad-
                   nezzar."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 138.

         Part 3      Several times God spoke to Nebuchadnezzar, and on each
     NEBUCHAD-    occasion he acknowledged God as the Supreme Ruler. "Such
                  had been the case after his dream of the great image. His mind
      NEZZAR'S    had been profoundly influenced by this vision. . . .
       FAILURE       "Nebuchadnezzar's noble conception of God's purpose con-
                  cerning the nations was lost sight of later in his experience;
                  yet when his proud spirit was humbled before the multitude on
                  the plain of Dura, he once more had acknowledged that God's
                  kingdom is 'an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion is from
                  generation to generation.' "—Prophets and Kings, p. 514.

                     When Nebuchadnezzar again lost his humility before God,
                  under what figure did God speak to the proud king and pre-
                  sent the true rule of national government? Dan. 4:10-12.
                      "In mercy God gave the king another dream, to warn him of
                  his peril and of the snare that had been laid for his ruin. In a
                  vision of the night, Nebuchadnezzar saw a great tree growing
                  in the midst of the earth, its top towering to the heavens and
                  its branches stretching to the ends of the earth."—Prophets and
                  Kings, p. 515.
                      Under this image God wanted to impress upon Nebuchad-
                  nezzar the fact that he was not the ultimate source of his power,
                  riches, and glory. As the tree he saw depended on favorable
                  soil, sunshine, and moisture for its growth, so Nebuchadnezzar
                  was to recognize that God was the ultimate Giver of all his
                  possessions.

                     How did Nebuchadnezzar fail to recognize God as his
                  wisdom, strength, and the Giver of his power? Dan. 4:30.

                      "Instead of being a protector of men, Babylon became a
                  proud and cruel oppressor."—Education, p. 176.
                      Through the adversity of sickness Nebuchadnezzar had a
                   change of mind. "The once proud monarch had become a
                  humble child of God; the tyrannical, overbearing ruler, a wise
                  and compassionate king. He who had defied and blasphemed
                  the God of heaven, now acknowledged the power of the Most
                  High and earnestly sought to promote the fear of Jehovah and
                  the happiness of his subjects. Under the rebuke of Him who
                  is King of kings and Lord of lords, Nebuchadnezzar had learned
                  at last the lesson which all rulers need to learn—that true great-
                  ness consists in true goodness. He acknowledged Jehovah as
                  the living God, saying, 'I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and
                  honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and His
                  ways judgment: and those that walk in pride He is able to
                  abase.' "—Prophets and Kings, p. 521.

                of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency." Isa.
  BABYLON TO    13:19. In Nebuchadnezzar's dream (Daniel 2) it had been aptly
   DISAPPEAR    symbolized by the head of gold of the metal image.

                   According to Jeremiah, how completely was Babylon to
                disappear from among the nations of the earth?

                   "And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading
                this book, that thou shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into
                the midst of Euphrates: and thou shalt say, Thus shall Baby-
                lon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon
                her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jere-
                miah." Jer. 51:63, 64.

                   The kingdom of Babylon was not merely to be conquered by
                another nation and deprived of its political dominance, but it
                was to disappear from the face of the earth. Jeremiah illus-
                trated Babylon's disappearance by instructing Seriah to tie a
                stone to a book containing the woes against Babylon and to
                throw it into the Euphrates River. There it would sink as Baby-
                lon would also "sink to rise no more."

                  Why was this fate to befall a nation and a city on which
                God had initially bestowed His favors? Jer. 50:24, 29.

                   Although Babylon defeated Judah and the surrounding na-
                tions in accordance with God's will, it did so not from love of
                God and His will, but from motives of self-aggrandizement.

                   For what acts in particular would Babylon be requited?
                Jer. 51:24.

                    "Every nation that has come upon the stage of action has
                been permitted to occupy its place on the earth, that the fact
                might be determined whether it would fulfill the purposes of
                the Watcher and the Holy One. Prophecy has traced the rise
                and progress of the world's great empires—Babylon, Medo-
                Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each of these, as with the
                nations of less power, history has repeated itself. Each has had
                its period of test; each has failed, its glory faded, its power
                departed."—Prophets and Kings, p. 535.
                    "Any injustice done to saint or sinner will then [in the judg-
                ment] be rewarded accordingly. Christ identifies His interest in
                all the afflictions of His people."—Welfare Ministry, p. 219.

                     With what was historical Babylon filled?
                     "A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up:
                  for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon
                  their idols." Jer. 50:38.
                     Religious superstitions and idol worship flourished in his-
                  torical Babylon. "In the book of Revelation the great Antichris-
                  tian power is described under the figure of ancient Babylon
                  (see Rev. 17; 18)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 51:6.
                     Of the development of mystical Babylon Ellen G. White
                  wrote: "The darkness seemed to grow more dense. Image wor-
                  ship became more general. Candles were burned before images,
                  and prayers were offered to them. The most absurd and su-
                  perstitious customs prevailed. The minds of men were so
                  completely controlled by superstition that reason itself seemed
                  to have lost its sway."—The Great Controversy, p. 57.

                    When the call of deliverance came to the Jews in Babylon,
                  what were they to do? Jer. 51:6; 50:8; cf. Rev. 18:4.

                     Why were God's people anciently to leave Babylon, and
                  why are God's people today to leave spiritual Babylon? Jer.
                  51:6, 7; Rev. 18:3, 4.

                      "As God's people formerly came out of literal Babylon in
                  order that they might return to Jerusalem, so His people today
                  are called out of mystical Babylon in order that they may be
                  accounted worthy to enter the New Jerusalem. Presumably, all

                  genuine sacrifices for it. Their homes, their business, their

        Part 6        "We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed:
  GOD DESIRED      forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for
                   her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to
      TO SAVE      the skies." Jer. 51:9.
     BABYLON
                       Babylon had been prospered by God under Nebuchadnezzar.
                   Its demise and destruction was not God's plan, any more than
                   was Israel's and Judah's political and national disintegration.
                   It was its failure to capitalize on its opportunity to do God's
                   work. He gave Babylon its chance. This failure precipitated its
                   fall before Medo-Persia.
                       God through Jeremiah says, "We would have healed Baby-
                   lon." This admission is comparable to the sorrowful pronounce-
                   ment of Jesus when He said, "0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, ... how
                   often would I have gathered thy children together, . . and ye
                   would not!" Matt. 23:37. God would like—He is yearning—to
                   save both men and nations, but He is limited by men's choice
                   or by your choice and mine.
                       "The crown removed from Israel passed successively to the
                   kingdoms of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. God
                   says, 'It shall be no more, until He come whose right it is; and
                   I will give it Him.' "—Education, p. 179.


                      What impression might you gain from reading about the
                   apparent inevitability of Babylon's destruction in such proph-
                   ecies as Isaiah 13:19?


                       God manipulates neither individuals nor nations. "The
                   prophecies do not shape the characters of the men who fulfill
                   them. Men act out their own free will."—Ellen G. White, Review
                   and Herald, Nov. 13, 1900. A person does this individually, a
                   nation does it collectively.
                       "God does not force the will or judgment of any. He takes
                   no pleasure in a slavish obedience. He desires that the crea-
                   tures of His hands shall love Him because He is worthy of
                   love. He would have them obey Him because they have an in-
                   telligent appreciation of His wisdom, justice, and benevolence."

                   mystical Babylon of history and prophecy?

     INEVITABLE    saved." Jer. 8:20.
          DOOM         In this verse Jeremiah expressed his bitter lament over the
                   failure and doom of his people. "In Palestine the grain harvest
                   begins about April. The fruit harvest comes about August or
                   September. When the grain crops failed, there was still the
                   hope there would be a yield of grapes, figs, olives, etc. For
                   Judah, however, the fruit-gathering season—the last oppor-
                   tunity—had passed, and there was no deliverance. Her doom
                   was now inevitable."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 8:20.
                   It is because he is completely identified with his people that
                   the prophet is heartsick and his grief is so complete.

                      What rhetorical question does Jeremiah ask to emphasize
                   the hopelessness of his people? Verse 22.

                       "He saw that sin is a cancer, a malignant disease which
                   goes down to the very nooks of our being. He saw that there
                   is no physician this side of God who can do anything for it. Did
                   you ever feel the pathos of his piercing question—`Is there no
                   balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?' Gilead was a
                   region which lay on the prophet's eastern horizon. It was over
                   Gilead that the sun rose every morning to illuminate little Ana-
                   thoth and big Jerusalem. It was the land which symbolized
                   hope. In Gilead grew herbs and trees and flowers from which
                   balsams were made to supply the physicians of that Eastern
                   world. Is there no balm even in Gilead? Is there no physician,
                   no prophet, no priest, no healer, no teacher who can cure a sick
                   heart? And the answer is `No.' There is no remedy on earth
                   for a heart which is desperately sick."—Charles E. Jefferson,
                   Cardinal Ideas of Jeremiah (New York: The Macmillan Co.,
                   1928), p. 141.
                      "Come, my brother, come just as you are, sinful and polluted.
                   Lay your burden of guilt on Jesus, and by faith claim His
                   merits. Come now, while mercy lingers; come with confession,
                   come with contrition of soul, and God will abundantly pardon.
                   Do not dare to slight another opportunity. Listen to the voice
                   of mercy that now pleads with you to arise from the dead that
                   Christ may give you light. Every moment now seems to connect
                   itself directly with the destinies of the unseen world. Then let
                   not your pride and unbelief lead you to still further reject of-
                   fered mercy. If you do you will be left to lament at the last: 'The

                                                                     December I


        Part 2        "My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my
   ANGUISH AT      heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because
     REVEALED      thou host heard, 0 my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the
  DESTRUCTION      alarm of war." Jer. 4:19.
                      Before the overthrow of Judah by the Babylonian armies
                   occurred, God showed its destruction to Jeremiah in a vision.
                   In the verse quoted above Jeremiah expressed his own horror
                   at the fate awaiting his nation; but the verse also expresses
                   the sentiment of his people.
                      How complete did his country's destruction appear to him
                   as he saw it in vision? Verses 23-26.
                      To the prophet the revelation of Judah's destruction was
                   overwhelmingly dreadful. Ordinary scenes of destruction did
                   not suffice to portray the desolation that would befall his
                   nation. The only adequate description was that applied to the
                   earth in the beginning: "Without form, and void." Gen. 1:2.
                      Although overwhelmed with pain at the dreadful prospect
                   awaiting his country and people, Jeremiah recorded his vision
                   without rebelling, since he accepted it as the just judgment of
                   God.
                      How does the prophet describe the character of his people
                   that provoked this calamity? Verse 22.
                      No one is so blind, as he who does not want to see, nor so
                   unknowing as he who does not want to know. God's professed
                   people in the days of Jeremiah did not know God. Compare
                   Jer. 2:8; 5:4, 21; 8:7. Jeremiah 9:6 gives the key to their spir-

                      The overthrow of Judah is also descriptive of the final days
                   of trouble that are to fall on "an impenitent world" and of the
                   end of the world. See SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 4:19.

THINK IT THROUGH       Inasmuch as these verses also depict the end of the world,
                   how do we react to the insights we have received regarding
                   the approach of the end?
                       "Angels are now restraining the winds of strife, that they
                   may not blow until the world shall be warned of its coming
                   doom; but a storm is gathering, ready to burst upon the earth;
                   and when God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there will
                   be such a scene of strife as no pen can picture.
                       "The Bible, and the Bible only, gives a correct view of these
                   things. Here are revealed the great final scenes in the history
                   of our world, events that already are casting their shadows
                    before, the sound of their approach causing the earth to

Jeremiah's Sorrow for His People LESSON 10                              ❑   Tuesday
                                                                        December 2

         Part 3       "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain
      UNENDING     of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the
                   daughter of my people!" Jer. 9:1.
       SORROW
                      As Jeremiah considered the sin of his people with its in-
                   evitable result of national ruin and total destruction, he broke
                   down with grief. Even though physical destruction had not yet
                   befallen his nation, he had so clearly foreseen it that his sor-
                   row was as deep in anticipation of it as it was upon its fulfill-
                   ment. Jeremiah's sorrow reveals the greatness of his soul. The
                   depth of his sorrow upon the fulfillment of the collapse of his
                   nation is expressed in Lamentations 2:11.
                      Overwhelmed with sorrow over his people, what did Jere-
                   miah wish he could do? Jer. 9:2.
                      Is there any person who at some juncture in his life has
                   not sensed a fleeting thought of getting away from it all? As
                   Jeremiah noted the rampant duplicity and immorality of his
                   people, he wished he could run away. Pierced with sorrow, he
                   thought he could not endure to be in the presence of his morally
                   corrupt and doomed people any longer. But he did not follow
                   the enticing inclination and flee from it all; he had accepted
                   God's call and been promised strength and courage adequate
                   for the task with the guarantee of preservation of life from God
                   Himself. See Jer. 1:19.
                     How had David expressed the same desire as Jeremiah,
                   when he was in a desperate plight? Ps. 55:6-8.

                      "We need to beware of following the instinct that prompts
                   us to escape from circumstances. If that desire becomes ha-
                   bitual, it is a morbid sign. Our work, our home, our relationships,
                   our responsibilities, are a discipline essential to the develop-
                   ment of Christian character. Rather than 'fly away,' we should
                   'call upon God' (v. 16)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Ps. 55:6.

THINK IT THROUGH       What occasions in my life cause me to feel like leaving it
                   all? What can I do in these situations that is in harmony with
                   faith in Jesus?
                       "By adherence to principle in the transactions of ordinary
                   life, the mind becomes accustomed to hold the claims of duty
                   above those of pleasure and inclination. Minds thus disciplined
                   are not wavering between right and wrong, like the reed trem-
                   bling in the wind; they are loyal to duty because they have
                   trained themselves to habits of fidelity and truth. By faithfulness
                   in that which is least they acquire strength to be faithful in
                   greater matters."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 223.

Jeremiah's Sorrow for His People LESSON 10                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  November 3

        Part 4   "This I recall to my mind, therefore have 'I hope. It is of
   PRESERVED the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his cont..
               passions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy
     THROUGH faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore
  GOD'S MERCY will I hope in him." Lam. 3:21-24.

                     The preceding verses of this chapter contain outcries and
                 implied complaints against God for the calamities that have
                 befallen Judah. But in verse 21 the mood changes. The proph-
                 et's mind rises above mournfulness to the steadfast love of God
                 that never ceases. The first part of the chapter may be termed
                 a prayer of complaint. Although a prayer, it is surcharged with
                 questions and doubts. This condition or state of mind is fre-
                 quently found in earnest Christians. Such people love God and
                 would like to believe that what has befallen them is all for
                 their best eternal good. But so far they cannot perceive this.
                     This apparently was Jeremiah's attitude in the first part of
                  this chapter. But then his mind broke through the clouds of
                  doubt and soared to the lofty heights of full trust and com-
                  mittal in the assurance of God's everlasting love. He recognized
                  that God's mercies never end. Even affliction is only a means
                  permitted by God to befall His children in order to bring them
                  into a more intimate relationship to Him.


                    What was Jeremiah's advice to his people so that they as
                 individuals might still experience personal forgiveness? Verses
                 39-42.

                    Jeremiah here appealed to the people that if there must be
                 sighing, let it be sighing over sins that have produced the un-
                 favorable conditions rather than over the sufferings. The prophet
                 wanted the people to search their hearts and conduct, be con-
                 victed of wrongdoing, and repent and turn from it, and return
                 to God. Then God would forgive their sin even though the
                 consequences of their wrongdoing could not be removed.
                     "'Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.' Have any
                 of us duly considered how much we have to be thankful for?
                 Do we remember that the mercies of the Lord are new every
                 morning and that His faithfulness faileth not? Do we acknowl-
                 edge our dependence upon Him and express gratitude for all
                 His favors? On the contrary, we too often forget that 'every good
                  and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from
                  the Father of lights.' "—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 315.

Jeremiah's Sorrow for His People LESSON 10                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                   December 4

           Part 5    "Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see
     JERUSALEM'S if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done
                  unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of
         SORROW his fierce anger." Lam. 1:12.
                     In this verse Jerusalem is personified. In his personal sorrow
                  Jeremiah portrays Jerusalem sitting like a woman, bereaved
                  and lonely, lamenting her state. Desolate and viewed with con-
                  tempt by her neighbors, she pours out her heart in anguish
                  and an appeal for sympathy.
                     Never had a city and a country been so favored by God as
                  Jerusalem and Judah had been. In Jerusalem God had de-
                  signed to show His glory. Judah's spiritual blessings had been
                  unexcelled. No one who had not experienced these privileges
                  could sense the anguish of heart caused by their loss. There
                  is a law of balance operative in life, making the opportunities
                  enjoyed commensurate with the sorrow felt at their loss. With
                  less opportunity there is less grief at their loss.
                      Of all the dolorous statements the most plaintive is, "It
                  might have been." It was Jeremiah's awareness that calamity
                  need not have befallen his people that made his pain so poig-
                  nant.
                     The finally lost will sense this hopeless sorrow when "at
                  the day of judgment there comes to the lost a full realization
                  of the meaning of the sacrifice made on Calvary. They see
                  what they have lost by refusing to be loyal. They think of the
                  high, pure association it was their privilege to gain. But it is
                  too late. The last call has been made. The wail is heard: 'The
                  harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.'
                  Jeremiah 8:20."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 16.
                     "In the time of the end the people of God will sigh and cry
                  for the abominations done in the land. With tears they will
                  warn the wicked of their danger in trampling upon the divine
                  law, and with unutterable sorrow they will humble themselves
                  before the Lord in penitence. The wicked will mock their sorrow
                  and ridicule their solemn appeals. But the anguish and humilia-
                  tion of God's people is unmistakable evidence that they are
                  regaining the strength and nobility of character lost in conse-
                  quence of sin. It is because they are drawing nearer to Christ,
                  because their eyes are fixed on His perfect purity, that they
                  discern so clearly the exceeding sinfulness of sin. Meekness
                  and lowliness are the conditions of success and victory. A
                  crown of glory awaits those who bow at the foot of the cross."

                                                                     December 5

        Part 6        "Turn thou us unto thee, 0 Lord, and we shall be turned;
      HOPE OF      renew our days as of old." Lam. 5:21.
  RESTORATION         The entire last chapter of Lamentations is a prayer by Jere-
                   miah for restoration. This prayer climaxes in verse 21.
                      Lamentations or expressions of sorrow for a calamity that
                   has befallen us because of our shortcomings and sins are
                   profitless unless they lead to repentance. As a matter of fact,
                   personal disaster resulting from personal neglect is downright
                   sinful. God may bring good out of evil by using the disaster to
                   generate active repentance and a determination to let God
                   direct one's life in the future.
                      It is evident from the verse that Jeremiah fully recognizes
                   that God alone, through His grace, can enable a sinner to re-
                   pent and return to God. Man in himself is unable to effect this
                   change, since man in his natural state is "dead in trespasses
                   and sins." Eph. 2:1.
                      Who and what, according to the apostle Paul, brings a
                   person to repentance? Rom. 2:4.
                      "The light shining from the cross reveals the love of God.
                   His love is drawing us to Himself. If we do not resist this draw-
                   ing, we shall be led to the foot of the cross in repentance for
                   the sins that have crucified the Saviour. Then the Spirit of
                   God through faith produces a new life in the soul. The thoughts
                   and desires are brought into obedience to the will of Christ.
                   The heart, the mind, are created anew in the image of Him who
                   works in us to subdue all things to Himself. Then the law of
                   God is written in the mind and heart, and we can say with
                   Christ, 'I delight to do Thy will, 0 my God.' "—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 176.
THINK IT THROUGH     When I recognize wrong attitudes in myself, what can be
                   done to change them?
                      "The victory is not won without much earnest prayer, with-
                   out the humbling of self at every step. Our will is not .to be
                   forced into co-operation with divine agencies, but it must be
                   voluntarily submitted. Were it possible to force upon you with
                   a hundredfold greater intensity the influence of the Spirit of
                   God, it would not make you a Christian, a fit subject for heaven.
                   The stronghold of Satan would not be broken. The will must be
                   placed on the side of God's will. You are not able, of yourself,
                   to bring your purposes and desires and inclinations into sub-
                   mission to the will of God; but if you are 'willing to be made
                    willing,' God will accomplish the work for you."—Thoughts

                                                                        December 7

        Part 1         "Thus saith the Lord unto me, Go and get thee a linen
     THE LINEN     girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. So
                   I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord, and put it
        GIRDLE     on my loins. And the word of the Lord came unto me the
                   second time, saying, take the girdle that thou hast got, which
                   is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there
                   in a hole of the rock." Jer. 13:1-4.
                     Read also verses 5-11.
                     The linen girdle, or rather waistcloth or loincloth, was a gar-
                   ment. Elijah wore one made of skin. 2 Kings 1:8.

                      What did the loincloth represent? Verse 10.

                      Being made of linen it was white. This color was to remind
                   Israel that they had been chosen by God to develop a charac-
                   ter worthy of a "holy nation" (Ex. 19:6; Lev. 20:26; Rev. 19:8).
                   The "getting" or buying was a reminder to the people that they
                   had been redeemed or purchased by God.

                     What was the intended relationship of the loincloth to its
                   owner and wearer? Verse 11.

                       Israel, espoused to God as Lord and Master, was originally
                   like an unsoiled loincloth. As the garment was to cling to its
                   owner and wearer and bring him glory, so God's covenant
                   people were to cling to Him, and as the priest's dress was "for
                   glory and beauty" (Ex. 28:40; Lev. 16:4), so God had chosen
                   Israel and Judah to glorify Him before the nations of the earth.
                       The priests were never to forget their holy calling and office.
                   Not only were their hearts to be clean, but also their bodies.
                   Thus there were many and frequent Levitical washings both of
                   body and garments.
                       Jeremiah was told to "put it not in water" (verse 1). Being
                   worn next to the body, the loincloth became soiled. This soil
                   was to signify the moral condition of Israel and the lack of the
                   "clean water" of repentance. See Ezek. 36:25.
                       As the girdle was hidden "in a hole of the rock" by the
                   Euphrates (verse 4), so God's unrepentant people were to be
                   in captivity in Babylon by the Euphrates because they had
                   failed in their holy calling. After leaving the loincloth and re-
                   turning "after many days" Jeremiah found it marred, rotting,
                   and unfit to wear.

THINK IT THROUGH       What principle in the parable of the loincloth is applicable
                   to life today?

Jeremiah's Parables LESSON 11                                      ❑ Monday
                                                                   December 8

        Part 2      "The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
                 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will
   THE POTTER
                 cause thee to hear my words. Then I went down to the potter's
                 house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And
                 the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of
                 the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed
                 good to the potter to make it." Jer. 18:1-4.

                    Read also verses 5-10.
                    This parable is the classic instance of the Bible teaching of
                 conditional prophecy. The setting of the parable is the rela-
                 tionship of Judah and God. It also contains lessons for the
                 personal experience of believers.
                    Note that the marring of the vessel was not the fault of the
                 potter. Rather, some foreign substance in the clay frustrated
                 the potter's effort and ruined his work.


                    To what did God liken His people? Verse 6.

                    God was willing to work with Israel and remake them so long
                 as they were willing and pliable in His hand.
                    The potter does not decide how many times he can return
                 the clay to a lump and remake it into another vessel. Rather, it
                 depends on the material, and how quickly it hardens.


                   Upon what does condemnation and calamity, or repentance
                 and salvation, ultimately depend? Verses 8-10.

                    As Jeremiah watched the potter at work on his wheel, he
                 heard God speak. Verse 5. He perceived the symbolic signifi-
                 cance of the potter and the clay, teaching that God would
                 change His plans for Judah if Judah would change by repent-
                 ance.
                    "The Potter cannot mold and fashion unto honor that which
                 has never been placed in His hands. The Christian life is one
                 of daily surrender, submission and continual overcoming. Every
                 day fresh victories will be gained. Self must be lost sight of,
                 and the love of God must be constantly cultivated. Thus we
                 grow up into Christ. Thus the life is fashioned according to
                 the divine model."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

Jeremiah's Parables LESSON 11                                            ❑   Tuesday
                                                                         December 9

           Part 3      Two parables dealing with earthen bottles are discussed in
     THE EARTHEN    this part. They are found in Jeremiah 13:12-14 and 19:1-13.
         BOTTLES       "Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus
                    saith the Lord God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with
                    wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know
                    that every bottle shall be filled with wine? Then shalt thou
                    say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will fill all the
                    inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's
                    throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabi-
                    tants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness." Jer. 13:12, 13.

                        The wine bottle or jar represents the people of Judah. As
                    it is filled with wine, so the people will be filled with intoxicat-
                    ing wine. All are to be drunk. In their confused state of mind
                    they will then utterly destroy themselves as they stumble into
                    vice and moral corruption; with leaders having blurred minds,
                    they are incapable of perceiving the will of God or of making
                    intelligent decisions.

                       What was God planning to do with the Jews symbolized
                    by the earthen bottle filled with wine? Jer. 13:14; cf. Jer.
                    19:10, 11.

                        Read also Jer. 19:1-9.
                        Jeremiah enumerates some of the transgressions of Judah
                    (Jer. 19:3-9) in the ears of the elders of the people at the east
                     gate. From there "the persons with him could look down into
                     that valley where idolatry and child sacrifice had been prac-
                     ticed."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 5, p. 968. His appeal to
                    them was to repent and return to God.
                        The breaking of the earthen bottle in the parable in Jer.
                    19:1-13 follows immediately upon the refusal of the people of
                    Judah to repent and return to their God.
                        It angered the people. The clay had hardened so that God
                    could not make them again. It was a rebuke to them and espe-
                    cially to the priests who carried on the religious rituals.
                        The parable of/the potter had been one with hope of recon-
                    struction; the parables of the bottles were portrayals of destruc-
                    tion. The clay in the potter's hand, although marred, was still
                    moldable; in the earthen vessels the clay was dry and hard.
                    It could no longer be molded but only broken.
                        "The Lord in mercy sends words of reproof to save the
                    erring, but they will not submit to be corrected. They insist that
                    they have done no wrong, and thus resist the Spirit of God."

Jeremiah's Parables LESSON 11                                  ❑   Wednesday
                                                                  December 10

       Part 4  What is Jeremiah bidden by God to take from His hand
     THE CUP and give to all the surrounding nations?
     OF FURY   "For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me; Take the
                wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations,
                to whom I send thee, to drink it. And they shall drink, and
                be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will
                send among them." Jer. 25:15, 16.
                    Read also verses 17-38.
                    The wine cup of fury symbolizes that the nations are to be
                filled with dread and despair before the victorious armies of
                Babylon. See Jer. 51:7.

                  Upon which nation was God's punishment through Nebu-
                chadnezzar to fall first? Jer. 25:29.
                   Israel and Judah were God's chosen people. Theirs had
                been unmatched opportunities. To them God had given His law
                and revealed His will. They had known that they might have
                been raised up to heaven, as it were, if they had obeyed God's
                will.
                   "The day of doom for the kingdom of Judah was fast ap-
                proaching. No longer could the Lord set before them the hope
                of averting the severest of His judgments. 'Should ye be utterly
                unpunished?' He inquired. 'Ye shall not be unpunished.' "—
                Prophets and Kings, p. 450.

                  Which other parable spelled utter doom also for the Jews
                who went to Egypt after the fall of Judah? Jer. 43:8-13.
                   This is another acted parable. It signified the campaign of
                the king of Babylon in Egypt. In this way the message was
                given to the Jews that, although they had sought refuge and
                security in Egypt, they were still to come under the dominion
                of Babylon.
                   "God was able to use him [Nebuchadnezzar] as an instru-
                ment for the punishment of the rebellious and for the fulfillment
                of the divine purpose. 'The terrible of the nations' (Ezekiel
                28:7), it was given Nebuchadnezzar, after years of patient and
                wearing labor,.to conquer Tyre; Egypt also fell a prey to his
                victorious armies."—Prophets and Kings, p. 515.
                   "The psalmist represents the presence of the Infinite One
                as pervading the universe. 'If I ascend up into heaven, thou
                art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.' [Ps.
                139:8]. We can never find a solitude where God is not."—Ellen

Jeremiah's Parables LESSON 11                                            ❑ Thursday
                                                                         December 11

           Part 5       "The Lord showed me this vision: Behold, two baskets of
     TWO BASKETS    figs placed before the temple of the Lord. One basket had
                    very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had
          OF FIGS   very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten." Jer. 24:1
                    (last part), 2, RSV.
                        This vision was given after Jehoiachin—here called Jeconiah
                    (cf. Jer. 37:1; 2 Kings 24:8)—with the princes and the craftsmen
                    had been taken captive to Babylon.

                       What did the two baskets of figs in Jeremiah's vision rep-
                    resent? Jer. 24:5, 8. See also Jer. 29:16, 17.

                        God is not speaking categorically in this parable with refer-
                    ence to the spiritual quality of the Jews represented by these
                    two baskets. Not all the Jews brought into captivity were mor-
                    ally good or better than those left behind in Judah. Jeremiah
                    says that God had rejected Jehoiachin—here called Coniah (see
                    Jer. 22:24-30)—so he was certainly not a good fig. On the
                    other hand Jeremiah himself chose to remain in Judah with
                    the Jewish remnant (see Jer. 39:13, 14; 40:1-6), rather than go
                    to Babylon when offered the option by Nebuchadnezzar. And
                    Jeremiah was not a bad fig even though he chose to remain
                    in Judah.
                        In generalities rather than specifics, the prophet in this vision
                    saw that the Jews left in Judah are falsely thinking they are
                    better than the recent captives. They trust in religious forms
                    connected with the temple worship rather than in a saving rela-
                    tionship to God. "Thus the conventions of orthodoxy, and the
                    temple itself, are substituted for the direct relation with Yahweh.
                    Their false center of worship corrupts their images and falsifies
                    their lives. They are thus the bad figs. Nothing corrupts like
                    a false conception of a true religion."—The Interpreter's Bible,
                    vol. 5, p. 997.

THINK IT THROUGH       What valid application can you make of this parable to
                    your life?
                       "When He permits trials and afflictions, it is 'for our profit,
                    that we might be partakers of His holiness.' Hebrews 12:10. If
                    received in faith, the trial that seems so bitter and hard to
                    bear will prove a blessing. The cruel blow that blights the joys
                    of earth will be the means of turning our eyes to heaven. How

Jeremiah's Parables LESSON 11                                          ❑ Friday
                                                                     December 12

        Part 6        Early in the reign of Zedekiah what parable did Jeremiah
   THE WOODEN      enact?
         YOKE        "Thus saith the Lord to me; Make thee bonds and yokes,
                   and put them upon thy neck." Jer. 27:2.
                     Read also verses 3-5.
                     According to the RSV this took place during the reign of
                   Zedekiah rather than during the reign of Jehoiakim. As the
                   SDA Bible Commentary on Jeremiah 27:1 points out, "Several
                   Hebrew manuscripts read `Zedekiah' which is undoubtedly the
                   correct reading, as clearly proved by vs. 3, 12 (see ch. 28:1)."
                   This is also supported by Prophets and Kings, p. 443.

                       For whom did Jeremiah act this parable, and what was it
                   to indicate? Jer. 27:6-11.

                      "From the first, Jeremiah had followed a consistent course
                   in counseling submission to the Babylonians. This counsel was
                   given not only to Judah, but to many of the surrounding nations.
                   In the earlier portion of Zedekiah's reign, ambassadors from
                   the rulers of Edom, Moab, Tyre, and other nations visited the
                   king of Judah to learn whether in his judgment the time was
                   opportune fora united revolt and whether he would join them
                   in battling against the king of Babylon. While these ambassa-
                   dors were awaitng a response, the word of the Lord came to
                   Jeremiah, [to enact this parable]... .
                       "Jeremiah was commanded to instruct the ambassadors to
                   inform their rulers that God had given them all into the hand
                   of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and that they were
                   to 'serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very
                   time of his land come.' Verse 7.
                       "The ambassadors were further instructed to declare to
                   their rulers that if they refused to serve the Babylonian king
                   they should be punished 'with the sword, and with the famine,
                   and with the pestilence' till they were consumed."—Prophets
                   and Kings, pp. 442, 443.

THINK IT THROUGH       What was the purpose of the Babylonian captivity? What .'
                   is the equivalent of this captivity in my life?

                      "The lightest punishment that a merciful God could inflict
                   upon so rebellious a people was submission to the rule of Baby-
                   lon, but if they warred against this decree of servitude they were
                   to feel the full rigor of His chastisement."—Prophets and Kings,
                   p. 444.

 PROMISES OF
RESTORATION
Promises of Restoration      LESSON 12                               ❑ Sunday
                                                                   December 14

        Part 1      What encouraging promise did God give to His people?
 ASSURANCE OF        "For, lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will bring
  RESTORATION    again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the
                 Lord: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave
                 to their fathers, and they shall possess it." Jer. 30:3.

                    In chapter 29 Jeremiah foretold the captivity of his people.
                 This was a gloomy message to an already discouraged peo-
                 ple. But God does not leave His people in despair; in chapter
                 30 God imparts hope by His promise of restoration.

                    Who would be included in the restoration? Jer. 30:3; 31:1.

                    The restoration from captivity would not merely embrace
                 the children of Judah, taken and held captive by the Baby-
                 lonians, but also the Israelites. These were taken captive by
                 the Assyrians more than 100 years before the first Babylonian.,
                 captivity. See 2 Kings 17:1-23. On restoration, Israel and Judah
                 would again be united and become one nation.

                    In contrast with His dealings with their heathen oppres-
                 sors, how would God deal with His people? Jet. 30:11.

                     The Israelites and the Jews were not to disappear as a
                 people from among the nations. In spite of their captivity God
                 was not to "make a full end" of them. They were to be re-
                 stored and live on as a people even though their oppressors
                 were to disappear from the face of the earth.
                     It was God's purpose that the promises of Isaiah 27:6, that
                 "Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world
                 with fruit," should be fulfilled. This promise, along with that
                 of Genesis 12:2 which says that "I will bless thee . . . ; and
                 thou shalt be a blessing" should have been largely fulfilled
                 "during the centuries following the return of the Israelites from
                 the lands of their captivity. It was God's design that the whole
                 earth be prepared for the first advent of Christ."—Prophets and
                 Kings, pp. 703, 704.
                     "They [the Jews] were carried into captivity to Babylon,
                 and there remained for many years. Yet they were not forsaken
                 of the Lord. His prophets were sent to them with reproofs and
                 warnings. The people were awakened to see their guilt, they
                 humbled themselves before God, and returned to Him with true
                 repentance. Then the Lord sent them messages of encourage-
                 ment, declaring that He would deliver them from their captivity
                 and restore them to His favor."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 468.

Promises of Restoration LESSON 12                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                   December 15

        Part 2        What business proposition did God reveal would be pre-
     JEREMIAH      sented to Jeremiah in the prison? Jer. 32:6-8.
DEMONSTRATES          Jeremiah knew God, and God through His Holy Spirit in-
HIS OWN FAITH      formed him what was going to happen. Then his uncle's son
                   arrived and presented his proposition to Jeremiah, just as God
                   had informed him.
                     How did Jeremiah, in response to this business proposition,
                   demonstrate his own faith in the surety of restoration from the
                   Babylonian captivity?
                       "And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanameel my
                   cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels
                   of silver. I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and
                   weighed the money on scales." Jer. 32:9, 10, RSV.
                       Jeremiah understood it to be God's will that he purchase
                   this piece of ancestral property.
                       From a human point of view this investment in land already
                   in the possession of the enemy appeared to be sheer foolish-
                   ness. Who would be stupid enough to buy real estate in an
                   area that is overrun and captured by the enemy? But Jeremiah
                   did this very thing in accordance with God's will.
                      Of what was this purchase to be an evidence or assurance
                   on the very verge of Judah's utter defeat before the Baby-
                   lonians? Jer. 32:15.
                      Jeremiah himself would derive no profit from this piece of
                   property. He was not a young man at the time of Zedekiah's
                   ascension to the throne, and he himself had predicted that the
                   captivity in Babylon would last for 70 years. But for Jeremiah
                   the will of God was sufficient reason for this purchase.
                      "Men who act by revelation have not to ask for reasons
                   before acting. Obedience is their role; afterwards they may
                   ask for light. Christians have to commit their way unto the
                   Lord, and trust where they cannot trace. They are led by a
                   higher reason, which cannot err."—H. D. M. Spence, Ed., The
                   Pulpit Commentary (New York: Funk and Wagnalls Co., 1913),
                   Jeremiah, vol. 2, p. 55.
THINK IT THROUGH       In what specific ways can a Christian's faith, or lack of
                   faith, be demonstrated in business transactions?
                       "Let God untangle the snarled-up threads for you. He is
                   wise enough to manage the complications of our lives. He has
                   skill and tact. We cannot always see His plans; we must wait
                   patiently their unfolding and not mar and destroy them. He will
                   reveal them to us in His own good time."—Testimonies, vol. 5,

        Part 3      As Jeremiah contemplated God's revealed restoration of
  NOTHING TOO    His people amid the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, what
                 temptation assailed him? Jer. 32:16-25.
 HARD FOR GOD
                    "Nebuchadnezzar's armies were about to take the walls of
                 Zion by storm. Thousands were perishing in a last desperate
                 defense of the city. Many thousands more were dying of hunger
                 and disease. The fate of Jerusalem was already sealed. The
                 besieging towers of the enemy's forces were already overlook-
                 ing the walls. 'Behold the mounts,' the prophet continued in
                 his prayer to God; 'they are come unto the city to take it; and
                 the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight
                 against it . . . ; and, behold, Thou seest it. And Thou hast said
                 unto me, 0 Lord God, Buy thee the field for money, and take
                 witnesses;.for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.' "
                 —Prophets and Kings, p. 471.

                    What was God's answer to Jeremiah's nagging doubts
                 about the reestablishment of His people in the Promised. Land?

                    "Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any
                 thing too hard for me?" Verse 27.

                     "The prayer of the prophet was graciously answered. 'The
                 word of the Lord unto Jeremiah' in that hour of distress, when
                 the faith of the messenger of truth was being tried as by fire,
                 was: 'Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any-
                 thing too hard for Me?' Verses 26, 27. The city was soon to
                 fall into the hands of the Chaldeans; its gates and palaces
                 were to be set on fire and burned; but, notwithstanding the
                 fact that destruction was imminent and the inhabitants of Jeru-
                 salem were to be carried away captive, nevertheless the eternal
                 purpose of Jehovah for Israel was yet to be fulfilled."—Proph-
                 ets and Kings, p. 471.

                    How was this regathering of God's people from captivity
                 to be remembered by them in the future? Jer. 16:14, 15;
                 23:7, 8.

                    "Worry is blind, and cannot discern the future; but Jesus
                 sees the end from the beginning. In every difficulty He has His
                 way prepared to bring relief. Our heavenly Father has a thou-
                 sand ways to provide for us, of which we know nothing. Those
                 who accept the one principle of making the service and honor
                 of God supreme will find perplexities vanish, and a plain path
                 before their feet."—The Desire of Ages, p. 330.

Promises of Restoration LESSON 12                               ❑    Wednesday
                                                                    December 17

        Part 4   What was God's plan for the returning captive Israelites
   CONDITIONS and Jews?
        AFTER    "Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither
  RESTORATION I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in
                 great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and
                 I will cause them to dwell safely." Jer. 32:37.
                     How was this security to be reflected in the general activi-
                 ties and industry of the restored Israelites? Jer. 31:4, 5; 32:15.
                    It was God's plan that such peaceful conditions might be
                 restored to the land of the returned captives that they might
                 plant vineyards and reap and enjoy the fruit of their labors.
                 Instead of living in gloomy dread of assaulting enemy armies,
                 they were to be able to dress themselves for joyous living.
                 Under such conditions real estate would again be valuable, in
                 contrast with its worthlessness as they faced deportation to
                 an enemy country.
                    Which ruling house did God state would again be firmly
                 established on the throne of Israel? Jer. 33:15, 16.
                     When Jeremiah wrote this, the house of David wobbled on
                 the throne of Judah. Jehoiachin had been taken captive to
                 Babylon; his uncle Zedekiah had been elevated to the throne
                 on his promise of loyalty to Nebuchadnezzar. At such a time
                 Jeremiah—obviously not always a prophet of gloom and tears
                 —painted before the frightened and distraught Jews a new day
                 of hope with a good and strong king of the same royal house
                 seated on the throne of reunited Israel. "If Jerusalem had only
                 lived up to what God designed that it should be, its future
                 would have been most glorious."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                 on Jer. 33:16. But "these promises were conditional on obe-
                 dience. The sins that had characterized the Israelites prior to
                 the captivity, were not to be repeated."—Prophets and Kings,
                 p. 704.
                     "By the Babylonish captivity the Israelites were effectually
                  cured of the worship of graven images. After their return, they
                  gave much attention to religious instruction and to the study
                  of that which had been written in the book of the law and in
                  the prophets concerning the worship of the true God. . . . The
                  seasons of prosperity that followed gave ample evidence of
                  God's willingness to accept and forgive, and yet with fatal
                  shortsightedness they turned again and again from their glorious
                  destiny and selfishly appropriated to themselves that which
                  would have brought healing and spiritual life to countless multi-
                  tudes."—Prophets and Kings, p. 705.

      NECESSARY       "Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord; that
                   ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands
                   to your own hurt." Jer. 25:7.

                      "From the time of their entrance to the land of Canaan, they
                   departed from the commandments of God, and followed the
                   ways of the heathen. It was in vain that God sent them warn-
                   ing by His prophets. In vain they suffered the chastisement of
                   heathen oppression. Every reformation was followed by deeper
                   apostasy."—The Desire of Ages, page 28.
                      What was the spiritual condition of Judah at this time?
                   Jer. 30:12, 15; 15:18.
                     "Judah had been forsaken by her lovers [allies (see v. 14)]
                      , and now she stood alone, for she had forsaken her God."
                   —SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 30:13.

                      How was God to chastise them? Jer. 29:18, 19.

                       This miserable state should not have come as a surprise to
                   Judah. Through Moses, God had long before foretold that such
                   would be their experience if they departed from His will. See
                   Deut. 28:47, 48.
                       "Had Israel been true to God, He could have accomplished
                   His purpose through their honor and exaltation.... But because
                   of their unfaithfulness, God's purpose could be wrought out
                   only through continued adversity and humiliation."—The Desire
                   of Ages, p. 28.
                       "Like Israel of old they [some Christians] question, 'If God
                   is leading us, why do all these things come upon us?'
                       "It is because God is leading them that these things come
                   upon them. Trials and obstacles are the Lord's chosen methods
                   of discipline and His appointed conditions of success. He who
                   reads the hearts of men knows their characters better than they
                   themselves know them. He sees that some have powers and
                   susceptibilities which, rightly directed, might be used in the
                   advancement of His work. In His providence He brings these
                   persons into different positions and varied circumstances that
                   they may discover in their character the defects which have
                   been concealed from their own knowledge. He gives them op-
                   portunity to correct these defects and to fit themselves for His
                   service. Often He permits the fires of affliction to assail them
                   that they may be purified."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 470,

        Part 6       What did Jeremiah assure his people was the basis of
 GOD'S ACTION      God's dealings with them?
BASED ON LOVE         "The Lord bath appeared of old unto me,. saying, Yea, I
                   have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
                   lovingkindness have I drawn thee." Jer. 31:3.
                      "God is love." 1 John 4:8. All His dealings with men are
                   founded on His love. He is looking out for what is eternally best
                   for them at all times. On this basis some happenings may
                   occur that are not pleasant at the moment. He did not want to
                   destroy His people; He wanted to re-create them.

                      How did God assure His people of His long-range benevo-
                   lent purpose for them, in contrast with His purpose for their
                   captors, despite their present adversity? Jer. 46:28.

                      "Thus was the church of God comforted in one of the darkest
                   hours of her long conflict with the forces of evil. Satan had
                   seemingly triumphed in his efforts to destroy Israel; but the
                   Lord was overruling the events of the present, and during the
                   years that were to follow, His people were to have opportunity
                   to redeem the past."—Prophets and Kings, page 474.
                      Temporarily the enemy may have appeared totally victorious,
                   while God's people were to be scattered among the nations.
                   But not so. The nations which appeared to have the upper hand
                   and were apparently victorious were ultimately to be removed
                   from the face of the earth, while Israel was to continue. God
                   would not "make an utter end" of His people "but correct thee
                   [them] in measure." Even today the Jews still exist as a sepa-
                   rate and distinct race, while the Babylonians of yonder years
                   disappeared not merely as a nation, but as a distinct people.
                       "They [Israel] were brought into subjection to Babylon, and
                   scattered through the lands of the heathen. In affliction many
                   renewed their faithfulness to His covenant. While they hung
                   their harps upon the willows, and mourned for the holy temple
                   that was laid waste, the light of truth shone out through them,
                   and a knowledge of God was spread among the nations. The
                    heathen systems of sacrifice were a perversion of the system
                    that God had appointed; and many a sincere observer of
                    heathen rites learned from the Hebrews the meaning of the
                    service divinely ordained, and in faith grasped the promise of
                    a Redeemer."—The Desire of Ages, p. 28.

          Part 1    "The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
  ORIGIN OF THE Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men
                 of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem." Jer. 11:1, 2.
     COVENANT
                      Read also Jer. 11:3-5.
                      This passage has special significance in the light of Josiah's
                   reform. The book of the covenant (Deuteronomy. See Prophets
                   and Kings, pp. 392, 393) had been found in the temple (2 Kings
                   22:8), and the king and the people covenanted to "perform
                   the words of this covenant." 2 Kings 23:3.
                      With the passage of time Josiah died, Jehoiakim had re-
                   cently been enthroned king of Judah and allegiance to the
                   covenant had waned. See Prophets and Kings, p. 414.
                      Now, some 13 years after the book of Deuteronomy was
                   found, God sent Jeremiah to call Judah back to the covenant.

                      When had this covenant originally been made? Jer. 11:3, 4.

                       The covenant made at Sinai with Israel was itself a renewal
                   of the covenant made with their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and
                   Jacob.

                     In its simplest terms, what was the purpose of the cove-
                   nant? Verse 4, last part.

                      At the time of the giving of the law the Lord called for Israel's
                   obedience to His covenant so that Israel might be "a peculiar
                   treasure: . . . a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation." Ex.
                   19:5, 6. The message was carried from God to the people by
                   Moses. "Their answer was, 'All that the Lord hath spoken we
                   will do.' Thus they entered into a solemn covenant with God,
                   pledging themselves to accept Him as their ruler, by which
                   they became, in a special sense, the subjects of His authority."
                   —Patriarchs and Prophets, page 303.
                      The statement "I will be their God and they shall be my
                   people," or one similar to it, is covenantal language. Jeremiah
                   uses it seven times in his book. Three of the references men-
                   tion the covenant explicitly, while in the other four references
                   the covenant is clearly understood.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the meaning today of the statement, "so shall ye
                   be my people, and I will be your God"? Jer. 11:4. What sig-
                   nificance do you see in the use of similar language in Revela-
                   tion 21:3?

                 manded your fathers when I brought them out of the land
                 of Egypt." Jer. 11:3, 4, RSV.
                    "Ancient covenants were of 2 kinds, those between equals
                 and those between lord and vassal. In a covenant between
                 equals there was mutual agreement on conditions, privileges,
                 and responsibilities (Gen 21:32; 26:28; etc.). In a covenant be-
                 tween lord and vassal, conqueror and conquered, superior and
                 inferior, the lord or conqueror specified the conditions, privi-

                 commonly describes the formal relationship that existed be-
                 tween God on the one hand and Israel as the chosen people
                 on the other. Obviously, this was not a covenant between
                 equals, but between the infinite God and finite man. God Him-
                 self determined the provisions of the covenant, made them
                 known to His people, and gave them the choice of accepting
                 or rejecting the covenant. Once ratified, however, it was con-
                 sidered binding upon both God and His people."—SDA Bible
                 Dictionary, p. 229.
                    According to the terms of the covenant, how were the
                 people to relate to their Divine King? Verse 4, last part.
                    According to the terms of the covenant, what was included
                 in God's responsibility to His people? Verse 5.
                    "The principles set forth in Deuteronomy for the instruction
                 of Israel are to be followed by God's people to the end of time.
                 True prosperity is dependent on the continuance of our cove-
                 nant relationship with God. Never can we afford to compromise
                 principle by entering into alliance with those who do not fear
                 Him.
                     "There is constant danger that professing Christians will
                 come to think that in order to have influence with worldlings,
                 they must to a certain extent conform to the world. But though
                 such a course may appear to afford great advantages, it always
                 ends in spiritual loss. Against every subtle influence that seeks
                 entrance by means of flattering inducements from the enemies
                 of truth, God's people must strictly guard. They are pilgrims
                 and strangers in this world, traveling a path beset with danger.
                 To the ingenious subterfuges and alluring inducements held
                 out to tempt from allegiance, they must give no heed."—Proph-

The Covenant        LESSON 13                                         ❑ Tuesday
                                                                     December 23

         Part 3       How did the ancestors of the people of Jeremiah's day
  REJECTION OF    relate to the covenant?
 THE COVENANT        "For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day
                  that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto
                  this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
                  Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every
                  one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring
                  upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded
                  them to do; but they did them not." Jer. 11:7, 8.
                       There were repeated times of apostasy in Israel. The first
                   was the worship of the golden calf during the covenant formal-
                   ities. Then came the backsliding at Baal-peor followed by the
                   checkered experiences of the days of the judges. After the
                  monarchy divided, the northern kingdom developed an idola-
                  trous religion, and Judah eventually went the same route.
                       "During the 4 centuries of Judah's history the worship of
                  God was frequently accompanied by the worship of pagan gods
                  for whom shrines and cult places were erected from the time
                  of Solomon to the end of the kingdom (1 Ki 11:4-8; 14:22-24;
                  2 Ki 21:1-7; etc.), Although the country did not experience the
                  depths of idolatry found in the northern kingdom, Judah was
                  practically a semipagan nation during the period of the kings.
                  Some kings, such as Asa (1 Ki 15:12-14), Jehoshaphat (ch
                  22:43-46), Hezekiah (2 Ki 18:1-4), Josiah (ch 22:1-20), made
                  serious attempts to stamp out idolatry and pagan cults. These
                  reforms, however, were temporary, and the people lapsed into
                  paganism once more. This was the chief reason for the na-
                  tion's downfall."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 609.
                      The question facing Judah when the message of Jeremiah 11
                  was given was, Will the reformation of Josiah continue, or die?
                  The answer was not long delayed.

                     How did Jeremiah's contemporaries relate to the covenant
                  during Jehoiakim's reign? Verses 9, 10.
                      "The Lord had through Moses set before His people the
                  result of unfaithfulness. By refusing to keep His covenant, they
                  would cut themselves off from the life of God, and His blessing
                  could not come upon them. At times these warnings were
                  heeded, and rich blessings were bestowed upon the Jewish
                  nation and through them upon surrounding peoples. But more
                  often in their history they forgot God and lost sight of their
                  high privilege as His representatives. They robbed Him of the
                  service He required of them, and they robbed their fellow men
                  of religious guidance and a holy example."—Prophets and

The Covenant LESSON 13                                         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                December 24

        Part 4      During Zedekiah's reign, what three scenes were given to
   CONDITIONS    Ezekiel of conditions in Judah? Ezek. 8:10-16.
     IN JUDAH        Tammuz was a Babylonian god who, according to myth, an-
                 nually died and was resurrected. The weeping mentioned in
                 verse 14 indicates participation by these women in the annual
                 rites of Tammuz.
                    What idolatrous practice did Jeremiah refer to?
                    "While their children remember their altars and their
                 Asherim, beside every green tree, and on the high hills."
                 Jer. 17:2, RSV.
                     Asherah, singular of Asherim, was "a Phoenician goddess of
                 vegetation," and "the female counterpart of Baal."—SDA Bible
                 Dictionary, pages 81, 82. She was frequently symbolized by
                 trees or upright sticks, and it is probably to these that the
                 plural Asherim refers in the above reference.
                     What social conditions were prevalent? Jer. 5:7-9; 23:
                 11, 14.
                     What was God's evaluation of Judah's condition as the
                 exile neared? Jer. 30:12; 2 Chron. 36:15, 16.
                     According to the covenant, the Lord was to be Judah's God.
                 But they chose Baal, Asherah, Tammuz, and others. Judah's
                 life-style was to be in harmony with the Lord's commands, and
                 they were to be His people. They chose instead to live like
                 the heathen. The land in which they lived was theirs only by
                 a provision of the covenant, and when they broke the covenant
                 and for a long period of time refused to repent, God had them
                 removed from the covenant land. The covenant had come to
                 an end.
                     There is the strongest possible contrast between Judah's
                 apostasy and the intentions God had for His people. In the
                 following quotation Ellen G. White summarized these intentions:
                     "Those nations that rejected the worship and service of the
                 true God were to be dispossessed. But it was God's purpose
                 that by the revelation of His character through Israel men
                  should be drawn unto Him. To all the world the gospel invita-
                 tion was to be given. Through the teaching of the sacrificial
                 service, Christ was to be uplifted before the nations, and all
                  who would look unto Him should live. All who, like Rahab the
                 Canaanite and Ruth the Moabitess, turned from idolatry to the
                  worship of the true God were to unite themselves with His
                  chosen people. As the numbers of Israel increased, they were
                 to enlarge their borders until their kingdom should embrace
                 the world.

The Covenant LESSON 13                                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                December 25

       Part 5      What is said of the covenant in promises of the restoration
         NEW    of Judah recorded in Jeremiah 31?
  COVENANT—I       "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make
                a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house
                of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with
                their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring
                them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake,
                although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord." Jer.
                31:31, 32.
                   Northern Israel had gone into captivity some 125 years
                earlier, and Judah was approaching a similar fate. In this
                "book of hope" Jeremiah recorded God's promise of a new
                covenant. The previous one was broken; and, if there was to
                be a covenant between God and His chosen people, He must
                reinstitute it. This He promised to do. The goal of this new
                covenant was to be the same as the Sinaitic covenant: "I . . .
                will be their God, and they shall be my people." Jer. 31:33,
                last part. The Lord pointed out that the new covenant was to
                be different from the one made after the Exodus from Egypt.

                  What specific characteristics were to be included in the
                new covenant? Jer. 31:33, 34; 32:40.

                   Note the emphasis on what was to happen internally to the
                covenant people:
                       1. Law within them.
                        2. Possess a knowledge of God.
                        3. Fear of God within.
                And on God's part He was to forgive their sins and do them
                good. The purpose of the fear of God was "that they shall not
                depart from me." The purpose of the law within was to make
                them God's people. These were the very heart of the previous
                covenant and thus the very points of failure that brought it to
                an end. God had never intended them to succeed without this
                internal law, knowledge, and fear. God's words were to be in
                their hearts. Deut. 11:18. They were to obey with their heart
                and soul. Deut. 26:16. The law was to be kept in love to God.
                Deut. 11:22. It was not the provisions of the covenant, then,
                that would be new. These provisions were really a prediction
                that the new one would succeed where the other failed.
                   What, then, was to be new about the new covenant? It was
                new, first, because it was a reinstatement of the former cove-
                nant. A voided contract must be renegotiated to be valid. So
                with the covenant.

The Covenant LESSON 13                                                ❑ Friday
                                                                    December 26

       Part 6         Who was to come in the days of restoration?
        HEW            "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform
 COVENANT—II       that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel
                   and to the house of Judah. In those days, and at that time, will
                   I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David;
                   and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
                   In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
                   safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called,
                   The Lord our righteousness." Jer. 33:14-16.
                      Jeremiah did not record this promise in direct connection
                   with the new covenant, but both are given as features of the
                   time of the restoration of Judah. It is the coming of the Mes-
                   siah, here promised, that also makes the new covenant really
                   new. While the gospel was previously preached through sacri-
                   fices, the Messiah could now be expected on earth bringing
                   salvation in ways that His people could better understand.
                       "Christ's death and resurrection completed His covenant.
                   Before this time, it was revealed through types and shadows,
                   which pointed to the great offering to be made by the world's
                   Redeemer, offered in promise for the sins of the world. An-
                   ciently believers were saved by the same Saviour as now, but
                   it was a God veiled. They saw God's mercy in figures."—Ellen
                   G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 932.
                       "Lessons must be given to humanity in the language of hu-
                   manity. The Messenger of the covenant must speak. His voice
                   must be heard in His own temple. He, the author of truth, must
                    separate truth from the chaff of man's utterance, which had
                    made it of no effect. The principles of God's government and
                    the plan of redemption must be clearly defined. The lessons of
                    the Old Testament must be fully set before men."—Prophets
                   and Kings, p. 700.
                      What is the foremost promise of the new covenant? Jer.
                   31:34.
                      "The blessings of the new covenant are grounded purely on
                   mercy in forgiving unrighteousness and sins. The Lord specifies,
                   I will do thus and thus unto all who turn to Me, forsaking the
                   evil and choosing the good. 'I will be merciful to their unrigh-
                   teousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no
                   more.' All who humble their hearts, confessing their sins, will
                   find mercy and grace and assurance."—Ellen G. White Com-
