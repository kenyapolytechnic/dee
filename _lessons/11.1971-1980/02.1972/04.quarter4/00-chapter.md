         Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering
        December 30, 1972                 Euro-Africa Division
   With the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow for the fourth
quarter of 1972, our newest division, Euro-Africa, has plans for two
projects. The first is to establish the work of the church in the south
of Angola, founding a new mission station in the region of the great
Cuenene River. This is a section of the country where we have no
work at the present time; so we are praying for your liberality.
   The second project is to build a new hospital on the island of
Madagascar. Experience has taught us that our medical work can
give to the world both spiritual and physical healing. Because of
this unique characteristic it has been the hope of the Indian Ocean
Union Mission for many years to open medical work on the island
of Madagascar.
   The president of the Malagasy Republic has endorsed this project
by his personal donation of 50,000 Malagasy francs. This shows
that the Malagasy people do not expect to receive everything from
outside and are anxious to do their part. Land has been purchased
on a beautiful mountain site overlooking the city of Andapa in the
northern part of Madagascar. The hospital, although simple in struc-
ture, will be an honor to the cause of God. Already several Adventist
doctors and nurses are ready to serve. All is in readiness awaiting
the offering overflow that will make this dream come true.

                    FOURTH QUARTER, 1972

    It was the teaching that Jesus would soon come that bound together the
first Adventists under William Miller. The power of that doctrine motivated
the spiritual forebears of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to proclaim their
belief in the face of intense opposition and ridicule. It also motivated them
to a new way of life. Ellen White wrote that in her last meeting with her
childhood church she bore testimony that a new religious experience had come
to her "by the stirring truths concerning the personal appearing of Jesus."—
Life Sketches, page 46. The truth of the second advent motivated believers
in those early days to preach and to live the truth. Does it still have this same
power after 128 years?
    The Seventh-day Adventist Church, as a body, believes in the soon coming
of Jesus. It is assumed that the individual members hold that belief, for to be
an Adventist and not believe in the advent is such an apparent contradiction
that those who reject it would surely find fellowship elsewhere. The second
advent, as a doctrine, is secure in the church. But does it produce the same
motivation that was seen in the pioneer days? If it does not, this is the fault
of those who hold it and not of the teaching itself. Each individual church
member needs to recapture the sense of urgency to prepare for the advent and
to do the Lord's work that the pioneers had.
    The advent message was derived from the Scriptures. A recapture of the
fervor of the pioneers will come from the same source. The beliefs accepted
in past years tend to lose their brilliance in a believer's mind unless renewed
by fresh contact with the Word.
    What signs does the Bible give that Jesus is coming soon? What do those
signs mean? Are they still relevant after 128 years of advent wear? What
attitudes should those who await the advent have toward life, their fellow-
men, their Redeemer, and the advent itself? These are questions that we
propose you investigate during the fourth quarter of 1972. This adult quar-
 terly can provide direction for you in that study, but we hope that you will go
 beyond it. We hope that you will relearn the old truths, discover some new
ones, make them your own, and recapture the fervor of 1844. If that should
 happen on a large scale, we might see Jesus quicker than we think. "Even so,
come, Lord Jesus!"

          The Blessing of Daily Study
        "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
    ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
    mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
    comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
    tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in
    the lesson."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                           My Pledge
        As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
    of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
    prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
    lesson each day of the week.

              Part 1 ► What remarks of Jesus prompted the disciples' in-
      THE REDEEMER quiry about signs?
       Matt. 24:1, 2

                            "And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple:
                        and his disciples came to him for to shew him the build-
                        ings of the temple. And Jesus said unto them, See ye not
                        all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be
                        left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown
                        down."

                           "With the overthrow of Jerusalem the disciples associated
                        the events of Christ's personal coming in temporal glory to take
                        the throne of universal empire, to punish the impenitent Jews,
                        and to break from off the nation the Roman yoke. The Lord
                        had told them that He would come the second time. Hence at
                        the mention of judgments upon Jerusalem, their minds reverted
                        to that coming; and as they were gathered about the Saviour
                        upon the Mount of Olives, they asked: 'When shall these things
                        be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end
                        of the world?'"—The Great Controversy, page 25.

                        ► When Jesus completed His enumeration of the signs,
                        what did He say was their significance? Luke 21:28.



                           Where the disciples had been concerned about the end of
                        the world and the destruction of the temple, Jesus pointed out
                        to them that the signs He spoke of indicated the approach of
                        the moment of their redemption. Not that the temple would
                        be kept intact or that the world would not end, but the para-

              Part 2 ► What phrase did Peter use to describe the time when
      THE RESTORER Jesus will return?
       Acts 3:20, 21


                          "And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was
                       preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until
                       the times of restitution of all things, which God hath
                       spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the
                       world began."

                          At the fall of man humanity lost its God-given dominion
                       over the world. Gen. 1:26. Satan not only claimed man's do-
                       minion, but also usurped the place of the Creator and is referred
                       to by Paul as "the god of this world." 2 Cor. 4:4.
                          The dominion that Satan usurped is to be restored. This res-
                       titution has its beginning at the second advent, but is not com-
                       plete until the earth is renewed after the thousand years.
                          "The golden age—the restitution of all things:-1. Restitu-
                       tion means the setting up again of that which has been thrown
                       down.. . . 2. In the universe there has been a great overturning.
                       The course of history seems to be a succession of failures—God
                       setting up, some other power casting down. And, apart from
                       revelation we could not tell what the end of all things would
                       be."—The Biblical Illustrator, on Acts 3:21.
                       ►    What is the initial step in this restitution? Rom. 8:23.

                          "Christ assured the angels that by His death He would
                       ransom many, and would destroy him who had the power of
                       death. He would recover the kingdom which man had lost by
                       transgression, and the redeemed were to inheriC,it with Him,
                       and dwell therein forever. Sin and sinners would be blotted
                       out, nevermore to disturb the peace of heaven' or earth. He
                       bade the angelic host to be in accord with the plan that His
                       Father had accepted, and rejoice that, through His death,
                       fallen man could be reconciled to God."—Patriarchs and
                       Prophets, page 65.


 THINK IT THROUGH        For the individual Christian what restitution must pre-
                       cede the restitution of the body, nature, and dominion?

      THE LIFE-GIVER
     1 Thess. 4:16, 17
                            "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with
                         a shout with the voice of the archangel, and with the
                         trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then

                            "We have a living, risen Saviour. He burst the fetters of the
                         tomb after He had lain there three days, and in triumph He
                         proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, 'I am the resur-
                         rection and the life.' And He is coming. Are we getting ready
                         for Him? Are we ready so that if we shall fall asleep, we can
                         do so with hope in Jesus Christ? Are you laboring for the sal-
                         vation of your brothers and sisters? The Life-giver is soon to
                         come. The Life-giver is coming to break the fetters of the

                         '0 death, where is thy sting?' The last thing they acknowledged
                         was the pangs of death. When they awake the pain is all gone."

                         1:0- What unique power does Jesus possess? John 5:25-29.


                            The fact that Jesus has life in Himself is really the basis of
                         all redemption. He has the capacity to give this life to His
                         people. John 17:2. If He were not self-living and able to give
                         life to the dead, redemption through Him would have been
                         an impossibility and we would be "of all men most miserable."
                         1 Cor. 15:19.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Besides giving life to the dead what is the importance
                         of Jesus' self-living existence?

      Rev. 19:11, 16

                          "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse;
                       and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True,
                       and in righteousness he doth judge and make war." "And
                       he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,
                       KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."

                          "When Christ shall come to the earth again, not as a prisoner
                       surrounded by a rabble will men see Him. They will see Him
                       then as heaven's King. Christ will come in His own glory, in
                       the glory of His Father, and the glory of the holy angels. Ten

                       angels, the beautiful and triumphant sons of God, possessing
                       surpassing loveliness and glory, will escort Him on His way.
                       Then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory, and before
                       Him shall be gathered all nations. Then every eye shall see
                       Him, and they also that pierced Him. In the place of a crown
                       of thorns, He will wear a crown of glory,—a crown within a
                       crown. In place of that old purple kingly robe, He will be

                       can white them.' Mark 9:3. And on His vesture and on His
                       thigh a name will be written, `King of kings, and Lord of

                       Rev. 11:15.


                          The expression "King of kings" implies that Jesus is King
                       over other kings. He rules those who rule. "The title `Lord of
                       lords, and King of kings' is used in Scripture of Christ as He
                       returns to earth to vanquish the hosts of evil and to deliver
                       His loyal people."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 17:14.

                        me, to give every man according as his work shall be."

                        truth will enter in. A voice, richer than any music that ever
                        fell on mortal ear, will be heard saying, 'Come, ye blessed

                        foundation of the world.' Then the righteous will receive their
                        reward. Their lives will run parallel with the life of Jehovah.
                        They will cast their crowns at the Redeemer's feet, touch the

                        ► What is the reward of the righteous? Rev. 22:14. Of
                        the wicked? Rev. 22:15.



                           The expression "according as his work shall be" in the
                        context of Revelation 22 refers to just two kinds of works, good
                        or evil, and not to a gradation of rewards.
                           The reward is "according to" and not "because of" the works
                        that a person has done. At the time of Jesus' coming there
                        will be no sinful acts on record for the righteous, for their sins
                        have been forgiven and blotted out. Only the record of righ-
                        teous works remains. The record of the evil deeds of the lost
                        remains. Thus humanity is divided into two clean-cut groups,
                        each identified by their works, and reward comes in inclusion
                        or exclusion from the city. Thus, "All will 'be justified by their
                        faith and judged by their works."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 386.

            Part 6 ► By what term does Jesus refer to Himself in relation
  THE SON OF MAN to His return to earth?
       Matt. 24:30


                          "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
                       heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
                       and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds
                       of heaven with power and great glory."

                          Throughout the Gospels Jesus refers to Himself as the Son
                       of man, including the references to His advent. The One whose
                       coming we anticipate is not a being foreign to our world and
                       unfamiliar to us; but He is one of us, returning to gather His
                       brothers and sisters together.
                          "Those who share Christ's suffering and reproach now will
                       share His glory hereafter. He 'is not ashamed to call them
                       brethren.' His angels minister to them. His second appearing
                       will be as the Son of man, thus even in His glory identifying
                       Himself with humanity."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 230.

                       ► Speaking before Caiaphas, what position did Jesus
                       say that He, the Son of man, would one day occupy?
                       Matt. 26:64.



                           "As a man Christ ascended to heaven. As a man He is the
                        substitute and surety for humanity. As a man He liveth to
                        make intercession for us. He is preparing a place for all who
                        love Him. As a man He will come again with power and glory,
                        to receive His children."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

                         and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall
                         be overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed God,

   A NATION FAILS

      Dan. 5:22, 23       "And thou his son, 0 Belshazzar, hast not humbled
                       thine heart, though thou knewest all this; but hast lifted
                       up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have
                       brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou,
                       and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk
                       wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver,
                       and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see
                       not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy
                       breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not
                       glorified."

                           "Through the folly and weakness of Belshazzar, the grand-

                        He had known of his grandfather's banishment, by the decree
                        of God, from the society of men; and he was familiar with
                        Nebuchadnezzar's conversion and miraculous restoration. But
                        Belshazzar allowed the love of pleasure and self-glorification to
                        efface the lessons that he should never have forgotten. He
                        wasted the opportunities graciously granted him, and neglected
                        to use the means within his reach for becoming more fully
                        acquainted with truth. That which Nebuchadnezzar had finally
                        gained at the cost of untold suffering and humiliation, Bel-

                           How did God communicate the sentence on Belshazzar
                        and Babylon? Dan. 5:24-28.


                          "In that last night of mad folly, Belshazzar and his lords
                        had filled up the measure of their guilt and the guilt of the

                            The importance that one attaches to a message from another
                        is largely determined by how he views the person who sends
                        the message. If the message sender is regarded as insignificant,
                        the message will probably be regarded as insignificant also.
                        Only as God's greatness is understood will the importance of
                        His communication to men be appreciated.
                           "Why is so much attention given to human agencies, while
                        there is so little reaching up of the mind to the eternal God?
                        Why are those who claim to be children of the heavenly King

                        thought are given to the Creator of the heavens and the earth.
                        God calls upon His creatures to turn their attention from the
                        confusion and perplexity around them, and admire His handi-

     Matt. 24:4, 5, 11

                            "And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed
                         that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my
                         name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."
                         "And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive
                         many."

                            This statement of Jesus was directed primarily to the time
                         leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem and secondarily to
                         the time leading to the second advent. The signs for these two
                         events are blended in verses 4-20. Beginning in verse 21 the
                         prophecy relates specifically to Christ's return. See The Desire

                           "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not
                        surely die."

                        thou shalt surely die."

                          "Satan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive
                       the world. The foundation of his work was laid by the assur-
                       ance given to Eve in Eden: `Ye shall not surely die.' In the
                       day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye
                       shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.' . . . Little by little
                       he has prepared the way for his masterpiece of deception in the
                       development of spiritualism. He has not yet reached the full
                       accomplishment of his designs; but it will be reached in the
                       last remnant of time."—The Great Controversy, page 561.
                        ► Contrast the deceptive promise of the serpent and the
                        results of believing it. Gen. 3:4, 5, 19.



                           "The only one who promised Adam life in disobedience was
                        the great deceiver. And the declaration of the serpent to Eve
                        in Eden—We shall not surely die'—was the first sermon ever
                        preached upon the immortality of the soul. Yet this declaration,
                        resting solely upon the authority of Satan, is echoed from the
                        pulpits of Christendom and is received by the majority of
                        mankind as readily as it was received by our first parents.
                        The divine sentence, 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die' (Ezekiel
                        18:20), is made to mean: The soul that sinneth, it shall not
                        die, but live eternally. We cannot but wonder at the strange
                        infatuation which renders men so credulous concerning the
                        words of Satan and so unbelieving in regard to the words of

       ILLUSTRATION
         OF SATAN'S
          DECEPTION        "Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman
          1 Sam. 28:7   that hath a familiar spirit, that I go to her, and enquire
                        of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a
                        woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor."

                           "When Saul asked the medium to describe what she saw,
                        she replied, 'An old man cometh up; and he is covered with
                        a mantle.' But Saul actually saw nothing. The narrative de-
                        clares 'Saul perceived' (that is, believed with the mind) that
                        what this abandoned woman saw was Samuel. We do not
                        doubt that she saw something, but it certainly was not Samuel.
                        Is it likely that Samuel, the prophet of God and leader of the
                        nation, the man who during life vigorously condemned witch-
                        craft, would, even if such a thing were possible, come in answer
                        to the demands of a witch during her incantations at night?
                        Such a thing is unthinkable.
                           "The whole episode was plainly the work of evil angels. It is
                        evident that Saul received neither comfort nor assurance. The
                        next day this poor deceived man took his own life. One can
                        never contemplate that massive form bending over the upturned
                        sword of suicide without realizing the awful price he paid for
                        his willful disobedience. When he turned aside from the living
                        God and sought the counsel of mediums he was fighting against
                        God."—R. A. Anderson, Secrets of the Spirit World, pages 59,
                        60.
                           What was the result of Saul's spiritistic inquiry?
                        1 Chron. 10:13.


                          "By consulting that spirit of darkness Saul had destroyed
                        himself. . . . Separated from the Source of strength, he could
                        not lead the minds of Israel to look to God as their helper.

                            "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in
                        the power of his might." "Stand therefore, having your

                        God."

                           Each of the six parts of the Christian life, that Paul illus-
                        trates as pieces of armor, is related directly to the Christian's
                        mind. And the idea of deception assumes intelligence, for there
                        can be no deception without a mind to deceive. The mind of
                        every living human being will eventually either be committed
                        to truth or deceived. The only protection against the decep-
                        tions of Satan, now or future, is in truth, righteousness, the
                        gospel, faith, salvation, and the Spirit working through the
                        Word.

                            What did Jesus point to as protection against decep-
                        tion? Matt. 24:24, 25.



                           Jesus foretold the general nature of the deceptions that would
                        confront the world before His advent. Without revelation the
                        world would be helplessly deceived. With revelation the world's
                        people will have opportunity to choose between believing the
                        truth and believing a lie.

   TRIBULATION FOR       before His coming?
     CHRIST'S NAME
       Matt. 24:9, 10
                           "Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and
                         shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for
                         my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and
                         shall betray one another, and shall hate one another."

                            What is the reason for this hatred, by the world, of those
                         who follow Jesus? It is because the principle by which the
                         world lives and that by which Jesus and His followers live are
                         incompatible opposites. The self-centered principle of Satan
                         and the world leads men to resort to force. The principle of
                         love, or unselfishness, held by Jesus and His followers leaves
                         every person free to make his own decision.
                            "Between righteousness and sin, love and hatred, truth
                         and falsehood, there is an irrepressible conflict. When one
                         presents the love of Christ and the beauty of holiness, he is
                         drawing away the subjects of Satan's kingdom, and the prince
                         of evil is aroused to resist it. Persecution and reproach await
                         all who are imbued with the Spirit of Christ. The character of
                         the persecution changes with the times, but the principle—the
                         spirit that underlies it—is the same that has slain the chosen

                             "From Olivet the Saviour beheld the storms about to

                          His disciples could not then endure to look, and Jesus passed

                           "And he had power to give life unto the image of the
                        beast, that the image of the beast should both speak,
                        and cause that as many as would not worship the image
                        of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both
                        small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive
                        a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and
                        that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the
                        mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his
                        name."

                            "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in
                        all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall
                        the end come."

                           The gospel is the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ.
                        "Lift up Jesus, you that teach the people, lift Him up in
                        sermon, in song, in prayer. Let all your powers be directed to
                        pointing souls, confused, bewildered, lost, to 'the Lamb of
                        God.' Lift Him up, the risen Saviour, and say to all who hear,
                        Come to Him who 'bath loved us, and hath given Himself for
                        us.' Let the science of salvation be the burden of every sermon,
                        the theme of every song. Let it be poured forth in every
                        supplication. Bring nothing into your preaching to supplement
                        Christ, the wisdom and power of God. Hold forth the word
                        of life, presenting Jesus as the hope of the penitent and the
                        stronghold of every believer. Reveal the way of peace to the
                        troubled and the despondent, and show forth the grace and
                        completeness of the Saviour."—Gospel Workers, page 160.



                        I). By what method is the gospel of Jesus to be carried?

                           "God's appointed means of saving souls is through 'the fool-
                        ishness of preaching.' Though human, and compassed with the
                        frailties of humanity, men are God's messengers; and the dear
                        Saviour is grieved when so little is effected by their labors.
                        Every minister who goes out into the great harvest field should
                        magnify his office. He should not only seek to bring men to
                        the knowledge of the truth, but he should labor, as did Paul,
                        'warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom,'
                        that he may 'present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.'"—
                        Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 300.
                           Contrast this loving persuasion with the persecution by Satan
                        and his followers.

              Part 5      How widespread and particular is the last preaching
         UNIVERSAL of the gospel to be?
           WITNESS
          Rev. 14:6;
         Matt. 24:14     "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
                     having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that
                     dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred,

                        before those who are without God and without hope in the

                        From door to door His servants are to proclaim the message
                        of salvation. To every nation, kindred, tongue, and people the

                           Note that the preaching of the gospel is coextensive with the
                        hatred of the world for Jesus' followers.

                        has been rejected. There are many who have never had an

          Rev. 18:1, 4     "And after these things I saw another angel come
                        down from heaven, having great power; and the earth
                        was lightened with his glory." "And I heard another
                        voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people,
                        that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive
                        not of her plagues."

                             "The Lord God of heaven will not send upon the world His
                          judgments for disobedience and transgression until He has sent
                         His watchmen to give the warning. He will not close up the
                         period of probation until the message shall be more distinctly
                         proclaimed. The law of God is to be magnified; its claims must
                         be presented in their true, sacred character, that the people
                         may be brought to decide for or against the truth. Yet the work
                         will be cut short in righteousness. The message of Christ's righ-
                         teousness is to sound from one end of the earth to the other
                         to prepare the way of the Lord. This is the glory of God, which
                         closes the work of the third angel."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 19.

                         power,' and the earth is to be 'lightened with his glory.' The

                             This prophecy was written by Amos as part of a larger
                         prophecy, including all of chapter 8, that deals with the cap-

                         and the moon shall not cause her light to shine."
                            In yesterday's section of the lesson the relation between
                         prophecies of doom and celestial signs was noted. The prophets
                         often refer to these days of judgment as "the day of the Lord,"
                         as does Isaiah in the above reference.
                            "This expression occurs at least 20 times in the writings of
                         the various OT prophets. It is always used in reference to a
                         time of divine judgment upon a city or nation (rather than
                         upon individuals), or eventually upon the inhabitants of the
                         whole world....
                            " 'The day of the Lord' against Judah (see Isa. 2:12 ; Joel
                         1:15; 2:1; Zeph. 1:7) was thus the day when, as a nation, it
                         was no longer permitted to continue on in its reprobate course
                         and divine judgment was meted out against it (see Eze. 12 :21-
                         28). . . . What happens to a city or to an entire nation when
                         `the day of the Lord' comes to it is similar to what will happen
                         to the whole world at the close of its probation. . . . Thus,

                         upon the world as a whole, and an OT prophetic description
                         of the fate of some ancient city or nation in terms of 'the day
                         of the Lord' applies also in principle to 'the great day of the

Matt. 24:29, first part      "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall
                          the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
                          light."

                             Jesus "mentioned certain events to precede His coming, and
                          fixed the time when the first of these should be witnessed: 'In
                          those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened,
                          and the moon shall not give her light.' Mark 13:24. The 1260
                          days, or years, terminated in 1798. A quarter of a century
                          earlier, persecution had almost wholly ceased. Following this
                          persecution, according to the words of Christ, the sun was to
                          be darkened. On the 19th of May, 1780, this prophecy was

                             The dark day and the falling of the stars are occurrences
                          that are so well-known among Seventh-day Adventists that
                          one may question the wisdom of including them here. The pur-
                          pose is to look at them anew in the light of related Old Testa-
                          ment texts. They are thus seen, not as merely unusual happen-
                          ings that foretell the advent of Jesus, but as events that bristle
                          with meaning imparted by their Old Testament antecedents
                          and that give an eschatological quality to our own life time.

            AND THE of heaven with power and great glory."
       FALLING STARS
          Matt. 24:30   The darkened sun and accompanying manifestations, which
                        were related to the day of the Lord in the Old Testament,
                        Jesus now relates to His coming again. The conclusion is in-
                        escapable that Jesus regards His second advent as the day of
                        the Lord for the whole world. But He does not say that the
                        day of His coming will be black or sunless, as some of the
                        prophets described the day of the Lord, but that a sunless day
                        will precede His coming. Thus that which was used in the Old
                        Testament as a description of the day of the Lord itself is in
                        the New Testament used as a sign preceding the day of the
                        Lord to indicate that it is approaching. As the day of the Lord
                        was the moment of defeat of a city or nation, so the coming
                        day of the Lord is the day of defeat and surrender of those
                        in the world who have rebelled against God.
                            The Old Testament signs in the stars are stated only as
                        nonvisibility. This clearly relates to the darkness of the day of
                        the Lord and not to the falling of the stars. The meteoric
                        shower is a prophecy of Jesus and John (Rev. 6:12, 13) that
                        has no Old Testament precedent, but by its close textual con-
                        nection with the dark day has precisely the same meaning.
                            The dark day and the falling stars declared dramatically and
                        nonverbally the same awesome message that Zephaniah enun-
                        ciated concerning Judah. "The great day of the Lord is near,
                        it is near, and hasteth greatly." Zeph. 1:14, first part. That
                        message was fulfilled within the lifetime of men who heard
                        it. More time than that has passed since 1780 and 1833, but
                        then it is a much more awesome event toward which they point
                        than the captivity of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar.

 THINK IT THROUGH          What significance do you see in the proximity of 1780
                        and 1833 to the close of two prophetic periods?

                       that Jesus stated in His prophecies given in response to the

                       His return.
                          Some persons question the relevancy of these celestial signs

                       many instances neither in their lifetime nor in the part of the

                          The great events of the plan of salvation have always had
                       meaning to those who knew about them and not merely to
                       those who lived in the time and place that they occurred. It
                       is our knowledge of the dark day and falling stars, made clear
                       and distinct by the Holy Spirit, that can make relevant to the

                           We live after the signs of darkness and meterorites, and not
                       before them. That can be no more irrelevant to the Christian

                             Ellen G. White points out that the individuals described here
                         are not worldlings who make no profession of religion. Rather
                         they are the professing Christians, whose names are on the

                            How did Paul indicate that moral conditions would
                         deteriorate as the end of time approaches? 2 Tim. 3:13.

                          character of the child of God. In view of this fact, Peter, Paul,

                          things first. We must give attention to developing a character
                          which will stand in the judgment, one that, when weighed in

      Matt. 24:32, 33

                            "Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch
                         is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that

                         ► What is the purpose of the signs as revealed by this
                         parable?


                             "Christ has given signs of His coming. He declares that we
                          may know when He is near, even at the doors. He says of
                          those who see these signs, 'This generation shall not pass, till

                         should be remembered that the promises and threatenings of

                         ► How did Jesus add meaning to the word "near"?
                         Matt. 24:34.


                            This prophecy was fulfilled in relation to the destruction of
                         Jerusalem. The city was destroyed in the lifetime of those who
                         saw the signs. Interpretation becomes a problem when we seek
                         the meaning of verse 34 in connection with the second advent.

         CERTAINTY the second advent?
         Matt. 24:35


                          "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words
                       shall not pass away."

                          "The prophecies which the great I AM has given in His

                       today in the procession of the ages and what may be expected
                       in the time to come. All that prophecy has foretold as coming
                       to pass, until the present time, has been traced on the pages of
                       history, and we may be assured that all which is yet to come
                       will be fulfilled in its order."—Prophets and Kings, page 536.
                          "It [the coming of the Lord] will not tarry past the time
                       that the message is borne to all nations, tongues, and peoples.
                       Shall we who claim to be students of prophecy forget that
                       God's forbearance to the wicked is a part of the vast and merci-
                       ful plan by which he is seeking to compass the salvation of
                       souls?"—Evangelism, page 697.

                       ► What expression of the certainty of the advent does
                       Paul give? Heb. 10:36, 37.



                          "The lapse of time has brought great changes. Light has
                       increased and has become widespread. While the people who
                       are anxious for truth have been calling, 'Watchman, what of
                       the night?' the answer has been given intelligently, 'The morn-
                       ing cometh, and also the night.' By a thorough investigation
                       of the prophecies we understand where we are in this world's
                       history; and we know for a certainty that the second coming

     UNKNOWN DAY
      Matt. 24:36-39
                           "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not
                        the angels of heaven, but my Father only. But as the days
                        of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man
                        be. For as in the days that were before the flood they
                        were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in mar•
                        riage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and
                        knew not until the flood came, and took them all away;
                        so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."

                           The purpose of the signs which Jesus gave was to reveal the
                        approach of the second advent, but the precise time of Hie
                        appearance was to remain unknown. As the time of arrival of
                        the Flood was unknown to the antedeluvians, so no one know;
                        the day and hour of the second advent. "Again and again have
                        I been warned in regard to time-setting. There will never again
                        be a message for the people of God that will be based on time
                        We are not to know the definite time either for the outpouring
                        of the Holy Spirit or for the coming of Christ."—Ellen G

        WATCHING        counsel does Jesus give?
          REQUIRED
      Matt. 24:40-42
                           "Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken,
                        and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the
                        mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Watch
                        therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
                        come."

                           Jesus continues the thought of men not knowing the time
                        of the advent in the two brief illustrations of two persons work-
                        ing together, and also introduces the idea of a judgment—one
                        taken and one left.
                           In the absence of knowledge about the time of an important
                        event, the logical course is to watch for it. When an important
                        personage travels in a motorcade through a city, the precise
                        time of the arrival of the motorcade at any point is unknown.
                        People line the route and watch for the arrival of the important
                        personage. To go shopping and fail to watch is to miss the
                        parade.
                           "Jesus has told His disciples to 'watch,' but not for a
                        definite time. His followers are to be in the position of those
                        who are listening for the orders of their Captain; they are
                        to watch, wait, pray, and work, as they approach the time for
                        the coming of the Lord; but no one will be able to predict just
                        when that time will come; for 'of that day and hour knoweth
                         no man.' You will not be able to say that He will come in one,
                        two, or five years, neither are you to put off His coming by
                        stating that it may not be for ten or twenty years."—Evan-
                        gelism, page 221.
                        116.- With what does Jesus contrast watching? Mark 13:35,
                        36.


                            "The attitude of watching is to designate the church as
                         God's people indeed. By this sign the waiting ones are dis-
                         tinguished from the world and show that they are pilgrims

                           "But know this, that if the goodman of the house had
                        known in what watch the thief would come, he would
                        have watched, and would not have suffered his house
                        to be broken up."

                           The householder had no information that a thief was com-
                        ing, and one doesn't stay awake at night watching for a thief
                        he doesn't expect. But Jesus had said (verse 33) that it could
                        be known that He was coming and when He was near. The
                        lesson is by contrast. If the householder had as much informa-
                        tion about the thief as the believer has about Christ's advent,
                        he would have watched. It is prudent for the believer to watch.

                           "The solemn fact is to be kept not only before the people
                        of the world, but before our own churches also, that the day
                        of the Lord will come suddenly, unexpectedly. The fearful
                        warning of the prophecy is addressed to every soul. Let no
                        one feel that he is secure from the danger of being surprised.
                        Let no one's interpretation of prophecy rob you of the convic-

                           The signs show that advent near, but since the day is un-
                       known and the hour will be unexpected, Jesus says that watch-
                       ing and readiness are essential. The signs were all that the dis-
                       ciples requested, but Jesus taught that there must be a personal

                       Christ's righteousness alone can avail for his salvation, and this

         TEACHING meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and
        Matt. 25:1-4 five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps,
                        and took no oil with them: but the wise took oil in their
                        vessels with their lamps."

                       ► Whom do the ten virgins and the bridegroom repre-
                       sent? To answer this question note the circumstances of
                       these persons in Matt. 25:1, 6 and then find these same
                       circumstances in Matthew 24 and note what persons are
                       mentioned in relation to them.



                       la- What is the key feature of this parable? Matt. 25: 3, 4.



                           While all of the persons, articles, and circumstances in the
                        parable are essential to its understanding, the central feature is
                        the oil. The main thrust of teaching in the parable derives from
                        the circumstance of having or not having oil. To have oil is
                        wise; to lack oil is foolish. To have oil results in reception into
                        the wedding; to lack oil results in rejection by the master of
                        the feast. To have oil is to be ready; to lack oil is to be
                        unready. It follows then that the key question of interpreta-
                        tion of the parable is, "What does the oil mean?" To this
                        question we will direct our study tomorrow.
                           During this week we shall study this central core of truth—
                        the relation between what the oil represents and readiness for
                        the advent. This was the main thought which Jesus presented.
                        There are valuable secondary ideas in the parable, but these
                        will not be the content of this week's lesson.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Read Matt. 25:1-12 several times, learn the details of
                        the parable, and reflect on it, in the light of Matthew 24.

             THE OIL     I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with
       Zech. 4:2, 3, 6   a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon,
                         and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the
                         top thereof: and two olive trees by it, one upon the right
                         side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof."
                         "Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is
                         the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by
                         might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of
                         hosts."

                            When Zechariah inquired the meaning of the vision of
                         lamps fed with oil from olive trees, he was given the straight-
                         forward message that Zerubbabel, leader of Judah, would suc-
                         ceed by God's Spirit.
                            In the Israelite sanctuary service a special anointing oil was
                         used for consecration of the tabernacle, furniture, and priests.
                         Everything touched by this oil was symbolically holy. See
                         Ex. 30:25-30. It is the Holy Spirit that makes men and places
                         holy.
                            The oil in the parable is "the informing Spirit of God which
                         prompts the works and quickens the faith, of which Spirit oil

                         Bow Another approach to interpreting the meaning of oil
                         is to ask, What is there that holds a central place in
                         Christian living equal to the place held by oil in the
                         experience of the ten virgins? Rom. 8:14-17.


 THINK IT THROUGH           What is the role of the Spirit in the Christian life?
                         Since the oil is the Spirit, and the parable is for those
                         awaiting the advent, what is the implication for me?

      OIL IN LAMPS ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to
        Matt. 25:1; meet the bridegroom."
        Ps. 119:105     "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto
                     my path."

                          This word of God represented by the lamp is related to the
                       Bible, but it has a more specific meaning. The oil is in the
                       lamp. The oil is God's Spirit. The Spirit is not in inanimate
                       things, such as books, but abides in people. "Through the Holy
                       Spirit, God's word is a light as it becomes a transforming
                       power in the life of the receiver."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                       page 414. The only way the Scriptures become a lighted lamp
                       is for the Christian to receive their teachings by the Holy
                       Spirit's aid and by the help of the same Spirit live the Word's
                       principles in the daily life.

                       ► By what means does the believer understand the truth
                       God has revealed? 1 Cor. 2:12.



                         "The more closely we adhere to the simplicity of truth, the
                       more surely do we comprehend its deep meaning. Then if the
                       heart is under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, it can say,
                       `The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understand-
                       ing to the simple' (Ps. 119:130). This means the word is inter-
                       preted by the Holy Spirit, not merely as perused by the student.
                          "It is not the mere letter of the words which gives the light
                       and the understanding, but the Word is in a special manner
                       written upon the heart, applied by the Holy Spirit."—Ellen
                       G. White, In Heavenly Places, page 139.

                       ►    What is the meaning of an unlighted lamp?




 THINK IT THROUGH          How can I receive a "supply" of the Holy Spirit which
                       is adequate to maintain the light of the Word in my life?

              Part 4       "While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and
     OIL AND CRISIS     slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold,
        Matt. 25:5-9    the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all
                        those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the
                        foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
                        lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, saying, Not
                        so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye
                        rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves."

                           All ten girls started out with lighted lamps—that is, a life
                        apparently in harmony with the Bible and led by the Spirit.
                        Outwardly the same, they were inwardly dissimilar.
                           The difference was in the quantity of oil that each group
                        had, that is, the extent to which each was indwelt by the
                        Spirit.
                           It was noted in yesterday's study that the lighted lamp
                        represented a believer living out the principles of the Bible by
                        the Spirit's aid. The foolish virgins, then, must represent those
                        who do not continue to live by the Word and the Spirit, but
                        have retained the form of religious faith, as evidenced by the
                        nearly empty lamp.
                           In the parable the oil could not be obtained quickly enough
                        to benefit the foolish virgins. Since this is speaking of human
                        experience with the Spirit, it teaches us that when the Spirit
                        of God has been neglected He cannot be quickly reaccepted.
                        Not because the Spirit is unwilling to return, but because
                        human character becomes set and a person cannot in a moment
                        change that which a lifetime of neglect has made him. Readi-
                        ness for the advent must be perpetual—not a last-minute,
                        frantic search for the grace of God.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Why did the wise virgins not share their supply of oil
                        with those whose lamps were going out? Answer from
                        the standpoint of spiritual experience. See Ezek. 14:14.

                         The five wise virgins went into the wedding because they
                      had oil in reserve to refill their lamps. The believer will be
                      ready for the advent because he has permitted the Holy Spirit
                      to fill him and accomplish a deep and lasting work beyond
                      that which was necessary to make him appear to men to be
                      a Christian.
                         It was because the five foolish virgins lacked oil that they
                      were not present when the wedding began. This represents
                      professed believers who, lacking the Holy Spirit, will be ex-

                       lesson in three ways—grace, Spirit, and the righteousness of
                       Christ. This is not contradictory. It is expressive of three ways
                       of looking at God's work for man. It is the oil of grace because
                       the Spirit is undeserved; it is the oil of the Spirit because the
                       Spirit is the direct means by which salvation is accomplished;
                       it is the oil of the righteousness of Christ because the Spirit's

                       imparting, Christ's character to the believer. "The Holy Spirit

                           This parable teaches that it is foolish to neglect to be filled
                       with the Spirit by faith in Jesus Christ, for it will result in
                       exclusion from the kingdom; it is wise to have faith in Jesus
                       Christ and thus be filled with the Spirit, for it will result in
                       acceptance into the kingdom.

                        reason for discharge from duty. To have increase is to have

              Part 2 D What business of Jesus Christ was placed in the hands
     THE MEANING of His servants just before His ascension?
   OF THE TALENTS
Mark 1:14, 15; 16:15
                          "Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came
                      into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
                      and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God
                      is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."
                          "And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and
                      preach the gospel to every creature."


                          As it was the business of the man in the parable to invest
                       money, so it is the business of Jesus Christ to preach the gospel
                       to the people of this world. As the master went on a journey,
                       so Jesus has gone to His Father. As the master returned, so
                       will Jesus return. But what is the equivalent in experience of
                       the talents in the parable?
                          The talents of the parable should not be confused with the
                       present-day usage of talent as ability. The talents given to the
                       servants were money. A worker today working at minimum
                       wage would earn about $75,000 in the time that a worker in
                       the first century would earn the equivalent of one talent. Thus,
                       even the man with one talent was given a considerable sum of
                       money. The man with five talents received a sum equivalent to
                       about $375,000. These talents, money, were the medium through
                       which the servants conducted the master's business.

                          "The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent
                       especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit."

                          In this week's lesson we will study this main idea of the
                       parable—the Holy Spirit and the cooperation of the believer in
                       doing the work of the gospel.

                       activity?

              Part 3    IP-What determined the amount of money entrusted to
  THE DISTRIBUTION      each servant?
   OF THE TALENTS
     Matt. 25:14, 15
                            "For the kingdom of heaven is- as a man travelling
                        into a far country, who called his own servants, and de-
                        livered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five
                        talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man
                        according to his several ability; and straightway took
                        his journey."

                           If the talents were interpreted as representing human abili-
                        ties, a problem is created: The talents were distributed accord-
                        ing to ability, which would then be saying that each man re-
                        ceives ability according .to his ability. Such a statement has
                        no meaning. But are not human abilities the means of preaching
                        the gospel? Yes, but only partially.
                           "The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents rep-
                        resented in the parable. It includes all gifts and endowments,
                        whether original or acquired, natural or spiritual. All are to be
                        employed in Christ's service. In becoming His dgaiiles, we
                        surrender ourselves to Hihi with all that we are and have.
                        These gifts He returns to us purified and ennobled, to be used
                         for His glory in blessing our fellow men."—Christ's Object
                        Lessons, page 328.
                            From the above quotation it becomes clear that it is neces-
                        sary to think of two kinds of abilities—the natural abilities
                         that one possesses as a human being and the human abilities
                         that are sanctified by the Holy Spirit. The talents do not rep-
                         resent the human ability that every person in the world has.
                         This is a parable of servants of Jesus Christ whose human
                         ability has been surrendered to Him. He sanctifies this ability
                         by the Holy Spirit and returns it to the Christian believer to be
                         used in doing His work. To receive talents according to ability
                         then must mean that the amount of sanctified ability that a
                         person receives is equal to the amount of natural ability that
                         he possesses.

 THINK IT THROUGH          What is sanctified ability? How does it differ from
                         human, natural ability?

     OF THE TALENTS
      Matt. 25:16-18
                             "Then he that had received the five talents went and
                         traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
                         And likewise he that had received two, he also gained
                         other two. But he that had received one went and digged
                         in the earth, and hid his lord's money."

                             The parable here teaches us that in doing the work of
                         Christ with sanctified ability there is an increase of sanctified
                         ability. This is possible not only because from a human stand-
                         point "practice makes perfect," but because the human being
                         and the Holy Spirit are in cooperation. Thus there is power
                         from outside of man working in him to make him more com-
                         petent in Christ's work than he was at the beginning or could
                         ever become by his own unaided effort.
                             The man who hid his money in the earth is not a world-
                         ling. He is one who has surrendered his life to Christ, or he
                         would have received no talent. Christ has worked in his life,
                         but his problem is that he did not continue by cooperating with
                         the Spirit in doing Christ's work. There was no increase. The
                         money was hid in the earth for safekeeping. His sanctified
                         ability was absorbed by the world, and not by the kingdom
                         of Jesus Christ. And the world's methods cannot increase sanc-
                         tified ability.

 THINK IT THROUGH           What is the responsibility of the person for the in-
                         crease of the abilities God has given?

             Part 5        "After a long time the lord of those servants cometh,
  THE ACCOUNTING        and reckoneth with them. And so he that had received
      FOR TALENTS       five talents came and brought other five talents, saying,
     Matt. 25:19-21     Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have
                        gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto
                        him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast
                        been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler
                        over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."
                        (Read also Matt. 25:22-28.)

                            The return of the master corresponds to the return of Jesus
                        at the unknown time. What each servant presents to the master
                        is the initial gift and the increase of sanctified ability. In actual
                        experience this has been accomplished through the Spirit, and
                        it is this fact that makes the subsequent welcome into the king-
                        dom the result of righteousness by faith. "All that He claims
                        from us we through divine grace can render."—Christ's Object
                        Lessons, page 362.
                            "It is the faithfulness, the loyalty to God, the loving sskylce,
                        that wins the divine approval. Every impulse of the -Holy
                        Spirit leading men to goodness and to God, is noted in the
                        books of heaven, and in the day of God the workers through
                        whom He has wrought will be commended."—Ibid., p. 361.
                            The man without increase did everything from a self-centered
                        viewpoint. He was not concerned for his master's business, but
                        for his own standing with the master. To use Christ's gifts
                        selfishly is a contradiction. But the one-talent servant tried to
                        overcome the contradiction by stressing preservation of his
                        ability instead of increase; his work, instead of the Spirit's
                        work in him. On this basis he was seeking the kingdom by
                        self-righteousness, and the master excluded him.

 THINK IT THROUGH           What is the relationship between the work for the
                        Master and acceptance into the kingdom? Think care-
                        fully.

               Part 6       "Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto

                             This text may sound puzzling, but if interpreted in the con-
                         text it is clear. That which the faithful servants had which the
                         unfaithful had not was increase of money. All who had an
                         increase were given rewards. The one without increase to all
                         intents and purposes had nothing at all, for the results to the
                         master were the same as if he had had nothing. From the stand-
                         point of Christian experience there is a sense in which he never
                         even had the one talent. He never made it his own by use. He
                         was so loosely attached to the sanctified ability that it can be
                         said he didn't have it; but it had been given to him, and so
                         it can also be said that he did have it.
                             This parable teaches us that faithful watching for the advent
                         is self-development through the Spirit to God's glory, and it
                         will result in eternal life; unfaithful watching for the advent
                         is neglect of self-development through the Spirit to God's glory,

                        as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats."

                            The event pictured here is the second coming of Jesus. A
                        decision as to who is redeemed has previously been made in the
                        investigative judgment, but it is at His appearing that the deci-
                        sion is carried out. This is not the judgment at the close of the
                        millennium, because that is the judgment of the wicked only.
                        It is at the second coming that the separation of the redeemed
                        from the unredeemed takes place, with the redeemed accom-

                            Christ is the Shepherd of the whole world—of the sheep and
                        the goats. The parable of the bridesmaids and the parable of
                        the talents dealt with two kinds of Christians. The parable of
                        the judgment scene represents the whole world, thus presenting
                         just two basic kinds of people. Therefore the rejected "Chris-
                         tians" in the two previous parables are shown to belong with
                        the goats—the world's total unredeemed population.

                         sheep in the parable? Matt. 25:35, 36, 40.


                            The persons represented as sheep are loving persons. They
                         not only feel concern for those in need, but supply the need.
                         Thus love is seen to be active. It is this active concern for the
                         temporal and eternal welfare of the fellowman that is the char-
                         acteristic of the redeemed. "When the nations are gathered

                            Love is the root both of God's character and of His inten-
                         tion for the character of man. When men love God and their
                         fellowmen, it is evidence that He is succeeding in His work
                         within them by the Holy Spirit. The parable of the judgment
                         scene presents basically the same truth that Paul teaches in
                         1 Corinthians 13.

                          As those who have done loving deeds are accepted, so those
                       who have neglected to do loving deeds are rejected. The doers
                       are lovers, and the non-doers are self-seekers. These have fol-
                       lowed the principle of Lucifer, who sought his own exaltation.
                       Those on Christ's left hand are not accused of crimes and foul
                       deeds. They may or may not have been guilty of these, but
                       that is a secondary consideration. The basic motivating power
                       of their lives has been selfishness, and they are rejected in the
                        judgment because they have not a loving character like that -
                       of Christ. Their ministry has been to self and not to others.
                          "Only when selfishness is dead, when strife for supremacy is
                       banished, when gratitude fills the heart, and love makes fragrant

                        are many kinds of temporal work to be done for God. An
                       unbeliever would do this work mechanically, for the wages he
                        receives. He does not know the joy of cooperation with the
                        Master Worker. There is no spirituality in the work of him

                        his life. Such a one may receive praise from men, but not from
                        God. Those who are truly united with Christ do not work for

                         ye did it not to me."

                             Christ's reference to brethren in verse 40 does not indicate
                         that His close identity is only with believers. "But not to any
                         class is Christ's love restricted. He identifies Himself with every
                         child of humanity. That we might become members of the
                         heavenly family, He became a member of the earthly family.
                         He is the Son of man, and thus a brother to every son and
                        daughter of Adam. His followers are not to feel themselves
                        detached from the perishing world around them. They are a
                         part of the great web of humanity; and Heaven looks upon
                         them as brothers to sinners as well as to saints. The fallen, the
                        erring, and the sinful, Christ's love embraces; and every deed
                        of kindness done to uplift a fallen soul, every act of mercy, is
                        accepted as done to Him."—The Desire of Ages, page 638.
                            It is this identity of Jesus with human beings that makes
                         justification possible to those who choose to identify themselves
                        with Christ.
                            "When this intimacy of connection and communion [faith]
                        is formed, our sins are laid upon Christ ; His righteousness is
                        imputed to us. He was made sin for us that we might be made

                        through Him; we are accepted in the Beloved. Whoever by
                        word or deed injures a believer thereby wounds Jesus. Whoever

                            Those on Christ's left hand are lost because they have never
                        identified themselves with Christ. Those on the right hand are
                        redeemed and their concerns and Christ's concerns coincide. This

                                                                       December 7

                      punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."

                          The rewards given to the "sheep and the goats" are based on
                       what each is. Jesus calls the sheep the "blessed of my Father"
                       because under God's blessing of grace they have developed
                       characters like the Father's. The work they do is in harmony
                       with the Father's work, and taey work from the same loving,
                       selfless motivation. They enter the kingdom because the prin-
                       ciples of the kingdom are within them. They belong to it.
                          The "goats" are pronounced cursed instead of blessed be-
                       cause they are in their own existence a curse. Self is their
                       center, and the needs of others are neglected. Having refused
                       God's grace, they have developed characters like those of the
                       devil and his angels. The work they do is in harmony with the
                       devil's work, and they work from the same selfish, rebellious
                       motivation. They are excluded from the kingdom because they
                       have rejected the principles of the kingdom, love for God and
                       man. They would be misfits in heaven and would start a new
                       rebellion.
                          None of those in either group recognize their actions as hav-
                       ing been done to Christ. It appears that this aspect of the
                       parable shows that human beings do not comprehend the close,
                       intimate attachment of Jesus to the people of this world.

 THINK IT THROUGH          How does righteousness by faith harmonize with the
                        picture of actions and rewards in this parable?

                              In the parable of the judgment scene Jesus gave a preview
                          of what will happen at the judgment. But the judgment is a
                          review of each human being's life. In this parable Jesus ties
                          the human actions of today to the events in connection with
                          the second advent. The central thrust of the parable, then, is
                          not only a revelation of a future event, but a portrayal of how
                          to live in the present in preparation for the judgment.
                              How shall men await Christ's appearing and the judgment?

                          of the Master that the parable of the talents taught was to be
                          done faithfully. It is an enlargement on the meaning of watch-
                          ing.
                              A review of the meanings of the three parables of Matthew
                          25 can be instructive. The parable of the bridesmaids teaches
                          the relation of the Christian, the Word, and the Spirit to readi-
                          ness. The parable of the talents teaches the relation of doing
                          the Master's work faithfully, through the Spirit, to watchful-
                          ness. The description of the judgment scene teaches that the
                          content of Christ's work was loving ministry to needy persons.
                          The total impact of these three parables is that the Christian
                          is to live his life—spiritually, vocationally, socially—in refer-
                          ence to the second coming of Jesus Christ.

 THINK IT THROUGH             How do these parables relate to the development of
                          a last generation?

                                     DELAY OF THE ADVENT

the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dis-

                           A prominent feature of the parable of the two servants is the
                        delay of the householder. There is nothing said of delay in
                        connection with the faithful servant. He was faithfully doing
                        his duty and constantly watching for the return of the master.
                        He waited as long as the wicked servant. He was a servant, and
                        the date of the master's return was not his business. The wicked
                        servant reasoned that 'the master's staying away beyond the
                        time of his expected return proved that he would stay away
                        longer still. Delay in the past led him to assume that there
                        would be delay in 'the future; and that was his undoing. Past
                        delay speaks only of the past, not of the future.

                        in white. Each carries a lighted lamp and a small flagon for
                        oil. All are anxiously watching for the appearance of the bride-
                        groom. But there is a delay. Hour after hour passes; the
                        watchers become weary and fall asleep. At midnight the cry is
                        heard, 'Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.'
                        The sleepers, suddenly awaking, spring to their feet. They see
                        the procession moving on, bright with 'torches and glad with
                        music. They hear the voice of the bridegroom and the voice

                            The prophetic setting of Rev. 7:1-3 is the period before the
                         close of probation. The winds of destruction are ready to blow,
                         but heavenly agencies hold them back. The signs of the advent
                         are, in general, the worsening conditions of our world previous

                         is a delay in the increasing intensity of the signs.
                            The delay pictured here is not because the forces of destruc-

          DELAY IN winds presented in Revelation 7?
           SEALING
          Rev. 7:1-3

                          "And after these things I saw four angels standing
                       on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds
                       of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth,
                       nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel
                       ascending from the east, having the seal of the living
                       God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels,
                       to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, say-
                       ing, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till
                       we have sealed the servants of our God in their fore-
                       heads."

                          The relation in this prophecy between the holding of the
                       winds and the sealing work implies that evil potentially comes
                       to fruition before righteousness. God's people are not ready
                       to be sealed when the winds of destruction are ready to blow.
                       "The soul is to take the impression of the Spirit of God and
                       retain the image of Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                       Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 970. The seal is "the sign of the
                       cross of Calvary in the Lord's adopted sons and daughters."—
                       Ibid., p. 968.
                          The central focus of delay is on the sealing work, and the
                       sealing has to do with the spiritual condition of the people of
                       God. It is not that we are today waiting for more last-day
                       events so that the advent can take place. The wait is for the
                       "servants of our God" to surrender themselves fully to the
                       Spirit, to accept fully the self-sacrificing way of life shown by
                       Jesus on Calvary and made possible for them by faith in Him
                       so that the sealing can be accomplished. It is for a spiritual
                       reason that the advent is delayed, and not for a political, social,
                       or naturalistic reason. It is when the sealing is finished that the
                       winds of strife are released and the last events take place.

                            "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some
                        men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not
                        willing that any should perish, but that all should come
                        to repentance."

                           "God is long-suffering, not willing that any should perish;
                        but His forbearance has a limit, and when the boundary is
                        past, there is no second probation. His wrath will go forth and
                        He will destroy without remedy.

                           "Any apparent delay in the Lord's coming is due to God's
                        unwillingness to close the door of salvation while there is hope

                           Peter assures us that while God is long-suffering for the
                        sinners' sake, yet the advent is certain. The apostle's thought
                        of God's delay in the past combined with the certainty of His
                        future coming is an expression of His character. In mercy He
                        has delayed; but because He is just, Christ will surely come.
 THINK IT THROUGH           The delay in the advent results in sin continuing
                        longer, thus more sorrow and unhappiness than might
                        have been if Christ had come sooner. How do you recon-

                         emerges victorious from all manner of trials, only to go down

                            The call to awake is twice repeated. In the first instance, the
                         prophet appealed to God to awake and come to the aid of His
                         chosen ones. Had He not done wonderful things for them? The
                         Red Sea had been opened up, and food had been given from
                         heaven for forty years. All through their history the Israelites
                         had been preserved from a thousand dangers because of the

                         to overthrow them.
                            Then the Lord called for His people to awake. It was not
                         God who was slumbering, but the people who needed to arouse.
                         They had a work to do in preparation for God's action. Thus

                            The Christian must not take either of two dangerous theories.
                         One says, "Jesus paid it all. There is nothing for me to do. He
                         has fought the battle and won the victory; so all I need to do
                         is say I believe in Him. Jesus wants me in the kingdom. If He
                         wants me there, I will be there regardless of what I do." The
                         other says, "It all depends on me. I must fight the good fight
                         of faith. I must keep the commandments. Jesus wants me in
                         the kingdom, but He expects me to work for it."
                            Both of these are extreme positions and must be rejected. It
                         is only when divine power is united with human effort that the
                         victory can be gained. "I can do all things through Christ which

        2 Peter 3:18
                        "But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord
                     and Saviour Jesus Christ."

                            "There is no Bible sanctification for those who cast a part of

                            "Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, or a
                         day. It is a continual growth in grace. We know not one day

                         active, and every day we need to earnestly cry to God for help

                            "How is it possible that we may grow in grace? It is possible
                         to us only as we empty our hearts of self, and present them
                         to Heaven, to be molded after the divine Pattern. We may have
                         a connection with the living channel of light; we may be re-

                         descend upon us. As we appropriate the blessing of God, we
                         shall be able to receive greater measures of His grace. As we
                         learn to endure as seeing Him who is invisible, we shall become
                         changed into the image of Christ. The grace of Christ will not
                         make us proud, cause us to be lifted up in self, but we shall

   GOD'S ORIGINAL
           PURPOSE
    Isa. 45:18; 43:7       "For thus saith the Lore that created the heavens; God
                        himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath estab-
                        lished it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be
                        inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else."
                           "Even every one that is called by my name: for I have
                        created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have
                        made him."
                           "God created man for His own glory, that after test and
                        trial the human family might become one with the heavenly
                        family. It was God's purpose to re-populate heaven with the
                        human family, if they would show themselves obedient to His
                        every word. Adam was to be tested, to see whether he would
                        be obedient. . . . If he stood the test, his instruction to his
                        children would have been only of loyalty. His mind and
                        thoughts would have been as the mind and thoughts of God.
                        He would have been taught by God as His husbandry and
                        building. His character would have been moulded in accordance
                        with the character of God."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

                           "The earth originally given to man as his kingdom, betrayed
                        by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty
                        foe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemption.

                           God is love, and love is the basis of creation. Education,

                        created man in His image that there might be a mutual ex-

                      and ever."
                         "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."

                             "The great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back
                          the world into God's favor.-All that was lost by sin is restored.
                          Not only man but the earth is redeenTed, to be the eternal
                          abode of the obedient. For six thousand years Satan has strug-

                          purpose in its creation is accomplished. 'The saints of the Most

                          page 342.
                             Today the meek do not have much of the earth. They are
                          thrust aside by the strong, the vicious, the ruthless elements
                          abroad in our world. But that arrangement will come to an
                          end. It has been sneeringly said, "It is a good thing that the
                          meek are going to inherit it. They would never get it in any
                          other way." Yes, thank God, it is to be by inheritance. Christ
                          the mighty Conqueror is going to take it from the hands of the
                          strong and give it to the meek.

                          12:32.



                             Children sometimes get the idea that God is standing at the

                          on the character of God! Jesus assured His followers that it
                          was the Father's good pleasure to give them the kingdom. There
                          was no possibility of their earning it, but it would be a free

                       worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight
                       of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen,

                       are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen
                       are eternal."

                          "Paul had a view of heaven, and in discoursing on the glories
                       there, the very best thing he could do was to not try to describe

                       unfolding to His people. There is only one way in which this
                        knowledge can be obtained. We can attain to an understanding
                       of God's word only through the illumination of that Spirit by
                       which the word was given. 'The things of God knoweth no
                       man, but the Spirit of God;' for the Spirit searcheth all things,
                       yea, the deep things of God.' And the Saviour's promise to His

              Part 4      What will be the extent of God's new creation?
   A NEW CREATION
         Isa. 65:17;
          Rev. 21:1        "For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth:
                       and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into
                       mind."
                           "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the
                       first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and
                       there was no more sea."

                          "'I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
                       and the first earth were passed away.' Revelation 21:1. The
                       fire that consumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every trace
                       of the curse is swept away. No eternally burning hell will keep
                       before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.
                          "One reminder alone remains: Our Redeemer will ever bear
                       the marks of His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon
                       His side, His hands and feet, are the only traces of the cruel
                       work that sin has wrought."—The Great Controversy, page
                       674.
                       I> What are some of the features which will distinguish
                       the future new earth from the present evil one? Rev.
                       21:3,4.



                          "Even today we can rejoice in the thought of the joys and
                       glories of the world to come. The pictures of a new and better
                       world give strength and courage as we meet the trials of the
                       present. Disappointments and discouragements will be met
                       with better grace if our hearts are set on the abounding joys
                       of the new earth, which is soon to become our home."—SDA
                       Bible Commentary, on Isa. 65:18.

 THINK IT THROUGH         Why must there be a new world? Would not a new
                       civilization be adequate?


   "Here they stand, and the finishing       "Oh, what music! There is not an
touch of immortality is put upon them,    inharmonious note. Every voice pro-
and they go up to meet their Lord in      claims, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was
the air. The gates of the city of God     slain.' He sees of the travail of His soul,
swing back upon their hinges, and the     and is satisfied. Do you think anyone
nations that have kept the truth enter    there will take time to tell of his trials
in. There are the columns of angels on    and terrible difficulties? 'The former
either side, and the ransomed of God      shall not be remembered, nor come into
walk in through the cherubims and         mind.! "—Ellen G. White Comments,

and puts upon them His benediction....    1093.

Beyond the Advent     LESSON 13                                        ❑   Thursday
                                                                       December 28
              Part 5 ► What promises to Judah will be fulfilled in the new
     SITUATION OF earth?
     THE REDEEMED
       Isa. 65:21-23
                        "And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and
                     they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They
                     shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,
                     and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days
                     of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work
                     of their hands. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring
                     forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of
                     the Lord, and their offspring with them."

                          "Through premature death, invasion, and deportation the
                       Israelites had lost their homes, their fields, and vineyards. Set-
                       tlement in the restored state was no more to be interrupted by
                       these. In the new heavens and new earth now soon to be
                       established, occupancy will not be interrupted even by death.
                       Life in the new earth will to a large degree be similar to the
                       life that man lived in Paradise before the entrance of sin."—
                       SDA Bible Commentary, on Isa. 65:21.
                           "A fear of making the future inheritance seem too material
                       has led many to spiritualize away the very truths which lead
                       us to look upon it as our home. . . . Human language is inade-
                       quate to describe the reward of the righteous. It will be
                       known only to those who behold it. No finite mind can com-
                       prehend the glory of the Paradise of God."—The Great Con-
                       troversy, pages 674, 675.
                           "There the student of science may read the records of crea-
                       tion and discern no reminders of the law of evil. He may listen
                        to the music of nature's voices and detect no note of wailing
                        or undertone of sorrow. In all created things he may trace one
                        handwriting—in the vast universe behold 'God's name writ
                        large,' and not in earth or sea or sky one sign of ill remaining.
                           "There the Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and
                        field."—Education, page 303.

                       ► What features were promised to Israel in the restored
                       earth? Isa. 65:25; 35:5, 6.


 THINK IT THROUGH          What is the basic difference between the activities of
                        the Christian in the present world and his activities in
                        the new earth?

  "All the treasures of the universe will the spectacle of human woe and rang
be open to the study of God's re-         with songs of gladness at the tidings of
deemed. Unfettered by mortality, they a ransomed soul."—"The Great Contro-

Beyond the Advent       LESSON 13                                          ❑ Friday
                                                                       December 29
            Part 6 Co- In the New Jerusalem what is to be the relationship
       FULFILLMENT of God and the redeemed?
 OF THE COVENANT
          Rev. 21:3
                        "And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying,
                    Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will
                    dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God
                    himself shall be with them, and be their God."

                         .- How close is this new relationship between God and
                        man? Rev. 22:4.



                        10- In what context was the idea of this God-people rela-
                        tion presented in the Old Testament? Deut. 29:12, 13.
                        (See also Gen. 17:7 and Lev. 26:12.)



                            There will not be merely a theoretical or abstract relation
                        between God and His people, but God will be visible to them,
                        and they will have consented to the principles of His character.
                           "All who enter will have on the robe Christ's righteousness,
                        and the name of God will be seen in their foreheads. This name
                        is the symbol which the apostle saw in vision, and signifies the
                        yielding of the mind to intelligent and loyal obedience to all
                        of God's commandments."—Ellen G. White, Sons and Daugh-
                        ters of God, page 370.
                            The whole purpose of the covenant that God initiated
                        through Abraham was that he and his descendants should be
                        God's people, and God should be their God. This is the cove-
                        nant in its simplest terms. Thus when in Rev. 21:3 we find
                        this same idea we conclude that the New Jerusalem, peopled
                        by the saints, is the fulfillment of the covenant. This covenant
                        includes all the work of Jesus Christ, and Rev. 21:3 thus pro-
                        claims the final success of the plan of redemption. God and
                        His people are at last united and belong to each other in the
                        way He intended at creation.

 THINK IT THROUGH          What determines if I am one of God's people?




   "The people of God are privileged to     in His dealings with men; but then we
hold open communion with the Father         shall see Him face to face, without a
and the Son. 'Now we see through a          dimming veil between. We shall stand
glass, darkly.' 1 Corinthians 13:12. We     in His presence and behold the glory
behold the image of God reflected, as       of His countenance."—"The Great Con-
in a mirror, in the works of nature and     troversy," pages 676, 677.
