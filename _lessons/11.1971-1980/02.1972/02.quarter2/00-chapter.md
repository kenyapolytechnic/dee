     The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in
the lesson."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                      My Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

       GOD'S WAY O SETING
            MIEN REGFETI
                     (Studies From the Book of Romans)
                            General Introduction

    The Jewish colony at Rome to whom the apostle Paul addresses the epistle
to the Romans represents in large part people who had come to the city be-
cause of its commercial advantages. Some were wealthy and influential.
Others were slaves brought from Jerusalem by Pompey to adorn his triumph
and later set free. Although the Jews dwelling in Rome enjoyed the favor
of the Caesars, they were held in contempt by the general population of the
Romans.
    There were Jews of the synagogue to whom the gospel had not yet been
preached, or by whom it had long since been rejected. Others were in con-
temptuous ignorance of "this sect" which was "everywhere spoken against."
Acts 28:22. It was to these chief spokesmen that Paul expounded the kingdom
of God; and in the epistle he wrote, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:
for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the
Jew first, and also to the Greek." Rom. 1:16.
    The message of Romans shows how the gospel and the gospel alone fully
answers the need which all men have for salvation. It deals with the law, with
sin, and with grace. By exaggerating some features and disregarding others,
it is easy to give an air of plausibility to very different and widely separated
views about Romans. There could be lengthy discussions also about the pur-
pose of the epistle.
    We could hope that a discussion of the lessons will center not so much
about Paul and his background and his times as around what the Lord was
saying to that generation and to this one through His servant. All Scripture
is given to us "by inspiration of God." There are deep veins of truth in the
book of Romans that the people of God need for this time of revival and
reformation. Let us not overlook them.

                                                                     March 26 to April 1



                    GOD'S WAY OF DEALING WITH SIN 1

   "This epistle [Romans] is really the chief
   part of the New Testament and the pur-
   est gospel, which not only deserves to
   be known by heart by a Christian, word
   for word, but to be studied daily as the
   daily bread of the soul." Martin Luther.

   "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto
salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
Rom. 1:16.


   The Christians at Rome were a commu-          by the Jews over others, 'chiefly, because
nity of diverse people drawn from various        that unto them were committed the oracles

every variety of Christian thought and           equally efficacious for Jew and Gentile, that
feeling then current found a place. One of       Paul in his epistle to the Romans declared

               Part 1        "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apos-
          MESSENGER      tle, separated unto the gospel of God, (which He had
       OF THE GOSPEL     promised afore by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures)."
           Rom. 1:1, 2
                            While the twelve disciples had been chosen by Jesus and
                         were with Him during His earthly ministry (Acts 1:21), Paul
                         had not enjoyed this advantage. But he was nonetheless an
                         apostle by divine call. Gal. 1:1. Though he considered himself
                         as "one born out of due time" (1 Cor. 15:8), perhaps a refer-
                         ence to the lateness of his conversion, his call was no less real
                         or effectual.

                            What was the good news Paul sought to preach? Rom.
                         1:3.




                            The gospel that tells of Christ's sacrifice for the lost is the
                         fulfillment of all that was old, the starting point of all that was
                         new. It says that God has been with us, that He has unveiled
                         Himself to us here, so that He might be, as man, the restorer
                         of mankind.

                           What did Paul offer as proof of the divinity of Christ?
                         Rom. 1:4.




    THINK IT THROUGH        We are commissioned, as was Paul, to carry the gospel
                         to our generation. But now, when transgression has al-
                         most reached its limit, am I readily satisfied with offering
                         the Lord trifling acts of service?

                                                                             March 27
           Part 2      "By whom we have received grace and apostleship,
        THE DIVINE for obedience to the faith among all nations, for His
         PURPOSE name: among whom are ye also the called of Jesus
        Rom. 1:5, 6 Christ."

                          The Scriptures speak of various kinds of calls. One is a call
                       to civil service. God called Cyrus to the conquest of nations
                       and to be the protector of Israel. Isa. 45:1, 4. A person's secular
                       employment is said to be his calling; it is the work to which
                       God invites him. 1 Cor. 7:20. There is also a call to office, as
                       when Paul was called to the apostleship. Rom. 1:1. Thus every
                       true minister of the gospel is called of God. 1 Cor. 12:7-11.
                       There is also a call to mankind, wherever the gospel is preached,
                       to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved. But though
                       all without exception are thus invited, few accept and hence
                       few are chosen. Matt. 22:1-10; Acts 17:30; compare Prov.
                       8:4; Isa. 55:6, 7.

                         Through his apostleship, what was Paul to lead the
                       Gentiles to do? Rom. 1:5, 6.


                          Today's English Version captures the meaning of the Greek
                       in a very interesting way:
                          "Through Him God gave me the privilege of being an apos-
                       tle, for the sake of Christ, in order to lead people of all nations
                       to believe and obey. This also includes you who are in Rome,
                       whom God has called to belong to Jesus Christ."
                          The gospel calls for a response on the part of the hearer.
                       1 Peter 1:22; Acts 6:7. God commands as well as invites and
                       offers. 1 John 3:23. Unbelief and rejection of Christ constitute
                       rebellion against God. Faith is itself obedience. When God
                       speaks, men are not to quibble and offer their own reasoning,
                       but they are to believe and accept.

                         Who are called of Christ? 1 Cor. 1:2, 7; Acts 9:32;
                       Eph. 1:1.


  THINK IT THROUGH        Am I willing to obey all that the Lord has said, or do
                       I have some reservations about what His Word plainly
                       says I should do?

          Rom. 1:7-10 prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you."


                     --- It is the grace of God that transforms man into the likeness
                         of his Maker.
                             "Through the power of Christ men and women have broken
                          the chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The
                          profane have become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate
                          pure. Souls that have borne the likeness of Satan have become
                          transformed into the image of God. This change is in itself the
                         miracle of miracles. A change wrought_by the Word, it is one
                          of the deepest mysteries-of - the—Word. We—rmot
                                                                       ca      understand
                         it; we can only believe, as declared by the Scriptures, it is
                          Christ in you, the hope of glory.'"—The Acts of the Apostles,
                         page 476.

                             Why did Paul wish to visit Rome? How does he speak
                         of those to whom he must preach? Rom. 1:11-15.



                           Faith is strengthened when it is shared. There is a law per-
                        vading God's works by which the giver becomes the receiver.
                        The seed comes back in the harvest; the ocean receives the
                        rain that it gives off in evaporation. Nothing is so injurious
                        as selfishness; nothing is so remunerative as benevolence.
    THINK IT THROUGH       Am I so living that my neighbors will better under-
                        stand and love God? Am I living up to my privilege to
                        advance daily in the Christian life?

         ROM. 1:16
                          The gospel is power. This power is manifested when a sinner
                       abandons his life of sin. Paul himself was a living illustration
                       of what the power of God can do for a man. The gospel of
                       Christ succeeds even when imprisonment, stripes, destitution,
                       and disgrace have been powerless to reform.

                           "What is the nature of the righteousness that comes

                           God's way of dealing with sin is the dominant theme of the
                        whole epistle. Compare Romans 3:21-26, in which God's righ-
                        teousness is especially revealed in the death of Christ. Compare
                        Rom. 10:2 ; Phil. 3:9.
                           "The righteousness of Christ will not cover one cherished
                        sin. A man may be a lawbreaker in heart; yet if he commits
                        no outward act of transgression, he may be regarded by the
                        world as possessing great integrity. But God's law looks into
                        the secrets of the heart. Every act is judged by the motives
                        that prompt it. Only that which is in accord with the principles
                        of God's law will stand in judgment."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                        page 316.
                           "Nor is it a righteousness that the sinner must work out for
                        himself through long and weary processes of thought or evolu-
                        tion or sacrifice and penance and pilgrimage; it comes to the
                        believer wholly apart from all that human power can do."—

 THINK IT THROUGH          If nature shows God's power in creation, and the Flood
                        furnishes proof of His destructive power, then the gospel
                        reveals His power to save. Are you ashamed of the gos-

     SINNERS WITHOUT all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold

           Rom. 1:18
                           When men renounce God, they turn to substitutes. In Bible
                        times they chose to worship the works of God's hands and
                        objects of their own making, including images of themselves.
                        Nothing has been too mean, or too obscene, for man to worship.

                           What reason does Paul give for the wrath of God
                        against man? Rom. 1:19, 20.



                           "Not only the things of nature, but the sacrificial service
                        and the Scriptures themselves—all given to reveal God—were
                        so perverted that they became the means of concealing Him."—

                           What is the terrible result of apostasy? Rom. 1:21, 22.




                            Men stand condemned because their conduct does not mea-
                        sure up to their knowledge of God. Having this knowledge,
                         they failed to glorify and worship Him who is disclosed in crea-
                         tion and in their consciences. A darkened mind leads to futility
                        and frustrated thinking which always ends in foolishness and
                        chaos.
                            "It is a mistake to suppose that idolatry was the gradual
                        growth of well-disposed but unenlightened human thinking. Its

                                                                            March 31

         APOSTASY four-footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God
                     also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of
                     their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between
                     themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie, and
                     worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator,

                           A hoist operator in a slope mine needs merely to loose the
                        connection, and the cars by their own weight rush down the
                        incline and dash themselves to pieces. A physician has merely
                        to retire when his orders have been repeatedly disregarded, to
                        deliver his patient to protracted suffering and possibly to a
                        premature grave. In like manner, if God delivers men who
                        reject Him to their lusts, they will sink into the lowest depths
                        and finally to everlasting destruction.

                          To what extent did God forsake these wicked men?
                        Rom. 1:26-28.


                           How complete was their apostasy? Rom. 1:29-32.

                          "Sin had become a science, and vice was consecrated as a
                        part of religion. Rebellion had struck its roots deep into the
                        heart, and the hostility of man was most violent against
                        heaven."—The Desire of Ages, page 37.

     DIVINE JUDGMENT thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the
                       same things. But we are sure that the judgment of God
                       is according to truth against them which commit such
                       things. And thinkest thou this, 0 man, that judgest them
                       which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt
           Rom. 2:1-3 escape the judgment of God?"

                            It is easy to discover sin in others, and it is simple to join
                         in general confessions of sin in which we seem to include our-
                         selves. But it is hard to acknowledge penitently a specific sin
                         before God. There is in every man a subtle element of self-
                         flattery which leads him to deny his own offenses while he is
                         quick to condemn the sins of his neighbors.

                           What is the attitude toward God's goodness of the
                         man who judges another yet practices the same things?
                         Rom. 2:1-3.



                            "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
                         speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in
                         them to do evil." Eccl. 8:11. It is the goodness of God that
                         leads Him to bless us; it is His forbearance that holds back
                         the avenging stroke against sin; it is His long-suffering that
                         endures much provocation from the sons of men. . . .
                            "The Pharisees . . . came forth from their religious services,
                         not humbled with a sense of their own weakness, not grateful

                         forth filled with spiritual pride. . . .
                            "The people partook largely of the same spirit, intruding
                         upon the province of conscience and judging one another in
                         matters that lay between the soul and God. It was in reference
                         to this spirit and practice that Jesus said, 'Judge not, that ye
                         be not judged.'"—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages
                         123, 124.
 THINK IT THROUGH            In what ways have I learned the magnitude of sin?
                         How do I look upon degrees of guilt when I am the guilty
                         one? Am I looking to the imperfect judgment of my

                         ously today, but he is also treasuring up wrath against the day
                         of wrath. The man who hardens his heart makes the wrath

                            "God has given in His Word decisive evidence that He will
                         punish the transgressors of His law. Those who flatter them-
                         selves that He is too merciful to execute justice upon the sinner,
                         have only to look to the cross of Calvary.. . . All this sacrifice
                         was made that sinners might be redeemed. In no other way
                         could man be freed from the penalty of sin. And every soul
                         that refuses to become a partaker of the atonement provided
                         at such a cost must bear in his own person the guilt and pun-

                            Deeds are seeds that continue to produce crops through
                        many generations. The consequences of man's evil deeds may
                        end only with the world's end. An ungodly example, wicked
                        instructions, evil institutions, the blasphemous books which
                        men write, are on this order. For their good deeds, those who
                        believe in Jesus receive a reward of grace. Matt. 25:34-36; Heb.
                        6:10. For their evil deeds those who reject the counsel of God
                        will be cast into outer darkness.
                            "Those whom Christ commends in the judgment may have

             Part 4       "Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law,
        THE JEWISH     and makest thy boast of God, and knowest His will, and
         MORALIST      approvest the things that are more excellent, being in-
                       structed out of the law; and art confident that thou thy-
                       self art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are
                       in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of
                       babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the
       Rom. 2:17-20    truth in the law."

                          The Jew boasted of his covenant relation with God. The
                       Jew expected salvation because he was a Jew. He also rested
                       on his superior knowledge. Divine things had been especially
                       revealed to him, and on this premise he expected a special favor
                       from God. The Jew forgot that superior knowledge often
                       heightens the guilt of sin and increases the certainty, the neces-
                       sity, and the severity of punishment.

                         Although the Jewish moralists were preaching to the
                       Gentiles, what were they themselves doing? Rom. 2:21-23.




                           "The apostle showed that religion does not consist in rites
                        and ceremonies, creeds and theories. If it did, the natural man
                        could understand it by investigation, as he understands worldly
                        things. Paul taught that religion is a practical, saving energy, a
                        principle wholly from God, a personal experience of God's
                        renewing power upon the soul."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                        page 451.

                          By their hypocrisy how were the Jews causing the
                        name of God to be regarded? Rom. 2:24.




  THINK IT THROUGH         Is my life consistent with the things which I say I
                        believe? Is my standard of conduct only a little above
                        the world's standards? Or is the distinction decidedly
                        apparent?

                            Abraham received circumcision as a sign or seal that he was
                         a worshiper of the true God. Unfortunately, many of his de-
                         scendants had the seal without the corresponding experience of
                         true worship.

                           What further significance had the rite of circumcision?
                         Gen. 17:9-14; Acts 7:8.




                            "The Lord appeared unto Abraham, and said unto him, 'I
                         am the Almighty God. Walk before Me, and be thou perfect,
                         and I will make a covenant between Me and thee, and will
                         multiply thee exceedingly.... '
                            "He then required of Abraham and his seed circumcision,
                         which was a circle cut in the flesh, as a token that God had
                         cut them out and separated them from all nations as His pecu-
                         liar treasure. By this sign they solemnly pledged themselves that
                         they would not intermarry with other nations; for by so doing
                         they would lose their reverence for God and His holy law,
                         and would become like the idolatrous nations around them."

                             What other sign designated the Jews as worshipers
                         of the true God? Eze. 20:20.




 THINK IT THROUGH           In what way ought Christians today to follow the

       Rom. 2:28, 29    praise is not of men, but of God."

                           The apostle is proving that both Jews and Gentiles are under
                        sin. Because the Jew was so blinded, prejudiced, and self-righ-
                        teous, this was a difficult proposition for him to accept.

                            What is the meaning of the word Jew? Rom. 2:28, 29.



                           The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Dictionary defines "Jew"
                        as follows:
                           "A term occurring first in the time of Jeremiah designating
                        a citizen or subject of the kingdom of Judah (2 Ki 25:25; Jer
                        32:12; 34:9; etc.). But the derived Hebrew term Yehiidith
                        occurs much earlier, in the days of King Hezekiah, to designate
                        the Hebrew language (2 Ki 18:26; Is 36:11). Most of the re-

                           What is true circumcision? Rom. 2:29. Compare Jer.
                        4:4.



                            "True circumcision is the worship of Christ in spirit and

 THINK IT THROUGH            What is there in outward rites and practices which,
                         of itself, can be acceptable to God? Since I have been

                             "When God pardons the sinner, remits the punishment he
                          deserves, and treats him as though he had not sinned, He

                          merits of Christ's righteousness. The sinner can be justified only
                          through faith in the atonement made through God's dear Son,
                          who became a sacrifice for the sins of the guilty world. No one
                          can be justified by any works of his own. He can be delivered
                          from the guilt of sin, from the condemnation of the law, from
                          the penalty of transgression, only by virtue of the suffering,
                          death, and resurrection of Christ. Faith is the only condition
                          upon which justification can be obtained, and faith includes
                          not only belief but trust." — Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 389.

                          3:22, 23.

Made Right With God by Faith           LESSON 3                          El   Monday
                                                                              April 10
             Part 2       "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through
        BOASTING faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the
         EXCLUDED remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance
                      of God; to declare, I say, at this time His righteousness:
                      that He might be just, and the justifier of him which be-
                      lieveth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded.
                      By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
                      Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith
                      without the deeds of the law. Is He the God of the Jews
                      only? is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles
                      also: seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circum-
       Rom. 3:25-30 cision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."

                           When we speak of Christ as being a propitiation for sin, we
                        imply that He was appointed by God the Father to make an
                        atonement for mankind. We indicate also that He took upon
                        Himself the guilt of His people and that He suffered the punish-
                        ment which they deserved.
                           "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated
                        as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He
                        had no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness,
                        in which we had no share. He suffered the death which was
                        ours, that we might receive the life which was His. 'With His
                        stripes we are healed.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 25.

                            Of what specific boasting does Paul say the Jews were
                         guilty? Rom. 2:17, 23.



                            Are there places for good works in the life of a Chris-
                         tian? 1 Tim. 5:9, 10; 6:18; 2 Tim. 3:17.



 THINK IT THROUGH            Righteousness is a condition of character rather than
                         conduct. Am I struggling to make an impression upon my
                         fellow believers, or am I asking the Lord to help me to
                         be right with Him?

                        sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the

                        7:7-12)."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 347.

                           What besides faith operates in justification? James
                        2:20-24.



                           "That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men
                        from the obligation of obedience to God, is not faith, but pre-
                        sumption. 'By grace are ye saved through faith.' But 'faith, if
                        it bath not works, is dead.' . . . Jesus said of Himself before
                        He came to earth, `I delight to do Thy will, 0 My God: yea,
                        Thy law is within My heart.' . . . And just before He ascended
                        again to heaven He declared, `I have kept My Father's com-
                        mandments, and abide in His love.'"—Steps to Christ, page 61.

                           Are the statements in the book of James contrary to
                        those in Romans?



                           At first they may seem to be in contradiction, but actually
                        the teaching of James complements the teaching of Paul. To
                        establish the connection between faith and works is one of
                        the purposes of the epistle of James.

                        of the righteousness of Christ and have known its power

                                                                            April 12
             Part 4       "Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned
        HOW GOD        of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but
          JUSTIFIES    believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is
     THE UNGODLY       counted for righteousness. Even as David also describeth
                       the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth
                       righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they
                       whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are cov-
                       ered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute
          Rom. 4:4-8   sin."

                          When Jesus confers sight upon a blind man, the man ceases
                       to be in darkness; and when a rich man confers wealth upon
                       a poor man, the poor man ceases to be in poverty. Just so
                       surely, when justification is conferred upon the ungodly, his
                       ungodliness is done away. His godliness is not the ground upon
                       which the gift was awarded. But just as sight and riches come
                       from outside, so a life of godliness comes out of the gift of
                       justification.
                          "We have no righteousness of our own with which to meet
                       the claims of the law of God. But Christ has made a way of
                       escape for us. He lived on earth amid trials and temptations
                       such as we have to meet. He lived a sinless life. He died for
                       us, and now He offers to take our sins and give us His righ-
                       teousness. If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your
                       Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake
                       you are accounted righteous. Christ's character stands in place
                       of your character, and you are accepted before God just as if
                       you had not sinned."—Steps to Christ, page 62.

                           What Old Testament example does Paul use to prove
                       that justification by faith is imbedded in the Scriptures
                       of the old covenant? Rom. 4:1-3.




 THINK IT THROUGH          If you were walking in a dark place, not knowing
                        the road, and someone offered you a light, would you
                        refuse to accept it? But have you fully accepted the provi-

                        `an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth
                        not away'—the earth freed from the curse of sin."—Patriarchs
                        and Prophets, page 170.

                           What argument does Paul make to point out the con-
                        nection between law and promise? Rom. 4:13-15.



                            "The fulfillment of God's promise may seem to be long de-
                        layed—for 'one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and
                        a thousand years as one day' . . . ; it may appear to tarry; but
                        at the appointed time 'it will surely come, it will not tarry.'
                        . . . The gift to Abraham and his seed included not merely the
                        land of Canaan, but the whole earth. So says the apostle, `The
                        promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to
                        Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the
                        righteousness of faith.' . . . And the Bible plainly teaches that
                        the promises made to Abraham are to be fulfilled through
                        Christ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 170.

                          To how many is the promise made sure through faith?
                        Rom. 4:16, 17.




                          The expression, "a father of many nations," is taken from
                        Gen. 17:5. God gave him that name because He foresaw the
                        multitudes from among all peoples who would exercise the

Made Right With God by Faith            LESSON 3                            ❑ Friday
                                                                               April 14
            Part 6         "He [Abraham] staggered not at the promise of God
          IMPUTED       through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to
    RIGHTEOUSNESS       God; and being fully persuaded that, what He had prom-
                        ised, He was able also to perform. And therefore it was
        Rom. 4:20-22    imputed to him for righteousness."

                           It was God's purpose that Abraham should be an outstand-
                        ing example of the power of faith. It was therefore necessary
                        that his faith should be tested in a special way. To this end
                        God gave him a promise that in his seed should all the nations
                        of the earth be blessed, and yet for many years he remained
                        without an heir. His faith triumphed through it all, and he
                        believed the promises of God. By such unquestioning faith and
                        confidence Abraham brought glory to God. The more difficult
                        the fulfillment of the promise, the more wonderful was Abra-
                        ham's faith.

                           Why was Abraham's faith imputed to him for righ-
                        teousness? Rom. 4:18-21.



                           "Faith that enables us to receive God's gifts is itself a gift,
                        of which some measure is imparted to every human being. It
                        grows as exercised in appropriating the Word of God. In order
                        to strengthen faith, we must often bring it in contact with the
                        Word."—Education, pages 253, 254.

             CHRIST      have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand,
          Rom. 5:1, 2    and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."

                            A man who owes a debt can be justified only when that debt
                         is paid, either by him or by someone who pays it on his
                         behalf. Similarly, a man defiled in sin can be justified. The only
                         way by which God can count a sinner righteous is through
                         justification. Faith unites a man with Christ and enables him
                         to appropriate the Saviour's righteousness.
                            "Christ is 'the Prince of Peace' (Isaiah 9:6), and it is His
                         mission to restore to earth and heaven the peace that sin has
                         broken. 'Being justified by faith, we have peace with God
                         through our Lord Jesus Christ.' Romans 5:1. Whoever con-
                         sents to renounce sin and open his heart to the love of Christ,
                         becomes a partaker of this heavenly peace."—Thoughts From
                         the Mount of Blessing, page 27.

                           In what other experience should the Christian rejoice?
                         Rom. 5:3.



                            What blessing in addition to peace does the believer
                         receive through Christ? Rom. 5:3, 4.



                            Having spoken of rejoicing in God, Paul now declares that
                         the Christian should rejoice in tribulations also. Not, that is, in
                         the sense of enjoying them while he endures them (for the
                         children of God suffer when they experience pain, depression,
                         et cetera), but in the knowledge that trials develop endurance,
                         provide experience, and inspire hope.
                            The word translated "patience" includes the qualities of
                         endurance and constancy. Certainly God is seeking not.only one
                         who will merely endure suffering, but one who will speak up
                         when his godly witness is needed.
                            The English word "tribulation" comes from the Old Latin
                         word tribulum, a threshing instrument used to pound out the
                         grain.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Jesus never spoke of the cross as His, but always as
                         ours. What important lesson does this have for me?

                        pose under the heaven," wrote Solomon (Eccl. 3:1) ; thus there
                        was an appropriate time for the manifestation of God in the
                        flesh. When the world was weary of waiting, like a sufferer
                        worn out with a long sickness, in "due" time, the Saviour came.
                           Christ was a friend to us in our time of urgent need. We
                        were in sin. We did not deserve the great sacrifice He came to
                        make on our behalf. Our utter unworthiness is the measure of
                        His infinite, condescending love. From a human standpoint,
                        He had every reason to abandon us to our fate; but He did
                        not, and therein lies the supreme vindication of the divine char-
                        acter and government.

                           What basis did Paul have for being so certain that
                        "hope maketh not ashamed"? Ps. 22:5.




                           In what way is the "due time" of Christ's first coming
                        elsewhere referred to in Scripture? Gal. 4:4; Mark 1:15.



 THINK IT THROUGH         God commended, not His wisdom, power, holiness, or
                        wealth, toward us, but His love. While we were at the

                            The death of Christ was substitutionary. We might compare
                        it to the death of a mother bird hovering over her young in
                        order to protect them, and giving her own life that they might

                        of eternal death that would otherwise be the inevitable result
                        of sin. He overcame sin and its penalty, death, in order that we
                        might overcome.

                           What is reconciliation? 2 Cor. 5:18-20.

                        5:11.




                           The believer is fully reconciled to the Father. There is now
                        no gulf of separation, for the justified one has benefited by
                        Christ's sacrifice on the cross. Reconciliation begins with a con-
                        viction of sin and is followed by repentance, remission of sin,
                        partaking of the divine nature, and adoption into the family
                        of God.
                           "Christ's sacrifice in behalf of man was full and complete.
                        The condition of the atonement had been fulfilled. The work
                        for which He had come to this world had been accomplished."

                       Adam. Satan, filled with malignant hatred against God, became
                       the tempter. Our first parents yielded, thus changing the course
                       of nature and bringing about consequences which will be felt
                       till the end of time.

                           What is the difference between Adam's sin and the
                        sins of his descendants? Rom. 5:14.



                           "Adam could not transmit to his posterity that which he
                        did not possess; and there could have been no hope for the
                        fallen race had not God, by the sacrifice of His Son, brought
                        immortality within their reach. While 'death passed upon all
                        men, for that all have sinned,' Christ 'bath brought life and
                        immortality to light through the gospel.' "—The Great Con-

                           What is the relationship between Adam's sin and the

                       made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many
       Rom. 5:18, 19   be made righteous."

                          Both sin and death entered the world by the first man,
                       Adam. The origin of evil is a deep mystery, but its introduc-
                       tion to our world is a historical fact clearly stated in the Bible.
                       God made Adam the father of all living, and gave him dominion
                       over all creation. But Adam failed. He was this world's original
                       sinner, and his descendants today continue to sin and die. Only
                       the grace of God can keep them from becoming victims of their
                       own transgression.

                          What result came from Adam's disobedience? Rom.
                       5:18-20.



                          "Man has fallen; and it will be the work of a lifetime, be
                       it longer or shorter, to recover from that fall, and regain,
                       through Christ, the image of the divine, which he lost by sin
                       and continued transgression. God requires a thorough transfor-
                       mation of soul, body, and spirit in order to regain the estate
                       lost through Adam."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 448.
                           "To learn of Christ means to receive His grace, which is His
                       character. But those who do not appreciate and utilize the

                       Their characters are not molded according to the divine simili-

                    that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
                    were bapized into His death? Therefore we are buried
                    with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
                    raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even
        Rom. 6:1-4 so we also should walk in newness of life."

                          Abounding sin required abounding grace. Those who accept
                       the provisions of the gospel renounce sin and are "dead" to it.
                          "Those who have put on Christ by baptism, by this act
                       showing their separation from the world, and that they have

                       in their hearts. Those who have once rejoiced in the evidence
                       of sins forgiven, who have tasted the Saviour's love and who
                       then persist in uniting with the foes of Christ, rejecting the
                       perfect righteousness that Jesus offers them and choosing the
                       ways that He has condemned, will be more severely judged
                       than the heathen who have never had the light and have never
                       known God or His law."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, pp. 365, 366.

                          What is the underlying purpose of baptism? Rom.
                       6:5-1 1.



                          Baptism is, first, a figure of the death of the believer to sin.
                       Then, having been buried with Christ, we rise with Him in
                       newness of life. Christ was raised by "the glory of the Father"
                       so that we might begin a new kind of life.

                          What three great gospel facts does baptism represent?
                       1 Cor. 15:3,4.

                            Peace, moral beauty, and strength are destroyed wherever
                        sin has the ruling power. It is a cancer that eats its way grad-
                        ually, yet effectually, to the very roots of our being. We are
                        all subject to some authority; it is for us to decide whose
                        government it will be. We cannot govern ourselves; we must
                        serve either righteousness or sin. How thankful we ought to be
                        that there is a higher, stronger, purer power ready to enter the

              Part 2        "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are
      A WONDERFUL        not under the law, but under grace. What then? shall
           PROMISE       we sin, because we are not under the law, but under
       Rom. 6:14, 15     grace? God forbid."

                            We must never forget that it is the nature of sin to grow.
                         Weeds generally grow faster than flowers. First, there is an
                         empty space, a life unfenced, no sense of danger. Sin enters
                         unobserved and grows stronger and stronger until it over-
                         shadows the whole moral being.

                           What promise is given those who yield themselves to
                         God? Rom. 6:14, 15.



                            Sin shall not be allowed to rule over us because of our faith
                         in Christ's atoning death on the cross and our death to sin. The
                         penalty demanded by the law has been paid; therefore be-
                         lievers are not subject to the law's claims. In contrast, the
                         believer is now under grace; that is, he is the subject of God's
                         gracious kindness, and God imparts the grace that enables His
                         children to conquer sin.

                            If we are not under sin's dominion, can we still be
                         slaves? Rom. 6:16.

                            There is no condition so sad as that of a slave, and no slavery
                        so hard as that of sin. There was once a tyrant who ordered
                        one of his subjects to make an iron chain of a certain length.
                        The man completed the task, and the tyrant bade him make
                        it longer still. He continued to add link to link, and at length
                        the cruel taskmaster ordered his servants to bind the worker
                        with his own chain and cast him into the fire. That hardest of
                        tyrants, the devil, treats his slaves in like manner.

                            How does Paul describe the deliverance wrought in the
                        life of the believer? Rom. 6:19-22.

    MARRIAGE LAW know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a
  BINDING FOR LIFE man as long as he liveth? For the woman which hath an
                    husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as
                    he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from
                    the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband
                    liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called
                    an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free
                    from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she
        Rom. 7:1-3 be married to another man."

                           The death of either partner dissolves a marriage. The law
                        has no more power over a dead subject than a husband has
                        over his dead wife. The believer, released from the condemna-
                        tion of the law by dying in fellowship with Christ, is one with
                        his risen Master anrfnciFt-o—Feir-The fruits of holiness to His
                        glory.

                            What conclusion does Paul draw from his illustration
                        of the marriage law? Rom. 7:4, 5.



                           The law does not die; it condemns the sinner, and the sinner
                        is counted dead. Faith in Christ's death is taken by the sinner
                        for his death; with Christ he dies to sin, and the law no longer
                        condemns him. With Christ he rises by faith to a new life,
                        married to Him who rose from the dead, that he may bring
                        forth fruit unto God.

                            What is the apostle's conclusion with respect to the
                   t;
                         law? Rom. 7:6-8. Of what law is Paul speaking? Verse 7.



  THINK IT THROUGH          How would I answer one who claimed to be under

                      mandment might become exceedingly sinful. For we
                      know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under
                      sin.' For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that

        Rom. 7:13-16 which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."

                            Paul here explains two statements that appear to be con-
                         tradictory—the law is holy, but it works death. Foreseeing that
                         some would have difficulty regarding this, Paul assumes the
                         position of an objector: "Was then that which is good made
                         death unto me?"

                            What is the sinner's condition without the law? Rom.

                         and convictions of sin, described in the two preceding verses,
                         overtook him. We are not able to determine the time in the
                         apostle's career when the commandment began to arouse the

      Rom. 7:17-20 no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."

                           If there is no sin, there is no need of redemption. If sin
                        consists merely in action, and it can be avoided, then redemp-
                        tion is a small matter. But if sin is a universal and incurable
                        wickedness, a part of our very nature, then redemption has to
                        be a work of God.
                           "None of the apostles and prophets ever claimed to be with-
                        out sin. Men who have lived the nearest to God, men who
                        would sacrifice life, itself rather than knowingly commit a

                        put no confidence in the flesh, have claimed no righteousness of
                        their own, but have trusted wholly in the righteousness of
                        Christ.

          Rom. 8:1, 2    death."

                            One natural law often cancels out another. For example, a
                         child gathering mushrooms might unwittingly eat a poisonous
                         fungus, with potentially fatal results. But an antidote is given
                         to counteract the poison. Acting as "the law of life," it sets the
                         child "free from the law of death" that had already begun to
                         work in his members. In the spring, in the same way, the law
                         of life sets the flowers free from winter's law of death. The
                         "law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" set Lazarus "free from
                         the law of sin and death" that had imprisoned him in the tomb.
                         So also the law of life communicated through the Holy Spirit
                         will set us "free from the law of sin and death" that has so
                         long reigned in our hearts.
                            "It is our privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to
                         stand before the law without shame or remorse."—Steps to

         Rom. 8:6-8
                             The phrase "carnal ;mind" does not necessarily imply gross
                          sensuality.. It may reflect, no more. than a preference for carnal
                          things over spiritual things. , Nevertheless, such a mind is "en-
                          mity against God." It deems His holiness too strict, His justice
                          too severe,. His truth too inflexible. Even His mercy may seem
                          abhorrent, because of the humiliating way in which men some-
                          times 'misrepresent it. The, carnal mind and the law of God
                          are as far apart as darkness and light.
                             "We have great victories to gain, and a heaven to lose if
                          we do not gain them. The carnal heart must be crucified; for
                          its tendency, is to moral corruption, and the end thereof is
                          death. Nothing but the life-giving influences of the gospel can

                              How does sin in the life affect our relationship with
                          God? Isa. 59:2. In contrast to separation from God, what
                          is the basis of "life eternal"? John 17:3.




                             " 'Life' is contrasted with 'death' and,in its highest expres-
                          sion, which must be in view here, it means the knowledge and

                          life. In this case it is no doubt the subjective effect of peace

                            By nature we are blind to spiritual things. We are assured
                         on the highest authority that the natural man accounts the
                         things of the Spirit to be foolishness, and that he not only
                         does not accept but cannot even know them, "because they
                         are spiritually discerned." 1 Cor. 2:14. With respect to the
                         knowledge of Christ in particular our Lord tells us that, as no
                         man knoweth the Father but the Son, so no man knoweth the
                         Son but the Father and he to whom God shall be pleased to
                         reveal Him. The Spirit of God must take of the things that
                         are Christ's and show them to us (see John 16:14, 15) ; He
                         must open our minds to understand them. Unless we allow
                         Him to guide us into all truth, we shall wander in a maze of
                         ignorance and error to the end of our days and perish at last
                         through lack of knowledge.

                           How is the life-giving power of the Spirit expressed?
                         Rom. 8:11.



                            What is the result of living after the flesh? What

                          As a result of sin, human beings have lost their right to be
                       sons of God. We are essentially orphans as we wander far from
                       our Father and live in rebellion against Him. To be reconciled
                       to God is practically to be made sons again in a fuller sense
                       than before. Paul speaks of this as adoption (verse 15, KJV) ;
                       Jesus called it a second birth (John 3:3, 5). This restoration
                       should be the source of our deepest joy. The son is not simply
                       saved; he is honored. The returned prodigal is not treated as
                       a hired servant, but as a privileged heir. Luke 15:22, 23.

                           Who are designated sons of God? Rom. 8:14, 15.




                          What witness do we have of our relationship with
                        God? Verse 16.


                           "You may have the witness of the Spirit that your ways
                        please God. This is obtained by believing in the Word of God,
                        by appropriating that Word to your own soul. This is eating
                        the bread of life, and this will bring eternal life. Compare
                        scripture with scripture. Study the representation of the life of
                        a true Christian as delineated in the Word of God."—Ellen G.

                          What logically follows if we are the children of God?
                        Rom. 8:17.


 THINK IT THROUGH          What can I see of God's truth, of God's mind, of God's
                        will, on my own? It involves leading, and I cannot lead
                        myself. Moreover, the Holy Spirit does not undertake to

                            Sonship does not exempt a person from suffering—sometimes
                         it may even cause suffering—as when we are called to suffer
                         because of our faith, especially in times of persecution. But we
                         need not look for "some great things," to bring the text into con-
                         formity with daily experience. No sufferings are small that have
                         power to affect the mind. The strife of tongues, the petty per-
                         secutions of home, the long continuance of some chronic dis-
                         ease, the anxiety connected with our occupation, may be doing
                         for us what greater trials did for the martyrs. We may be
                         sufferers in the intensity of emotion, even when the instruments
                         of suffering may not be the prison or the stake. The gospel,
                         then, does not imply immunity from suffering.

                            How do the sufferings of this present time compare
                         with the glory to be revealed? 2 Cor. 4:17, 18.


                            In writing of the saints' reward Ellen G. White says: "I was
                         shown the saints' reward, the immortal inheritance. Then I
                         was shown how much God's people had endured for the truth's
                         sake, and that they would count heaven cheap enough. They
                         reckoned that the sufferings of this present time were not
                         worthy to be compared with the glory which should be re-
                         vealed in them. The people of God in these last days will be
                         tried. But soon their last trial will come, and then they will
                         receive the gift of eternal life."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 432.

                            When will the manifestation of the sons of God take
                         place? 1 John 3:1-3.


 THINK IT THROUGH             Am I earnestly looking forward to this manifestation?
                         If I am, what am I doing to get myself and others ready?

                    the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For
                    we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope:
                    for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if
                    we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
       Rom. 8:22-25 wait for it."

                          The whole creation is worn out with the necessity to serve
                       the demands of man. The earth is digged, wasted, polluted, and
                       deprived of its rest. The rivers have lost their vitality, and even
                       the oceans are dying. Thus creation groans for the slavery we
                       have imposed upon it. We live in a groaning world, but we
                       must hope in the midst of this sorrow. The throes of our
                       sorrow may be sharp, but the coming of Jesus will bring joy
                       enough to offset them.

                          For what do we especially need the aid of the Holy
                       Spirit? Rom. 8:26.



                          God gives us hope and enables us to be patient in waiting.
                       But God has another Helper for us—the Holy Spirit. The Holy
                       Spirit dwelling in us, and knowing our wants better than we,
                       pleads in our prayers and raises us to a higher and holier desire
                       than we can express in words.

                           How does Paul express his hope? Rom. 8:31-39.



  THINK IT THROUGH         In this world, are we to be hidden away in Christ as

     "God owes no one anything. Therefore
     He does no one wrong although they
     [proud sinners] remain in their hardness
     of heart. But God has a way of helping
     the lowly and paying little attention to
     the great and the wise, no matter how
     furious they are." Martin Luther.

will have compassion on whom I will have compassion." Rom. 9:15.

                           Paul closes the previous chapter with the triumphant con-
                        fidence that "neither death, nor life" should be able to "sepa-
                        rate" him from "the love of God, which is in Christ." The list
                        of separating forces is comprehensive enough, but it is not ex-
                        haustive. The apostle omitted one potentiality which is con-
                        stantly separating men from the love of Christ—self. The
                        citadel which can resist any combination of external adversaries
                        may fall through the voluntary act of the garrison within. The
                        gate which cannot be battered down can be opened. Men cannot
                        be driven from Christ, but they can "go away." But Paul's
                        desire and prayer for Israel was that they might be saved.

                          What privileges of the Jews does Paul enumerate?
                        Rom. 9:3-5.



                           Upon what occasion did another devoted man of God
                        express a similar love for his people? Ex. 32:30-32.


                           "Moses supplicated God in behalf of sinning Israel. He did
                        not try to lessen their sin before God; he did not excuse them in
                        their sin. He frankly acknowledged that they had sinned a
                        great sin, and had made them gods of gold. Then he loses his
                        timidity, and the interest of Israel is so closely interwoven with
                        his life that he comes with boldness to God and prays for Him
                        to forgive His people. If their sin, he pleads, is so great that
                        God cannot forgive them, if their names must be blotted from
                        His book, he prays the Lord to blot out his name also."—

                           Some possess the name, the form, but deny the power. This
                        does not suggest that the word of God is without effect. Some
                        recognize its power, but to others who do not believe, the arm
                        of the Lord is not revealed.
                           All men are God's offspring (Acts 17:28), and thus His
                        children. The pure in heart, the benevolent, and the unrevenge-
                        ful, these in particular are His children (Matt. 5:43-45). And
                        if from among the wayward some arise to answer the call
                        toward purity, then all these are accepted as "children of God
                        by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:26. Having received Christ
                        they have received "power [authority] to become the sons of
                        God." John 1:12.

                           What does it mean to be a spiritual Jew? Gal. 3:29.


                           "As a son of Abraham, Christ became, in a special sense, heir
                        to the covenant promises. . . . By baptism we acquire kinship
                        to Christ, and through Him acquire the right to participate
                        in the promises made to Abraham....
                           "As spiritual children of Abraham, Christians become 'joint-

                          The seven words from Rom. 9:7 (above) are quoted from
                       the Septuagint version as used in Paul's day. Compare Heb.
                       11:18. There was, however, now a better promise about all the
                       families of the earth being blessed through a particular seed.
                       God promised that Abraham's seed would come through Isaac.
                       Gen. 21:12. In other words, the promise of a Messiah was now
                       held before them as their highest hope. Isaac and Jacob foresaw
                       the call through the promised Messiah.

                       brothers? Rom. 9:12, 13.

                          "Esau had no love for devotion, no inclination to a religious
                       life. The requirements that accompanied the spiritual birthright
                       were an unwelcome and even hateful restraint to him. The law
                       of God, which was the condition of the divine covenant with
                       Abraham, was regarded by Esau as a yoke of bondage. . . .
                          "Jacob had learned from his mother of the divine intimation
                       that the birthright should fall to him, and he was filled with

                            Paul now answers two objections that a Jew might raise to
                         his reasoning about the called seed through Isaac, and in
                         verse 19 he continues to answer their objections.

                           How does Paul illustrate the sovereignty of God?
                         Rom. 9:17, 18.


                            "Though this haughty tyrant [Pharaoh] had by his crimes
                         forfeited the mercy of God, yet his life had been preserved that
                         through his stubbornness the Lord might manifest His wonders
                         in the land of Egypt. The disposing of events is of God's provi-
                         dence. He could have placed upon the throne a more merciful
                         king, who would not have dared to withstand the mighty mani-
                         festations of divine power. But in that case the Lord's purposes
                         would not have been accomplished. His people were permitted
                         to experience the grinding cruelty of the Egyptians, that they
                         might not be deceived concerning the debasing influence of
                         idolatry. In His dealing with Pharaoh, the Lord manifested His
                         hatred of idolatry and His determination to punish cruelty and
                         oppression."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 267, 268.

                           What further illustration is used by Paul to stress
                         God's sovereignty? Rom. 9:19-23.

            Part 5      "Even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews only,
 GENTILES INCLUDED but also of the Gentiles? As He saith also in Hosea, 1 will
IN PURPOSE OF GOD call them My people, which were not My people; and her
                    beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to

                    are not My people; there shall they be called the children
      Rom. 9:24-26 of the living God."

                          Paul strongly intimated that the Jews as a nation were now
                       to be rejected as God's special people and that the Gentiles were
                       to be considered in a new light. This he knew was a most offen-
                       sive subject to many; and therefore he had shown, both from
                       God's word to Moses and from His dealings with Pharaoh, that
                       God had a right to communicate His blessings, or execute His
                       judgments, in His own way and according to His own wisdom.
                          "Called" is in the sense of the gospel summons, as in 1 Cor.
                       1:9.

                         Does He call Jews and Gentiles in the same way?
                       Rom. 9:24. What had Isaiah said about the remnant?
                       Rom. 9:27; Isa. 10:22.




                           What name is given to the once unfaithful who turn

                         What is God's basis in dealing with both Jew and

 THINK IT THROUGH • Those who give themselves to Christ become not only
                God's people, but God's children; not only His servants,
                but His heirs. He manifests the power of divine grace

                     a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whosoever
      Rom. 9:32, 33 believeth on Him shall not be ashamed."


                           "Why was this?" Paul asks why Israel had not achieved
                        righteousness. Then he answers his own question. It is because
                        the religion of the Jews was "not based on faith, but (as they
                        supposed) on deeds." NEB. The great lesson is for all genera-
                        tions, that righteousness can be attained only by faith. See
                        Rom. 3:21, 22.
                           Any kind of working to be righteous is men's way, and it
                        causes them to stumble. (See Rom. 14:13 on stumbling blocks.)

                           In what way is Christ considered to be a "stumbling
                        stone"? 1 Cor. 1:23, 24; 1 Peter 2:7, 8.


                           "How is Christ a "cornerstone"? 1 Peter 2:5, 6.


                           "To those who believe, Christ is the sure foundation. These
                        are they who fall upon the Rock and are broken. Submission
                        to Christ and faith in Him are here represented. . . .
                           "Our eternal safety depends upon our building upon the sure
                        foundation. Multitudes are today building upon foundations
                        that have not been tested. When the rain falls, and the tempest
                        rages, and the floods come, their house will fall, because it is

                        our own attitude is toward Christ. Am I clinging to Him

                      going about to establish their own righteousness, have
        Rom. 10:1-3 not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."

                           It was his "heart's desire." Not all today who are interested
                        in the salvation of men are influenced by Paul's great yearning
                        for Israel "that they might be saved." This great burden shows
                        that all included in this desire (9:3) were not beyond hope.
                        Compare Rom. 11:23.
                           What does Rom. 10:2 teach us about the relationship be-

                        us unsaved. Our zeal must be based on true knowledge.
                           "It was no ordinary desire that the apostle felt. Constantly
                        he was petitioning God to work in behalf of the Israelites who

                           "They were unable to discern the deep spiritual significance
                        of their symbolic service. In their self-righteousness they trusted
                        to their own works, to the sacrifices and ordinances themselves,
                        instead of relying upon the merits of Him to whom all these
                        things pointed. Thus 'going about to establish their own righ-

                      mands, Paul is saying, quoting Lev. 18:5 almost word for word.
                      Paul is using a Jewish concept that if you think salvation comes
                      by law, you must keep it absolutely literally, without grace and
                      mercy. Faith introduces both grace and mercy. The law is
                      spelled out in the Ten Commandments. We know them, and
                      if we desire eternal life, we must ask for God's grace and mercy
                      to keep them. Obedience follows faith and surrender. Thus the
                      law gives us a knowledge of God's will, and the gospel gives us
                      grace to conform.
                          "Many have said: 'You must do good works, and you will

                      and works go together, believing and doing are blended. The

                          What does "say not in thine heart," et cetera, mean?



                          To determine to find salvation by our own deeds is to act
                       as though Christ had never come down from heaven to teach
                       us faith and grace, as if we do not really believe that He rose
                       from the dead. Only by faith in what he has done can the
                       believer receive life and power to obey God in all things.

                          Could men be saved anciently by the righteousness
                       that "Moses describeth"?


 THINK IT THROUGH         Shall we place anyone outside of God's limit and
                       power to reach and save? For how many then should we
                       pray?

 THE BASIS OF FAITH       not believed? and how shall they believe in Him of whom

                             Now come four questions arising from the quotation in Rom.
                          10:14, 15.
                             What is the first answer? None can call on God unless they
                          believe in Him. See Heb. 11:6. Joel prophesied that men would
                          believe and call. Joel 2:32.
                             How can we believe in God whose voice we have not heard?
                          In great part through words spoken from burning hearts of
                          men and women chosen and sent, both by God and by men.

                          52:7, which prophecy found no worthwhile fulfillment in the
                          return from Babylon (especially not chapter 53) and must have
                          pointed forward to a great future day.
                             "The greatest work, the noblest effort, in which men can
                          engage, is to point sinners to the Lamb of God. True ministers
                          are colaborers with the Lord in the accomplishment of His
                          purposes. God says to them, Go, teach and preach Christ. In-
                          struct and educate all who know not of His grace, His good-

                            What was Israel's attitude toward the gospel they
                          had heard? Rom. 10:16, 18.


 THINK IT THROUGH             Is true devotion to Christ, in my thinking, a luxury of
                          first-century believers, which can find no lasting home
                          in our modern civilization? Does my heart find in Him,
                          as in no one else, its rest? What is my attitude toward

  ISRAEL'S LACK OF will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people,

                   very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought

     Rom. 10:19-21 saying people."

                          The question expects a negative answer when rendered, "Can
                      it be that Israel failed to recognize the message?" The quotations
                      prove that they should have known.
                          "Moses saith," et cetera, is from Deut. 32:21. In verse 20
                      Moses called them "children in whom is no faith."
                          The words, "I will provoke," do not suggest provoking to
                      anger, but an attempt to stir them up by showing mercy and
                      love toward other peoples. See Rom. 9:25.
                          What should the expression "I was found of them that sought
                      Me not" have done to Jewish thinking? They should have re-
                       joiced in such an accessible, merciful God. Now it is God in
                       person who is making Himself to be found, even when the man
                      is not seeking after Him.

                          Why could the Jews not claim that they had never
                       heard of righteousness by faith?

                          "The prophet Isaiah, looking down through the centuries
                       and witnessing the rejection of prophet after prophet and finally
                       of the Son of God, was inspired to write concerning the accept-
                       ance of the Redeemer by those who had never before been
                       numbered among the children of Israel."—The Acts of the
                       Apostles, page 375.

                          Another man made the same charge as Paul made.
                       Acts 7:51-53.


  THINK IT THROUGH        There are in everyday life two ways of waking a man
                       out of deep slumber. We may shout in his ear and rudely
                       shake his person; or we may bring a lamp into the room
                       and leave it burning. The latter is the way God most
                       often works. Has He left a lamp burning for me that I
                       have not yet noticed?

          Rom. 11:1, 2 His people which He:foreknew."
                              "Cast away His people" is from the Septuagint version of
                           Ps. 94:14 ("for the .Lord will not cast off His people"), hence
                           the answer to Paul's question here is that God did not cast
                           away His remnant in Israel who were of faith. However, hence-
                           forth they were no longer to be saved as a nation. Even when
                           admitted into the kingdom of God, into which they still might
                           enter by "the obedience of faith," they should have no pre-
                           eminence over their believing Gentile brethren. John 10 : 16.
                              "Notwithstanding Israel's failure as a nation, there remained
                           among them a goodly remnant of such as should be saved. At
                           the time of the Saviour's advent there were faithful men and
                           women who had received with gladness the message of John
                           the Baptist, and had thus been led to study anew the prophe-

                           was founded, it was composed of these faithful Jews who
                           recognized Jesus of Nazareth as the One for whose advent they
                           had been longing."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 376, 377.

                              What was Paul seeking to prove by citing his own
                          tribal descent?



                             That he was of a remnant of a tribe (Benjamin) that re-
                          turned from captivity. See Ezra 4:1; 10:9.

                             What experience does .the apostle cite to establish his
                          point further? Rom. 11:2-4.



                    0.       Why hasn't God cast away His people if they are
                          unfaithful?



 THINK IT THROUGH            There are many who are called. The few are the

                        relaxes until it has lifted us from it. Jesus "poured out His

                        to save himself. The Pharisee' said,' "God, I thank Thee, that

                        "God be merciful to me a,sinner." Verse 13. The gospel repeats,
                        "By grace are ye saved." Eph. 2:8. And it adds the reason:
                        "Not of works, lest any man should boast." Verse 9.

                           What disappointment must necessarily come to Israel,

          THE SOVEREIGNTY AND MERCY OF GOD                                    9

       strength can overthrow." Ellen

                            The Jews stumbled at "that stumbling stone" and at the
                         gospel of Christ, and in consequence of their unbelief, preachers
                         of the first century turned to the Gentiles. However, God makes
                         all conditions serve the good of His elect. If the individual
                         Jews stand, it is all to the good. But if they fall, God's pro-
                         gram still moves on. If they rise again and stand as individuals
                         saved by the merits of Jesus, this, too, will be marvelous in our
                         eyes.

                            Is it possible to "fall" and rise again as Christians?
                         1 Cor. 10:12; Prov. 24:16.



                             What did Paul hope to accomplish through the gospel
                         to the Gentiles? Rom. 11:13, 14.



                           What comparison is drawn between the casting away
                         and the receiving of the Hebrew people? Rom. 11:15.



                            Rejection, or casting away, describes what happened to the
                         nation which might have become the light of the world. As a
                         result the world was enlightened by Gentile evangelism.
 THINK IT THROUGH            A stumbling block is that which causes men to fall
                         into a snare or a trap. The gospel, when believed, raises
                         men to heaven; when rejected, it remains only for men
                         to fall into the pit of eternal death. To those who have
                         faith the grace of God brings salvation; to those bound
                         by unbelief, it is incomprehensible. What is it for me?

                           "Firstfruit" is a term referring to the portion of dough re-
                        served for the making of a cake for the priests. See Num. 15:17-
                        21; compare Rom. 8:23. The whole lump becomes holy, so to
                        speak, in the Christian church.

                          Why were the old branches, cut off? Why were new
                        ones taking their places? Rom. 11:20.



                           What custom was to be followed by the Israelites when
                        they Came into the Promised Land? Num. 15:18-21.


                           God commanded these ceremonies to teach the Jews that
                        they received all blessings from the Lord. They were ways
                        by which they could have recognized Jesus as the Messiah.
                           "When the early Christian church was founded, it was com-
                        posed of these faithful Jews who recognized Jesus of Nazareth
                        as the one for whose advent they had been longing. It is to
                        this- remnant that Paul refers when he writes, 'If the firstfruit
                        be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are
                        the branches!"—The Acts of the Apostles, page 377.
 THINK IT THROUGH          God had to break off the branches of natural Israel
                        because they failed to spread the knowledge of salvation
                        among the nations. Am I better than they in the work of

              Part 3      "For if God spared not the natural branches, take
      GOODNESS AND heed lest He also spare not thee. Behold therefore the
     SEVERITY OF GOD goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, sever-
                       ity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His
                       goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they
                       also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted
                       in: for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou wert
                       cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert
                       grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how
                       much more shall these, which be the natural branches,
        Rom. 11:21-24 be grafted into their own olive tree?"

                             The "fear" in verse 20 is here given a reason. God is not
                          disposed to tolerate in His vineyard those who only cumber
                          the ground. If an Israelite be left out of the reckoning, what
                          will happen to a Canaanite, or a hyprocrite, or a rebel? God's
                          goodness and severity are conditional on the faith or unbelief
                          of the branches, whether they are natural or grafted.

                             For what purpose does Paul mention the two char-
                          acteristics of God? Rom. 11:22.



                            What was the underlying cause of Israel's rejection?
                          Rom. 11:25.



                             What provision will yet be effective for Israel? Rom.

                          "For the fathers' sakes" probably means that the promises
                       to the faithful fathers were still regarded by God as open to the
                       children who elected to accept them, and thus become children
                       of the election, or the elect children of God. They are still
                       "beloved of God."

                          How will divine mercy extended to the Gentiles affect

                          The Gentile nations were then heathen, but now number
                       millions of believers; the Jews became hostile in refusing faith
                       in Jesus, but many of them will yet find a way to accept Him
                       through the mercy extended to the Gentiles. Verse 32 states
                       the divine prophecy, which is that God has included the whole
                       world as candidates for salvation by the exercise of individual
                       faith.

                           What is said of God's wisdom? Rom. 11:33.




 THINK IT THROUGH           God loved the world for His own sake. He loves sin-
                       ners also for His Son's sake. His love to fathers is remem-
                       bered in behalf of their children. Lev. 26:42. Children

                           "Who hath known the mind of the Lord?" is taken from
                        Isa. 40:13. Our knowledge is theoretical, but God's wisdom is
                        practical. His gifts are not given for something He first re-

                        sin.

                            What Old Testament characters does Paul quote? Isa.
                         40:13; Job 41:11.

                            "We are wholly dependent upon God, and our faith is
                         strengthened by still believing, though we cannot see God's
                         purpose in His dealing with us, or the consequence of this
                         dealing."—Temperance, page 195.

                         of Christ? Rom. 11:36. Compare Col. 1:16.


                            "If Christ made all things, He existed before all things. The
                         words spoken in regard to this are so decisive that no one need
                         be left in doubt. Christ was God essentially, and in the highest
                         sense. He was with God from all eternity, God over all, blessed
                         forevermore."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

 THINK IT THROUGH           Man knows only what God reveals. Do we talk as
                         though we know God's mind on everything? Christ is the
                         fullest revelation of God, but do we know all the mys-

                                                                                 May 26
           Part 6     "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
         CALL TO God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
    SACRIFICE AND acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
  NONCONFORMITY And be not conformed to this world: but be ye trans-
                   formed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove
                   what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of
      Rom. 12:1, 2 God."

                          Paul now makes practical application of the doctrine of righ-
                       teousness by faith by reference to the Old Testament sacrifices
                       —which to have any moral value must be dead. The sacrifice
                       of which Paul speaks must be presented living. The believer is
                       therefore a priest who lays upon the altar his own living body.
                       And as it was the work of the Jewish priest not only to present
                       the sacrifice, but to see that it was without blemish and properly
                       offered, so the Christian's sacrifice is to be kept from all contact
                       with the degrading or sensual. Hence it is to be "acceptable to
                       God" as our reasonable service.
                          "In that ancient ritual, which was the gospel in symbol, no
                       blemished offering could be brought to God's altar. The sacri-
                       fice that was to represent Christ must be spotless. The Word
                       of God points to this as an illustration of what His children
                       are to be—`a living sacrifice,' holy and without blemish,' well-
                       pleasing to God.'"—The Ministry of Healing, page 130.

                          How does Paul esteem the human body? 1 Cor. 6:13,
                       15-20; 7:4, 34; 2 Cor. 5:6, 8, 10.




                           Is God's will for each individual fixed by predeter-
                       mined purpose, or is it related to the believer's obedience
                       to the commandments? Matt. 7:21; Acts 13:22; Eph. 5:17.



 THINK IT THROUGH         The priestly service is required of all believers without
                       distinction. Have I been anointed with the Holy Spirit?
                       Have I been called and separated and consecrated to
                       God's service?

         EXHORTATIONS TO CHURCH MEMBERS 1O


      "The Christian, filled with the
      knowledge of an eternal love,
      is told how not to dream, but to
      serve, with all the mercies of God
      for his motive." Handley C. G.
      Moule.


  "For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the
same office: so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and everyone members
one of another." Rom. 12:4, 5.


  In the latter portion of his letter to the            LESSON OUTLINE
Romans Paul deals with the practical ap-
plication of the gospel in relation to certain      Exhortations to Humility
problems faced by the followers of Christ           and Unity
from that age to the end of time.                   Rom. 12:3-5
  In sending these exhortations to the
church, the apostle bases them on the pro-       2. Brotherly Love
gressive development of the Christian ex-           Rom. 12:9, 10
perience as presented in the preceding chap-
ters.                                            3. Sympathy and Humility

            Part 1    "For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every
     EXHORTATIONS man that is among you, not to think of himself more
      TO HUMILITY highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, accord-
       AND UNITY ing as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
                   For as we have many members in one body, and all

                   are one body in Christ, and everyone members one of
       Rom. 12:3-5 another."

                            If a man thinks more highly of himself than he ought to
                         think, he is likely to despise the service to which God has
                         called him, and thus seek to undertake work which is beyond
                         his God-given ability. The plan of God will be marred and the
                         person humiliated, as the task is passed to more humble hands.
                         In Christ's church the surest way to honorable promotion is by
                         rendering prompt, earnest, humble service in the position to
                         which one has been called.

                            What exhortation did Paul give the Roman Christians
                         in regard to exercising their God-given capabilities? Rom.
                         12:6-8.



                            "The Lord desires His chosen servants to learn how to unite
                         together in harmonious effort. It may seem to some that the
                         contrast between their gifts and the gifts of a fellow laborer
                         is too great to allow them to unite in harmonious effort; but
                         when they remember that there are varied minds to be reached,
                         and that some will reject the truth as it is presented by one
                         laborer, only to open their hearts to God's truth as it is pre-
                         sented in a different manner by another laborer, they will hope-
                         fully endeavor to labor together in unity."—Testimonies, Vol.
                         9, p. 145.



 THINK IT THROUGH            Is there danger that I might go to the other extreme
                         and discount my abilities? Did any Bible characters do
                         this? See Judges 6:15; 1 Sam. 9:21; 1 Kings 19:4.



   "The forms of unbelief are varied,        earnestly and zealously you may labor,

   BROTHERLY LOVE is evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned
                    one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring
     Rom. 12:9, 10 one another."

                           When we truly love, there is no need for boasting. If we
                        have love, it will shine forth in the life. Actors represent char-
                        acters which are not their own without intending to deceive.
                        But in proportion to the excellence of their performance is
                        the degree of illusion in the person who beholds it. We should
                        be certain that we are not merely acting a part in the kindness
                        we show to men or in the reverence we show to God. We
                        should feel what we profess to feel. We should think as we
                        seem to think. Otherwise our lives will be little else than stage
                        play.
                           "The fact that we are under so great obligation to Christ
                        places us under the most sacred obligation to those whom He
                        died to redeem. We are to manifest toward them the same
                        sympathy, the same tender compassion and unselfish love, which
                        Christ has manifested toward us. Selfish ambition, desire for
                        supremacy, will die when Christ takes possession of the affec-
                        tions."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 170.

                           What are some other attributes manifested by the
                        Christian? Rom. 12:1 1-13.


                            "These admonitions have been strangely neglected. Even
                        among those who profess to be Christians true hospitality is
                        little exercised. Among our own people the opportunity of show-
                        ing hospitality is not regarded as it should be, as a privilege
                        and blessing. There is altogether too little •sociability, too little
                        of a disposition to make room for two or three more at the

                           There are some who rejoice only over their own happiness,
                        who weep only over their own miseries. If they are in good
                        health, if they are doing well in business, if the world smiles
                        upon them, they are happy. If they are sick, or poor, or ignored,
                        they are miserable. A thoroughly selfish man grieves more over
                        an attack of dyspepsia or the loss of a twenty-dollar bill than
                        over much greater trouble that comes to another.
                           "Christ identified Himself with the necessities of His people.
                        Their needs and their sufferings were His. He says: 'I was
                        anhungered, and ye gave Me meat: . . . I was sick, and ye vis-

                        followers of Christ."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 186.

                           How did Jesus identify Himself with those who re-
                        joiced and with those who wept? John 2:1-11; 11:35.


                           "Though He was the Son of God, yet He had taken human
                        nature upon Him, and He was moved by human sorrow. His
                        tender, pitying heart is ever awakened to sympathy by suffer-

                        that rejoice."—The Desire of Ages, page 533.

                           What kind of a reputation should the Christian have

      Rom. 12:19-21     not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."

                           The common practice is to return evil for evil. "Give him as
                        good as he sends." "Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."
                        "Be six to his half dozen." There are a score of proverbs which
                        suggest meeting evil with evil. But does any man dare to stand
                        before God on those terms?
                           "Give place unto wrath. Literally, 'give place unto the wrath.'
                        The definite article before 'wrath' indicates that the reference
                        is to the wrath of God. . . . This interpretation is confirmed
                        by the following words, 'vengeance is Mine; I will repay.'
                        `Give place' means 'give room' for the avenging wrath of God
                        to work. Christians are never to attempt to seek revenge upon
                        those who treat them unjustly. They should leave the matter
                        with God."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rom. 12:19.

                            . And there is wonderful power in silence. Words spoken
                        in reply to one who is angry sometimes serve only to exasper-
                        ate. But anger met with silence, in a tender, forbearing spirit,
                        quickly dies away."—The Ministry of Healing, page 486.

                          In no society or government will we find an ideal situation.
                       We must remember that the basis of society is mutual forbear-
                       ance and self-sacrifice for the common good. The apostle's
                       teaching shows that we are bound to render obedience on the
                       ground that government is an "ordinance of God."
                          "Let every man be obedient to the civil government under
                       which the providence of God has cast his lot. For there is no
                       power but of God. As God is the origin of power, and the
                       supreme Governor of the universe, He delegates authority to
                       whomsoever He will; and though in many cases the governor
                       himself may not be of God, yet civil government is of Him;
                       for without this there could be no society, no security, no pri-
                       vate property; all would be confusion and anarchy, and the
                       habitable world would soon be depopulated."—Clarke's Com-

                       Rom. 13:3, 4.


                           "In general, rulers are not to be dreaded except when wrong
                       is done. In actuality, of course, not all rulers belong to this
                       class, for many of them have persecuted the good; for example,
                       Nero, the Roman emperor at the time Paul wrote this epistle,
                       who was later responsible for Paul's martyrdom. Nevertheless,
                       it is generally true that those who are virtuous have nothing to
                       fear from civil authorities."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rom.
                       13:3.

                          What should be the Christian's motive as he seeks to
                       be a good citizen? 1 Peter 2:13, 14.



 THINK IT THROUGH         Do I obey the civil powers from a sense of duty? Or
                       am I afraid of punishment? Am I strictly honest when
                       making up my income tax returns? What is my attitude
                       toward speed laws and traffic ordinances?

     Rom. 13:5-7 custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."

                           The Christian's subjection to civil authority is necessary
                        because it is a divine ordinance. It is also essential to the gen-
                        eral good. If society is to be effective, it must have laws and
                        people to enforce them.
                           "If public order is part of a divine purpose, it is an exceed-
                        ingly serious thing to set ourselves against it. It means that we
                        have willfully preferred our private aims to the well-being of
                        society; we have exalted our own preferences above the needs
                        of the collective whole. This kind of gratuitous individualism
                        is destructive of all the values which a community exists to
                        serve; and in a tradition where its virtues have been praised
                        and its dangers overlooked, it is well to ponder the seriousness
                        with which Paul regarded irresponsible opposition to the state."

                        state? Acts 5:29.


                           "When the laws of men conflict with the word and law of
                        God, we are to obey the latter, whatever the consequences may
                        be. The law of our land requiring us to deliver a slave to his
                        master, we are not to obey; and we must abide the consequences

          THE TIME     than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day
                       is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,
     Rom. 13:11, 12    and let us put on the armor of light."

                           It is a sad fact that many professing Christians seem to be
                       asleep so far as their personal obligations and responsibilities to
                       others go. They are insensible to the sins and sorrows of those
                       around them. They say, "What is to be will be; the Lord's will
                       be done. Some will be saved, others will be lost." The nearer
                       we come to the return of our Lord, the more awake we should
                       be and the more zealous in advancing His cause on earth.
                           "The coming of the Lord is nearer than when we first be-
                       lieved. The great controversy is nearing its end. Every report
                       of calamity by sea or land is a testimony to the fact that the
                       end of all things is at hand. Wars and rumors of wars declare
                       it. Is there a Christian whose pulse does not beat with quickened
                       action as he anticipates the great events opening before us?"
                       —Evangelism, page 219.

                        of light? Rom. 13:12.



                           How is the Christian to walk? Rom. 13:13.



                           How may the Christian "put on" the Lord Jesus? Rom.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Being wakened out of sleep (Rom. 13:11) is a term
                        which can be applied only to Christians. The unconverted
                        are dead in their trespasses and sins and require not an
                        awakening, but a resurrection. In what way may I be
                        asleep, and what can I do about it?

         TOLERANT all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not

                     him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God
        Rom. 14:1-3 hath received him."

                           The so-called law of Moses was actually given by God. Many
                        of its features pointed forward to the death of Christ, when
                        type would meet antitype, and the endless round of rites and
                        ceremonies would lose their significance. It is not surprising
                        that some Jewish converts to Christianity objected to the elimi-
                        nation of these features of the law which had been in force for
                        fifteen centuries. To them it was a matter of conscience. And
                        the man who regards his conscience must be respected even
                        when he is wrong. The strong should not put a stumbling block
                        in the way of the weak. The problem of eating meats offered
                        to idols probably entered in here also, a decision that would
                        vitally affect the Gentile believers. In this passage, Paul is
                        pleading for toleration of one another. He also suggests a sur-
                        render of what strong Christians regarded as their "right" in
                        order not to cause weaker brothers to stumble.

                          What question did Paul ask concerning judging others?
                        Rom. 14:4.


                           "True Christians will not exult in exposing the faults and
                        deficiencies of others. They will turn away from vileness and
                        deformity, to fix the mind upon that which is attractive and
                        lovely. To the Christian every act of faultfinding, every word
                        of censure or condemnation, is painful."—Testimonies, Vol. 5,
                        p. 96.

                           What similar admonition did Jesus give? Matt. 7:1-3.



 THINK IT THROUGH          When my brethren do things which I feel are wrong,
                        how do I respond? How do I react when they condemn
                        my practices? How only can peace between us be pre-
                        served?


   "More and more we ought to recog-        also make us more charitable in con-
nize that we are answerable to God—         ceding that our brother too is answer-

       Rom. 14:5, 6 thanks."

                           There is no evidence that the apostle was here referring to
                        the seventh-day Sabbath. The whole discussion was in refer-
                        ence to observances that were distinctly Jewish. The Sabbath
                        was not in this classification, since it was instituted for all man-
                        kind at creation. Again Paul is pleading for tolerance. The
                        thought is that we should not try to rein up someone else and
                        expect him to follow the dictates of another's conscience.
                           "They climb upon the judgment seat, and as soon as they
                        see one of their brethren and sisters, they look to find some-
                        thing to criticize. This is one of the most effectual means of
                        becoming narrow-minded and of dwarfing spiritual growth.
                        God would have them step down from the judgment seat, for
                        He has never placed them there."—Child Guidance, page 429.

                            To what kind of "day" is Paul referring here? Lev.
                        •16:29-31; 23:24, 39.


                           The first and seventh days of the Jewish Passover week were
                        to be "sabbaths." Fifty days later came the Feast of Weeks,
                        another "sabbath." Then the tenth day of the seventh month
                        was always to be a "sabbath." That these were not seventh-
                        day-of-the-week Sabbaths is evident from the fact that they
                        fell on the same day of the month each year. These ceremonial
                        "sabbaths" were still significant to the Jewish Christians, but
                        meant little or nothing to the Gentiles.

                             What wise admonition did Paul give the Roman Chris-
                         tians? Rom. 14:5 (last part).


 THINK IT THROUGH           Is it best for me to remain silent when I am in the com-

          INFLUENCE
           Rom. 14:7        God turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his
                         friends. A completely selfish man may appear very religious if
                         he goes to church, reads religious books, and now and then
                         makes a contribution to some worthy cause. But every con-
                         secrated Christian is a leavening element, placed in the world
                         to proclaim and extend the truth. As John Donne reminds us,
                         "No man is an island, entire of itself."

                            To whom do we live and die? What price has been
                   1$    paid for all? Rom. 14:8, 9.


                           "Our life is not our own, never was, and never can be. The
                         question of importance to us is, Is our life interwoven with
                         that of Jesus? . . . We shall come into judgment for the very
                         atmosphere that surrounds the soul, for it is vital and is influ-

                         Know Him, page 90.

                            In view of the price paid equally for everyone, what
                         pertinent questions does Paul ask? Rom. 14:10-13.


                           "The apostle presses home the great thought of the lesson
                         the third time—judge not; condemn not. . . . If we assume to
                         be judge, we put ourselves in the place of God, the only Judge
                         and Lawgiver. God forbid that we should thus do."—Milton
                         Charles Wilcox, Studies in Romans, pages 128, 129.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Does the thought of others occupy only a very small
                         place in my devotions? Do I thank God for my brethren?
                         Would Job's experience be mine if I prayed more for
                         others?

     Rom. 14:14, 15 Christ died."

                          There are a number of practices which we should shun, not
                       because our conscience would condemn us if we followed them,
                       or because they would prove harmful in themselves, but be-
                       cause our example might be such as would mislead others. At
                       the same time we have no right to be conscience for another.
                       We can give the light to another, but we cannot decide what
                       he should do with it.
                          Paul is not referring to things which are morally wrong, but
                       to practices which may be debatable. To grieve a brother by
                       what one does is to sin against the law of love.

                           On what will Christian emphasis rest? Rom. 14:16-18.




                           "Take heed lest by your example you place other souls in
                        peril. It is a terrible thing to lose our own soul, but to pursue

                            Babies are born selfish. Very small children develop strong
                         attachments to their toys and strongly object to sharing them
                         with others. The Jews' response to their extraordinary privileges
                         was to develop selfishness and exclusiveness. The idea ad-
                         vanced by Jesus that Gentiles might sit down in the kingdom
                         of God while the Jews would be thrust out, filled them with
                         rage.

                            What trait of Jesus should the Christian especially
                         seek to emulate? Rom. 15:1-7.




                            "An example is more forceful than an exhortation; but even
                         more important than the example is the inspiration which en-
                         ables us to follow it. Paul finds both in Jesus Christ. The dis-

      THE GENTILES edge, able also to admonish one another. Nevertheless,
                     brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in
                     some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace
                     that is given to me of God, that I should be the minister
                     of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of
                     God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be accept-
      Rom. 15:14-16 able, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost."

                          Goodness and knowledge are not always combined in this
                       world, but both are found in Christ. These constitute the heart
                       and head of the_new man (Eph. 3:19; 4:24), and are to be
                       taken in-Th-6r fullness. Paul's largehearted love is shown by
                       the terms he employs. He obviously delights in pointing to the
                       depth of experience the believer may enjoy in Christ.

                           How only may the believer experience this infilling
                        of goodness and knowledge? Eph. 3:17-21.



                           In what personal experience did Paul glory? Rom.
                        15:17-19.

                         not heard shall understand. For which cause also I have

                         see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way
                         thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with
        Rom. 15:20-24    your company."

                            At the time when Paul was converted, he had already made
                         his mark in the world. As a member of the Sanhedrin, the
                         Jewish supreme court, he had taken a leading part in hunting
                         down, imprisoning, and even putting to death, members of
                         what was contemptuously called the sect of the Nazarenes.
                         When he changed sides and joined the army of the Lord, he
                         asked for no position of power in the church at Jerusalem. He
                         had one great purpose, to preach the gospel in the "regions
                         beyond." Here we see a marked similarity to the spirit that
                         later motivated David Livingstone. Like Paul, Livingstone re-
                         jected the idea that he settle down in some comfortable, well-
                         established mission and spend his life there. The great unknown
                         beckoned him. Both walked thousands of miles. Both died in
                         harness.

                           What experience inspired Paul to carry the gospel into
                         Europe? Acts 16:10.


                            "Paul defends his practice of preaching where Christ's name
                         was unknown by noting that the procedure was a fulfillment
                         of OT prediction."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rom. 15:21.

 THINK IT THROUGH           After Jesus' work on earth was done, He could look
                         forward to satisfaction at seeing the travail of His soul.
                         May I do the same? On what conditions?

            Part 4      "But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the
    PAUL'S MISSION saints. For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia
     TO JERUSALEM to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which
                     are at Jerusalem. It hath pleased them verily; and their
                     debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made
                     partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to
                     minister unto them in carnal things. When therefore I
                     have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit,
                     I will come by you into Spain. And I am sure that, when
                     I come unto you, I shall come in the fullness of the bless-
                     ing of the gospel of Christ. Now I beseech you, brethren,
                     for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the
                     Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers
      Rom. 15:25-30 to God for me."

                           When the apostles in Jerusalem gave Paul and Barnabas
                        the right hand of fellowship and sent them out to preach the
                        gospel, they asked them always to remember the poor in Jeru-
                        salem, a thing Paul did faithfully. Gal. 2:10. Although many
                        of the Gentiles were poor, they gave willingly to this cause.
                        Paul asked the Roman believers to pray that this gift might
                        be accepted kindly by the Judean brethren.

                           Although Paul was a minister, what did he ask the
                        believers to do for him? Rom. 15:30-32. Compare 2 Thess.
                        3:2.



                            Paul was a mighty man of prayer. "Pray without ceasing,"
                         he admonished the Thessalonians. There can be no doubt but
                         that he carried out his own instruction.
                            "Perseverance in prayer has been made a condition of re-

                         experience. . . . Unceasing prayer is the unbroken union of the
                         soul with God, so that life from God flows into our life; and
                         from our life, purity and holiness flow back to God."—Steps to

                                                                                June 15
              Part 5     "I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a ser-
     PHEBE, PRISCILLA, vant of the church which is at Cenchrea: that ye receive
        AND AQUILA her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her
                     in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath
                     been a succorer of many, and of myself also. Greet
                     Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: who have
                     for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not
                     only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gen-
         Rom. 16:1-4 tiles."

                           It seems evident that Phebe, a Greek name that means
                        "bright, radiant," was the bearer of Paul's letter. She was
                        presumably fairly wealthy, and she was going to Rome on
                        private business. She was an active church member. The Greek
                        word translated "servant" is the same that is translated in some
                        other places as "deacon." This suggests that she may have been
                        a deaconess.
                           Priscilla and Aquila had apparently run grave risks for Paul's
                        sake. This is one of the few instances in the Bible in which the
                        woman's name is given first, indicating, perhaps, that she was
                        a person of great ability and that she may have done more for
                        the church than her husband.

                           What indicates Paul's intimate knowledge of the be-
                        lievers in Rome? Rom. 16:5-16.


                           "Here is a window in Paul's heart. He was apparently dis-
                        owned by his own kindred, yet, as the Lord had promised, he
                        had mothers, sisters, and brothers a hundredfold. What a con-
                        trast there is between the spirit of this chapter and that of the
                        mere disputant cr theologian, the stoic or monk!"—F. B. Meyer,
                        Through the Bible Day by Day, pages 99, 100.

                           Against whom did Paul warn the church? Rom. 16:
                        17-19.


 THINK IT THROUGH          How did Paul know so much about the Roman Chris-
                        tians? Has all of his correspondence been preserved in
                        the New Testament?

                          Of what coming deliverance did Paul remind the Ro-
                        man believers? Rom. 16:20. Compare Gen. 3:15.



                           "The church will yet see troublous times. She will prophesy
                        in sackcloth. But although she must meet heresies and persecu-
                        tions, although she must battle with the infidel and the apostate,
                        yet by the help of God she is bruising the head of Satan. . . .
                           "The gospel message does not win a single soul to Christ, or
                        make its way to a single heart, without wounding the head of
                        Satan. Whenever a captive is wrenched from his grasp, deliv-
                        ered from his oppression, the tyrant is defeated."—Testimonies,

                             Who had heard of the obedience of the Roman be-

                     known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed

                           "Faith is the condition upon which God has seen fit to

                        God pardons his sin and justifies him freely. The repentant

                           Such expressions as "dead to sin" and "alive to God," having
                        "Christ in you" and "you in Christ," are frequently found in
                        the epistles of Paul. The thought is that Christ must have full
                        control of the believer.
                           "The soul must be cleansed from vanity and pride, and
                        vacated of all that has held it in possession, and Christ must

                            The crucifixion of self comes first. Then comes the burial in
                        the precious blood of Jesus, who "hath loved us, and washed
                        us from our sins in His own blood." Rev. 1:5. This is followed
                        by the resurrection, as the Christian rises to walk in newness of
                        life.
 THINK IT THROUGH          Now and then we hear of someone who was literally
                        "buried alive." Is there any danger that someone may

        NOW NO which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,
   CONDEMNATION but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in
                     Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and
                     death. For what the law could not do, in that it was
                     weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the
                     likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the
                     flesh."
                         "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are
     Rom. 8:1-3, 14 the sons of God."

                          In the latter part of the seventh chapter of Romans, Paul
                       presents a rather hopeless outlook. No matter how much he
                       desired to do the will of God, he found need for a power out-
                       side himself to carry out those desires. He found the answer!
                       To his despairing cry, "Who shall deliver me?" come the
                       reassuring words, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
                       Rom. 7:24, 25. The delivered saint loses his sense of condemna-
                       tion and becomes a son of God on one condition: that he sub-
                       merge his will and accept the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
                          "We may go to Jesus and be cleansed, and stand before the
                       law without shame and remorse. 'There is therefore now no
                       condemnation.' ...
                          "Through Jesus the fallen sons of Adam become 'sons of
                       God.' ... The Christian's life should be one of faith, of victory,
                       and joy in God. 'Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
                       world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even
                       our faith.' . . . Truly spoke God's servant Nehemiah: 'The joy
                       of the Lord is your strength.'"—The Great Controversy, page
                       477.

                           Through whom does Christian freedom come? John
                        8:36.



                           What brings condemnation? John 3:19.



  THINK IT THROUGH        There is no feeling in a corpse. Do I lack a feeling of

                          While the spirit of independence, of strife for supremacy, and
                       of disorganization is seen everywhere, God's church is to be
                       different, characterized by its unity and its perfect oneness in
                       Christ.
                          "The world is filled with strife for the supremacy. The
                       spirit of pulling away from fellow-laborers, the spirit of dis-
                       organization, is in the very air we breathe. By some, all efforts
                       to establish order are regarded as dangerous,—as a restriction
                       of personal liberty, and hence to be feared as popery. These de-
                       ceived souls regard it a virtue to boast of their freedom to
                       think and act independently. They declare . . . that they are
                       amenable to no man. I have been instructed that it is Satan's
                       special effort to lead men to feel that God is pleased to have
                       them choose their own course, independent of the counsel of
                       their brethren."—Gospel Workers, page 486.
                          "The unity that exists between Christ and His disciples does
                       not destroy the personality of either. . . . By partaking of the
                       Spirit of God, conforming to the law of God, man becomes

       Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering
                     North American Division

                           June 24, 1972

    It is normal for each world division to receive an overflow offer-
ing about every three years. An exception to this rule always is the
North American Division. The last offering scheduled there was
eight years ago, the second quarter of 1964. We just don't think of
North America as a mission field because it is the source of a large
percentage of denominational funds. However, there are groups
of people in North America who very much need the material bene-
fits money can buy as a means of spreading the gospel and hasten-
ing Jesus' return.
  The Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering will be divided three
ways:
   (1) To give assistance to the medical work of the young clinic
       at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Canada.
   (2) To build a boys' dormitory for Pine Forge Academy, Penn-
       sylvania, one of two boarding academies for the denomina-
       tion's black youth in North America.
   (3) To supply urgently needed equipment for vocational and
       industrial training at our North American Indian school in
       Holbrook, Arizona.
   This clinic and these schools will give you special thanks as you
give liberally this Thirteenth Sabbath.

               Lessons for the Third Quarter of 1972
        Sabbath School members who have not received an adult
    Lesson Quarterly for the third quarter of 1972 will be helped
    by the following outline in studying for the first lesson. The
    title of the series is "Christ and the Sabbath." The title of the
    first lesson is "Christ's Sign." The memory verse is Exodus
      1:13.

r3      The outline is as follows: (1) Christ the Creator. John
    1:10; (2) Creator Existent From Eternity. John 1:1, 3, 14;
    (3) Redemption Is Re-creation. 2 Cor. 5:17, RSV; (4) A Pre-
    determined Plan. 2 Tim. 1:9; (5) A Sign of the Creator. Ex.
    31:15-17; (6) A Sign of the Saviour. Eze. 20:12.
