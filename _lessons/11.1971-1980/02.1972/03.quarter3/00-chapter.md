       Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering
                      September 30, 1972
                     Southern Asia Division

   On September 30 the Southern Asia Division will benefit from
the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering Overflow. According to General
Conference policy, the overflow is 25 percent of the total offering
taken for Thirteenth Sabbath. The Southern Asia Division plans
to use this money for the addition of much needed facilities at the
following educational institutions:
   Burma Union Bible Seminary
    Kottarakara High School, India
    Roorkee High School, India
    Recognizing that the future of the work in Southern Asia is de-
pendent to a large extent on the proper education of the young
people of the church, for a number of years this division has de-
voted most of the overflow offerings to education. This has already
begun to pay off.
    For the generosity of Sabbath School members the world around,
Southern Asia is indeed very grateful. Now again in this time of
great need we anticipate that you will come to the aid of the young
people of the church. For this September 30 overflow, Southern Asia
thanks you in advance.

                   THIRD QUARTER, 1972
                             INTRODUCTION
    Regardless of what a person's religious views are, he knows that a wave of
lawlessness, rebellion, and strife is sweeping over the world. This is a prelude
to that climactic, world-ending time of trouble spoken of in Daniel 12:1.
   This in turn should make Sabbath keepers keenly aware that now is the
time to proclaim the Sabbath more fully, as mentioned in Early Writings,
page 33: "At the commencement of the time of trouble, we were filled with
the Holy Ghost as we went forth and proclaimed the Sabbath more fully."
(Italics supplied.)
   The Sabbath truth must be preached more extensively and in more and
more geographical areas. Also it should be proclaimed in its fuller spiritual
significance, in relationship to the Lord Jesus and His righteousness.
    There is a connection between observing the Sabbath as a seal of righteous-
ness by faith, and the glory of Christ's righteousness, which shall enlighten
the entire world (Rev. 18:1) and complete the proclamation of the gospel.
    Then multitudes of true Christians in the various religious bodies will see
that the Lord of the Sabbath is Christ our Creator and Saviour-Sanctifier.
They will recognize that keeping the true Sabbath of Christ is the natural
expression and fruitage of having Him as one's personal Saviour. They will
see that true Sabbath observance is the divinely appointed sign of a Christian's
continuing, progressive sanctification. Then many sincere hristians, includ-
ing some ministers and other leaders, will take their stand under the banner
of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. Rev. 18:1-4.
    Concerning last-day movements, Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 55, says that
God's people "will find their power in the sign spoken of in Exodus 31:12-18."
The Sabbath bears the stamp of Christ as our Creator and Sanctifier. This
should motivate God's people to present the Sabbath more fully everywhere
as the sign of our allegiance to God's will.
    The Sabbath truth is part of the setting of the threefold message of Reve-
lation 14:6-12 for the last days. Before Seventh-day Adventists were in ex-
istence as a separate body of Christian people, this message came, and it has
made them what they are today. Hence an understanding of this truth for
our time is basic and vital.
    We shall receive help and be blessed during this quarter as we study Christ
in the Sabbath and the Sabbath in Christ.

      The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in
the lesson."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                       My Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

   "Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you

              Part 1    "He [Christ] was in the world, and the world was made
          CHRIST THE by him, and the world knew him not."
           CREATOR
           John 1:10    Here is a positive declaration that the Lord Jesus Christ,
                          who walked among men at His first advent, is the One who
                          made this world.
                             Millions of professed Christians apparently are unaware of
                          the role of Christ as the Creator. They think of Him only as the
                          Saviour.
                             It is essential that a person be fully committed to Christ as
                          his only Saviour. Acts 16:30, 31; 4:12 ; John 14:6. But the
                          adequacy of Christ as the only true Saviour rests upon two
                          everlasting foundation truths of the gospel: (1) The eternity of
                          Christ as God the Son and as the Son of God; (2) The role of
                          Christ as the Creator-God of Genesis 1 and 2.

                             What indicates that Christ the Saviour is also the Crea-
                          tor of all? Col. 1:13-16.


                             Most assuredly we are saved by the perfect life of Christ,
                          His atoning death, His resurrection, His ascension, and His
                          intercession as our High Priest. If He had not been one with
                          God from eternity and co-Creator in the beginning, He could
                          not be man's Saviour.

                             How does the Word of God show further that Christ
                          was associated with the Father as the co-Creator of all
                          things? 1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 3:9; John 1:1-3.


    THINK IT THROUGH         Why have all the Father's dealings with this world
                          been through His Son?




   "It was Christ that spread the heav-       He made it.' Ps. 65:6; 95:5. It was He
ens, and laid the foundations of the          that fulled the earth with beauty, and
earth. It was His hand that hung the          the air with song. And upon all things
worlds in space, and fashioned the            in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the
flowers of the field. 'His strength setteth   message of the Father's love."—"The

           CREATOR      with God, and the Word was God."
     EXISTENT FROM         "All things were made by him; and without him was
           ETERNITY     not any thing made that was made."
      John 1:1, 3, 14      "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us."

                           The Gospel of John is an outstanding Biblical presentation
                        of Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God and the Saviour of
                        men. How does it begin? Christ is introduced as one with God
                        from eternity and as the Creator of the universe. He is pre-
                        sented as the Word, who was with God the Father in the be-
                        ginning, and as one who was God. Christ is coeternal and
                        coexistent with God the Father.
                           Another tremendous truth is the fact that Christ is the
                        Creator of the universe. "All things were made by him; and
                        without him was not any thing made that was made." John 1:3.

                          How do we know that this Word, the Creator, is also
                        Christ our Saviour? John 1:10, 14.


                           John presents Christ as our Creator and Saviour, and as
                        existing with God from the beginning. Preaching Christ must
                        not omit presenting Him as God the Son from eternity and as
                        the Creator of all. To preach Christ without making this clear
                        would be like trying to build a house without a foundation.
                           Notice that in Heb. 1:1-3 the One who has purged us from
                        our sins is the Son of God by whom the worlds were made.

                          How does God the Father attest that Christ is the
                        Maker of heaven and earth? Heb. 1:8-12.


  THINK IT THROUGH          Why did the Father allocate to the Son an active role
                        in creation? What bearing does this have on our salva-
                        tion through Christ?

       2 Cor. 5:17, RSV
                             Salvation is effected, in part, by a work .of creation in the
                         sinner by the same Christ who made man in the beginning.
                         Christians are declared to be Christ's workmanship, created in
                         Him unto good works. Eph. 2:10. He imparts His character
                         to us. Heb. 8:10, 11.
                             This is why every soul is dependent upon Christ for salva-
                         tion. This shows also that Christ is our Saviour, because He
                         is the Creator. For the salvation of man it is essential that both
                         creation and redemption be accomplished by the Son of God
                         —the Lord Jesus Christ.

                   t).      Why does salvation from sin require more than for-
                         giveness? John 3:3; Eph. 4:22-24.


                             When the believer truly receives Christ as his personal Sav-
                         iour, not only is free and full pardon granted to him, but he
                         is trar211=zied into a new person. He is born again, born of
                         God. John 1:12, 13. Christ creates within him a new heart,
                         a new_ mind.                                            --
                             Then by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the believer is
                         enabled to live a life of obedience to Christ and His command-
                         ments. Ezek. 11:19, 20; Gal. 2:20. This is how Christ brings
                         the believer into harmony with God and keeps him right. Thus
                         Christ as our Creator cannot be detached from Christ as our
                         Redeemer.
    THINK IT THROUGH        Why does the acceptance of Christ as our Saviour nec-
                         essarily include honoring Him as our Creator? What are
                         the main reasons why millions of professed Christians
                         have lost sight of Him as Maker of the worlds?

                         tion of this world. He has saved us according to His own pur-
                         pose given us in Christ before the world began. See also Eph.
                         1:4, 5 ; Titus 1:2.
                            This helps us understand why God the Father allocated the
                         creation of all to the Son—the Lord Jesus Christ. Our salvation
                         was at stake. Only He who can create can save from sin and
                         death. The fact that Christ was the Creator meant that salva-
                         tion was available in Him when it should be needed.
                            When Adam sinned, his Creator began to function as his
                         Saviour. Thus Jesus Christ is "the Lamb slain from the foun-
                         dation of the world." Rev. 13:8. See also 1 Peter 1:18-20.
                            When man sinned, no created being could satisfy the claims
                         of the broken law of God. Only one equal with God could make
                         atonement for the transgression. Hence no one but the Lord
                         Jesus Christ, as Creator, could offer Himself as a sufficient ran-
                         som for sinful man. This thought should kindle a deeper love
                         in our hearts for the Father and the Son for Their predeter-
                         mined plan by which our omnipotent Creator became our
                         all-sufficient Creator and Saviour.

                             When was the gospel first outlined? Gen. 3:15.




                             How have millions of believers deprived themselves
                          of much by limiting their concept of Christ to what hap-
                          pened during His earthly life? Rom. 11:33; Eph. 1:18;
                          3:18-21.


 THINK IT THROUGH             In what ways do we demonstrate our faith in Jesus
                          as our Creator and Saviour? Has His ministry on behalf
                          of man been lost sight of by the vast majority of Chris-
                          tians? How is this truth being restored to its rightful place
                          in the gospel?

         A SIGN OF      sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord.... It is a sign between
       THE CREATOR      me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the
                        Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day
        Ex. 31:15-17    he rested, and was refreshed."

                           The Lord declares that the seventh-day Sabbath is a sign
                        between Him and His people because He made the world in
                        six days and rested on the seventh day. The New Testament
                        shows that this Lord who made the world in six days and
                        rested on the seventh day is our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus Ex.
                        31:16, 17 and Mark 2:27, 28 show that the seventh-day Sabbath
                        is a sign of Christ as our Creator.
                            Sunday is not the Sabbath of Christ, nor the Lord's day.
                        It is the first day of the week. The Lord Himself says, "The
                        seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord." Ex. 20:10. Hence the
                        seventh day, or Saturday, is Christ's Sabbath for man.

                           How does the Bible imply that the command in Ex.
                        20:8-11 to keep the seventh day is a command from the
                        Lord Jesus Christ? Compare Neh. 9:12, 13 with 1 Cor.
                        10:1-4.


                           The Lord who in the Ten Commandments commands the
                        keeping of the seventh day is our Creator. See Ex. 20:10, 11.
                        The New Testament declares that Christ is our Creator, and
                        the precept recorded in Ex. 20:8-11—to keep the seventh day
                        holy—is a commandment from our Lord Jesus Christ. The ob-
                        servance of the seventh day is one step in our accepting Christ.

                          How important is it for us to obey Christ's command-
                        ments? Heb. 5:9.


                           Christ has appointed the keeping of the seventh day as a
                        sign whereby we honor and worship Him as our Creator and
                        Saviour. What a high privilege it is to keep His Sabbath !
 THINK IT THROUGH          What makes Sabbath keeping an appropriate way to
                        honor and worship the Lord Jesus?

Christ's Sign   LESSON 1                                                 ❑ Friday
                                                                            June 30
              Part 6      "Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign
         A SIGN OF     between me and them, that they might know that I am
       THE SAVIOUR     the Lord that sanctify them."
         Ezek. 20:12
                          The Bible shows that creation and redemption are insepa-
                       rably united in the Lord Jesus Christ. Ex. 31:16, 17 presents
                       the seventh-day Sabbath as a sign between us and our Creator.
                       See also Ezek. 20:20. Ezek. 20:12 shows that the Sabbath is
                       a sign of sanctification.
                          The heart of the Sabbath truth is Christ our Creator and
                       Redeemer. Every soul who receives Christ as his Lord and
                       Saviour should receive also His seventh-day Sabbath as a sign
                       that He is his Creator and Saviour.

                          What will they know who truly keep the Sabbath of
                       the Lord? Ex. 31:13; Ezek. 20:12.


                          Why is it that so many Christians are not keeping Christ's
                       seventh-day Sabbath, but prefer to observe the first day, or
                       Sunday, which Christ has not commanded us to keep?
                          History shows that during the centuries which followed the
                       apostolic age, there developed a widespread departure from the
                       truth as taught by the Lord Jesus Christ. As a result of this
                       apostasy, the keeping of Sunday was introduced and estab-
                       lished as a man-made substitute for the observance of Christ's
                       seventh-day Sabbath. This custom has been handed down by
                       ecclesiastical and civil laws through the centuries to our day.
                       This is why the majority of Christians keep Sunday instead
                       of observing Christ's seventh-day Sabbath which is com-
                       manded in the Ten Commandments.
                          In setting aside Christ's Sabbath, men did not realize that
                       they were, in a sense, setting aside their Creator and Saviour.
                       Bible prophecy foretold this departure from the truth and
                       predicted that there would be a restoration in the closing age.
                       So the call of God today is in substance: "Give Christ's Sab-
                       bath its rightful place in your life, as a sign that He is your
                        Creator and Saviour-Sanctifier."
  THINK IT THROUGH        How may we show our love for Christ? John 14:15,
                       21; 1 John 5:3.




  "The Sabbath given to the world as    power that re-creates the soul in His
the sign of God as the Creator is also own likeness. To those who keep holy

         DIVINELY          "It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for
       APPOINTED        ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
 COMMEMORATION          and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."
    Ex 20:8; 31:17
                           It was noted in last week's lesson that the Creator, in whose
                        honor the Sabbath is observed, was Jesus Christ. Just as long
                        as this is true, the seventh day remains the Sabbath.
                           The fact that the New Testament neither records nor au-
                        thorizes any transfer of the Sabbath from the seventh day
                        (Saturday) to the first day (Sunday) of the week manifests
                        the falsity of the claim that Sunday should be kept as the Lord's
                        day in honor of Christ's resurrection on the first day of the
                        week.

                           What is the significance of baptism? Rom. 6:4; Col.
                        2:12.


                           In true baptism the believer is buried and rises with Christ.
                        Baptism by immersion is a God-appointed way whereby we
                        are to show our faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of
                        Christ as our Saviour.
                           Notice how the Word presents a record that the same
                        seventh day which was the Sabbath before Christ's resurrection
                        (Luke 23:54-56; Mark 16:1, 2) was still observed as the Sab-
                        bath by God's people after the Saviour's resurrection. Acts
                        13:14, 27, 42, 44; 15:21; 16:13; 17:1, 2; 18:4. In the absence
                        of any command to change this day, the seventh-day Sabbath
                        as the sign of the Creator-Redeemer continues for all Chris-
                        tians.

                           To what vitally significant events does the ordinance of
                        the Lord's Supper point? 1 Cor. 11:26; Luke 22:17-20.



 THINK IT THROUGH          Do I observe these memorials—baptism, the Lord's
                        Supper, and the Sabbath—for which Christ calls? If I omit
                        any of them, how can my life be what He wants it to be?




   "Though sin has entered the world        a knowledge of Himself. He desires

         Mark 2:28         Christ made the seventh day the Sabbath at creation. In the

                        Sabbath, because He made the world in six days, rested upon
                        the seventh day, and then blessed and hallowed it. Ex. 20:8-11.

                  tfr       Why did Christ as Creator rest upon this last day of the
                        first week of this world's time? Compare Isa. 40:28 with
                        Gen. 2:3.


                           He sanctified the seventh day because in it He had rested
                        (Hebrew, "ceased," that is, from creating). Gen. 2:3; Ex. 20:11.
                           His rest was preparatory to His blessing and sanctifying; or
                        setting apart, the seventh day of the week as the Lord's day
                        for man. The relation between creation and redemption is so
                        close that it affects every day of the week, for during the
                        labors of the six working days we must remember that we are
                        to prepare to observe the seventh. Ex. 20:8-11; Ezek. 46:1.
                           The word "Sabbath" is a transliteration of the Hebrew word
                        shabbath, which signifies cessation or rest. The Hebrew cognate
                        verb shabath means to cease, to rest, to sabbatize, or to keep
                        a sabbath. This verb is used twice in Gen. 2:2, 3, where it is
                        translated as "rested." This is evidence that Christ's rest on
                        the seventh day at the close of His creative work made this
                        day the Sabbath day of sacred rest in the beginning.

                           How does Christ, in the fourth commandment, identify
                        the seventh day as the Sabbath day as it relates to His
                        work of the creation of our world? Ex. 20:11.


                           Note how this precept refutes the notion that Sabbath ob-
                        servance was not instituted until the Exodus of Israel from
                        Egypt.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Does Jesus become my personal Saviour before I begin
                        to obey Him? Why is the Sabbath not a sign of the Crea-

              Part 3     "And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:
     BLESSED FOREVER because that in it he had rested from all his work which
            Gen. 2:3 God created and made."

                           There is nothing in the Bible to indicate that Christ has
                        transferred His blessing and sanctification of the seventh day
                        to any other day Therefore the seventh day still is His blessed
                        and sanctified day for all people.
                           In the New Testament there is not a word directing Chris-
                        tians to observe the first day of the week.

                           How does Christ confirm the Old Testament revelation
                        of which the Sabbath was a part? Matt. 5:17-19.


                           Christ ordained the seventh-day Sabbath as a perpetual
                        memorial of His creative and redemptive power. Hence there
                        was no valid reason for uninspired men in postapostolic times
                        to introduce Sunday keeping to commemorate the resurrection
                        of our Lord on the first day of the week.
                           Christ cannot be divided. His role as Redeemer cannot be
                        separated from His role as our Creator.
                           The Bible clearly shows that the keeping of the seventh day
                        is a sign of Christ as our Creator and our Redeemer. The keep-
                        ing of Sunday to commemorate redemption in Christ is in
                        effect an attempt to deny that our Saviour is also our Creator.
                           The very doctrine on which men have based their keeping
                        of Sunday is, as a matter of fact, contrary to Christ in His dual
                        and inseparable role as both our Creator and our Saviour.
                        Gladly we keep the Sabbath, which gives to Christ honor due
                        to Him as Redeemer and Creator.
  THINK IT THROUGH           Can any person really make a day holy or truly bless
                        it? What else then cart we do but keep holy the seventh
                        day as sacred to Christ, who has blessed and hallowed
                        it for us?




   "In Eden, God set up the memorial        on the part of all who should dwell

              Part 4         "The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God:
         THE ONLY       . . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, ...
        RIGHT DAY       and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed
       Ex. 20:10, 11    the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

                           This is why the Lord commands the'observance of the sev-
                        enth day instead of any other day of the week.
                          Thus Christ Himself, in Ex. 20:8-11, has made it clear that
                        the seventh day is the only right day of the week for man to
                        observe as the Sabbath.
                           Christ, as our Creator, put His blessing and sanctification
                        on the last day of the week because He had rested upon it.
                        Gen. 2:3. Hence it is impossible for man to transfer these two
                        things to any other day of the week.
                           These God-given reasons for keeping the seventh day holy
                        —because He made the world in six days, and rested upon the
                        seventh day, and then blessed and sanctified it—have an im-
                        portant meaning.
                           Some declare that the obligation to keep the seventh day
                        is merely a Jewish ordinance which did not originate until the
                        Israelites came out of Egypt. But Christ based His command
                        to keep the seventh day on what He did when the world was
                        created.

                          How did Christ show that the Sabbath is not for the
                        Jews only? Mark 2:27. See also Isa. 56:2, 6, 7.



                          As every soul today needs Jesus as his Creator-Sanctifier,
                        even so he needs the Sabbath as a sign of this acceptance of
                        Him as such.
  THINK IT THROUGH        Since Christ blessed and sanctified the seventh day for
                        me, what should I do about it? Heb. 5:9; Luke 6:46.




   "It [the Sabbath] is to be remem-        enth day signify by this act that they
bered and observed as the memorial          are worshipers of Jehovah. Thus the
of the Creator's work. Pointing to God      Sabbath is the sign of man's allegiance

       RELEVANT TO      ments; and rested the sabbath day according to the com-
       CHRISTIANITY     mandment."
         Luke 23:56
                          Many Christians think that the keeping of the Saturday
                       Sabbath was a religious obligation only under the Mosaic dis-
                       pensation, which ended at the crucifixion of Christ. They believe
                       that after Christ's death on the cross, the first day of the
                       week became the Lord's day to commemorate redemption
                       through Christ's death and resurrection. The New Testament
                       does not substantiate this.
                          Christ's seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment
                       continued to be applicable to men in the new Christian age,
                       even as did the other nine precepts. This Sabbath commandment
                       is specifically referred to in Luke 23:56, as being binding the
                       day after the crucifixion. See also Heb. 4:10.

                           What laws were abolished at the cross? Eph. 2:15.



                          The Ten Commandments, as God's eternal rule of right,
                       continued to be binding after the crucifixion of Christ. Thus
                       the keeping of the seventh day is as relevant today as is the
                       command, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," or
                       "Thou shalt not steal," or any of the other precepts of the
                       Decalogue.
                          It is significant that Christ sanctified the seventh day
                       for man before he sinned. This shows that the keeping of
                       the seventh day cannot be reckoned as one of the sabbaths
                       referred to in Col. 2:16, 17, as "a shadow of things to come."
                       This is evident from the fact that, in the world to come, "all
                       flesh" will come to worship before Him "from one sabbath to
                       another." Isa. 66:22, 23.
                          These Scriptural considerations indicate that the keeping of
                       the seventh day is one link in the chain of the truth as it is
                       in Jesus. It is a part of a full commitment to Christ.
 THINK IT THROUGH         If man had never sinned, how many in this world
                       would observe the seventh-day Sabbath? How much
                       crime, sickness, strife, trouble, sorrow, and death would
                       there be? When will God's ideal in this matter be real-
                       ized?




   "The sign of obedience is the obser-    upon to restore it [the seal] by exalting
vance of the Sabbath of the fourth         the Sabbath of the fourth command-

          ETERNITY      to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from
                        one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship
       Isa. 66:22, 23   before me, saith the Lord."

                           All of the saved will honor the Sabbath as a day of worship
                        throughout eternity in the new earth. It will continue to be
                        remembered forever in that coming perfect world. Says the
                        Eternal One: "My covenant will I not break, nor alter the
                        thing that is gone out of My lips." Ps. 89:34.
                           When we compare Gen. 2:1-3 with Isa. 66:22, 23, we see
                        that the Sabbath spans the arch of time from the creation of
                        this world past its re-creation in the future. Thus the seventh
                        day is Christ's Sabbath for His people in all ages.

                           How does the Lord speak of Sabbath observance as a
                        perpetual practice? Ex. 31:16, 17.



                           The Sabbath was here before sin entered our world. It will
                        be here after sin has been banished from it. It spans the gulf
                        from Paradise lost by man's lack of faith in God and its result-
                        ant disobedience to Paradise regained by man's faith in Him
                        and his resultant obedience. The Sabbath is a continuing sign
                        pointing to Christ as the Way to Eden restored.
                           Every Sabbath, as it comes at the end of each week, brings
                        to us a double, delightful outlook. It points us back to the
                        time when the earth was perfect and happiness reigned su-
                        preme. It points forward to the time when the earth will be
                        perfect again and filled with everlasting happiness.

                                                A LINK OF LOVE

  "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:
and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father." John 14:21.


                                                     LESSON OUTLINE
  The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit      1. Sealed by the Cross
have bound Themselves to humanity with             Rom. 5:8
an everlasting love. Jer. 31:3 ; John 3:16.
                                                2. Love Spells Obedience
When a soul responds to this love in obe-
dience to God, it makes love a link uniting        1 John 5:3
him with God.                                   3. An Example of Love
   Christ's seventh-day Sabbath is a symbol        1 Peter 2:21
of His love as our Creator-Saviour. Thus        4. For Our Good
true Sabbath keeping is a link of love, bind-      Deut. 6:24
ing the believer to his Lord. It bestows
                                                5. The Right Motivation
the joys and delights of divine love. But
trying to keep the Sabbath without the love        Ps. 40:8

tion, and a burden.                                Isa. 58:13, 14

              Part 1  "God commendeth his love toward us in that, while
          SEALED BY we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
          THE CROSS
            Rom. 5:8 Creation and redemption are manifestations of the love of
                        the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit for man. The Sabbath,
                        as a sign of our Creator-Redeemer, is a link of love, extended
                        by Him to bind our hearts to His heart. It is said of the Ten
                        Commandments: "The fourth is the connecting link between
                        the great God and man."—The Story of Redemption, page 141.

                           What relationship is there between the hallowing of
                        the Sabbath on your part and having a personal knowl-
                        edge of God? Ezek. 20:20.




                          What connection is there between obedience to Christ
                        and abiding in His love? John 15:10.



                            Christ the Creator was manifest as Christ the Redeemer in
                        His all-sufficient sacrifice at Calvary. A wooden cross is a per-
                        pendicular post with a crossarm extending in each direction.
                        The creative power of Christ may be likened to the upright
                        post, by which all things are upheld. Heb. 1:2, 3. His redemp-
                        tive power may be likened to the crossarm, extended to all
                        and reaching from the entrance of sin to the close of probation.
                        The Sabbath, as a sign of Christ's creative and redemptive
                        power, bears the imprint of His cross.
                           Think how this links true Sabbath keeping with the grand
                        center of all attraction—Christ and Him crucified. It reveals
                        its inseparable relationship to Christian living. The cross of
                        Christ casts the halo of Heaven's redeeming love around His
                        Sabbath.
 THINK IT THROUGH          Is my Sabbath keeping a link of love binding my heart
                        close to that of Christ? Does it bring to me joys and de-
                        lights of His love and presence?




   "The Sabbath points then to the          Saviour. And every object in nature re-
works of creation as an evidence of         peats His invitation, 'Come unto Me, all
His mighty power in redemption. While       ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and
it calls to mind the lost peace of Eden,    I will give you rest.'"—"The Desire of
it tells of peace restored through the      Ages," page 289.

               Part 3        "For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also
        AN EXAMPLE       suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should
            OF LOVE      follow his steps."
         1 Peter 2:21
                            The Son of God took upon Himself our human nature. Thus
                         He forever linked His divinity with our humanity. When He
                         lived on earth, He kept the seventh day. Mark 1:20, 21; Luke
                         4:16, 31. This makes the keeping of the seventh day one of
                         Christ's "steps" for us.

                             How do we know that Jesus has not changed? Heb.
                          13:8.



                             Since He has not changed and He kept' the Sabbath when
                          He lived here, what day would He observe if He lived on earth
                          today?
                             Sunday keeping was introduced among Christians by some
                          church leaders after the apostles Paul, Peter, and John had
                          died. The call of God for our day is to turn from tradition to
                          His way.

                             What made the ground around the burning bush holy?
                          Ex. 3:2-6.



                              The presence of Christ in the burning bush made the very
                          ground surrounding it holy. Likewise He has hallowed the sev-
                          enth day by putting His own presence into it. He Himself kept
                          it first as our Creator in the beginning and later when He came
                          to live here as our Redeemer. We should walk in His steps by
                          keeping it, too. The Sabbath observance hallowed by His ex-
                          ample affords us a deeper consciousness of His presence.
                              The consciousness of the Saviour's abiding presence is one
                          of life's greatest joys and imperatives.
 THINK IT THROUGH            If Jesus were here on earth today, what would He do

            Part 4    "And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes,
    FOR OUR GOOD to fear the Lord our God, for our good always."
         Deut. 6:24
                           When we truly love God, we know in our inmost soul that
                        all of His commandments are for our good always. We also
                        understand that he who sins against God wrongs his own soul.
                        Prov. 8:36. Then our uppermost desire is to obey Christ. This
                        leads to a lasting decision to follow Him faithfully all the way
                        to the end. Then we understand that the keeping of the Sab-
                        bath is not ordained to deprive us of time for our own activ-
                        ities. It is enjoined to provide us time to maintain in a special
                        way a closer fellowship with Christ.

                           How are we blessed both spiritually and physically by
                        keeping the Sabbath? Ise. 58:13, 14.


                           The best experiences in this life and in the never-ending
                        life to come are bound up in remembering the Lord in all the
                        affairs of our life.

                           Why do not the boundaries of Saturday, as reckoned
                        by man, coincide exactly with the seventh day of the
                        fourth commandment? Gen. 1:23, 31; Mark 1:21, 32;
                        Lev. 23:32.


                            The observance of the seventh day, as Christ commands, is
                         from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday.
                            Remembering the Sabbath projects its spirit into the other
                         days of the week. The Sabbath must be remembered in our
                         plans, appointments, and transactions, so that nothing will
                         conflict with the proper keeping of God's holy day when it
                         comes to us. Thus it is designed to keep the will of .the Creator
                         and Redeemer prominent in our life. It helps us to set the
                         Lord always before us as did the psalmist. Psalm 16:8.
 THINK IT THROUGH          Do I keep the Sabbath in mind all during the week? Is
                         my Sabbath keeping truly a sign that the Creator has
                         made me into a new person and is sanctifying me?

A Link of Love     LESSON 3                                            ❑ Thursday
                                                                              July 13
             Part 5       "I delight to do thy will,    0   my God: yea, thy law is
         THE RIGHT     within my heart."
       MOTIVATION
           Ps. 40:8       Do we obey God because we "have to"? Or because we
                       desire to? The answer may reveal whether we are living under
                       the old covenant or the new.

                         What is the primary purpose of God in giving us a new
                       mind? Ezek. 11:19, 20; Rom. 8:7.



                          Some ask, "Isn't it hard to keep Saturday as the Sabbath?"
                       The answer is Yes or No according to whether or not Christ
                       is living His life in you. The keeping of the Sabbath is a spir-
                       itual experience.
                           It is good to obey God from a realization of our obligation;
                       but it is better to have the love of God in our hearts to the
                       extent that we obey because we truly wish to do it. True Sab-
                       bath keeping is a token of mutual love between our best Friend
                       and us. John 14:21.
                           In the performance of every duty it should be that "the love
                       of Christ constraineth us." Then His yoke is easy. In fact, we
                       find true rest in having His yoke upon us. Matt. 11:28-30.
                           Love makes it easy to do what otherwise would be difficult
                       and burdensome. Does mother love find it hard to keep a try-
                       ing night vigil at the bedside of a sick child?
                           A devout Christian has raised and answered this question,
                       "Why is it so hard to lead a self-denying, humble life? Be-
                       cause professed Christians are not dead to the world. It is easy
                       living after we are dead."—Messages to Young People, page 127.
                           It is easy to live in accordance with God's law when we
                       are "crucified with Christ" and He "liveth" in us. Gal. 2:20.
                       On the other hand, it is hard to do if we are not dead. So
                       each of us decides whether or not he will cooperate with the
                       Holy Spirit in order to enter into and maintain the right
                       Christian experience.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Do I keep the Sabbath because I love God or from a
                       feeling of duty? Have we been remiss in urging the
                       Sabbath upon people, from the law, without letting the
                       gospel arouse love's desire to keep it?

A Link of Love    LESSON 3                                                ❑ Friday
                                                                              July 14
            Part 6    "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from
  DAY OF DELIGHT doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath
    Isa. 58:13, 14 a delight, . . . then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord."

                         The Sabbath of Christ has in it today the love and joy of
                      the original in a perfect creation and of the future in a perfect
                      restoration. It is an indication of eternal love and joy.
                         The keeping of the seventh day originated in Eden when all
                      was perfect. Each Sabbath brings to us a breath from Eden. It
                      is also a foretaste of Eden restored in the earth made new,
                      where sin, sickness, sorrow, and death will be no more. The
                      successive Sabbaths are like lights along the highway to that
                      better world.
                         The perfect delight of the first Sabbath in Eden may be
                      recaptured to some degree by true Sabbath keeping now. It
                      will be fully recaptured by God's redeemed in the new earth
                      as we come to worship before Him from one Sabbath to an-
                      other.

                          How is keeping the Sabbath linked with delighting
                       oneself in the Lord? Isa. 58:13, 14.




                          How is pleasing the Lord linked with keeping the Sab-
                       bath? Isa. 56:1, 2, 4, 5.



                          The Sabbath is not merely a day of physical rest. Any day
                       would do for that. It is not exclusively a day for spiritual
                       renewal. It is both of these and more. It is a sign of allegiance
                       to Christ as our Creator and Saviour.
                          The seventh-day Sabbath has lost none of its Scriptural -sig-
                       nificance as a memorial of 'Christ's creative and saving power.
                       Every soul who receives Christ as his personal Saviour needs
                       to keep His Sabbath as a sign of his acceptance of Christ as
                       both his Creator and Saviour.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Is Sabbath observance truly a delight to me? If it was
                       essential before man sinned, is it not more so in this
                       present world of sin?

                            There can be no house without a builder. Every house is
                         proof that a builder has made it. Thus the Bible points to the
                         existence of the world and the objects therein as evidence that
                         there is a Creator-God (Rom. 1:20) and that He is the only
                         true God. Ps. 96:5 ; Jer. 10:10-12.

                   1).      What did Christ, as our Creator, give man to be his
                         continual means of acknowledgment of the only true God,
                         and as a sign of his supreme allegiance to Him? Ex. 20:
                         8-11; 31:16, 17.


                            Those who truly keep the Sabbath show thereby that they
                         worship the Creator as the only true God. This makes Sab-
                         bath keeping a mark of true worship. In the Decalogue the
                         Sabbath command (Ex. 20:8-11) is the only precept in which
                         the Lord (YHWH) is identified as the Creator and therefore
                         the only One to whom we should render worship and supreme
                         allegiance. Thus Sabbath keeping is a distinguishing mark be-
                         tween true and false worship.

                            How does the Word of God emphasize that supreme,
                         heart-motivated obedience to God is true worship? 1 Sam.
                         15:22; Ps. 40:6-8.


                            True Sabbath keeping shows our commitment to obey God
                         supremely. A person cannot keep the Sabbath as Christ directs
                         if he serves other gods. A true Sabbath keeper is a true wor-
                         shiper of the Father and the Son. True Sabbath observance
                         must not be omitted if we would worship God in spirit and
                         in truth as Jesus directs. John 4:24.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Do I have any gods before the Creator? Am I allow-
                         ing anything or any person to hold me back from render-
                         ing full and supreme obedience to the Lord?

           Part 2  "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his
    PREVENTIVE OF judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven,
    FALSE WORSHIP and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
        Rev. 14:7
                         These words are a part of the message given in the final
                      phase of the gospel, which God has foreordained shall be pro-
                      claimed to every nation shortly before the second advent of
                      Christ. Rev. 14:6-15. This message restores forgotten and ne-
                      glected truths to their rightful place in the preaching of the
                      gospel of Christ.

                         What kind of Christian people are raised up by ac-
                      ceptance of this heaven-sent message?


                         This last-day message provides certainty amid uncertainty.
                      The way of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus
                      is the Lord's true way in the midst of all the confusing and
                      conflicting doctrines of the last days.
                         This call to "worship Him that made heaven and earth"
                      requires that men recognize Christ and His rightful place as
                      our Creator and Lord. This in turn calls for the keeping of
                      the Sabbath as His appointed sign that He is our Creator and
                      Redeemer. Ezek. 20:12, 20. Since Sabbath observance is a mark
                      of true worship, it is one test for distinguishing truth from
                      error.

                          What will the observer of the Sabbath know? Ezek.
                       20:20.


                          If Christ's Sabbath had been kept by all men from the
                       beginning, there would be no infidel, atheist, or idolator. And
                       there would be neither Buddhism, Confucianism, Mohamme-
                       danism, nor pantheism. Neither would there be materialism
                       or humanism, which leave God out of their reckoning.
                         Honoring the Sabbath as the sign of loyalty to our Creator-
                       Redeemer sweeps the foundation from under every false sys-
                       tem of worship. Is it any wonder that the devil's chief target
                       has been the Sabbath?
  THINK IT THROUGH        Do I keep the Sabbath in such a spirit that it signifies
                       that Christ is Lord in all the affairs of my life?


  "Had the Sabbath been universally      keeping of the Sabbath is a sign of

              Part 3  "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but
         WORLDWIDE the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it
           WITNESS thou shalt not do any work."
         Ex. 20:9, 10
                           There are twenty-four hours in a day. The period of rota-
                        tion of the earth upon its axis determines the length of the
                        day. The period of a revolution of the moon around the earth
                        is the natural measure of the month. The revolution of the
                        earth around the sun in a little over 365 days is the basis of
                        the common year of 365 days and the leap year of 366 days.
                           But whence came the seven-day week? It cannot be ac-
                        counted for from nature.

                            What connection is there between Christ's instituting
                         the Sabbath and commanding its observance, and the
                         reckoning of the days by the recurring cycle of seven?
                         Ex. 20:8-11.




                             To what inspired account must men turn for the origin
                         of the week? Gen. 1:1-31; 2:1-3; Ex. 20:11; 31:17; Heb.
                         4:4.


                            Christ the Creator established the seven-day week when
                        He made the world in six days and rested on the seventh. Then
                        He sanctified the Sabbath, or set it apart as sacred for man to
                        keep holy on every seventh day thereafter. He directed man
                        to confine his secular affairs to the first six days of the week
                        and to devote the seventh day to the worship of the Lord. This
                        is the origin of the seven-day week.
                            The universal use of seven days for a week reveals how the
                        Sabbath has influenced our world. Each week ending with the
                        Sabbath points to the Creator-God of Genesis 1 and 2, who is
                        Christ. The week bears its own witness that the days of crea-
                        tion week were not long and indefinite periods of time but were
                        evening-and-morning days, seven of which made up the week
                        of creation like every week since that time. The calendar, with
                        its weeks of seven days, bears witness to the identity and con-
                        tinuity of Christ's Sabbath for our age.
  THINK IT THROUGH          How did the Lord identify the true week and the right
                         Sabbath for forty consecutive years in connection with

           THEORY
          Heb. 11:3       "The weekly cycle of seven literal .days, six for labor, and
                       the seventh for rest, which has been preserved and brought
                       down through Bible history, originated in the great facts of
                       the first seven days."—Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, p. 90.

                  1(      How does the fourth commandment indicate that the
                       six days of creation are the same kind of days as those
                       which precede the Sabbath each week? Ex. 20:8-11.



                          The Lord commands all people to keep the seventh day be-
                       cause He made the world in six days and rested on the seventh,
                       as set forth in Genesis 1 and 2. The keeping of the Sabbath, as
                       Christ directs, commits a person to the acceptance of the doc-
                       trine of the direct creation of the world in six literal days of
                       twenty-four hours each.
                          Can those who believe in the Bible Sabbath, as commanded
                       by Christ, accept the theory that it took millions of years to
                       make the earth as a home for man and that man evolved from
                       the lower forms of life? If professed Christians had kept the
                       true Sabbath, then millions of them would not have been over-
                       taken and ensnared by the evolutionary theory.
                          Christ our Saviour is Christ our Creator. Rejection of Christ
                       as our Creator in Genesis 1 and 2 is a serious mistake on the
                       part of a professed Christian.
                          The introduction of the man-made Sunday sabbath by early
                       ecclesiastical leaders, as a substitute for Christ's seventh-day
                       Sabbath, deprived Christendom of one of the Lord's major
                       barriers against the errors of the theory of evolution.

     A SIGN BETWEEN between me and you, that ye may know that I am the
        US AND GOD Lord your God."
          Ezek. 20:20
                            In seven places in the New Testament Jesus is presented as
                        the Creator of this world and also of all the worlds in the
                        universe. Only Deity can create a world. The true and living
                        God is set forth as the Creator of all, in contradistinction to the
                        vast array of false gods, none of whom have made the heaven
                        and earth. Jer. 10:10-12; Acts 17:23, 24.
                            God sets forth His seventh-day Sabbath as a sign that He
                        is this Creator. Ex. 31:16, 17. Therefore it becomes a sign of
                        His incomparable standing as God, in addition to His becom-
                        ing man.
                            The Sabbath, as it relates to His deity, is especially relevant
                        to Christianity today. Why? Because many professed Chris-
                        tians in various religious denominations which were formerly
                        fully committed to the deity of Christ are now openly express-
                        ing their disbelief in this. They laud Him as the best man and
                        the greatest teacher. But they do not regard Him as being
                        truly God as He was truly man.

                           Why is the acceptance of Christ as being truly God as
                        He was truly man essential to a full appreciation of sal-
                        vation?


                           No one can truly hallow Christ's Sabbath and at the same
                        time deny His deity. No one can keep the Sabbath as the
                        Lord's command requires in Ex. 20:8-11 and be committed to
                        the evolutionary theory.
                           Among the myriads of true Sabbath keepers there are none
                        who deny the deity of Christ or who disbelieve the Biblical
                        account of creation. The true Sabbath is a barrier against cer-
                        tain errors. It is an important link in that interlocked chain
                        of truth as it is in Jesus.
 THINK IT THROUGH          What should all Sunday-keeping Christians who still
                        believe in the deity of Christ do to manifest greater faith
                        in His lordship? Ezek. 20:20; James 2:20, 26.

                                                                             July 21
            Part 6        "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth."
  TRUTH SANCTIFIES
        John 17:17        The adequacy of the Sabbath truth is the adequacy of
                       Christ, because true Sabbath observance is a sign of loyalty
                       to Christ as our Creator and Saviour. Everything that every
                       person ever needs for time and eternity is enfolded in Christ
                       as the Creator and Saviour and Sanctifier.

                           Why can no person earn merit and thereby save him-
                       self by his good works? Eph. 2:8-10.


                          The Sabbath is a sign that Christ can sanctify any penitent
                       sinner. Ezek. 20:12. True Sabbath keeping is an acknowledg-
                       ment that He alone can make such a person righteous. Hence
                       no one who keeps the Sabbath as Christ directs is a legalist.
                       Why not? Because true Sabbath keeping is a part of the fruit-
                       age of His righteousness as it has been received by faith in
                       Him.

                           Why does salvation by grace not set aside obedience
                       to the Ten Commandments through Christ? Rom. 3:31;
                       6:14, 15.


                          Note what an effective barrier true Sabbath keeping is
                       against error. No false religions. No theory of evolution. No
                       false philosophy substituting its dicta for the truths of God's
                       Word. No legalistic attempt by man to lift up himself by pull-
                       ing at his own bootstraps. No antinomians 'advocating that
                       faith in Christ frees a Christian from the obligation to obey
                       the precepts of the Decalogue. No false system of salvation by
                       works. But all honor, and glory, and love, and obedience to
                       the Creator-Saviour-Sanctifier.
                          He who truly keeps the Sabbath as Christ directs is ready
                       to do everything else that He commands. Why is this? Be-
                       cause the Sabbath, when kept in the manner that God has
                       appointed, is a sign that Christ is sanctifying and saving one
                       from sin (the transgression of His law) by His indwelling
                       presence.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Do I experience sanctification every day by Christ liv-
                       ing His life in me so that I can truly keep His sanctified
                       day at the end of each week?

     RESURRECTION morning he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, from
       ON SUNDAY whom he had formerly cast out seven devils."
     Mark 16:9, NEB
                         This is a definite statement that Christ arose early on
                       Sunday morning. But there is not a hint that Sunday is to be
                       honored because the Lord arose on that day.

                          How does Mark show that the Lord's holy day is the
                       one which precedes Sunday? Mark 16:1, 2.


                          Regardless of how earnestly one may try, it is impossible to
                       keep the Lord's holy day on Sunday. Why? Because Mark 16:
                       1, 2 shows that the Sabbath was past when the women came
                       to the tomb at daybreak on Sunday.

                          How does John refer to the day when Mary found the
                       tomb empty? John 20:1.


                          John wrote this account about sixty years after the resur-
                       rection of Christ. Some claim that during these sixty years the
                       keeping of Sunday by Christians was established in the place
                       of that of the seventh-day Sabbath. If this were true, wouldn't
                       John have mentioned this when he spoke of the first day in
                       direct connection with our Lord's resurrection?
                          The fact is that Christians in the days of the apostles kept
                       Saturday and not Sunday. In Acts 18:4 the record declares
                       that at Corinth Paul reasoned in the synagogue every Sab-
                       bath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. This happened
                       about A.D. 54, or twenty-three years after Christ's resurrection.
                          The Jews assembled in their synagogues according to their
                       custom every week upon the seventh day, or Saturday. The
                       Holy Spirit, speaking through Luke in Acts 18:4, identifies
                       their meeting days as being every Sabbath. This indicates that
                       this day on which they met for worship was observed as the
                       Sabbath twenty-three years after the resurrection of Christ.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Why can no one adequately harmonize Sunday keep-
                       ing with Mark 16:1, 2?

                                                                            July 24

    RESURRECTION'S       "The women who had accompanied him from Galilee
      RELATIONSHIP followed; they took note of the tomb and observed how
       TO SABBATH his body was laid. Then they went home and prepared
                      spices and perfumes; and on the Sabbath they rested in
                      obedience to the commandment. But on the Sunday morn-
      Luke 23:54-56; ing very early they came to the tomb bringing the spices
         24:1, NEB they had prepared."

                          These verses present three notable facts:
                          1. Christ was crucified on Friday, the day before the Sab-
                       bath. Mark 15:42 designates the day of the crucifixion as "the
                       day before the Sabbath."
                          2. Christ arose from the dead on Sunday, the day after the
                       Sabbath. Mark 16:1, 2, NEB, declares that "the Sabbath was
                       past" when the women went to the tomb on Sunday at day-
                       break. Matt. 28:1, NEB, says, "The Sabbath was over, and it
                       was about daybreak on Sunday, when Mary of Magdala and
                       the other Mary came to look at the grave."
                          3. The day in the middle between the Friday of the cruci-
                       fixion and the Sunday of the resurrection was "the sabbath day
                       according to the commandment" of the Lord. Luke 23:56;
                       Ex. 20:8-11. Thus everyone can be sure, according to Luke
                       23:54-56; 24:1, that the seventh day—Saturday—is the day
                       which the Lord asks us to keep holy.

                          What evidence do you see in Luke 23:54-56; 24:1 that
                       the followers of Jesus came to the tomb to do on Sunday
                       what they would not do on Saturday?



                          Some think that changes in the calendar have made it un-
                       certain whether or not Saturday is the true seventh day of the
                       week now. The calendar changes have pertained to the num-
                       bering of days in certain months. There has been no change of
                       the fixed order and number of the seven days in the weekly
                       cycle.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Since the followers of Jesus were expected to keep the
                       Sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset on the
                       weekend of the crucifixion, what does the law of God
                       requir'e of me every week?

                         gin the keeping of Sunday in honor of Christ's resurrection.
                         But note there is not a word in the text to indicate this.

                            How do we know that when they came together on
                         that occasion, they did not believe that Jesus had risen
                         from the dead? Mark 16:9-14.




                            Why is it wrong to read into a text something different
                         from what it says? Prov. 30:6; 2 Peter 3:16.



                           In John 20:26 the apostle records that after eight days
                        from this Sunday-night meeting, Jesus appeared again to His
                        apostles. According to Jewish method of reckoning days, this
                        second meeting took place on the next Sunday. Some claim
                        that this was the setting apart of Sunday as the Lord's day
                        for worship instead of the seventh day. But there is no hint
                        of such a purpose in this text. Jesus came to convince doubting
                        Thomas.
                           The first recorded Christian council convened at Jerusalem
                        about A.D. 52, or approximately twenty-one years after Christ's
                        resurrection. See Acts 15. It is worthy of note that in the offi-
                        cial letter of this council to all the churches, the day observed
                        by the Jews was recognized as the Sabbath. It referred to the
                        reading of the Scriptures in the synagogues "every Sabbath
                        day." Acts 15:21. There was then no other Sabbath than the
                        seventh day of the week. So it is today and forevermore. Isa.
                        66:22, 23.
 THINK IT THROUGH           If it was the Lord's plan for Christians to keep Sun-
                         day, wouldn't the New Testament so declare it? Since
                         such a thing is not mentioned at all, is it according to
                         Christ's plan?

           MEETING      them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his
           Acts 20:7    speech until midnight."

                            Many claim that this passage shows that it was a regular
                        practice there for Christians to assemble on every Sunday for
                        worship. We must not read into the Scriptures something that
                        is not there.

                           How do we know that, according to Biblical mode of
                        reckoning of the twenty-four-hour day, this meeting at
                        Troas was held on what we call Saturday night? Gen.
                        1:19; Mark 1:32; Acts 20:7, 8, 11.


                           The celebration of the Lord's Supper on the first day of the
                        week at Troas would not sanctify Sunday for Christians to
                        keep as the Lord's day. The celebration of the first Lord's
                        Supper by Jesus and His disciples on a Thursday night did
                        not make that a holy day.
                           This first-day meeting at Troas does not represent regular
                        Christian practice. It lasted all night long. Acts 20:7, 8, 11.
                        No church customarily holds regular meetings during the entire
                        night.
                           This meeting was not held because it was Sunday, but be-
                        cause Paul was "ready to depart" early the next morning.
                        Verses 7 and 11. He went on foot on Sunday morning to Assos.
                        Verses 13, 14.
                           It was logical that he would hold this farewell meeting on
                        the night previous to his departure, a Saturday night doubtless,
                        and celebrate the Lord's Supper with them.

                           What New Testament Christian leaders speak of the
                        day on which devout Jews and some Gentiles assembled
                        for worship as the Sabbath? Acts 13:27; 15:21; 18:4.


 THINK IT THROUGH          Why does it take more than the holding of a meeting
                        on Sunday to make it a divinely appointed weekly holy
                        day for Christians? Gen. 2:3; Ex. 20:8-11.

        1 Cor. 16:2
                         Some declare that this means that a collection was taken
                       every Sunday at the church in Corinth. Evidence indicates,
                       however, that the believers at Corinth were Sabbath keepers.
                       See Acts 18:1-4, 11. But 1 Cor. 16:2 does not say anything
                       about a weekly church collection.

                          What words in our text indicate that Paul is not here
                       calling for a public collection to be taken up in a church
                       service?


                          The money was to be laid aside perhaps at home. The RSV
                       rendering: "Each of you is to put something aside and store
                       it up." NEB: "Each of you is to put aside and keep by him a
                       sum." Phillips: "Let everyone put so much by him." Today's
                       English Version: "Each of you must put aside some money."
                       The Roman Catholic New Testament Confraternity Version:
                       "Let each one of you put aside at home and lay up whatever
                       he has a mind 10." The Jerusalem Bible: "Each one of you must
                       put aside what he can afford."
                          Paul was then gathering funds to help the needy saints at
                       Jerusalem. He planned to stop at Corinth for this purpose, and
                       he advised the believers there to lay aside some money on the
                       first day of each week for this relief fund which he would take
                       to Jerusalem.

                          Why is it unscriptural to assume that "the Lord's day"
                       in Rev. 1:10 is Sunday?


                          The Bible repeatedly states that the seventh day is the
                       Lord's special day for man. Ex. 20:8-11. God calls it spe-

      PREDICAMENT
        Matt. 22:29 This statement was made in reference to the Sadducees'
                      ignorance of the resurrection. It could well portray the condi-
                      tion of those who endeavor today to defend Sunday observ-
                      ance by the Bible.
                         If there is Scriptural authority for keeping Sunday, then we
                      would expect to find it in connection with the eight passages
                      which specifically mention the first day of the week. But they
                      contain no Scriptural evidence in favor of the observance of
                      that day.

                         What is the decisive test as to what we should follow
                      in matters of religion? Isa. 8:20.



                         What six things can be said concerning the lack of Biblical
                      evidence for keeping Sunday?
                         1. Christ and His apostles never changed the Sabbath from
                      the seventh day to the first day of the week.
                         2. Jesus and His apostles never observed the first day of
                      the week as the Sabbath or Lord's day.
                         3. There is in the New Testament no divine command to
                      keep holy the first day of the week.
                         4. In the Bible there is no indication that the first day is
                      to be kept as sacred for any reason.
                         5. There is no indication that Sunday observance took the
                      place of the keeping of the seventh day of the week as holy
                      during Bible times.
                          6. Neither God, Christ, holy angels, nor divinely inspired
                      men have ever said one word in favor of SundaSr as a holy day.
                          In direct contrast, the keeping of the seventh day is plainly
                      commanded by Christ in the Ten Commandments. Ex. 20:8-11.
                      It is inseparably connected with the acceptance of Christ as
                      Creator (Ex. 31:16, 17), Saviour (Ezek. 20:12) , and Lord
                      (Ezek. 20:20; Matt. 12 :8) .
 THINK IT THROUGH        When a person who is keeping Sunday or any other
                      day finds that there is no Bible authority for it, what
                      should he do?

  "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever." Heb. 13:8.


   Christ never changes. He established the
Sabbath for man upon the seventh day as               LESSON OUTLINE

His Sabbath cannot be changed by man,               Ps. 89:34
even as Christ cannot be changed from
being the Lord and the Creator-Saviour.          2. Unchanged Under New

                                                                                 July 30
             Part 1   "My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that
      NOT CHANGED is gone out of my lips."
           BY GOD
          Ps. 89:34  There is in this world only one code of moral law that came
                         direct from the lips of God to man. It is the law of Ten
                         Commandments, which God also wrote with His own finger
                        on tables of stone.
                            In the fourth commandment God has said, "The seventh
                        day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:10. Texts
                        such as Ps. 89:34 declare that God will not alter, or change,
                        the thing that is gone out of His lips. This implies that God
                        is not the one who has attempted to change the Sabbath from
                        the seventh day to the first of the week.
                            Christ, as the Creator-God (John 1:1-3, 10), made the
                         seventh day the Sabbath by resting on it, blessing it, and de-
                        claring it holy. Ex. 20:11; Gen. 2:2, 3. It is unalterably estab-
                        lished on the last day of the week.
                            Those who attempt to make Sunday the Christian sabbath
                        are in effect exalting themselves above God by planning to do
                        what He Himself has not done or authorized anyone else to do.
                            The jot (yod) is the smallest character in the Hebrew alpha-
                        bet. A tittle (the tiniest part of a letter of the Greek alphabet)
                        is even smaller; it is the hook or point of such a letter. It is
                        small like the dot on the "i" or the cross on the "t." Christ
                         teaches in Matt. 5:18 that the Ten Commandments cannot be
                        changed in the least as long as heaven and earth stand. This
                        shows that Christ did not change the Sabbath from the seventh
                        day to the first to honor His resurrection.
                            Christ foretold the destruction of Jerusalem, and it occurred
                        thirty-nine years afterward, in A.D. 70.
                            He said, "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,
                        neither on the sabbath day." Matt. 24:20. Thus he indicated
                        that the same seventh-day Sabbath which His disciples were
                        keeping before His death would still be the Sabbath of the
                        Lord in A.D. 70, or thirty-nine years after His resurrection.

                           How has the Lord forbidden men to attempt to change
                        His commandments? Deut. 4:2; 12:32.


 THINK IT THROUGH           Is it my steadfast purpose that by the grace of God
                        I will obey His commands without any additions or sub-

The Attempted Change         LESSON 6                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                              July 31
             Part 2        "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel,
UNCHANGED UNDER         and with the house of Judah: . . . I will put my law in
   NEW COVENANT         their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will
      Jer. 31:31-33     be their God, anetthey shall be my people."

                           "The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone
                        is written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart.
                        Instead of going about to establish our own righteousness we
                        accept the righteousness of Christ. . . . Through the grace of
                        Christ we shall live in obedience to the law of God written
                        upon our hearts. Having the Spirit of Christ, we shall walk
                        even as He walked."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 372.
                           This shows that under the new covenant God writes upon
                        the renewed hearts of converted persons the same law of His
                        Ten Commandments which, in connection with the old cove-
                        nant with Israel, He had written upon the two tablets of
                        stone. Thus Christ's seventh-day Sabbath stands unchanged
                        in the very heart of the Decalogue under the new covenant.

                           What is the attitude of a converted person toward
                        God's commandments? Ps. 40:8; Ezek. 11:19, 20; Rom.
                        7:22.


                           Some ask, "If the keeping of the seventh day is binding on
                        Christians, then why is there no command concerning it in the
                        New Testament?"
                           "The New Testament does not reenact the law of the tithe,
                        as it does not that of the Sabbath; for the validity of both is
                        assumed, and their deep spiritual import explained."—Counsels

             Part 3  "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that
      NOT CHANGED preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath
       BY APOSTLES day."
         Acts 15:21
                            There are still those who say that the apostles introduced
                        the keeping of Sunday in the place of the seventh day. But the
                        book of Acts shows that the apostles regarded the seventh day
                        as the only weekly Sabbath.
                           There are eight places, in the Acts of the Apostles, where
                        reference is made to the seventh-day Sabbath: Acts 13:14, 27,
                        42, 44; 15:21; 16:13; 17:1-4; 18:4. If the apostles had changed
                         the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, they
                        could not have correctly called the seventh day the Sabbath
                        day. These references in the Acts show that the apostles did
                        not change the Sabbath.
                           In three of these references—Acts 13:27; 15:21; 18:4—three
                        Christian leaders—Paul, James, and Luke—refer to successive
                        Sabbaths on which devout Jews and Gentiles assembled for
                        worship as "every Sabbath day."
                           Some ask, "If the keeping of the seventh day is still binding,
                        how is it that all of the Ten Commandments are repeated in
                        the New Testament except the Sabbath commandment?"
                           Only three of the Ten Commandments are repeated verbatim
                        in the New Testament: the sixth, seventh, and eighth. Does
                        this mean that the other seven are not binding? Not at all.
                        It was not necessary for them to be repeated verbatim, or
                        reenacted, in the New Testament to make them binding.
                           None of them ever was repealed. None expired by limita-
                        tion. Hence all of them, including the Sabbath, are binding.

                          What texts show that the apostles taught that all the
                        Ten Commandments are to be obeyed by Christians?
                        James 2:8-12; Rom. 7:7; 13:8-10; Eph. 6:2.



 THINK IT THROUGH           Since it was contrary to the will of God for men to at-
                        tempt to change the true Sabbath, what should be my
                        attitude toward it?

The Attempted Change       LESSON 6                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                          August 2
             Part 4      "He shall speak great words against the most High,
      THE ATTEMPT     and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think
         FORETOLD     to change times and laws."
          Dan. 7:25
                        The context reveals that this prediction refers to a religio-
                      political power that ruled over Western Europe after the fall
                      of the Roman Empire in the West. No other power fits the
                      specifications of the prophecy except the papacy.

                         What one word in Dan. 7:25 indicates not only a delib-
                      erate attempt to change the law of God, but also an
                      inability to change it in reality?



                         One important measurement of time is the seven-day week,
                      as stated in the Sabbath command. Changing the times and the
                      law points to an attempt to change God's Sabbath command-
                      ment. Roman Catholic spokesmen plainly declare that their
                      church has changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.
                         In a popular Catholic book we read:
                         "Q. Which is the Sabbath day?
                         "A. Saturday is the Sabbath day.
                         "Q. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?
                         "A. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the
                      Catholic Church . . . transferred the solemnity from Saturday
                      to Sunday."—Peter Geiermann, The Convert's Catechism of
                      Catholic Doctrine, 1957 ed., page 50.
                         Thus the Catholic Church admits making this change, as
                      was forecast in Dan. 7:25. Many have noted that in practice
                      the churches keep Sunday, the first day, when the Ten Com-
                      mandments say, "The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord
                      thy God."
 THINK IT THROUGH         How can a person keeping Sunday correct this dis-
                       crepancy between his practice and God's commandment?




   "The soul who keeps the Sabbath is     of the City of God who does not bear

         Isa. 48:3
                           We find light on future events in the prophecies of the Bible
                        for our day. This prophecy, "He . . . shall think to change the
                        times and the law" (Dan. 7:25, RSV), is one key for unlocking
                        the Sabbath truth as it pertains to our day. "The change in the
                        fourth commandment exactly fulfills this prophecy."—The
                        Great Controversy, page 446.
                           History confirms this prophecy. The establishment of Sun-
                        day observance instead of that of the Sabbath was accom-
                        plished principally under the leadership and domination of the
                        Roman power.
                           Dr. Nicholas Summerbell, a founding father of the denomi-
                        nation known as the Disciples of Christ, wrote a History of
                        Christians, in which he says: "The Roman Church . . . has
                        reversed the fourth commandment, by doing away with the
                        Sabbath of God's word, and instituting Sunday as a holiday."
                        —Pages 417, 418.
                           Some ask, "When was the Sabbath changed?" No exact
                        date can be given, for in its effect it was a gradual change that
                        took place most significantly from about A.D. 150 to 400.
                           Christians generally did not refrain from ordinary labor on
                        Sunday until the first Sunday law was issued by Constantine
                        the Great in A.D. 321. The church Council of Laodicea a little
                        later decreed that Christians should not be idle on the Sabbath
                        and, if possible, should abstain from work on Sunday.

                           What does Christ say about those who follow tradi-
                        tion in violation of His commandments? Mark 7:7-13.


                           Every Christian should reject this unscriptural change of
                        Christ's Sabbath commandment. In love for Him he should
                        say, "As for me, I will take my stand for Christ's seventh-day
                        Sabbath as commanded in the Ten Commandments."

        Rom. 6:16 teousness?"

                        This is a decisive statement. It reveals that all people by
                      their own choice arrange themselves on one of two sides, either
                      for the Lord Jesus Christ or for Satan.

                        What, according to Rom. 6:16, shows whose servants
                      we are?


                          Every soul settles his eternal destiny, for heaven or hell,
                      by whether his faith in Christ leads him to choose to obey
                      Christ. The real test is submission to the rightful supremacy
                      of the Son of God versus the assumed supremacy of Satan.
                          In this closing age God has ordained that this test concern-
                      ing the Sabbath truth shall come to every soul. Christ has ap-
                      pointed His Sabbath as a sign of His supremacy as our Creator
                      and God and our only Saviour. The attempted change of the
                      Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday stands as a sign of the
                      unwarranted attempt by the papal power to assume supremacy
                      in religious matters.
                          This presents a decisive test to every soul. Will your faith
                      lead you to accept the sign of Christ's authority by keeping
                      the seventh day as He commands? Or will you in unbelief fol-
                      low the sign of the papal authority by keeping Sunday as it
                      directs?
                          This issue of whether a person keeps the seventh day or the
                      first means far more than whether a person rests on Saturday
                      or Sunday. It involves a choice between acceptance of the
                       rightful supremacy of the Son of God over one's life and sub-
                       mission to the assumed supremacy of the papal power. It
                       means a decision for or against Christ as our supreme Lord.

                          On what basis should we decide this Sabbath ques-
                       tion? Acts 5:29.

                                                                          August 6

                     day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and
       Ex. 20:10, 11 hallowed it."

                          The Lord commands us to keep holy the same day of the
                      week on which He, as our Creator-God, rested after He had
                      made the world in six days. This cannot apply to any except
                      the seventh and last day of the week.
                          The idea that it makes no difference which day a person
                      observes is directly contrary to the Lord's Sabbath command-
                      ment. The concept that keeping any day in the seven is suffi-
                      cient contradicts the Creator.
                        - The reasons why Christ asks man to observe the Sabbath do
                      not apply to any other day in the week except the seventh. He
                      has so designed this Sabbath command that only the proper
                      keeping of the seventh day will meet its requirement.

                         May we expect the Lord to take• notice when men set
                      aside the Sabbath command or any other divine law?
                      Ps. 119:126.


                         The substitution of any other day than the last day of the
                      week for the Sabbath is disobedience to our Lord Jesus Christ.
                      The difference between keeping the seventh-day Sabbath, when
                      we perceive its validity, and a man-made sabbath on any of
                      the other six days is the vital difference between obedience to
                      the Lord and disobedience to Him. This involves one's eternal
                      destiny.

                         What solemn warnings given in the last chapter of
                      the Bible stress the importance of following God's Word
                      exactly as He has given it? Rev. 22:18, 19.

                     gardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the
       Rom. 14:5, 6 day, to the Lord he doth not regard it."
                           Does this text mean that Christians need not keep any fixed
                       day in the week as the Lord's day? Is Paul sanctioning thereby
                       the keeping of any day that a person may choose? Not at all.
                       Why not? Because this interpretation would make Rom. 14:
                       5, 6 contradict the Lord's command in Ex. 20:8-11. Also it
                       would make Paul contradict his own teachings that the Ten
                       Commandments are to be obeyed by Christians. See Eph. 6:2;
                       Rom. 7:7; 3:31; 13:8-10.
                           In addition to the weekly seventh-day Sabbath of the
                       Decalogue, the Lord gave to the •Jews seven yearly sabbaths
                       in the ceremonial law. These are listed in Leviticus 23. The
                       requirement for their observance ended when Christ was cruci-
                       fied. No one needed to honor them thereafter.
                           Many of the Jewish believers continued to observe some of
                        these yearly sabbaths after their conversion to Christianity.
                        Some also observed certain fast days, and some urged that the
                        Gentile Christians should observe them too.
                           Paul sought to end this dissension and establish Christian
                        tolerance on minor differences not vital to salvation. He urged
                        that the religious observance or nonobservance of a ceremonial
                        feast day was not a matter on which one should judge another.
                            However, the weekly seventh-day Sabbath (Ex. 20:8-11) is
                        another matter altogether. The Lord requires every soul to keep
                        the Sabbath of the Decalogue. He has not left it to others
                         to decide what day we are to keep.

                           Discuss the distinction between the weekly seventh-day
                        Sabbath and the yearly rest days of .Leviticus 23 with
                        regard to time of origin, reasons given for observance,
                        and continuity. See Gen. 2:3; Ex. 20:8-11.

                         the obligation to observe the seventh-day Sabbath ended at
                         the cross. Such an interpretation is unsound. Why? Because the
                         Bible does not actually teach such a thing.
                            In a former lesson we noted eight places in the book of
                         Acts where the seventh-day Sabbath is spoken of during the
                         decades that followed Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. If
                         the seventh-day Sabbath had been abolished at the cross, then
                         the Word of God would not thereafter refer to the seventh day
                         as the Sabbath.
                            " 'Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on
                         the Sabbath day,' Christ said. He who made the Sabbath did
                         not abolish it, nailing it to His cross. The Sabbath was not
                         rendered null and void by His death. Forty years after His
                         crucifixion it was still to be held sacred. For forty years the
                         disciples were to pray that their flight might not be on the
                         Sabbath day."—The Desire of Ages, page 630.

                            How does the context of Col. 2:16, 17 show that it
                         applies to the abolition of the Jewish typical system at
                         the cross? Col. 2:14, 16, 17.



                            Paul is dealing in part with a similar problem in Rom.
                         14:5, 6. The yearly holy days of the ceremonial law are not
                         binding on Christians. The Jewish ceremonial system met its
                         fulfillment in Christ. Therefore Christians are not obligated
                         to present the burnt offerings, the meal and drink offerings, to
                         observe the new moons, the annual feast days, and the yearly
                         sabbaths.
 THINK IT THROUGH            How does the origin of the Sabbath in Eden show that
                         it cannot be included among those typical, yearly Sab-
                         baths which were a shadow of things to come?

Why Not Any Day? LESSON 7                                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                            August 9
             Part 4     "There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the
 SITUATION ETHICS     end thereof are the ways of death."
      INADEQUATE
        Prov. 16:25      Many people make their decision concerning the Sabbath
                      question by a form of situation ethics. They think the keeping
                      of Sunday, motivated by love, is proper under present-day cir-
                      cumstances. Hence they deem it unnecessary to make any
                      Biblical investigation of the subject.
                         Prov. 16:25 shows the danger in deciding our course by
                      principles of situation ethics, and the fatal results of following
                      such a course. The way may seem right to a person, but it
                      ends in destruction.

                         Can he who depends entirely upon his own reason-
                      ing find the right way? Jer. 10:23.


                         The notion behind situation ethics is not new. To a degree
                      Eve made the first human experiment with it in Eden. It
                      seemed right to her understanding of love, under the circum-
                      stances, to eat the fruit from the Lord's reserved tree. Yet it
                      was the worst thing she could have done.
                         Six thousand years of misery and suffering have come upon
                      humanity because Eve reasoned that it wouldn't do any harm
                      to eat the fruit of the Lord's reserved tree. "She disbelieved
                      the words of God, and this was what led to her fall."—
                      Patriarchs and Prophets, page 55.
                         In matters of clear-cut moral duty, God has dealt with the
                      inadequacy of situation ethics. He commanded, "Ye shall not
                      do . . . every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes." Deut.
                      12:8. This verse of scripture overthrows the philosophy of
                      situation ethics insofar as our duty to God is concerned.
                         Some ask, "If I am not to do what I think is right, what
                      shall I do?" The Lord tells you what to do: "Observe . . . all
                      these words which I command thee, that it may go well with
                      thee, . . . when thou doest that which is good and right in
                      the sight of the Lord thy God." Deut. 12:28. When the appli-
                      cation of His law seems impossible, He will guide us if we
                      are willing.
 THINK IT THROUGH        Am I fully committed to follow only what is right in
                      the sight of God, as defined in His Word?

Why Not Any Day? LESSON 7                                                 ❑ Thursday
                                                                              August 10
            Part 5     "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
 GOD IS PARTICULAR enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the
         Matt. 7:21 will of my Father which is in heaven."

                             The Lord is particular about how we cooperate with His
                         plan to work in us for true obedience to all His commandments.
                         The Bible shows that admittance into heaven calls for this.
                         Jesus says that many who perform wonderful works in His
                         name will be denied entrance into heaven because they have
                         disobeyed some of His commandments. Matt. 7:22, 23.
                             Many are unaware of what is involved in their own in-
                         dividual cases in this matter of the Sabbath versus Sunday.
                         It is not merely a choice as to which day one shall observe as
                         God's holy Sabbath.
                             The real issue is obedience versus disobedience, faith versus
                         unbelief. Shall I obey the Lord in keeping the seventh day as
                         He directs in Ex. 20:8-11? Or shall I obey man in keeping the
                         first day? In this case the only right decision for a Christian
                         to make is to obey Christ.

                           What is the difference in the end between obeying
                         Christ and disobeying Him? Heb. 5:9; Rev. 22:14; 21:8.



                            What does Christ want us to do above all else? Deut.
                         5:29; 10:12, 13; John 14:15, 21.



                            The idea that it makes no difference which day one keeps,
                         just so he observes a day, lacks validity, even as does the false
                         proposition that it makes no difference which god a person
                         worships, just so he worships a god. The underlying issue in
                         each case is obedience to God versus disobedience. Whom shall
                         I obey as supreme?
                            Christians need to realize from the Scriptures how the keep-
                         ing of the seventh day is Christ's appointed way whereby we
                         show our faith in Him as our Creator-Saviour. This shows
                         that making a lasting decision to keep His Sabbath is one of
                         the best things any person can do.
 THINK IT THROUGH            Why does Christ want to see obedience in me above
                         all else? John 15:14; Deut. 6:24.




   "It is the grossest presumption for       to occasionally use the Sabbath for
mortal man to venture upon a com-            secular business as to entirely reject
promise with the Almighty in order to        it; for it is making the Lord's command-
secure his own petty, temporal interests.    ments a matter of convenience."—"Tes-

        John 9:41
                        God judges every soul according to the light and oppor-
                     tunities he has had for obeying the truth. If a person has had
                     no opportunity to learn about the true Sabbath, he will not
                     be condemned for keeping the wrong day through ignorance.
                     Acts 17:30. Condemnation comes when a person willfully re-
                     fuses to obey the truth. John 3:19.

                        What is the situation when a person knows what is
                     right and fails to do it? James 4:17.


                       The true Christian obeys the truth when the Word of God
                     points it out. John 8:47; Luke 8:15. God's eye is on every
                     honest soul in every country. 2 Chron. 16:9. He will lead such
                     ones into a fuller knowledge of truth.

                         How is the vital matter of our cleansing from sin af-
                      fected by our walking in the light, obeying truth as it
                      comes to us? 1 John 1:7.


                         What plain Biblical evidences show the inseparable connec-
                      tion between keeping the seventh day and obeying Jesus
                      Christ?
                         1. The seventh day is the only day of the week that Christ, as
                      our Creator, ever sanctified, or set apart as holy, for man to
                      observe.
                         2. The seventh day is the only day of the week that the
                      Son of God ever blessed or hallowed for man.
                         3. The seventh day is the only day of the week that Christ,
                      as the Lord of the Ten Commandments, has ever commanded
                      any Christian to keep as holy.
                         4. The seventh day is the only day of the week that the
                      Lord has appointed us to keep as the sign that He is our
                       Creator-God and only Saviour.

                            The Jewish religious leaders considered it a sin to heal a
                         crippled person on the Sabbath. Isn't this surprising? It shows
                         the senseless extremes to which people will go when they lose
                         the spirit of true religion in a sterile system of righteousness
                         by works. They had buried the proper keeping of the right
                         day under a long list of senseless restrictions of their own
                         devising. Jesus swept away these burdensome man-made ex-
                         actions. He restored to men the true objective of Sabbath
                         keeping.

                            How did Christ refute their charge that He and His
                         disciples broke the Sabbath? Luke 13:14-17; 14:1-6; Matt.
                         12:1-8.



                            How did He sweep away their exacting man-made
                         regulations concerning the Sabbath? Matt. 12:12, last
                         part.


                            Jesus was a Sabbath reformer, not by changing the day
                         which is to be kept, but by showing how it is to be observed.
                         Today God's remnant are called by Him to be Sabbath re-
                         formers, both as to the identity of His true Sabbath and as

 THINK IT THROUGH           In the case of the Jews, how did their burdensome

   A FALSE CHARGE of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day."
         John 9:16
                          This does not prove that Christ broke the Sabbath. It does
                       say that His enemies accused Him of doing that. It simply
                       records the false charge of Sabbath breaking that the Pharisees
                       brought against Him.
                          He who accuses Christ of breaking the Sabbath arrays the
                       Saviour against Himself. Why? Because He, as the Creator,
                       set it apart as holy for man in the beginning. Gen. 2:2, 3;
                       Mark 2:27. He is the Lord God who requires in the Ten Com-
                       mandments that we keep it holy. He did break the burden-
                       some regulations which the Jewish leaders had made concern-
                       ing Sabbath observance. But He rightly kept the Sabbath as
                       required in the Old Testament.

                          How do we know that Christ kept the Sabbath ac-
                       cording to God's commandments? 1 Peter 2:21; John
                       15:10.



                          What did His enemies decide to do when Christ re-
                       fused to keep the Sabbath according to their ideas?
                       John 5:16-18.


                         The Orthodox Jew today reckons the Sabbath from sunset
                       Friday evening to sunset Saturday evening. But he does not
                       keep this right day in the right way, because he does not have
                       the Lord of the Sabbath. One cannot keep the Sabbath of the
                       Lord correctly unless he has this Lord living in him. And no
                       one can have the Lord living in him until he has been born
                       again as a result of believing in Christ as his personal Saviour.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Consider John 5:16 in the light of Rev. 13:15. What
                       test will the remnant finally face as a result of refusing
                       to keep the counterfeit sabbath?

                           It has been widely proclaimed that those who keep the
                        seventh day according to the Ten Commandments are legalists
                        trying to save themselves by their own works.
                           Under the new covenant of grace, he who truly accepts
                        Christ receives a new heart (or mind). Christ writes His com-
                        mandments upon the believer's heart. Heb. 8:8-10. In doing
                        this, He does not omit the precept concerning His Sabbath.
                        "The fourth commandment is the only one of all the ten in
                        which are found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver."
                        —Patriarchs and Prophets, page 307.

                           When Christ lives His life in the enlightened, sur-
                        rendered, born-again believer, how many of His com-
                        mandments will the believer obey? 1 John 2:3, 4; Ps.
                        40:8.



                           How does true faith in Christ manifest itself in rela-
                        tionship to the requirements of God's law? Rom. 3:31;
                        Rev. 14:12.


                           Keeping the Sabbath as Christ directs does not make a
                        Christian a legalist, even as obedience to the other nine pre-
                        cepts of the Decalogue does not make him a legalist. John
                        Wesley was right when he said that after his conversion he
                        wanted the law to keep him to Christ, as he ever wanted it to
                        bring him to Christ. (Sermons, Vol. 1, p. 314.)
 THINK IT THROUGH         How am I reacting to my greatest need of letting

                           Some claim that living in the newness of the spirit, and not
                        in the oldness of the letter, means that one may violate the
                        letter of the Decalogue while obeying it in spirit. They apply
                        this false reasoning to the Sabbath commandment; they insist
                        that living in the newness of the spirit means that they need
                        not keep the exact seventh day as specified in the letter and
                        that keeping Sunday is carrying out the spirit of the law.

                  1).       How did Christ show that a person may obey the
                        commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," according to the
                        letter, but be living in violation of the spirit of that com-
                        mand? Matt. 5:21-23, 43, 44.




                           He who is honest according to the spirit of the command,
                        "Thou shall not steal," will not act contrary to the letter of it.
                           A person may follow the letter of the law and yet not obey
                        the spirit of it. But no person who obeys the law in spirit will
                        live contrary to the letter of it. Let no one deceive himself in
                        this. There is no such thing as keeping the Sabbath in spirit
                        while directly violating the letter of the Sabbath precept.
                           The spirit of true Sabbath keeping is a manifestation of
                        supreme love to Christ as our Creator and Saviour. By His
                        creative power a penitent sinner is made into a new person.
                        Then he must let Christ sanctify him by His indwelling pres-
                        ence every day. Thus his Sabbath keeping becomes a real sign
                        that Christ the Saviour is his Creator-Sanctifier.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Does my Christianity go beyond the letter of the law

     GRACE PRODUCES forbid: yea, we establish the law."
         OBEDIENCE
          Rom. 3:31     A doctrine that is half true and half false is very dangerous.
                    The citing of a few Scriptures to support such a doctrine mis-
                    leads many who do not know the real teachings of the Bible.
                    It is for our eternal good that we know what is the real truth
                    in Christ.
                        Some say, "A Christian is not under the law, but under
                    grace. Hence he doesn't need to keep the seventh day as speci-
                    fied in the Ten Commandments." The first part of this state-
                    ment is true; but the second part is false. This is an example
                    of the way many are led to accept doctrines that are half true
                    and half false.

                             How does Paul in Rom. 3:31 show that salvation by
                          grace only, and justification by faith only, do not su-
                          persede the obligation to keep God's commandments?



                             What positive evidence is there to show that being
                          under grace does not mean that a person is free to live
                          contrary to God's moral law? Rom. 6:14, 15.


                             A converted person is not under the condemnation of the
                          law, but under grace. This is the case only when sin—the trans-
                          gression of God's law—is no longer the ruling factor in his
                          life. Notice the word "for" in verse 14.
                             Does being under grace give a person license to steal, lie,
                          swear, commit adultery, or worship false gods? Certainly not.
                          God's Ten Commandments forbidding these things are binding
                          forever upon all. So being under grace does not release a be-
                          liever from keeping the seventh-day Sabbath which God or-
                          dained in the Ten Commandments.
                             When a believer receives Christ for his justification, then by
                          grace the work of sanctification begins. Christ has appointed
                          the keeping of His Sabbath as a sign of this continuing process
                          of sanctification. Ezek. 20:12.
 THINK IT THROUGH            Is my Sabbath keeping such that it is an outward
                          sign of the operation of God's grace working in me for
                          my progressive sanctification?

                      concluded from this that the Sabbath pertained to the Jewish
                      people solely and exclusively. However, the text shows that
                      the Sabbath is such a sign because God is the Creator of heaven
                      and earth. And this basic reason is applicable to every soul on
                      earth.
                         The Bible repeatedly refers to the only true God as the
                      God of Israel. Does this mean that the true God is exclusively
                      for the Jews? He is certainly the only true God for every soul.
                      So the observance of God's true Sabbath by the Jews does
                      not preclude its being the only true Sabbath for every soul.
                         God committed His system of truth—including His Ten
                      Commandments, His Sabbath, and the entrance of His Son into
                      human form—to the Jews because the Hebrew people had
                      been called to witness for Him to all people.

                         How does the Word point out that all Gentiles and
                      Jews who truly accept Christ are counted as Israelites
                      by the Lord? Gal. 3:29, 7; Rom. 9:6-8.



                          What shows that the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel
                       continue throughout eternity? Rev. 21:12; Matt. 19:28.


                          Thus the Lord's declaration that His Sabbath was made for
                       man (Isa. 56:2, 5, 6) and is a sign between Him and Israel
                       forever is conclusive evidence that it is a continuing sign of
                       allegiance to Christ as our Creator throughout eternity in the
                       earth made new (Isa. 66:22, 23).
                           The Sabbath rests on one immutable, unshakable, indivisi-
                       ble, and everlasting pillar—Christ our Creator and our Sanc-
                       tifier. Ex. 31:17, 13 presents such a pillar.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Does my Sabbath keeping reveal that I am a true
                       subject of Christ's creative and redemptive power?



  "Speaking of Israel, He said, 'I gave power to make us holy. And it is given
them My Sabbaths, to be a sign be- to all whom Christ makes holy. As a
tween Me and them, that they might sign of His sanctifying power, the Sab-
know that I am the Lord that sanctify   bath is given to all who through Christ
them,'—make them holy. Ezek. 20:12.     become a part of the Israel of God."

           Isa. 56:6 bath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant."

                           This prophecy of Isaiah is quoted in The Great Controversy,
                        page 451, where this statement is made: "The work of Sabbath
                        reform to be accomplished in the last days is foretold in the
                        prophecy of Isaiah."
                           The substitution of Sunday keeping in place of the seventh
                        day of the Ten Commandments makes a breach in one's full
                        commitment to his Creator-Saviour and His law. Also, it takes
                        away the seal from His law. This makes a God-appointed Sab-
                        bath reform movement a necessity in this closing period of
                        time. His remnant will restore the seal to His law. Isa. 8:16, 17.

                           What does prophecy say about God's people repair-
                        ing this breach by keeping the right day in the right
                        way? Isa. 58:12, 13.


                           Note that being a repairer of the breach, as stated in verse
                        12, is expressly conditioned upon the 'Sabbath reform of verse
                        13.
                            In this age of permissiveness and lukewarmness there is a
                        growing trend among many Sabbath keepers to keep the sev-
                        enth-day in a careless manner as most others keep Sunday.
                        They make it a holiday rather than the Lord's holy day. Every
                        Sabbath keeper is called to resist such a departure from Christ's
                        way. Carelessness in Sabbath keeping begets carelessness in
                        obedience to God's other requirements, in talking, eating,
                        drinking, dressing, associations, recreation, et cetera.

                            What is the sad result when a believer's actions con-
                         tradict his profession? Rom. 2:21-24; 2 Tim. 3:1-5.


 THINK IT THROUGH          Is my Sabbath keeping such that it bears the right
                        testimony for the Lord of the Sabbath?

        PROTECTING afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even,
         THE EDGES from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath."
          Lev. 23:32
                           This was the rule for the reckoning of the yearly ceremonial
                        sabbath of the Day of Atonement. But the same rule—from
                        evening unto evening, or from sunset to sunset—applies also for
                        beginning and ending the weekly seventh-day Sabbath. Christ's
                        Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on
                        Saturday.

                            What did Nehemiah, as governor of Jerusalem, do
                         to protect the edges of the Sabbath? Neh. 13:19.



                           Those who wait until Saturday morning to begin their
                        observance of the Sabbath have only a partial Sabbath, which
                        really is not right. No one can keep the Sabbath unless he
                        begins its observance when it commences at sunset. If he begins
                        its observance one or two hours after sunset, he is lagging
                        behind the Lord's schedule. Those who go through the gates
                        into the New Jerusalem at the end will not lag behind His
                        schedule.
                           There is no better way to protect the edges of the Sabbath
                        than to gather around the family altar for worship at sunset
                        on Friday and again at sunset on Saturday. How fitting it is,
                        at the moment of sunset on Friday, to welcome the Sabbath
                        with praise and,prayer as it arrives.
                            This sets the 'tempo for closer fellowship with God during
                         the Sabbath day. It serves to instill a spirit of reverent regard
                        for its sacred hours.
                            Then how fitting also at sunset on Saturday to have a season
                         of special worship, to thank God for the blessings of this Sab-
                         bath and to ask for His special help to live right during each
                        day of the next week until we welcome another Sabbath at
                         the next Friday sunset. Thus special prayer at sunset at the
                         commencement and again at its close serves to mark off each
                         Sabbath as Christ's holy day in closer fellowship with Him.

 PREPARATION DAY       was the preparation, that is, the day before the sab-
       Mark 15:42      bath."

                          This text, in conjunction with Luke's testimony (Luke 23:54
                       to 24:1), gives New Testament evidence that Friday, "the day
                       before the Sabbath," was the day of preparation for keeping
                       the Sabbath holy on the following day. God is particular about
                       how we observe His Sabbath. Unless certain matters are cared
                       for on Friday, we cannot keep the Sabbath holy. Hence the use
                       of Friday to prepare for beginning the Sabbath at sunset is
                       God's provision to help us rightly observe His hallowed day.

                          How did the Lord point out this duty to His people in
                        ancient times? Ex. 16:22-26.



                           If one does not prepare for the Sabbath on Friday, can
                        he really keep the Sabbath? Ex. 16:27, 28.


                          Suppose a dear friend or loved one, in a far distant place,
                       notified you that he would arrive at your house for a one-day
                       visit beginning at six o'clock on Friday evening. Wouldn't you
                       have everything in readiness to welcome him upon arrival?
                       How much more, then, we should be ready to welcome Christ's
                       precious Sabbath at Friday sunset, and then enter into a closer
                       fellowship with Him.
                          The right use of Friday as the preparation day ,enables us to
                       welcome the Sabbath immediately when it arrives. Also, it
                       prevents certain worldly cares from causing us to mar God's
                       plan for our Sabbath keeping.

                  t$.      Does the Bible show that there should be no buying
                        or selling on God's holy day? Neh. 13:15-18.



                           What example did Christ leave for us in regularly
                        attending divine worship on the Sabbath? Luke 4:16, 31;
                        Mark 1:20, 21. See also Lev. 23:3.


                           It was a part of the life of Jesus to attend p_itlalic worship
                        every Sabbath. So it will be a part of our way onifr;r        ien
                        we closely follow His way,
                           Jesus doubtless walked out tch see the beauties of nature on
                        the Sabbath, but not at the time of the Sabbath worship
                        service.
                           All that is permissible on the Sabbath is wrapped into
                        doing well, which was His guiding principle. Matt. 12:12. Re-
                        lieving the afflicted and doing deeds of kindness and acts of
                        mercy are in accord with this principle. A safe rule is this: Do
                        not leave any secular work to be done on the Sabbath that
                        can be done during the six working days.

           Ex. 20:8-10 not do any work."

                             One main objective of the Sabbath observance is that man
                         may continually remember the Lord Jesus Christ as his Crea-
                         tor-Saviour. Thus remembering the Sabbath is not limited to
                         the twenty-four-hour period of its observance during the end
                         of the week. It projects itself into the entire week, as a part
                         of our everyday commitment to our Creator-Saviour.
                             Your paper boy tells you on Sunday, "This month ends on
                         Saturday. I will stop then to collect." But you say, "Saturday
                         is for me the Lord's Sabbath. Please be so kind as to call either
                         Friday or Sunday and I will pay you." Or, "Let me pay you
                         now, and avoid a special trip." Thus you are remembering the
                         Sabbath on the first day of the week.
                            On Monday your dealer telephones that the refrigerator
                         which you ordered will be delivered next Saturday morning.
                         But you tell him that you are a Seventh-day Adventist and
                         that you don't transact any business on Saturday because you
                         observe it as the Lord's Sabbath. Suggest he bring it out Friday
                         morning or Monday or on the dealer's next convenient day.
                         In this you are remembering the Sabbath on Monday.
                            Perhaps on Wednesday a neighbor calls to say, "My little
                         girl has a birthday Saturday. We will have a picnic at the
                         park to celebrate it with a lot of games and a big dinner. We
                         invite you to come along." But you say, "Thanks for remem-
                         bering me in your plans. But Saturday is the Lord's Sabbath
                         for me, and although I appreciate the invitation, I must de-
                         cline your kindness." You are remembering the Sabbath on
                         Wednesday.
                            "All through the week we are to have the Sabbath in mind
                         and be making preparation to keep it according to the com-

                            What great importance did the Lord attach to the

                    with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of
     Isa. 58:13, 14 the Lord hath spoken it."

                          Here God makes three promises to those who truly hallow
                       His Sabbath. (1) "Then shalt thou delight thyself in the
                       Lord"—true and abiding happiness. (2) "I will cause thee to
                       ride upon the high places of the earth"—spiritual prosperity.
                       (3) "I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father"
                       —an eternal home in the new earth.
                          The word "heritage" means an estate that a person receives
                       by descent or as an inheritance. The inheritance of Jacob is
                       that of Isaac his father, whose inheritance is that of his father
                       Abraham. The real inheritance of Abraham is the new earth.
                       Rom. 4:13; Heb. 11:13-16. Those who are truly Christ's are
                       fellow heirs with them to this inheritance. Gal. 3:29.
                          What greater promise could God make to those who hallow
                       His Sabbath than to give them the heritage of Abraham, Isaac,
                       and Jacob—an eternal home in the new earth? It will be free
                       from all sickness, sorrow, trouble, and death. How much is it
                       worth? What an encouragement for every true Sabbath keeper!
                       "It means eternal salvation to keep the Sabbath holy unto the
                       Lord."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 356.

                           What three things does God specify that we are not

            GOSPEL       to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
       Rom. 1:16, 17
                            The gospel is the power of God unto salvation because it
                         is "God's way of righting wrong, a way that starts from faith
                         and ends in faith." Rom. 1:17, NEB. The gospel of Christ is
                         summed up in righteousness by faith in Him.
                            Some have declared that keeping the seventh day is related
                         to righteousness by works. Such is not the case, even as obe-
                         dience to the other nine commandments by the born-again
                         believer is not.
                            In true Sabbath keeping the faithful believer does not keep
                         the Sabbath to make himself righteous. He keeps the seventh
                         day because he has received the righteousness of the Lord of
                         the Sabbath. The righteousness of Christ leads to full obedience
                         to God's commandments. See Rom. 8:3, 4.

                           In what words does Paul set forth Christ as both Re-
                         deemer and Creator? Col. 1:14-16.



                            Of what is the Sabbath declared to be a sign? Ex.
                         31:16, 17; Ezek. 20:12.


                            The Sabbath, as the appointed sign of loyalty to Christ as
                         our Creator, signifies that He alone can re-create a penitent
                         sinner into a righteous person. Thus it signifies that man cannot
                         save himself by his own works. He must depend wholly on
                         Christ to save and sanctify him. Thus true Sabbath keeping
                         stands as a Christ-appointed sign of the all-essential experience
                         of righteousness by faith.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Is my Sabbath keeping merely a formal, legal trans-
                         action, or the natural fruitage of my justification and

                      our faith in Christ. True faith always manifests itself in ap-
                      propriate works. So the true Christian does not keep the Sab-
                      bath to make himself righteous.
                         An apple tree does not become an apple tree by bearing
                      apples. First, it had to be an apple tree in order to bear
                      such fruit. Then the apples came as a natural fruitage of the
                      tree.

                         What really counts for a true Christian experience,
                      according to Gal. 5:6?



                         How will love for God manifest itself? 1 John 5:3;
                      1 Cor. 7:19.


                         A Christian who is keeping Sunday may find the real truth
                      for himself by accepting the Biblical answers to certain ques-
                      tions.
                          Do I believe that Jesus is my Creator and only Saviour?
                          Since I believe what the Bible says about Him, my answer
                      is in the affirmative. In fact, such an answer is essential to my
                      salvation.
                          "Every soul in our world is the Lord's property, by creation
                      and by redemption. Each individual soul is on trial for his
                      life. Has he given to God that which belongs to Him? Has
                      he surrendered to God all that is His as His purchased pos-
                      session? All who cherish the Lord as their portion in this life
                      will be under His control, and will receive the sign, the mark
                      of God, which shows them to be God's special possession.
                       Christ's righteousness will go before them, and the glory of
                       the Lord will be their rereward [rear guard]. The Lord pro-

                        ciple in attempting to make themselves righteous by their
                        works? Luke 18:11, 12; Matt. 6:1-5.
                           "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in
                        his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Rom. 3:20.
                        No person can make himself righteous by means of his own
                        good works.
                           When the Pharisees kept the Sabbath in order to make
                        themselves righteous, their Sabbath keeping became a part of
                        a false righteousness by works. It was not a sign of righteous-
                        ness by faith.
                           True Sabbath keeping is a continual acknowledgment of a
                        person's dependence and reliance upon our Creator for the gift
                        of life day by day, and upon our Redeemer for the gift of
                        salvation. The Sabbath can be kept holy only as one has re-
                        ceived righteousness by faith and continues in this experience;
                        for "the just shall live by faith."

                           Why does the substitution of ecclesiastical tradition in
                        place of the Lord's commandments constitute righteous-
                        ness by works? Mark 7:1-13.



                           The final issue upon which men must decide for or against
                        Christ will be the worship of the Creator versus the worship
                        of the beast and hini  nage—the reception of the seal of God
                        versus the acceptance of the mark of the beast. Rev. 14:6-12;
                        7:1-3. The basic issue is righteousness by faith versus righ-
                        teousness by works. In keeping with this thought, we have been
                        told that righteousness by faith is the third angel's message in
                        verity.

A Sign of Righteousness by Faith        LESSON 10                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                          August 30
             Part 4       "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
      CHRIST'S REST    laden, and I will give you rest."
        Matt. 11:28
                          This promise never fails when we comply with the condi-
                       tion. Everyone who comes to Christ in true penitence enters
                       into His rest. He alone can bring us rest from the guilt and
                       dominion of sin.

                          How does the Lord show that rest to the soul is the
                       fruitage of loving obedience to Him? Jer. 6:16; Isa.
                       32:17.




                          What is the token of Christ's rest for the believer?
                       Ex. 20:8-10.



                          The Lord of this commandment is Christ the Creator. Ex.
                       20:11.
                          The word "sabbath" is a transliteration of the Hebrew
                       word shabbath, which means a cessation, rest, or sabbath. The
                       expression "the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord" really
                       signifies for the Christian that the seventh day is the sacred
                       rest day of Christ the Lord.
                          The Sabbath, then, is primarily a day of spiritual rest in
                       Christ. It is our Saviour's loving provision for the believer to
                       enter more fully into His rest. This is true Sabbath keeping.
                          The fourth chapter of Hebrews mentions that God "spake
                       in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God
                       did rest the seventh day from all his works." Heb. 4:4. Then
                       from this comes the conclusion that "he that is entered into
                       his [God's] rest, he also bath ceased from his own works, as
                       God did from his." Heb. 4:10.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Am I making the Sabbath merely my own rest, and
                       not entering into Christ's rest?

             Part 5     "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from
      TRUE SABBATH doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath
          KEEPING a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt
                     honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine
         Ise. 58:13 own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words."

                          God declares that we are not to speak our own words upon
                       His holy day. Conversation that is proper concerning secular
                       matters on the other days is to be avoided on the Sabbath.
                       The conversation of the true Sabbath keeper will be centered
                       upon sacred themes during the Sabbath hours.
                          Without Christ's righteousness within, no person can refrain
                       from speaking his own words on the seventh day regardless
                       of his resolutions. He will talk upon secular matters that come
                       into his mind. He is unable to bring the thoughts and intents
                       of his heart into harmony with the sacredness of the Sabbath.

                          Why is an unconverted person unable to keep Christ's
                       Sabbath? Rom. 8:7.



                          What must a person have before he can receive Christ's
                       rest? Phil. 2:5.


                          No one can keep Christ's Sabbath unless he first has Him
                       living within to control his mind and affections. This experience
                       can make true Sabbath keeping a manifestation of righteous-
                       ness by faith.
                          There is an important difference between being a nominal
                       Saturday keeper and a real Sabbath keeper. An unconverted
                       person can lay aside his ordinary work and attend church
                       regularly on Saturday. But to be a real Sabbath keeper, one
                       must experience progressive sanctification as aresult of Christ's
                       living inliiin:ev-e. ry-day.
                          The mere acceptance of the Biblical evidences showing that
                       the seventh day is the only right day to keep can make a per-
                       son a Saturday keeper. But nothing except the sonyerting
                       power of_christ_can make us Christian Sabbath keepers.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Am I merely a Saturday keeper, or a true Sabbath
                       keeper?

            Ex. 16:4     them, whether they will walk in my law, or no."

                            God brought a test upon the Israelites, whereby each one
                         by his own choice demonstrated whether or not he would obey
                         the law of God. The context shows that the test was how he
                         would regard God's holy seventh day as the Sabbath. Ex.
                         16:4-28.
                            In this closing age God is calling His people to come out
                         of the false religious sisterhood led by Babylon the Great and
                         to unite with the remnant of His true church. Rev. 18:4;
                         12:17. God's test for all today is how each one, by his own
                         choice, will regard His commandments. The keeping of Christ's
                         Sabbath is to be the sign of loyal obedience to Him, the Lord
                         of the Sabbath.

                             On what twofold basis is every person obligated to
                          render supreme obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ? Acts
                          14:15; Ise. 43:11.


                             In these lessons we have learned from the Bible that Christ's
                          seventh-day Sabbath has a twofold significance: first, as a
                          sign of loyal allegiance to Him as Creator of all (Ex. 20:8-11)
                          and, therefore, the only true God (Ezek. 20:20) ; and, second,
                          as only Sanctifier, or Saviour (Ezek. 20:12). This makes the
                          Sabbath a precious sign of His authority by requiring of us
                          supreme obedience to Him above all others.
                             The Sabbath stands for supreme obedience to the Lord Jesus
                          Christ. The keeping of the Sabbath on our part signifies sub-
                          mission to His supreme authority. Its proper observance means
                          that we accept His control over our lives. True Sabbath keep-
                          ing is inseparably connected with living for Christ.

                             What does a presumptuous refusal, or neglect, to
                          keep the Sabbath mean concerning one's attitude toward
                          Christ? Ezek. 20:13.

    Acts 20:29, 30 verse things, to draw away disciples after them."

                            What departure from the truth would take place after
                        Paul's oversight of the churches should cease? Acts 20:29,
                        30.



                           How did Peter and John counsel Christ's followers to
                        remain true to the teachings of Jesus? 1 Peter 2:21;
                        1 John 2:6.


                           After the apostles passed away, certain church leaders be-
                        gan to mingle erroneous teachings with the pure religion of
                        Jesus. Rites, ceremonies, and customs which Jesus and His
                        apostles never taught crept into use. Soon men urged these
                        upon the believers as being of divine authority by tradition.
                        One of these innovations was the honoring of Sunday in
                        commemoration of the resurrection of Christ.
                           Some Christians began to meet at about sunrise on Sunday
                        for a brief religious service, after which they went about their
                        regular work. But as the second and third centuries passed,
                        Sunday began to take on more and more of the aspect of a
                        regular day of worship. The result was that Sunday keeping
                        gradually became widely established and preferred above the
                        seventh-day Sabbath of the Ten Commandments.
                           This general apostasy from the truth called for a divinely
                        inaugurated reformation. This began in earnest in the sixteenth
                        century under Martin Luther and other Reformers. What they
                        did in restoring certain lost truths was only a good begin-
                        ning. Bible prophecy indicates that this great work of reforma-
                        tion and restoration would continue in successive generations
                        until every error would be exposed and the full truth in Jesus
                        for His people would be restored. Rev. 14:6-11. This does not
                        mean that all professed Christians would fully accept the re-
                        stored truths, but a "remnant" would. Rev. 12:17; 14:12.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Do I follow the teachings of Jesus without subtrac-
                        tions or additions?


   "The spirit of concession to paganism    aside the ancient Sabbath, the day
opened the way for a still further dis-     which God had blessed and sanctified
regard of Heaven's authority. Satan,        .   , and in its stead to exalt the festi-

The Predicted Restoration     LESSON 11                                ❑    Monday
                                                                       September 4
           Part 2   "And an host was given him against the daily sacri-
        NEED FOR Lice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the
      RESTORATION truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered."
         Dan. 8:12
                        This refers to the same power that is set forth in Dan. 7
                     under the symbol of the little horn—the papacy. Paul spoke
                     of this power, too, as the one who would exalt himself above
                     God, "so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing
                     himself that he is God." See 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.

                         What does Dan. 8:12 declare this power would do
                      with the truth?


                         "The truth" in this case means the pure gospel preached by
                      the Lord Jesus and His apostles. They designated their teach-
                      ings as "the truth" (John 8:45, 46, 31, 32; Gal. 3:1; 2:14).
                      The Sabbath of Christ our Lord, as the sign that He is the
                      Creator-Sanctifier, is an essential part of the gospel truth cast
                      down to the ground by the little horn.
                         Dan. 7:25 (RSV) declares that this power would attempt
                      to "change the times and the law." In fulfillment of this
                      prophecy, this power attempted to change the fourth com-
                      mandment. It gradually set aside the keeping of the seventh-
                      day Sabbath as the Lord's day (Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke
                      6:5) and set up the keeping of Sunday in its place.

                         Why is the truth of God that is cast down to the ground
                      sure to rise again? Ps. 100:5; 111:7, 8.


                         God's truth was destined to be restored from being buried
                      under the false teaching of man. This same prophecy of Daniel
                      8 pointed out the time when God would inaugurate a reforma-
                      tory movement to restore His downtrodden truth.
                         "In every age there were witnesses for God—men who
                      cherished faith in Christ as the only mediator between God
                      and man, who held the Bible as the only rule of life, and who
                      hallowed the true Sabbath. How much the world owes to
                      these men, posterity will never know."—The Great Contro-
                      versy, page 61.
  THINK IT THROUGH        Do I appreciate this line of witnesses, many of whom
                      suffered death to preserve gospel truth for generations
                      to come?



   "As foretold by prophecy, the papal churches that were under the rule of
 power cast down the truth to the the papacy were early compelled to
 ground. The law of God was trampled honor the Sunday as a holy day."—

       RESTORATION
          Dan. 8:14    This is God's answer to the question in the preceding verse.
                         "How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice,
                         and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary
                         and the host to be trodden under foot?" Dan. 8:13.
                            How long shall the truth be cast down to the ground? The
                         answer in Dan. 8:14 implied that new light would appear—
                         particularly concerning God's sanctuary—at the end of the
                         2,300-day period. These symbolic days represent 2,300 literal
                         years. See Ezek. 4:6.

                         for the 2,300 days? Dan. 9:25.


                            This decree for the restoration of Jerusalem to the Jews
                         is recorded in Ezra 6:14 and 7:11-28. It was issued in the
                         seventh year of Artaxerxes I, king of Persia (Ezra 7:6-9),
                         which was 457 B.C.
                            This is the beginning date for the seventy weeks (or 490
                         years), the first part of the 2,300 day-years. The 490 years,
                         beginning in 457 s.c., extend to AD. 34, the end of the seventy
                         prophetic weeks. The remaining 1,810 day-years of the 2,300
                         extend from AD. 34 to 1844, the terminal date of the period
                         of 2,300 prophetic day-years. See The Great Controversy, page

             Part 4  "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that

      RESTORATION
         Rev. 14:12 This is the concluding statement of God's last-day message
                      which restores lost and neglected truths. Three angels are repre-
                      sented as heralding the three parts of this final gospel message
                      for all the world as recorded in Rev. 14:6-12.
                         The preaching of the gospel to all people has been com-
                      mitted to Christ's followers. Mark 16:15. Hence these three
                      angels prefigure the raising up of a special people, in this clos-
                      ing period of history, who will proclaim the everlasting gospel,
                      accompanied by certain special truths, to all the world.

                          What are the two chief points identifying the remnant
                       people of God in this closing age? Rev. 14:12.


                         God's true people keep the commandments of God and the
                      faith of Jesus. This shows that they are a people who keep the
                      seventh-day Sabbath, for the fourth precept of Christ's Ten
                      Commandments requires it. Ex. 20:8-11. Thus Rev. 14:12 is
                      a forecast of the restoration of the observance of the true
                      Sabbath under this final proclamation of Christ's everlasting
                      gospel.

                          What essential of true worship is called for in the
                       very first part of this last heaven-sent message? Rev.
                       14:6, 7.


                           The Bible shows that the worship of Christ as our Creator
                       is inseparably connected with-the- keeping of the seventh-day
                       Sabbath. Ex. 20:8-11; 31:16, 17. He has ordained the keeping
                       of His seventh-day Sabbath as a distinguishing sign that we
                       recognize Him as our Creator. Hence this last-day call to "wor-
                       ship him that made heaven, and earth" (Rev. 14:7) is another

          Rev. 14:6, 7 and the sea, and the fountains of waters."

                             These words, "for the hour of his judgment is come," pin-
                         point the time when God's Sabbath-restoring movement would
                         commence. Related Biblical evidences establish that the hour
                         of God's judgment in Rev. 14:7 arrived in the year 1844, when
                         the prophetic period of 2,300 days in Dan. 8:14 ended.
                             In 1844 a small company of Christians, some at Washing-
                         ton, New Hampshire, and others elsewhere, turned from keep-
                         ing Sunday and began to observe the seventh-day Sabbath
                         Soon Christians in other places accepted the Sabbath and the
                         other special truths of the threefold message. In 1860 these
                         Sabbath keepers chose the denominational name, "Seventh-day
                         Adventist."
                             From this small beginning in 1844, this divinely appointed
                         movement for restoring the true Sabbath and other lost truths
                         has spread into all the world. There are now more than twc
                         million people in this movement which began in answer tc
                         prophecy. It is a part of God's predetermined plan to enlighten
                         the whole world with His last message of truth.
                             Behold, then, the fulfillment of Rev. 14:6-12 in the rise
                         teachings, and worldwide extension of the movement for Sab-
                         bath reform as carried forward by the Seventh-day Advent-
                         ists. This movement is here in response to the sure word of
                         prophecy. It represents what the Lord has planned to be done
                         at this time.

                           How has the Lord cautioned men against rejecting the
                         work He is doing before their very eyes? Acts 13:40, 41



 THINK IT THROUGH          Do I appreciate the prophetic implications of being
                         Sabbath keeper in this great advent movement?

                            What shows that the prophecy of Isa. 58:12, 13, in-
                         cludes the restoration of the true Sabbath?


                            The phrase, "the restorer of paths to dwell in," is rendered,
                         "restorer of paths leading home," in Rotherham's translation
                         of Isa. 58:12. The path of obedience to Christ's command-
                         ments does lead men closer to God and to their everlasting
                         home.

                           Where does the path of obedience to God's com-
                         mandments lead the faithful? Rev. 22:14; Isa. 26:2.


                            "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath." Isa. 58:13.
                         God has appointed a special vindication and revelation of His
                         downtrodden Sabbath in these closing days. The world at
                         large has had its foot on Christ's Sabbath by using it as an
                         ordinary working day instead of honoring it as His holy rest
                         day. Now it must be removed.
                            Those whom God designates as His chosen restorers in
                         Isa. 58:12 are those who observe the Sabbath as He specifies
                         in Isa. 58:13. They keep the right day in the right way. In this
                         closing age, the Sabbath is to be presented by a people who
                         place righteousness by faith first in their way of life and in
                         their teachings to others.

repentance, conversion, love, obedience,
righteousness by faith, et cetera.              3. The People of God Identified
   In addition to these, there are special         Rev. 17:14
truths applicable only to the particular
time for which God has appointed them.          4. The Needed Certainty
Examples of these are: Noah's 120-year             Luke 4:21

             Part 1    "And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And
        PROPHETIC he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he an-
     CERTIFICATION swered, No. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that
                    we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest
      John 1:21, 22 thou of thyself?"

                          There were at that time various religious sects among the
                       Jews. The Bible mentions some of them: Pharisees, Sadducees,
                       Herodians, Zealots. John the Baptist had arisen as a new
                       preacher proclaiming a new and startling message.
                          Questions naturally arose concerning his teachings. What
                       divine authority did he have for his message? How could his
                       listeners be sure that his teachings presented the right way for
                       them to follow, in preference to the currently popular reli-
                       gious ways?

                          What evidence did John cite to certify that his teach-
                       ings were God's present truth for the people of his day?
                       John 1:23.



                          John cited Isa. 40:3 as the prophecy which his work and
                       teachings were fulfilling. If the message of Isa. 40:3 had not
                       been proclaimed at that time, the Bible would not be a true
                       book. The Lord had raised up John the Baptist at the right
                       time, to preach the right message, to show the right way, to
                       men at that time. His work and teachings were a remarkable
                       fulfillment of prophecy.
                          Strong evidence that God has ordained certain religious
                       teaching is shown when that message is indicated in prophecy
                       and it is proclaimed according to the prophetic timetable.
                          The Sabbath reform advocated by Seventh-day Adventists
                       may be compared to the work of John the Baptist. "In this
                       age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds
                       of heaven, such a work as that of John is to be done."—

 THINK IT THROUGH         How can I be sure which way the Lord wants me to
                       go when there are so many conflicting messages pro-
                       claimed by so many different religious denominations?

                                                                      September 11
            Part 2 "So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things,
     THE TRUTH OF know that it is near, even at the doors."
 THE ADVENT NEAR
       Matt. 24:33 The Bible shows that John the Baptist prepared the way
                       for the arrival of the Messiah at His first advent by proclaim-
                       ing the God-appointed message for that time. Matt. 3:1-3. Simi-
                       larly, the Scriptures have designated the Heaven-sent message
                       that is preparing the way for the second advent of this same
                       Lord.

                          How is Christ's second coming portrayed in Rev.
                       14:14?


                          Rev. 14:6-14 plainly reveals that the preaching of the three
                       angels' messages to every people, as set forth in verses 6-12,
                       leads directly to the second advent described in verse 14. This
                       threefold message is the one that God wishes all people to
                       accept in this closing age preceding the second coming of Christ.
                       It is His present truth for this time.
                           Such is the prophetic certification from God for this modern
                       Sabbath-reform movement. Candid investigation reveals that
                       Seventh-day Adventists are the only people publishing these
                       special truths to all the world.
                          The prophecy of Rev. 14:6-12 is being fulfilled in the rise,

                       1844. The obligation is clear now to keep the seventh day holy.
                           "I saw that the present test on the Sabbath could not come
                        until the mediation of Jesus in the holy place was finished and
                       He had passed within the second veil; therefore Christians

                        rest in hope; for they had not the light and the test on the
                        Sabbath which we now have since that door was opened. I
                       saw that Satan was tempting some of God's people on this
                        point. Because so many good Christians have fallen asleep
                        in the triumphs of faith and have not kept the true Sab-

     GOD IDENTIFIED of kings: and they that are with him are called, and
         Rev. 17:14 chosen, and faithful."

                           The worldwide Sabbath-reform movement fostered by Sev-
                        enth-day Adventists owes its existence to the Heaven-sent
                        threefold message of Rev. 14:6-12.
                           Seventh-day Adventists are not merely another church or
                        religious denomination. They represent God's last-day plan
                        for the restoration of the original gospel work of Jesus.

                           How does Rev. 15:2, 3 mark out the glorious destiny
                        of those who have won the victory over the beast, its
                        image, and its number?



                           Can we be sure that the particular people described in Rev.
                        15:2, 3 passed through the period of the preaching of the last-
                        day threefold message of Rev. 14:6-12? Most assuredly, for
                        they had gotten the victory over the beast and his image
                        mentioned in the third message. Thus it is established by Rev.
                        15:2, 3 and 14:6-15 that the advent movement of the three-
                        fold message will go through to eternal victory and to heaven.
                        The sure word of prophecy has marked it through to the sea
                        of glass before the throne of God.
                           These scriptures show that the same movement by which
                        the threefold message is proclaimed to every nation will sweep
                        forward without a break to eternal victory at the coming of
                        the Lord. This is the divinely appointed destiny of the advent
                        movement for a sure and everlasting triumph.
  THINK IT THROUGH         Isn't this a most impelling and decisive reason for
                        accepting this message and staying by it to the end?

                                                                      September 13
            Part 4   "And he began to say unto them, This day is this
       THE NEEDED scripture fulfilled in your ears."
        CERTAINTY
         Luke 4:21

                         To what scripture did Jesus refer? Compare Luke
                      4:16-21 with Isa. 61:1, 2.


                         Some 700 years before Christ preached in the synagogue of
                      Nazareth, Isaiah had foretold what the Messiah would do and
                      say when He appeared. Christ opened the book of Isaiah to this
                      prophecy and read it to the assembled worshipers. Then He
                      said, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Christ
                      cited the fulfillment of Isa. 61:1, 2 in His work and teachings
                      as a sure evidence of the right way for His day.

                 D.      How did Apollos show that Jesus is the true Messiah?
                      Acts 18:28.


                         Note how truth was substantiated in the first sermon by
                      the apostles after Jesus ascended. Peter cited the particular
                      prophecy in Joel which foretold the outpouring of the Holy
                      Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. "This is that which' was spoken
                      by the prophet Joel." See Acts 2:14-21; Joel 2:28-32. He cited
                      also the particular prophecies which foretold the resurrection
                      of Christ. Acts 2:24-36.
                         John the Baptist preached present truth in announcing his
                      own teachings as the fulfillment of the prophecy of Isa. 40:3.
                         During Christ's ministry present truth involved the fulfill-
                      ment of such prophecies as Isa. 61:1, 2.
                         So the question for our day is this: In what teachings and
                      movement is God's appointed message for our day, as foretold
                      in Rev. 14:6-12, being fulfilled? In answering this, we see
                      that Heaven's seal of certainty rests upon the message and
                      work of Seventh-day Adventists.
 THINK IT THROUGH        Since this threefold message is the one which God has
                      appointed to be preached, believed, and obeyed at this
                      time, what else should I do but stand by it to the end?

                                                                      September 14
            Part 5  "Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit
 GOD'S CALLED-OUT the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name."
             ONES
        Acts 15:14 Since the time of the fall of Adam and Eve, God's purpose
                        has been manifested in calling out from the world a people
                        fully committed to obey Him. The great masses have walked
                        in the ways of their own devising. But in every generation God
                        has had a remnant people who have remained true to His
                        commandments and kept His Sabbath. This is how the knowl-
                        edge of God and His truth have been preserved through the
                        centuries.

                            How many faithful souls did God have in His remnant
                        church when the Flood came in the time of Noah? 1 Peter
                        3:20. And how many in the time of Elijah? Rom. 11:3,
                        4; 1 Kings 19:18.


                           Paul declared that in his day God had a remnant according
                        to the election of grace. Rom. 11:5. The vast majority of the
                        professed people of God had departed from the truth by fol-
                        lowing their traditions and doctrines instead of the word of
                        God. But there were many faithful ones in the Jewish church
                        who gladly accepted God's truth for that time. The Lord
                        gathered them out in many lands and used them to form His
                        true church at the beginning of the Christian age.
                           Likewise the Bible prophecies foretell what will happen in
                        the closing age. All the world, except a small remnant, will
                        obey the apostate power by keeping the false sabbath. Rev.
                        13:8, 12-17. This false system is spoken of as Babylon the
                        Great. Rev. 14:8; 17:5; 18:1-4. Many of God's people are in
                        the various religious bodies which compose the great family
                        of spiritual Babylon today.
                           That Babylonian coalition has set aside God's seventh-day
                        Sabbath and instituted the Sunday sabbath in its place. Those
                        who respond to the call of God to come out of Babylon will
                        help to restore the Sabbath to its rightful place in the gospel
                        message.
                           The Lord is searching in every nation, kindred, tongue,
                        and people for those who will rightly represent Him. "For the
                        eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth,
                        to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is
                        perfect [or truly sincere] toward him." 2 Chron. 16:9.
 THINK IT THROUGH          Will God find in me the object of His quest?

                                                                      September 15
              Part 6 . "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and
          REMNANT went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which
         IDENTIFIED keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony
         Rev. 12:17   of Jesus Christ."

                         By the symbol of a pure woman, Revelation 12 has foretold
                      the story of the true church during the centuries from the
                      ascension of Christ to the end of the 1260 years of papal su-
                      premacy in 1798. And Rev. 12:17 foretold the remnant, the
                      last segment of Christ's church in the closing age. These are
                      identified as those "which keep the commandments of God."
                         One of God's commandments pertains to the keeping of the
                      seventh day. Ex. 20:8-11. Since this remnant of the true
                      church would keep the commandments of God, they would
                      have to be a Christian people observing the seventh-day Sab-
                      bath.
                         The people of this same remnant are designated in Rev.
                      14:12 as follows: "Here are they that keep the commandments
                      of God, and the faith of Jesus." The context shows that they
                      are the people of the threefold-message movement of Rev.
                      14:6-12. They go into all the world to proclaim the everlast-
                      ing gospel, including certain special truths. They began to
                      appear in 1844, the year when the judgment-hour message was
                      due to be given.
                         Rev. 12:17 declares that this remnant "have the testimony
                      of Jesus." Rev. 19:10 says, "The testimony of Jesus is the
                      spirit of prophecy." Theirs is a six-point pattern:
                         1. They keep the commandments of God and the faith of
                      Jesus. 2. They keep the seventh-day Sabbath. 3. They
                      preach the message of Rev. 14:6-12. 4. They began to ap-
                      pear in 1844, when the judgment-hour message was due. 5.
                      They became a worldwide movement. 6. They have the
                      spirit of prophecy.
                         Where do you find a Christian people who conform to this
                      six-point pattern? There is only one group that fulfills these
                       prophetic specifications. Since you desire to belong to Christ's
                      true church, doesn't this confirm the group with whom you
                      should be identified?

                                                                         September 17
             Part 1       "And I saw another angel ascending from the east,
       SEAL OF GOD having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a
                       loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to
                       hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth,
                       neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the
         Rev. 7:2, 3 servants of our God in their foreheads."

                           In the final phase of the gospel work, God warns every soul
                        against receiving the mark of the beast. Rev. 14:9-12. The
                        acceptance of God's message will result in placing the seal of
                        God upon God's servants as stated in Rev. 7:2, 3.
                          The final test involves the reception of the seal of God
                        versus the reception of the mark of the beast. Hence it is of the
                        utmost importance to find out from the Bible what is meant
                        by the seal of God and the mark of the beast.

                             How does 1 Kings 21:8 show that the seal of a ruler
                         is the sign of his authority?



                           What has Christ, as the Creator, appointed as a sign?
                         Ex. 31:16, 17; Ezek. 20:12, 20.


                           The Sabbath commandment is the only precept in the Deca-
                        logue which identifies the Lord as the Creator of all and, there-
                        fore, the rightful Ruler of all. This imparts validity to the
                        other nine precepts. This makes the Sabbath commandment
                        the seal of God's law and the sign of the rightful supremacy
                        of Christ.
                           There are four places in the Bible where the Sabbath is
                        spoken of as a sign that He is the Lord. This is fourfold evi-
                        dence that the true Sabbath stands as the sign or seal of God.
                        When you yield yourself to Christ in full understanding and
                        obedience and keep the Sabbath holy, then it becomes a sign,
                        or seal, in your life, indicating that the true God is your God
                        and that you are His loyal child. Ezek. 20:20.
                           "God's claim to reverence and worsliIp, above the gods of

                                                                     September /8
             Part 2       "And the third angel followed them, saying with a
         MARK OF loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image,
        REJECTION     and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the
                      same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
                      is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indigna-
                      tion; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone
                      in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of
       Rev. 14:9, 10 the Lamb."

                         A comparison of this scripture with Rev. 7:1-3 shows that
                       the mark of the beast is the opposite of the seal of God. It
                       has been shown in Part 1 of this lesson that the seal of God is
                       connected with the keeping of Christ's seventh-day Sabbath.
                       The mark of the beast, as the opposite of the seal of God, is
                       connected with the keeping of the Sunday sabbath as a man-
                       made substitute for the true Sabbath.

                          What is the only way any person can escape receiv-
                       ing the mark of the beast? Rev. 14:12.


                          When the final test comes, all will obey the apostate power
                       and receive the mark of the beast except the remnant who
                       keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. Be-
                       cause they keep the commandments of God, they observe the
                       seventh-day Sabbath according to His law.
                          Those who keep the seventh-day Sabbath as the Lord com-
                       mands are distinguished as His true followers. But those who
                       disobey Him and keep the first-day sabbath of the papacy in
                       opposition to the truth are distinguished as followers of apos-
                       tasy. Thus a final test will come when all men will have to
                       make a choice between Christ's true Sabbath and the man-
                       made sabbath ; between whose authority they will accept—
                       God's or man's; between who they will obey—Christ or Satan.
                          "The Sabbath question is to be the issue in the great final
                       conflict in which all the world will act a part."—Testimonies,

                          What shows that those who keep the commandments
                       of God and the faith of Jesus will obtain the victory over
                       the mark of the beast? Rev. 15:2, 3.


  THINK IT THROUGH         Will I, by the grace of God, keep the true Sabbath and
                        be victorious over the mark of the beast?


  "Since those who keep God's com-         the one hand, and its violation, on the
mandments are thus placed in contrast      other, will make the distinction be-
with those that worship the beast and      tween the worshipers of God and the

                                                                     September 19
            Part 3     "And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the
   ISSUE OF DESTINY Lord; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the
          Jer. 21:8 way of death."

                          How, according to 1 John 2:3, 4, does every believer
                       show whether he is a real Christian or a make-believe
                       Christian?



                          According to Rom. 6:16, what shows which side I am
                       on in conflict between Christ and Satan?


                          "To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
                       ye are." Rom. 6:16. Anyone who applies this Scriptural prin-
                       ciple to the Sabbath-versus-Sunday issue will see for himself
                       what identifies the worshipers of the Creator and only true
                       God. He will see, also, what identifies the worshipers of the
                       beast and his image. Too, he will know what he ought to do
                       about this question.
                          When a Christian faithfully keeps the seventh-day Sabbath
                       as the divinely appointed sign that Christ is his Creator and
                       Redeemer, to whom is he rendering service? He is obeying his
                       Lord Jesus Christ. This marks him as a worshiper of Christ,
                       his Lord, Creator, and Saviour. His servant he is, to whom
                       he obeys.
                          When a Christian knows the Sabbath truth, but still keeps
                       Sunday, whom is he obeying in this respect? Many Sunday
                       keepers honestly think that they are obeying Christ because
                       He arose from the dead on this day. But according to the
                       Bible, Jesus has never required anyone to keep the first day
                       of the week as sacred for any reason whatsoever.
                          When a Christian keeps Sunday after he has been enlight-
                       ened about it, he is obeying the apostate power, which has
                       attempted to make Sunday, instead of the Sabbath, God's holy
                       day of rest for man. His servant he is to whom he obeys. He
                       is honoring the papacy above the Lord Jesus Christ, "Lord
                       even of the Sabbath." Matt. 12:8. In such a case, the only
                       safe decision that a Christian can make is to obey Jesus by
                       keeping the holy day as He has commanded.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Do I renew my decision every day to obey all of God's
                       commandments?

                                                                         September 20
             Part 4       "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,
        THE MASTER      whose names are not written in the book of life of the
         DECEPTION      Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
           Rev. 13:8
                           This refers to one of Satan's overwhelming deceptions.
                        Countless millions of professed Christians are observing Sunday
                        as the Lord's day without knowing that it is an institution of
                        antichrist and without Biblical authority. They sincerely be-
                        lieve that in so doing they are obeying and worshiping Christ.
                        But in this they are actually rendering homage and obedience
                        to the system of counterfeit Christianity.

                           Why will God's true people not be deceived by Satan's
                         masterful deceptions? Matt. 24:24, 25.



                            How will Satan work to enlist, if possible, all men on
                         his side? Rev. 13:13, 14; 16:13, 14.


                            Christ, as our Creator, made the seventh-day Sabbath to be
                         a sign of allegiance and loyalty to His true system of worship.
                         In direct opposition to this, Satan introduced, in ancient times,
                         the worship of the sun upon the first day of the week as a
                         sign of adherence to his false system of worship. This is how
                         the first day of the week got its name "Sunday."
                            Satan knew that one of the most telling blows that he
                         could strike against the Son of God would be to turn all people
                         away from keeping His seventh-day Sabbath, because it is
                         the sign of the rightful sovereignty of Christ as our Creator
                         and Redeemer. Thus he has succeeded in establishing his "day
                         of the Sun" in the place of the day of the Son. See Matt. 12:8.
                            Millions have been misled to believe that by keeping Sunday
                         they acknowledge the supremacy of our blessed Saviour. But,
                         in reality, this practice denies His rightful supremacy, for by
                         substitution of the observance of Sunday for that of the sev-
                         enth-day Sabbath, the Roman Church has placed papal author-
                         ity above the word of Him who is the Lord of the Sabbath.

                           Satan attempted through the agency of pagan Rome to

                        Matt. 2:16. He worked later through civil and religious powers
                        of the earth to destroy millions of Christians during the Dark

      MOMENT FOR       long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God,
          DECISION     follow him."
      1 Kings 18:21
                         God confronts men continually with moments of decision.
                       This is for our own eternal good if we make the right responses.

                         What moment of decision came to God's professed
                       people in the golden calf apostasy? Ex. 32:19-26.


                         In the final test preceding the close of probation, every soul
                       will have to decide between the worshi.gf Christ as our
                       Creator-Redeemer and the worship of the beast and his image;
                       between the observance of the true Sabbath of Christ and the
                       observance of the counterfeit sabbath of the papacy.

                         How did Christ show that no one can be neutral?
                       Matt. 12:30.


                          Observing Christ's seventh-day Sabbath is a sign of recog-
                       nition of His authority as sovereign Lord of all, the Creator
                       of all, and the only Saviour of man. Observance of the Sun-
                       day institution, after light has come, is a sign of recognition
                       of the alleged authority of the papacy to rule over all God's
                       people. Thus each of us must decide which of these two signs
                       of authority he will accept for himself. This is the basic issue
                       in this impending conflict of Sabbath versus Sunday.
                          The issue is, in brief, this: Whom shall I obey as supreme?
                       Shall I decide for Christ? Shall I obey Him in keeping His
                       Sabbath as a sign that I choose Him as my Lord-Creator-
                       Saviour? Or shall I obey the papal power in keeping Sunday?
 THINK IT THROUGH        As I come to the end of these lessons, shall I pray,
                       "Lord, help me to have Christ in the Sabbath and the
                       Sabbath in Christ?"

  REDEEMING LOVE        "The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of
  Gen. 2:1; Job 38:7 God shouted for joy."

                         Notice how these verses are used in The Desire of Ages in
                      the context of Christ's finished work of creation as a type of
                      His finished work of redemption while He rested in the tomb
                      on the Sabbath day:
                         "In the beginning the Father and the Son had rested upon
                      the Sabbath after Their work of creation. When 'the heavens
                      and the earth were finished, and all the host of them' (Gen.
                      2:1), the Creator and all heavenly beings rejoiced in contempla-
                      tion of the glorious scene. 'The morning stars sang together,
                      and all the sons of God shouted for joy.' Job 38:7. Now Jesus
                      rested from the work of redemption; and though there was
                      grief among those who loved Him on earth, yet there was joy
                      in heaven. Glorious to the eyes of heavenly beings was the
                      promise of the future. A restored creation, a redeemed race,
                      that having conquered sin could never fall,—this, the result to
                      flow from Christ's completed work, God and angels saw. With
                      this scene the day upon which Jesus rested is forever linked.
                      For 'His work is perfect;' and 'whatsoever God doeth, it shall
                      be forever.' Deut. 32:4; Eccl. 3:14. When there shall be a
                      `restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth
                      of all His holy prophets since the world began' (Acts 3:21),
                      the creation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in
                      Joseph's tomb, will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven
                      and earth will unite in praise, as 'from one Sabbath to another'
                      (Isa. 66:23) the nations of the saved shall bow in joyful
                      worship to God and the Lamb."—Pages 769, 770.

                      be restored. Acts 3:21.

                      Christ during His life on earth to know and observe now

                          What relation has always existed between God's love
                        and His laws?



                           Is divine love temporary or eternal? Jer. 31:3.



                           The controversies of the Pharisees with Christ show how
                        they magnified the first four commandments of the Decalogue
                        as of much greater importance than the other six because they
                        reveal the duty of man to His Maker. Consequently "they
                        greatly failed of practical godliness. Jesus had shown the people
                        their great deficiency, and had taught the necessity of good
                        works, declaring that the tree is known by its fruits. For this
                        reason He had been charged with exalting the last six com-

                        607.

                           What is the relation between God's love and man's
                        obedience?


 THINK IT THROUGH          In what way does Christ's part in creation prove that

      2 Cor.5:17, RSV. God's eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord (Eph. 3:11)
                        has been to reveal both creation and re-creation as beneficent
                        and redemptive acts.
                           How can man have the experience of conversion and the
                        new creation? By the grace of God in Christ we may put
                        off the corruption and deceitfulness of sin and thus find in
                        Him new spiritual hope and courage. Eph. 4:20-22.

                        and carried it with him. He searched the Scriptures in a new
                        way, not for the discussion of a theory, but in order to receive
                        life for the soul. He began to see the kingdom of heaven as he

                           Just as creation was a gift of God, so is the new creation. In
                        what way must man accept both God's creation and His re-

                        not our Saviour. It earns nothing. It is the hand by which we
                        lay hold upon Christ, and appropriate His merits, the remedy
                        for sin. And we cannot even repent without the aid of the
                        Spirit of God. The Scripture says of Christ, 'Him hath God
                        exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for
                        to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.' Acts

                        —Ibid.
 THINK IT THROUGH          Does acceptance of Christ as our Redeemer necessitate
                        recognition of Him as our Creator?

                                                                     September 27
            Part 4    "He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
       THE DIVINE the world, that we should be holy and without blame
     FORETHOUGHT before him in love: having predestinated us unto the
        Eph. 1:4, 5 adoption of children by Jesus Christ."

                          Various expressions are used in the New Testament to reveal
                       to us divine initiative and forethought in providing for the
                       salvation of man. This was to ensure that the world would
                       eventually be populated by holy beings. Titus 1:2 speaks of
                       the "hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
                       before the world began." True acceptance of Christ and loyalty
                       to Him assure salvation.
                          The existence of Christ before the foundation of the world
                       (Eph. 1:4) is clearly seen in various Biblical passages. He was
                       the creator of all things. John 1:1-3, 10. "For by him were
                       all things created . . . : and he is before all things, and by
                       him all things consist." Col. 1:16, 17. This includes the Sab-
                       bath, for "the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day."
                       Matt. 12:8. It provides for all other things essential to the
                       welfare and full redemption of man.
 THINK IT THROUGH          Is it more logical to think that in the event of man's
                       fall, (1) his redemption would be accomplished by his
                       beneficent Creator, or that (2) man would in time work
                       his own way out of this tragic situation?

      MARK OF THE between me and you, that ye may know that I am the
           MAKER Lord your God."
       Ezek. 20:20
                          Four things should be noted in Ezek. 20:5-12: (1) God's
                       choice of His people; (2) His deliverance of them from heathen
                       abomination and bondage; (3) His desire that His name should
                       not be polluted among the heathen, and (4) the laws He gave
                       to His people as peculiar signs of His presence with them.
                          In Ex. 31:15-17 the weekly Sabbath is given as one of the
                       marks of God's sovereignty over His people. According to
                       Neh. 9:14, one of the signs of God's presence with them was
                       His holy Sabbath. In 1 Cor. 10:1-4 His guidance and training
                       of them in the desert are attributed to Christ, who is thus
                       indicated as the Lord of both His people and His Sabbath. See
                       The Desire of Ages, page 288.

                          What is meant by the statement in Ex. 31:17 that the
                       Creator "rested, and was refreshed" on the seventh day?
                       Did He need physical rest?


                          "All was perfect, worthy of its divine Author, and He
                       rested, not as one weary, but as well pleased with the fruits
                       of His wisdom and goodness and the manifestations of His
                       glory."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 47.

                          Can we find "rest" in the fullest sense if God's bless-
                       ing is not with us?

                       deeper acknowledgment of Christ as our Creator and
                       Sanctifier solve our problem of giving proper service to
                       Him?

  EVIDENCE OF THE
        SAVIOUR'S         This expression is often used in the Old Testament, and
                       we have seen in Ezek. 20:12 that it is connected with Sabbath
         PRESENCE
                       observance.
         Lev. 21:23       From the lessons of this quarter, what have we learned as
                       the paramount thing in all religious observances?
                          "No other institution which was committed to the Jews
                       tended so fully to distinguish them from surrounding nations
                       as did the Sabbath. God designed that its observance should
                       designate them as His worshipers. It was to be a token of
                       their separation from idolatry, and their connection with the
                       true God. But in order to keep the Sabbath holy, men must
                       themselves be holy. Through faith they must become partakers
                       of the righteousness of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 283.
                          Does history show that the observance of Sunday, the day
                       substituted for the seventh day, has declined into formalism?
                       Was it ever anything else?

                          Does formal observance of a day inhibit the vital
                       experience of Christ's righteousness by faith? Ex. 31:13.


                           Should Seventh-day Adventists constantly seek Christ in
                       daily experience in order to witness effectively for truth, espe-
                       cially the Sabbath truth? "God's remnant people, standing
                       before the world as reformers, are to show that the law of
                       God is the foundation of all enduring reform and that the
                       Sabbath of the fourth commandment is to stand as a memo-
                       rial of creation, a constant reminder of the power of God.

 THINK IT THROUGH         Do we show God's love by obvious, aggressive effort,
                       or by constancy to Him under all circumstances? See
                       1 John 5:3. (Moffatt's translation says that "his commands
                       are not irksome.")

Not all love letters are meant to be tied up in a
pink bow and tucked away in the attic. Some love
letters should be kept near and read often. Not all
of them say the things we want them to say. Be-
cause, sometimes, when we truly love people, we
have to say things that hurt in order to help.
Ellen White understood love. She wrote many let-
ters. Some of them hurt very much. But they were
all written in a true spirit of love and were de-
signed to help us. Ellen White's love letters are the
kind that should be kept near. And read often.
