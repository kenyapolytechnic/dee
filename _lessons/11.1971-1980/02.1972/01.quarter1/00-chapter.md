      The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in
the lesson."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                       Ally Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

    To worship God is man's greatest privilege. How can we make worship
more effective? These lessons are designed to help the whole church enter
into a richer and more joyful experience of worship and then to go out
and share their joy with others.
    When the prophet Isaiah saw "the Lord . . . high and lifted up," he
also saw himself as "undone"—"a man of unclean lips." True worship
uncovers the heavens and makes God real to man; but it also uncovers
the soul of man, making him real to himself. Every service of the church
should lead people into a consciousness of the presence of God. Both the
order and the content of the service are important, but it is the progres-
sion and the appeal of each particular part that inspires true worship.
    True worship does not necessarily have to follow a set pattern. In many
cases it is the unusual that arrests the mind and makes man meditate.
When Moses saw the burning bush and saw that it was not being con-
sumed, it attracted his attention; and out of that experience he was led
into his lifework. He heard God's voice in an unusual environment. But
by contrast when Isaiah heard God's call, he was in the very environment
of the temple. That of course was the usual place of worship. But that
usual environment became the occasion of an unusual experience to him
because of his mental attitude. "Our meetings should be . . . pervaded
with the very atmosphere of heaven," is the counsel of the Lord's messenger
 (E. G. White, Review and Herald, November 30, 1886).
    These words written so long ago should have challenged us to give
more attention to the subject of worship. Although worship may take
varied forms, yet for it to be a lasting experience the congregation must
sense three things: (1) the presence of God, (2) a revelation of His
purity and power, and (3) His call to a life of dedication and service
    Each of these lessons deals with a different aspect of the nature, pur-
 pose, and methods of true worship. We are not trying to lay down a defi-
nite form of worship, but to suggest ways of making the worship more
meaningful. Ponder these inspired words: "The evil of formal worship
cannot be too strongly depicted, but no words can properly set forth the
 deep blessedness of genuine worship."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 143.
    "There is nothing more needed in the work than the practical results
of communion with God."—Ibid., Vol. 6, p. 47.
    Worship can move on the level of public or private manifestation. The
worship of God includes the province of salvation and grace and the con-
sequent submission of one's will, returning gratitude and praise to God for
 His love and mercy.

                           The Bible is a Book of worship. From the first chapter of
                        Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation God is revealed as the
                        One whom we should revere, adore, and worship. "God's claim
                        to reverence and worship . . . is based upon the fact that He
                        is the Creator, and that to Him all other beings owe their exis-
                        tence. Thus it is presented in the Bible."—Patriarchs and
                        Prophets, page 336.

                          How does the prophet Jeremiah contrast the living
                        God with the gods of the heathen? Jer. 10:10-12, 14-16.


                           True worship is the most dynamic and creative experience
                        possible to man. It embraces the whole personality of man—his
                        thoughts, his emotions, his will, and his strength.

                           How did the psalmist express his joy in worship?
                        Ps. 103:1.


                           "God calls upon His people to arise and come out of the
                        chilling, frosty atmosphere in which they have been living, to
                        shake off the impressions and ideas that have frozen up the
                        impulses of love and held them in selfish inactivity. He bids
                        them come up from their low, earthly level and breathe in the
                        clear, sunny atmosphere of heaven."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p.
                        607.

                                                                      December 27
             Part 2        "And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying,

     AGAINST FALSE      habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit,

                           "And I heard another voice from heaven, saying,
                        Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers
         Rev. 18:2, 4   of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."

                           Those who proclaim God's last gospel message to the world
                        must know and interpret the great chronological prophecies of
                        Daniel and Revelation. It is important to convince men that
                        "the hour of God's judgment is come," yet that is but prelimi-
                        nary. They must also be led to heed God's call to separate from
                        every form of idolatry and self-worship.

                           What warning did Isaiah give to the captives in Baby-
                        lon? Isa. 52:10, 11.



                            What warning did Paul send to the Corinthian be-
                        lievers? 2 Cor. 6:17.
                            It is the Christian's duty to perfect holiness in the fear
                        of God. 2 Cor. 7:1.


                          "The apostle's words of warning to the Corinthian church
                        are applicable to all time and are especially adapted to our
                        day. By idolatry he meant not only the worship of idols, but
                        self-serving, love of ease, and gratification of appetite and
                        passion. A mere profession of faith in Christ, a boastful knowl-
                        edge of the truth, does not make a man a Christian. A religion
                        that seeks only to gratify the eye, the ear, and the taste, or
                        that sanctions self-indulgence, is not the religion of Christ."

                           How did the psalmist relate to false ways of worship?
                        Ps. 119:126, 128.

                         earth, the Author of all true science—this is the church's
                         primary task. Every feature of the advent message, whether
                         doctrine, precept, or prophecy, should lead to worship. He
                         who "made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains
                         of waters" is also the One who redeemed us by His blood and
                         sanctifies us by His Spirit.

                            "At the heart of worship lies a fundamental need—the need
                         of God."—Marie Powell, Guiding the Experience of Worship,
                         page 11.

                           With whom does He whose name is holy deign to
                         dwell? Isa. 57:15. See also Ps. 34:18; 138:6.



                           What should be the attitude toward God in "the as.
                         sembly of the saints"? Psalm 89:7.


                           A new power is felt in the church when the congregation
                         becomes more conscious of the true spirit of worship. A new
                         quality of fellowship unites the group, something akin •to the
                         experience of the apostolic church as recorded in Acts 4:32, 33.
                         Enjoying that kind of experience brought power into their
                         prayers. See verse 31. And that experience will be repeated
                         before our Lord returns.- True worship will help bring this
                         about, for it produces true humility.

         SPIRIT AND    for the Father seeketh such to worship Him."
              TRUTH
          John 4:23       When the Lord Jesus spoke these words to the woman at
                       the well, it revealed the interest God the Father has in our
                       worship. He not only accepts our worship but is actually seek-
                       ing sincere worshipers. While the Samaritans were a religious
                       people, yet of these Jesus said: "Ye worship ye know not
                       what." Verse 22.
                          The word "worship" occurs more than one hundred times
                       in Scriptures, but sometimes •it refers to something far removed
                       from the true worship •of God. For example, God says: "They
                       worship the work of their own hands, that which their own

                          This would naturally include images of wood, stone, and
                       metal. Might it not include other things such as our homes,
                       our businesses, our education, our dress, our social concerns,
                       and our money? All too often (these become objects of worship.

                          How did our Lord reply to the tempter who tried to
                       lure Him into false worship? Matt. 4:10.




                          The Lord's counsel to us is very clear on this point. We
                       read: "How much means are spent for things that are mere
                       idols, things that engross the thoughts and affections?"—Evan-
                       gelism, page 344. "Expel from the soul-temple everything that
                       assumes the form of an idol."—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 53.

                          How does John describe those who accept and obey
                       the three angels' messages? Rev. 14:12.




 THINK IT THROUGH        Am I more concerned with the place of worship or
                       even the day of worship than I am about the spirit of
                       worship?




  "Although God dwells not in temples      them by His Spirit. But those who as-

                                                                          December 30
                Part 5       "The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: He sitteth
     GOD'S GREATNESS      between the cherubims; let. the earth be moved."
             INSPIRES        "Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His holy hill;
             WORSHIP      for the Lord our God is holy."
            Ps. 99:1, 9
                             Worship is inspired by a sense of a power outside of and
                          beyond the control of man. It had its beginning in human
                          experience when the Creator communed face to face with man
                          in Eden. Gen. 3:8. That intimate converse was broken by
                          man's sin, but God invites us still to commune with Him, the
                          high and holy God. Our knowledge of Him as Creator and
                          Upholder of the universe inspires awe. And the more we know
                          of God and His majesty, the greater and more intelligent will
                          be our praise. No previous generation has had more reason to
                          praise God than ours. Our expanding knowledge of the universe
                          should lead us to honor the One who made heaven and earth.

                            How does the psalmist express his adoration of God,
                          and what does he say of man? Ps. 8:3-6.




                             Worship is the response of the creature to the Eternal, not
                          only here on earth but also in heaven. The twenty-four elders
                          and the four "living creatures" (NEB) continued to voice
                          their praise to God as they fell down before Him in adoration.
                          John describes the scene, telling how they worship "Him that
                          liveth forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne,
                          saying, Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honor
                          and power: for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy
                          pleasure they are and were created." Rev. 4:10, 11.
 THINK IT THROUGH            Does a sense of the greatness and the holiness of God
                          inspire me to bow in adoration of the Infinite?




  "The duty to worship God is based           upon to worship the Creator; and the

     TRUE WORSHIP       were come down from the hill, much people met Him."
           INSPIRES
            SERVICE        Jesus had taken three disciples up the mountain to pray,
          Luke 9:37
                        and they had witnessed the spectacular transfiguration, eclipsed
                        only by His resurrection. They had heard the voice of God
                        saying: "This is My beloved Son: hear Him."
                            Peter was so moved that he suggested that they build three
                        tabernacles and stay there. But there was work to do in the
                        valley. A multitude was awaiting the warmth and comfort i3f
                        the Saviour's love and compassion.
                            While activity is not worship, yet true worship naturally
                        leads to activity. There is ever the tendency •for us to let our
                        service for God actually take the place of our worship of God.
                           "As activity increases and men become successful in doing
                        any work for God, there is danger of trusting to human plans
                        and methods. There is a tendency to pray less, and to have less
                        faith. Like the disciples, we are in danger of losing sight of our
                        dependence on God, and seeking to make a savior of our ac-
                        tivity. We need to look constantly to Jesus, realizing that it is
                        His power which does the work."—The Desire of Ages, page
                        362.
                            Anything we permit to take the place of Christ in our lives
                        is in reality the spirit of antichrist.

                            In view of God's activities in the earth, what is man
                         called upon to do? Ps. 46:10.



                            Why would God not hear the prayers of Israel? What
                         were they to do before offering their worship? Isa.
                         1:15-17.



 THINK IT THROUGH            There is a great work to be done, but there is also a
                         great God to be worshiped. Is it possible that the work
                         of the Lord is keeping us from the Lord of the work?

              Isa. 6:8      It was while in the atmosphere of worship that Isaiah heard
                        the call to service. He lived in a time of great international

                        Uzziah, sometimes called Azariah, who had ruled Judah for
                        forty years, was dying of leprosy. He had been a good king,
                        but success had made him proud. When he came to the temple
                        to worship, he even disdained the services of the priests. He
                        would offer his own incense. Eighty priests resisted him. Then
                        all at once leprosy was seen to break out upon him, and he
                        fled from the sacred building never to return; thus came the
                        sad and tragic end of an otherwise great leader. But when the
                        king, in whom the people's hope was centered, collapsed, God
                        gave the young prophet a vision of another King—the Ruler
                        of eternity.
                           Study carefully every feature of Isa. 6:1-5.

                            As Isaiah beheld this heavenly scene, how did it
                         affect him? Isa. 6:5.


                            "As Isaiah beheld this revelation of the glory and majesty
                         of his Lord, he was overwhelmed with a sense of the purity
                         and holiness of God. How sharp the contrast between the
                         matchless perfection of his Creator, and the sinful course of
                         those who, with himself, had long been numbered among the

                         Witnessing the awful inroads of wickedness, the prophet
                       Habakkuk wondered why God permitted things to get so

                       he said. And why is it that "wrong judgment proceedeth"?

                      thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
          Ex. 3:4, 5 ground."

                           Moses stands out as unique. He was a brilliant scholar, a
                        literary genius, an army general, and a philosopher. He had
                        already made the greatest decision of his life, having renounced
                        the crown of Egypt. But he was ill-prepared for his great work
                        until in the atmosphere of quiet meditation in the desert he
                        heard the voice of God. As a scientist he` vinas gripped by the
                        phenomenon of the burning bush. While there he became aware
                        of the divine Presence.

                           What was Moses' attitude when God spoke to him?
                        Ex. 3:6, last part.


                           Forty years earlier he felt confident in his own ability to
                        deliver Israel. He was eager for the task. Now he begs to be
                        excused. His self-sufficiency has disappeared. Only •as we hum-
                        ble ourselves before God can we be used. True worship always
                        begets true humility.

                           What further discovery did Moses make? Ex. 4:6, 7.



                           What was in the hand of Moses when God appointed
                        him his work? Ex. 4:2.

          Ps. 63:1-4 I live: I will lift up my hands in Thy name."


                          While we worship God, He is actually seeking us more than
                       we are seeking Him. The ability to commune. with God is life's
                       highest attainment. Someone has gid7Worship is as simple
                       as daylight, sensible as reason itself." That may be true, but
                       to experience this we should recognize a few vital principles.
                       First, that God is our Father, and it is natural that we, His
                       children, should feel free to come to where He is. Second, that
                       worship is simply focusing Godward. Third, that we must
                       train ourselves to listen not only to the minister, but to God.

                           How does Paul describe the change that is wrought
                       in the human heart? 2 Cor. 3:18.


                          "Christ is sitting for His portrait in every disciple. Every
                       one God has predestinated to be 'conformed to the image of
                       His Son.' Rom. 8:29. In every one Christ's long-suffering love,
                       His holiness, meekness, mercy, and truth are to be manifested
                       to the world."—The Desire of Ages, page 827.
                          True love for our fellowman grows out of our personal rela-
                       tionship to God who "hath made of one blood all nations of
                       men to dwell on all the face of the earth." Acts 17:26. In wor-

                       male nor female, bond nor free."

                          What does the Lord require of His children? Micah 6:8.

                         is it a ritualistic religion. It is an intensely practical religion.
                         The ancient Hebrews' religion by contrast was definitely ritual-
                         istic and included many different sacrifices. And in addition to
                         these there was in the courtyard of the tabernacle, and later at
                         the temple at Jerusalem, the "continual burnt offering" which
                         pointed forward to the coming Redeemer.
                            "Every morning and evening a lamb of a year old was
                         burned upon the altar, with its appropriate meat offering, thus
                         symbolizing the daily consecration of the nation to Jehovah."
                         —Patriarchs and\Prophets, page 352.
                             The apostle Paul wrote: "By Him let us offer up the sacri-
                         fice of praise to God continually." Then immediately following
                         this was his instruction: "Do not neglect to do_good and to
                         share what you have." Ai Christians we have very much to
                         share. Not only the truth concerning our Lord's sacrifice and
                         the "blessed hope" of His soon return, but also a life of joyful
                         service to others. When worship is genuine it always carries
                         over into the home, the office, the farm, the workshop, the
                         classroom, the playground.

                            What did the Master say He had come to do? Luke
                         4:18.



                            Helping those wounded by sin and setting at liberty those
                         bound by wrong habits is one of the outcomes of worship.
                         To have attended a worship service and then leave the meet-

     AND WORSHIP
            Ps. 51:2       Nothing is more important in the experience of worship
      See Isa. 6:6, 7
                        than a new sense of forgiveness and cleansing. David sought
                        cleansing from •his heinous sin. Isaiah's sense of human un-
                        worthiness is an explicit worship experience.

                            What proof is there that God's people were included
                        in Isaiah's need for cleansing? Isa. 6:9.



                           Are forgiveness, cleansing, and true worship of vital
                        necessity in Christ? Rev. 1:5, 6.



                           What is said of "the great multitude" of the redeemed
                        standing before God's throne? Rev. 7:14.



                            Only a coal from God's altar is sufficient to cleanse the
                        soul. "Strange fire" can never accomplish this. Once cleansed,
                        the worshiper can then join with the angels in ascribing full
                        praise to the Lord of Hosts who alone is holy.
                            To be cleansed from all bitterness and disappointments over
                        what might have been is for many the greatest forgiveness of
                        all.

                           How does God plan to cleanse His people and purge
                        their iniquity? Isa. 4:4; Matt. 3:11.



 THINK IT THROUGH          Does worship, both private and public, renew my

                          great salvation has been provided, act as if He were a hard,
                          exacting taskmaster. He is their best friend; and when they
                          worship Him, He expects to be with them, to bless and comfort
                          them, filling their hearts with joy and love. The Lord desires
                          His children to take comfort in His service and to find more
                          pleasure than hardship in His work. He desires that those who
                          come to worship Him shall carry away with them precious
                          thoughts of His care and love, that they may be cheered in
                          all the employments of daily life, that they may have grace
                          to deal honestly and faithfully in all things.

                           The expression "the beauty of holiness" (1 Chron. 16:29)
                       implies arrangement, order, art, and even architecture; but it
                       also includes the inner beauty of fellowship where consecrated
                       personalities and dedicated lives unite in approaching God.
                       Worship is the primary and eternal activity of the redeemed.
                       It is man's response to the nature and action of God. True wor-

                          Quietness is one characteristic of true worship climate. The
                       healing quality of silence is something we all need. Many of
                       God's people are today compelled to live amid noise, confu-
                       sion, and ungodly competition. Never did a generation need
                       so desperately the fortifying experience of quietude and con-

                            Irreverence during worship is not usually the result of a
                         defiant spirit of wickedness; it is more often the result of a
                         lack of understanding. Should we not, as individuals and as a

                            Under what circumstances did the Lord communicate

                        and a devouring fire swept by; but God was not in all this.
                        Then there came a still, small voice, and the prophet covered
                        his head before the presence of the Lord. His petulance was

                             Worship is essentially an attitude of the mind and heart. We
                          must do more than merely attend a place of worship and be

                          to destroy the spirit of worship. To attempt to worship while

                       statement from the spirit of prophecy.
                          "When the worshipers enter the place of meeting, they
                       should do so with decorum, passing quietly to their seats."
                       —Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 492.

                          What does it mean that our places of worship should
                       be "pervaded with the very atmosphere of heaven"?
                       How can we help to create worship "atmosphere"?



                          Through what means does God offer salvation and
                       strength? Isa. 30:15.


                          It will help us if we remember that the dedicated church
                       building is God's house. We go there not so much to meet our
                       friends as to meet Him.
                          "When every other voice is hushed, when every earthly
                       interest is turned aside, the silence of the soul makes more

                          This sanctuary, later known as the "house of the Lord,"
                       was not to shut God away from His people, but to permit
                       Him to dwell in their midst.

   PRIVATE HOMES brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, . . . and
 AND SYNAGOGUES Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in thy
     Philemon 1, 2 house."

                          Special buildings for Christian worship were unknown dur-
                       ing apostolic times. Not until the latter •part of the second
                       century is there any record of church •buildings.

                           Where did Aquila and Priscilla conduct their worship?
                        1 Cor. 16:9; Rom. 16:3-5.


                           In apostolic times services of worship were often conducted
                        in the homes of certain members. The architecture of the Mid-
                        dle East of that day permitted many people to congregate in
                        the homes of the more well-to-do in the community. Large
                        rooms opening off a central patio made it possible for sizable
                        groups to gather together. Many congregations were thus ac-
                        commodated during the first century of Christian history.

                          Where else did the congregations of that time meet?
                        Acts 17:1, 2; 13:14; 14:1.



                           What interesting custom was followed by the rabbis
                        when important visitors attended the meeting? Acts
                        13:14-16.


                           Christian worship, growing as it did out of both the temple
                        and the synagogue patterns of Hebrew worship, naturally re-
                        tained certain basic principles. While the two divisions of the
                        temple—"the holy" and "the most holy"—passed out of exis-
                        tence when the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, yet in the
                        synagogues around the world the place where the scroll of the
                        prophets is kept still corresponds to the "most holy" place of
                        the temple. In the Christian church the pulpit and especially
                        the table on which we celebrate the Lord's Supper are par-
                        ticularly sacred. This is a principle we do well to recognize.

                        of the spiritual awareness and forms of worship of those who
                        meet there.

                           What was the psalmist's deepest desire? Ps. 27:4.



                           How did Jacob consecrate the stone he had used for
                        a pillow and set it up for a pillar? Gen. 28:18.



                           What name did he give to the place? Verse 17.



                          ("El" is one of the names of God, and "beth" means house.
                       Beth-el therefore means the "house of God." Verse 19).
                          God's house does not have to be a Gothic structure, but it
                       should be made appropriate and attractive. The Pilgrim Fath-
                       ers spoke of the church building as a "meetinghouse," and the
                       Quakers still use the same term today. It is that, because it
                       is where God meets with His people and they meet one an-
                       other. But there is danger that it will degenerate into a social
                       center and the spirit of true worship be lost.
                          "It should not be made a place to meet old friends and
                       visit and introduce common thoughts and worldly business

                           While our knowledge of life in antediluvian days is very
                        limited, yet we do know that music had its place in the culture
                        of the ancients. We read of Jubal who "was the father of all
                        such as handled the harp and the organ." Gen. 4:21. Moffatt's
                        translation reads: "The ancestor of all who play the lyre and
                        the pipe."

                           What was the response of the sons of God at the time
                        this world came from the Creator's hand? Job 38:4-7.


                          "When the morning stars were singing, and all the angels
                        chanted in their joy." Moffatt.

                           One who accepts the Bible story and senses that the ante-

                        living, finds no difficulty in recognizing that God Himself was
                        man's first instructor in the art of music.

                      the waters stood like a wall upon each side. The light from

                          The musical ability of Moses and Miriam may better be
                       understood when we remember that Moses, "learned in all the

                       of music of his day. And among the ancient nations, Egypt was

     TIME OF DAVID     of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding,
      1 Chron. 15:16   by lifting up the voice with joy."
                          David was the next great national figure after Moses. He
                       too was a great songwriter. But more, he organized schools of
                       music. Many of the psalms were written by David, and these
                       great expressions of praise were sung by the people, led by
                       priests and Levites. The Hebrews apparently had some form
                       of music for every important occasion. It was David who led
                       out in the development of music for their worship. We read,
                       "Four thousand praised the Lord with the instruments which
                       I made, said David, to praise therewith." 1 Chron. 23:5.

                          Under what circumstance was the ark of the covenant
                       brought back to the sanctuary? 1 Chron. 16:4-36.


                          "With reverent care the ark was now placed upon the

                       day Jehovah was to be . . . the sole object of reverence.
                          "Again the long train was in motion, and the music of harp
                       and cornet, trumpet and cymbal, floated heavenward, blended

                       2 Chron. 5:7, 12-14.



                          The Levite choir was robed—"arrayed in white linen." "The
                       trumpeters and singers were as one." And God's acceptance of
                       this worship was evidenced by His filling the temple with "the
                       glory of the Lord."

                       other parts of the Bible. The , service of worship, particularly
                       in the second temple (the temple built after the Jews returned
                       from Babylon), made praise a leading feature. They called
                       the Psalms the "Book of Praise." And these were divided into
                       five books, each book concluding with a benediction. The first
                       three of these books closed with a repeated "Amen." (See
                       Ps. 41:13; 72:19; 89:52.) The last two books closed with
                       the expression "praise the Lord" or "hallelujah." (Ps. 106:48;
                       150:6). The five books of the Psalms •are: (1) Psalms 1 through
                       41; (2) Psalms 42 through 72; (3) Psalms 73 through 89;
                        (4) Psalms 90 through 106; and (5) Psalms 107 through 150.
                           Psalm 150 is really the doxology to the whole book, which
                        psalm many believe might well have been the last psalm writ-
                       ten.

                           For what reason did the psalmist call upon the nations
                        to sing? Ps. 67:2, 4.


                           "The singing should not be done by a few only. All present
                        should be encouraged to join in the song service."—Evange-
                        lism, page 507. "As often as possible, let the entire congrega-
                        tion join."—Ibid.

                           When King Hezekiah led out in the restoration of the
                        worship at the temple, what accompanied the burnt
                        offering at the altar? 2 Chron. 29:27-31.



 THINK IT THROUGH          When I read the psalms, do I realize that these were
                        the hymns of God's ancient people? Do they speak their

                       needed to happen in his life. Samuel had just anointed him

   CHRISTIAN TIMES     to the king's order."
      1 Chron. 25:6
                          Under the leadership of King David music began to have a
                       very much more prominent part in the worship of the ancient
                       people of God. While Moses had established the form of wor-
                       ship in the ancient tabernacle, no particular program had been
                       outlined for music and singing. But during the reigns of both
                       David and Solomon choirs and orchestras became a regular
                       part of the worship program.
                          "From David's time on, music was used in connection with
                       the morning and evening sacrifices, with Sabbath worship, and
                       with the celebration of the new moon and set feasts such as
                       the New Year and the Day of Atonement.. .
                          "The music for the dedication of the magnificent temple
                       must be of matching magnificence. David's preparation for it
                       was threefold: the composing, collecting, and revising of the
                       psalms of praise, including the tunes to which they should be
                       sung; the making of the musical instruments to be used; and
                       the actual training of players and singers."—Grauman, Musk
                       in My Bible, page 76.

                          What did David say concerning the house of the Lord
                        which Solomon was to build? 1 Chron. 22:5.




                           In what way did David receive the plans for the forth-
                        coming house of the Lord? 1 Chron. 28:19.



                           During the next four centuries the music of the temple
                        worship continued. But with the destruction of the temple by
                        Nebuchadnezzar their temple worship ceased. Even after the
                        Jews returned and rebuilt the temple, the worship was never
                        again so elaborate.

                             The words, "Thy Holy Child Jesus," are deeply significant,
                          for here we see the Old Testament hymns being applied to
                          Christ Jesus.
                             When Peter and John were released from prison, they came
                          to "their own company" and rehearsed what the Lord had
                          done. Little wonder the whole company broke out into song.
                          And they related the second psalm definitely to Christ. The
                          psalms were not merely read or repeated; they were sung. A
                          few weeks earlier many in that group had joined in the songs
                          of praise when Jesus entered Jerusalem in triumph, for they
                          recognized a definite fulfillment of prophecy, and they ex-
                          pressed their feelings in the hymn of praise.
                             "If there was much more praising the Lord, and far less

                         praise the Lord heartily with words and music." The apostle
                         Paul was appealing to the church to develop real Christian
                         fellowship through the use of, hymns and-songs. And he fecog-
                         nized the difference between hyrinis — arid— songs. Generally
                         speaking, a hymn is an ascription to God; it may be praise,
                         prayer, or deep devotion. But a gospel song, on the contrary,
                         is often addressed to our fellowmen.

                            What similar instruction did the apostle Paul give to
                         another church concerning the use of hymns and spiritual
                         songs? Col. 3:16.



                             What did our Lord Jesus say will happen when He is
                         lifted up? John 12:32.



                            While this refers primarily to His being lifted up on the
                         cross, we must also lift Him up in our worship. The spirit of
                         prophecy says, "Do not strike one dolorous note; do not sing
                         funeral hymns."—Evangelism, page 180.
                            We do not understand this as counsel not to sing hymns at
                         a funeral service, for hymns can be a great blessing in the time
                         of sorrow. But "funeral hymns" as used here are those that
                         fail to exalt the living God, hymns that are gloomy and
                         sepulchral.
 THINK IT THROUGH            Does our congregation enter heartily into the singing
                         of the great hymns of the centuries? Do the songs I sing

                         A new note of joy came with the Christian message. The
                       angel said to the shepherds, "I bring you good tidings of great
                       joy, which shall be to all people."

                            How did David react to God's revelation of the "way
                        of life"? Acts 2:28.




                           How did Peter say the Christian should respond to the
                        love of God? 1 Peter 1:8.




                           When we truly love the Lord, what should be our
                        response? Ps. 5:11.




                          Our singing should not be reserved just for those days when
                       everything seems to be going right. Jesus said: "Blessed are
                       ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you
                       from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your
                       name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye in that
                       day, and leap for joy." Luke 6:22, 23. That surely was the
                       new way of looking at life, and how wonderfully the disciples
                       entered into that experience. When persecution was raised
                       against Paul and Barnabas and they were expelled from the
                       city, the record says they were "filled with joy, and with the
                       Holy Ghost." See Acts 13:50-52.

                          The place the psalms had in the worship of the early church
                       is revealed in Paul's letter to the Romans. These hymns be-
                       come their inspiration as peoples of all nations assembled for
                       worship. The Hebrew hymnbook forecasted this gathering in
                       of the Gentiles. The apostle's prayer was that the God of hope
                       would fill them with all joy and peace and that through the
                       power of the Holy Spirit their lives would overflow.

                           The hymn, Hebrew or Christian, is the child of its age.
                        Christian hymns centered largely in Christ as Creator and
                        Redeemer. New hymns and songs appeared because the He-
                        brew psalms were insufficient to express praise to Christ as
                        Lord. The "Jehovah of the Jews" was hailed as "the Lord of
                        all nations" by the Christians. Christians sang the Old Testa-
                        ment psalms and hymns but also added new hymns and songs
                        to express their victory in Christ.

                           What was Paul's admonition to those who were "risen
                        with Christ"? Col. 3:15-17.


                           Congregational singing practically ceased for a thousand
                        years, the singing being done only by the monks. This con-
                        tinued until the beginning of the fifteenth century when John
                        Huss of Bohemia, a musician as well as a great preacher, wrote
                        hymns for his people. This was actually one cause of his mar-
                        tyrdom in 1415. A century later Martin Luther with his en-
                        lightened colleagues changed the whole pattern of worship in
                        Europe. His famous hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,"
                        based on Psalm 46, became the watchword of the Reforma-
                        tion.

                           In remembrance of God's holiness, what should His

         Ps. 96:1-3
                          The call to sing "a new song" inspired Isaac Watts to begin
                       a new hymn pattern in the English language. He is sometimes
                       called "the father of English hymnody." The early English and
                       French Reformers maintained that we should sing only the
                       inspired words of Scripture. But Watts contended that to sing
                       only the words of the Old Testament was to put a veil over
                       the mind as did the Jews in Paul's day. Why should we close
                       our eyes to the reality of Jesus Christ? So he began to para-
                       phrase the Hebrew hymns into Christian language.

                          In what words did John the Baptist call the people
                       to behold Christ? John 1:29, 35, 36.




                          The eighteenth century was marked by a great evangelical
                       revival. John and Charles Wesley were prominent leaders in
                       this movement, which was characterized by "an outburst of
                       song." The great doctrines of free grace and universal atone-
                       ment which they emphasized naturally called for new songs
                       of faith, hope, and love.
                          Charles Wesley, the poet of the movement, wrote more than
                       6,500 hymns, many of which emphasized the mercy and judg-
                       ment of God, such as "Jesus, Lover of My Soul" and "Lo! He
                       Comes With Clouds Descending." Wesley seemed to cover the
                       whole message •of •the Bible in his hymns.

     Isa. 56:6, 7, RSV   prayer for all peoples."
                            Prayer is as old •as man, who was created to commune with
                         his Maker. The Greek word for man, anthropos, is said by
                         some scholars to mean "the being with the upturned face."
                         Man by nature is religious, and prayer is the natural impulse
                         of the soul. While different religions approach prayer in dif-
                         ferent ways, yet all pray. These words by Augustine are sig-
                         nificant: "Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are
                         restless till they find their rest in Thee." Prayer is, therefore,
                         a vital part of worship.

                            What request did the disciples make of Jesus? Luke
                         11:1.


                            "Teach us to pray," not "how to pray." They had seen and
                         heard the Master at prayer, and they were reaching out for
                         the experience He enjoyed with His Father. Christ's answer
                         is revealing. He did not say, "Well, just ask God for what you
                         want." Instead He gave them the model prayer which we call
                         the Lord's Prayer. In this prayer only one third is petition;
                         the rest is adoration, worship, and praise.

                           What kind of person has his prayer heard by the
                         Lord? Prov. 15:29.


                            We need not be righteous before we pray. We come to God
                         just as we are. The prayer of the publican was, "God be
                         merciful to me a sinner." That man's prayer was heard. He
                         went home justified. He had been made righteous through the
                         gift of God's grace. Having received pardon for his sins, he
                         was now in God's sight righteous. The other man went back
                         as he came—condemned.

         THE NATURE that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."
          OF PRAYER
           Heb. 11:6   "It is a wonderful thing that we can pray effectually; that
                         unworthy, erring mortals possess the power of offering their
                         requests to God. What higher power can man desire than this
                         —to be linked with the Infinite God? Feeble, sinful man has
                         the privilege of speaking to his Maker. We may utter words
                         that reach the throne of the Monarch of the universe. . . .
                            "True faith and true prayer—how strong they are! They
                         are as two arms by which the human suppliant lays hold upon
                         the power of Infinite Love."—Gospel Workers, pages 258, 259.

                             Can we be sure the Lord will hear us? Ps. 34:15.



                             What is God's promise to those who call upon Him?
                          Ps. 145:18, 19.



                             What assurance do we have that God will hear us?
                          1 John 5:14, 15; 3:22.


                             While real prayer is individual communion with God, yet
                          when a congregation gathers together for worship and one is
                          designated to lead in the public prayer, he must realize that
                          his voice is really the voice of the whole group; he expresses
                          their praise, their needs, their desires. Instead of using the
                          personal pronoun, "I pray Thee," it should be "we pray Thee,"
                          or "hear Thou our prayer," not "my prayer." The prayer must
                          become congregational. The expression of praise to God, the
                          confession of sins and enmities, the petition for the assuaging
                          of griefs that corrode the soul, all of these should be expressed
                          in the plural, not the singular form.
 THINK IT THROUGH            Am I learning really to intercede for others as Daniel
                          did?
                             Am I •as concerned about the straying and lost as I

          PRAYER
        Ps. 95:6, 7        Prayer is God's method for man's communion with Him,
                        but we should come to Him in the way He directs. The psalm-
                        ist said, "Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker."

                          What was Paul's and Daniel's attitude in prayer?
                        Eph. 3:14; Dan. 6:10.



                          When the people were assembled before Ezra, what
                        was his posture in prayer? Ezra 9:4-7.


                           "Both in public and in private worship, it is our privilege
                        to bow on our knees before the Lord when we offer our peti-
                        tions to Him. Jesus, our example, 'kneeled down, and prayed.'
                        Of His disciples it is recorded that they, too, 'kneeled down,
                        and prayed.'...
                           "True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infinite
                        greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of
                        the Unseen, every heart should be deeply impressed. The hour
                        and place of prayer are sacred, because God is there; and as
                        reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling
                        that inspires it will be deepened. 'Holy and reverend is His
                        name,' the psalmist declares. Angels, when they speak that
                        name, veil their faces. With what reverence, then, should we,
                        who are fallen and sinful, take it upon our lips!"—Gospel

                        will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My
     John 14:13, 14;    name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
          16:23, 24     full."
                           When Jesus gave the model prayer, He began with the
                        words, "Our Father which art in heaven." It is God the Father
                        who promises to heed and hear the petition of His children.
                        It is God the Son who by His sacrificial death provides access
                        to Deity, and it is God the Holy Spirit who indites true prayer.
                        For "we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit
                        Himself intercedes for us." Rom. 8:26, RSV.

                           How did Jesus say we should come to the Father?
                        John 14:6.


                          What was the prophet Hosea's appeal to his people?
                        Hosea 14:2.


                            The wording of our public prayers is important. To address
                        the God of the universe in the language of the street or the
                        ballpark or the shop is not only inappropriate; it is sacrilegious.
                        It has been well said, "The way a man prays in public shows
                        people the sort of Person he worships, and the way he regards
                        that Person." The tendency to address the High and Holy God
                        in the same way as we would address one another is something
                        to be deplored. We must remember that all the worshipers,
                        including the one who is offering the prayer, are helpless sin-
                        ners, and the only reason that we are enabled to speak in the
                        holy presence of God is His free and unmerited grace. It be-
                        hooves us, then, that our language be marked by dignity, hum-
                        ility, and reverence.
  THINK IT THROUGH         Do my prayers reveal reverence both in language

                          In the service of worship there are usually a number of
                       prayers before the closing prayer. Let us now •think particu-
                       larly of the general or main prayer. No feature in the service
                       is more important than this, for it concerns every person
                       present.
                          C. H. Spurgeon, the outstanding pastor-evangelist of his
                       generation, declares, "Prayer is one of the most weighty, use-
                       ful, and honorable parts of the service, and . . . it ought to
                       be even more considered than the sermon. . . . Let the Infinite

                          Against what kind of praying has our. Saviour warned
                        us? Matt. 6:5, 6.



                          The prayer of the hypocrite, which is only a pretense, does
                       not count with God. Such expressions as "the closet," "the
                       inner chamber," and the "closed door" are deeply significant.
                       The one who truly senses what congregational prayer really
                       is will have disciplined himself to close his mind to all other
                       thoughts and attractions while he speaks to God on behalf of
                       the worshipers.

                                                                        February 11
             Part 6        "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in
        PRAYING IN      the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance
         THE SPIRIT     and supplication for all saints."
          Eph. 6:18
                           The expression "praying in the Spirit" is arresting. Through
                        prayer we contact the Creator. Prayer is the mightiest force
                        in the world, and this the enemy knows. This is why "Satan
                        trembles when he sees the weakest saint upon his knees." But
                        only when prayer is Spirit-imbued is it effective.

                          Of what are we assured in our relationship to God?
                        Gal. 4:6, 7.




                           When the Spirit of God takes possession of the soul, He
                        becomes in truth the Spirit of intercession and "is at once the
                        Guide of prayer and the Guarantor of its success." Both the
                        desire and the ability to pray are made possible through the
                        Spirit of God. Merely to say prayers is not enough. Our minds
                        and hearts must be Spirit-possessed. Note the apostle's clear
                        statement: "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
                        mind of the Spirit." Rom. 8:27.
                           There are two divine Intercessors. Christ Jesus intercedes
                        for us before the throne in heaven, and the Holy Spirit inter-
                        cedes at the throne of our hearts. We could put it this way
                        —the One who prepares our case is the Holy Spirit—the
                        "Chamber Advocate"; while the One who presents our case
                        is Christ Jesus our High Priest—"The Court Advocate."

                           Reading a portion of Scripture in public is an art, and like
                        any other art it requires real preparation. While the Bible is
                        the Word of God, it must be read as the Word of God.
                           "By diligent effort all may acquire the power to read intel-

                         The spirit in which the people were making their gifts was
                      important to Jesus. The Lord does not need our money, for
                      all the silver and the gold are His, and the cattle upon a
                      thousand hills. But we need the blessing of the partnership.

                          Who gives us the ability to get wealth? Deut. 8:18.



                          God does not give us wealth to squander on ourselves. "Our
                       money has not been given us that we might honor and glorify
                       ourselves. As faithful stewards we are to use it for the honor

                         What should be our attitude in giving to the cause of

         Isa. 6:1, 3
                            The spirit of worship in the heart means that worshipers
                        will be expecting a blessing. An attractive house of worship,
                        with suitable music, immerses them in an attitude that uplifts
                        the soul. All should feel that God is present. The spirit of
                        Ps. 46:10 should pervade the house of worship: "Be still, and
                        know that I am God."
                            Possibly the Sabbath School has already been conducted in
                        the church building. If so, then special thought must be given
                         to the change from the informal study of God's Word and the
                        promotion of worthy activities, to quiet, worshipful reflection.
                        To bring all, old and young, into such a spirit of worship is
                        not easy.
                            Experience has proved the wisdom of making the announce-
                         ments and all necessary offering and campaign..-promotion
                         before the actual worship begins. All the King's business justly
                         requires our attention, but the service of worship is to exalt
                         the Lord our Maker. From the first call to worship to the final
                         benediction everything must be on the high plateau of com-
                         munion with God.
                            An example of an appropriate short prayer of adoration can
                         be found in these words taken from Ps. 145:3, 17, 19: "Great
                         is the Lord, and greatly to •be praised; and His greatness is
                         unsearchable." "The Lord is righteous in all His ways, and
                         holy in all His works." "He will fulfill the desire of them
                         that fear Him: He also will hear their cry, and will save them."
                             Many other such calls will be found in the Psalms; here are
                         a few: Ps. 46:1, 10, 11; 95:1-3; 96:1, 7-9; 99:1-3, 9; 100:1, 2,
                         4, 5. Other passages of Scripture are equally appropriate, such
                         as Luke 1:68, 77, 78: "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for
                         He bath visited and redeemed His people." "To give knowl-

                         spring from on high hath visited us."
 THINK IT THROUGH          When the invocation is offered at the beginning of
                         worship, am I truly prepared in heart to commune with
                         my Maker?

                                                                          February 17
               Part 5        "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.
        THE CALL TO Serve the Lord with gladness: come before His presence
            WORSHIP with singing."
                             "Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His
                         courts with praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His
                         name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting; and
     Ps. 100:1, 2, 4, 5 His truth endureth to all generations."

                            The call to worship should be very real, for many that come
                         to a meeting are not •prepared to enter into the experience of
                         worship. The apostle Peter says, "Gird up the loins of your
                         mind." It is very easy for our minds to wander. On the way
                         to the church the conversation may not have been always in
                         a devotional setting. Something must grip our hearts if we
                         would worship God "in spirit and in truth." An appropriate
                         call will be given in the words of Scripture, such as Psalm 99:
                         "The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: He sitteth between
                         the cherubims; let the earth be moved. The Lord is great in
                         Zion; and He is high above all the people. Let them praise
                         Thy great and terrible name; for it is holy." "Exalt ye the
                         Lord our God, and worship at His footstool." Verses 1-3, 5.
                            If a different scripture is chosen from week to week, it will
                         prevent the call to worship from becoming just a form. Some
                         New Testament passages are also excellent, such as Heb. 4:14-
                         16 or Luke 1:68, 77, 78. When such a call to worship is fol-
                         lowed by a doxology, it will do much to unify the spirit of
                         worship.

                            What are we admonished to do? Ps. 100:4, 5.
                           If such a call is given in a tone of joy and gratitude, all
                         will want to respond in an expression of praise.



 THINK IT THROUGH           Have I emptied my mind of all worldly thoughts when
                         the call to worship is given?

Other Aspects of the Worship Service LESSON 8                            ❑ Friday
                                                                      February 18
            Part 6     "Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling,
       CLOSING THE and to present you faultless before the presence of His
        SERVICE OF glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our
          WORSHIP Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
        Jude 24, 25 both now and ever. Amen."
                          These words conclude the brief epistle of Jude, and they
                       set forth some of the most wonderful truths concerning salva-
                       tion. As a benediction, this scripture is unsurpassed.
                          The benediction should come as the climax to all that has
                       gone before. From the beginning of the organ prelude through
                       all of its features the worship service should be leading up to
                       this point.

                          How did the Lord instruct Aaron and his sons through
                       Moses to bless the children of Israel? What were these
                       priests to say? Num. 6:24-26.


                           While the benediction seems to belong with the prayers of
                        the church, it is not actually a prayer. This is not always
                        understood by those who conduct the Sabbath worship service.
                        Sometimes the meeting closes with a prayer, even a commen-
                        tary on the preacher's message. That of course is not a bene-
                        diction in this sense. The people have already joined in the
                        singing and the prayers, and through the ministry of the
                        Word have been led to look to God for His manifold blessings.
                        Then it is fitting if the service closes with a benediction.
                           There are a number of wonderful benedictions to be found
                        in the Bible. These should be studied and memorized. One of
                        the most simple yet most beautiful of the many benedictions
                        we find in God's Word is 2 Corinthians 13:14. We can do no
                        better than to choose such a scripture, preferably from mem-
                        ory, to close the meeting.

                          What example of a fitting benediction is given in the
                        book of Hebrews? Heb. 13:20, 21.


  THINK IT THROUGH         As I leave the worship service, is it with a sense of
                        having met God?


   "Paul wrote to these •brethren [He-     that Great Shepherd of the sheep.' He

The Sermon in the Service of Worship LESSON 9                                   ❑ Sunday
                                                                              February 20

       PREACHING is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall
  CENTERS IN CHRIST be damned."
     Mark 16:15, 16
                              The Christian church was commissioned to proclaim a very
                           definite message. Christianity spread to the whole world under
                           the power of Spirit-filled preaching. A true sermon is not a
                           lecture or an oration; it is not a political or informative speech.
                           Rather it is a setting forth of the living Christ and His saving
                           gospel. It must be delivered in the •power of the Holy Spirit.

                              To what did Paul attribute his power in the winning of
                           souls? 1 Cor. 1:18.



                               What wonderful example did he give to the church
                           in this respect? 2 Cor. 4:5.


                              "The sacrifice of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great
                           truth around which all other truths cluster. In order to be
                           rightly understood and appreciated, every truth in the Word
                           of God, from Genesis to Revelation, must be studied in the
                           light that streams from the cross of Calvary."—Evangelism,
                           page 190.
                              The sermon is not the only part, perhaps not even the most
                           important part, of the worship service. Other parts such as
                           the reading of Scripture and the prayers are also important.
                           When Jesus read the Scriptures, we notice, "the eyes of all
                           were fastened upon Him." Having heard His voice in the
                           reading, they were ready for God's message.
                              Every feature of worship that leads up to the sermon is a

        WHAT GOD       our appeal to men."
       EXPECTS OF          "Does my language now sound as if I were canvassing
       A PREACHER      for men's support? Whose support do I want but God's
                       alone? Do you think I am currying favor with men? If
   2 Cor. 5:11, NEB;   I still sought men's favor, I should be no servant of
     Gal. 1:10, NEB    Christ."

                          What was the urge behind Paul's preaching? 2 Cor.
                       5:11.


                          To interest or entertain people is not sufficient. The preacher
                       must persuade men. Sometimes arguments will convince men
                       of certain ideas, but convincing speech is not as great as per-
                       suasive speech. Convincing speech appeals to the mind; per-
                       suasive speech appeals to the heart. And only as men's hearts
                       are reached are their wills affected.
                          "It should be the burden of every messenger to set forth the
                       fullness of Christ. . . . Let the preciousness, mercy, and glory
                       of Jesus Christ be dwelt upon until Christ is formed within,
                       the hope of glory."—Evangelism, page 186.
                          "There should not a sermon be given unless a portion of
                       that discourse is to especially make plain the way that sinners
                       may come to Christ and be saved. They should point them to
                       Christ, as did John and with touching simplicity, their hearts
                       aglow with the love of Christ, say, 'Behold the Lamb of God,
                       which taketh away the sin of the world.' "—Ibid., p. 188.

                           What did Paul say was his message? 2 Cor. 4:5.




                           What was his declaration to the Athenians on Mars'
                       Hill? Acts 17:31.

                Part 3 "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in
        DECORUM OF conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
     WORSHIP LEADERS
           1 Tim. 4:12 The worshipers are vitally affected by the attitude of those
                          who lead the service. Very specific instructions were given to
                          Israel's priests concerning their dress and deportment.
                             What words were worn by the high priest on his miter
                          as he ministered? Ex. 28:36-38.


                             While we do not now have such specific instructions, yet the
                          principle established in ancient times is just as real today.
                             "Very specific were the directions given in regard to Aaron's
                          robes, for his dress was symbolic. So the dress of Christ's fol-
                          lowers should be symbolic. In all things we are to be represen-
                          tatives of Him. Our appearance in every respect should be
                          characterized by neatness, modesty, and purity."—Testimonies,
                          Vol. 6, p. 96.
                             How did the apostle Paul express his concern to Timo-
                          thy? 1 Tim. 3:14, 15.


                             "Decorum is necessary in the desk. A minister of the gospel
                          should not be regardless of his attitude. If he is the represen-
                          tative of Christ, his deportment, his attitude, his gestures,
                          should be of such a character as will not strike the beholder
                          with disgust. Ministers should possess refinement. They should
                          discard all uncouth manners, attitudes, and gestures, and
                          should encourage in themselves humble dignity of bearing.
                          They should be clothed in a manner befitting the dignity of
                          their position. Their speech should be in every respect solemn

                                                                          February 23
             Part 4         "After these things the Lord appointed other seventy

                         the harvest, that He would send forth laborers into His
                         harvest."
                            "And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto
      Luke 10:1, 2, 9    them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."

                           From its beginning the Christian church has been blessed
                         and forwarded by the ministry of laymen. The seventy whom
                         Jesus sent out were not ordained preachers, but they were
                         definitely a part of the ministerial workers used by the Lord.

                             When the apostle Paul set forth the different types
                         of leaders God gave to the church, what did He say was
                         their work? Eph. 4:11, 12.



                            Various types of workers such as evangelists, pastors, teach-
                         ers, prophets, and apostles have been called of God. And these
                         are to combine their services for the perfecting of the saints.
                         The Berkeley Version reads: "To make the saints fit for the
                         task of ministering."
                            The work of ministry, even the preaching of the word, is
                         not always to be done by ordained ministers. One of the great-
                         est sermons recorded in the New Testament was preached by
                         Stephen, a deacon. Thus the pattern of lay preaching was set.

                   1).      How did Peter say the gospel should be preached?
                         1 Peter 1:12.

        THE SERMON       Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
           Acts 2:37
                            Every service of worship should move toward a definite
                         goal, and the sermon, being a vital part of that worship service,
                         can and should, more than any other part, lead to that goal.
                         And it should begin at the point where the people are and carry
                         them forward.
                            The one who breaks the bread of life for the people must
                         have a singleness of purpose. Peter's message on the day of
                         Pentecost reached a focal point and the response was imme-
                         diate. Someone has said, "From too many worship services, the
                         people go away 'almost persuaded'--but not quite." The Pente-
                         cost sermon hook a passage from the prophet Joel, focused it
                         upon the immediate present, set Christ in the center, empha-
                         sized His ministry, His death, His resurrection, and His ascen-
                         sion, and climaxed with His priesthood in heaven. This was
                         indeed a Christ-centered sermon.

                   1).       What did Peter say his hearers must do to receive the
                         gift of the Holy Spirit? Verse 38.


                            He expected the people to make a decision. Good preaching,
                         whether by an ordained minister or a layman, should always
                         lead to decision and dedication. Be a sermon ever so eloquent
                         or philosophical or psychological, it fails if it does not lead
                         people to salvation. A sermon is not just saying something; it
                         must do something.

                            In what way were the people convicted under the
                         preaching of Peter on the Day of Pentecost? Acts 2:37.

      THE MESSAGE        the testimony of God. For I determined not to know any-

                             "And my speech and my preaching was not with en-
                         ticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of
      1 Cor. 2:1, 2, 4   the Spirit and of power."

                            Preaching is not easy, and woe be to anyone who tries to
                         make it so. Someone has said, "Preaching is the transmission
                         of a Person through a person to a company of persons." And
                         the Person transmitted is the eternal Word (Greek, logos, John
                         1:1) the 'Creator, who was made flesh and dwelt among us.
                         Could it be said of all our sermons, those we preach and those
                         we listen to, that they are filled with Christ the living Word?
                            "He [Paul] claimed no wisdom of his own, but acknowl-
                         edged that divine power alone had enabled him to present the
                         truth in a manner pleasing to God. United with Christ, the
                         greatest of all teachers, Paul had been enabled to communicate
                         lessons of divine wisdom, which met the necessities of all classes,
                         and which were to apply to all times, in all places, and under
                         all conditions."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 303.

                            How did Peter say he preached the gospel? 1 Peter
                         1:12.



                             The Holy Spirit comes not to glorify the preacher, but to
                         glorify Christ. John 16:14. That makes the sermon different
                         from a lecture, an oration, or a political speech. If it is pre-
                         pared in the atmosphere of prayer and deep Bible study, then
                         it should bear the evidence of spiritual illumination. The most
                         important part about a sermon is not "the man behind it" but
                         "the Man within it"—the Person preached rather than the
                         person preaching.

                             How did the apostle say the gospel came to the be-
                         lievers in Thessalonica? 1 Thess. 1:5.



 THINK IT THROUGH          Do I sense that the preacher is God's spokesman?
                         Do I listen as I would if Christ Himself were speaking?

                     THE EFFECTS OF TRUE WORSHIP 1

   "I will worship toward Thy holy temple, and praise Thy name for Thy loving-
kindness and for Thy truth: for Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy
name." Ps. 138:2.

                           We are linked together by indissoluble ties which override
                        all national barriers and nominal differences. We are no longer
                        separate and self-contained but individual units in a new and
                        wonderful creation—the church of Jesus Christ. Fellowship is
                        inherent in the Christian message. We become part of each
                        other as cells in the body—the body of Christ; an organic unity,
                        not a mere collection of individuals.
                           Our worship services when properly understood become a
                        divinely ordained way of exhibiting our gratitude to God for
                        His mercy.

     1 Cor. 12:25, 26    rejoice with it."
                            When worship is conducted rightly, the effect upon the wor-
                         shipers is very real. No stranger will remain ungreeted, no
                         invalid unvisited, no unfortunate member unbefriended, no
                         needy person unassisted, no missing Sabbath School member
                         neglected or unassisted. When bereavement strikes a family,
                         all the members feel the stroke. When one member or one fam-
                         ily is honored, all the rest should rejoice. This admonition to
                         rejoice in another's success is often more difficult to carry out
                         than the counsel to sympathize with those who mourn.
                             Fellowship is one of God's choicest words. And unless the
                         church enters into such fellowship, we come far short of God's
                          purpose for us.
                             The effect of true worship will be seen in the home, in the
                         office, in the classroom, on the farm, in our business and social
                          relationships. The one who comes home from the worship
                         service and scolds the family or kicks the dog has not really
                          worshiped. The effects of true worship are seen in every act
                         of life.
                             A church that is rich in money, in ideas, in apparatus and
                          numbers, but poor in love, comes far short of Christ's stan-
                          dard. One of our old-time leaders once passed on a remark
                          that revealed much thought. He said, "If only our members
                          would live up to the religion in their hymnbooks, it would be
                          wonderful." Yes, our hymns express Christian love. And we
                          often sing these lustily, but to live out the theology and
                          Christian admonition in these hymns is not always easy. But
                          by God's grace we can.

                            What did Jesus say should be the measure of our love
                         for the church? John 15:12.


 THINK IT THROUGH           Do I truly love my church? Can my friends feel the
                         love of God emanating from my life?

                           "Brotherhood" is the apostle Peter's name for the church.
                         John also regarded the church as a band of brothers. He said:
                         "He that loveth his brother abideth in the light." And again,
                         "We know that we have passed from death unto life because
                         we love the brethren." "We ought to lay down our lives for
                         the brethren." The watchword in John's epistle is love; not
                         love in a sentimental sense; but love of the brethren—agape
                         love; love which springs from a divine source.

                            What was Peter's admonition, especially to the church?
                         1 Peter 2:17.



                            Paul, another of the master builders of the church, empha-
                         sizes the same great truth. Note his counsel to the Thessalonian
                         believers in 1 Thess. 4:9, 10.
                            This was a love that must "increase more and more." It was
                         not just a one-time experience. In fact the distinctive note of
                         the Christian life is love for our fellow Christians. A man's
                         Christianity is revealed not merely by loving men in general,
                         but by his attitude to_his_brethren in Christ. (The world will

                         or eloquence, but by the love of believers one for another.
                            True fellowship is not just a high ideal. It is a distinct com-
                         mand of our Lord. It is more than love for the community,
                         although that is implied; or love for humanity in general, and
                         that surely is our privilege; but in a specific sense it is love
                         for one's fellow Christians, which opens the door of the world's
                         heart to understand the message of salvation. The apostolic
                         church revealed this, and the pagan crowds stood amazed, say-

                          It is the work of church leaders to plan areas of service for

          Isa. 6:8, 9 Having seen the Lord high and lifted up, having heard the
                        heavenly choir singing, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of
                        hosts," and having experienced forgiveness and cleansing, the
                        prophet then heard the call to •go and tell what he had seen
                        and heard and experienced. This "carry-over" of worship is
                        vital. Nothing is more disappointing than a congregation that
                        gives only lip service, whose hearts are not inspired to bring
                        the gospel to their fellowmen.

                           Looking out upon the great unsaved world, what
                        did Paul say? Rom. 10:14, 15.



                           When the Lord gave the word, what did He say about
                        those who published it? Ps. 68:11.


                            To proclaim or publish the good news requires more than
                        evangelistic specialists. It is the work of an enthusiastic, con-
                        secrated congregation. An evangelistic church must be inspired
                        literally to boil over with the good news of salvation.

                          To how many of earth's inhabitants must the good
                        news of salvation go? Rev. 14:6.


                          "Christ's work in •behalf of man is not finished. It continues
                       today. . . . His ambassadors are to preach the gospel and to
                       reveal His pitying love for lost and perishing souls. . . . The
                       evangelization of the world is the work God has given to those
                       who go forth in His name.... •God calls for thousands to work
                       for Him, not by preaching to those who know the truth for

     EVANGELISTS
         Luke 5:4 A congregation that has truly worshiped becomes a net let
                      down into the great sea of humanity. Then, having witnessed
                      the ingathering of souls, the evangelistic church like Peter of
                      old is ready to fall down at the feet of her Lord under a con-
                      victing sense of individual need.

                          What was the Lord's promise to Peter? Verse 10.


                          Catching men is the real work of the entire church, not of
                       a few specialists. Now let us change the figure from a net to
                       a fire. Both of these symbols are Biblical. Jesus said, "I am
                       come to send fire on the earth." Luke 12:49. On the Day of
                       Pentecost a small group of believers were set on fire, and be-
                       fore the day was out the whole city felt the effects. When the
                       church is set on fire, the world will feel the warmth of it. But
                       there can be no fire in the church until the fuel is brought
                       together. It was united when the disciples were of one accord,
                       of one soul, of one mind. It was then and not till then that
                       they were ready to bear their witness to the risen Lord. For
                       ten days they had been searching their hearts, catching a new
                       vision of the Lord high and lifted up. The spirit of true wor-
                       ship had gripped their hearts. That experience must and will
                       be repeated before the return of our Lord. The church of Jesus
                       Christ exists for one purpose, that of kindling the fire of God's
                       love in the hearts of those in the community.

                         Having caught a new vision of his risen Lord, how did
                       John conclude his account of the revelation of Jesus
                       Christ? Rev. 22:17.


                          Through the ministry of the church, the Holy Spirit says
                       to the community, "Come," and the bride of the Lamb is also
                       heard to say, "Come." But the Patmos prophet goes even far-
                       ther when he says, "Let him that heareth say, Come."

       OF WORSHIP
       Ps. 50:14, 15        If we are to pay our "vows unto the Most High," we must
                         learn all we can about Him. The attributes of God as revealed
                         in the Old Testament are majesty, holiness, justice, love, and
                         mercy. But in the New Testament we have a fuller revelation
                         —that of a loving Father. That was our Lord's central mes-
                         sage to the Jewish people. While other great religions pay
                         homage to "the Great Spirit" or "the Supreme Power," the
                         Christian recognizes a filial fellowship with God. He is not
                         only our Creator; He is also our Redeemer, and He is "our
                         Father."
                            The Hebrew word most frequently used for "worship" is
                         shachah, which means to bow down. When Abraham's servant
                         recognized the guidance of God in leading him to Rebecca, he
                         "bowed down his head, and worshiped the Lord." Gen. 24:26.

                            What was our Lord's reply to the tempter? Luke 4:8.

                            Worship belongs to God alone, said Jesus. In the New Tes-
                         tament the word most frequently used for worship is proskun,
                         and it also means to •pay homage by bowing down as when
                         the mother of James and John came to Jesus "worshiping
                         Him, and desiring a certain thing of Him." Matt. 20:20. "She
                         bowed low and begged a favor." NEB. The RSV reads, "Kneel-
                         ing before Him she asked Him for something." The English
                         word comes from an old Anglo-Saxon word "weorthscipe,"
                         which meant worthship. Sometimes dignitaries of state such as
                         the mayor are addressed as "Your Worship." Recognizing the
                         majesty and holiness of our God, our natural attitude in wor-
                         ship should be one of humility.

                           To whom did the apostle Paul pray? What was the
                         burden of his prayer? 2 Cor. 13:7.

     2 Cor. 4:6, NEB

                           When Philip said to Jesus, "Lord, show us the Father,
                        and we shall be satisfied" (John 14:8, RSV), how did
                        Jesus reply? Verse 9.


                           All we need to know about the Father is revealed to us in
                        Jesus Christ. We often say of a son, "He is just like his father."
                        The New Testament picture of the Son thus shows the char-
                        acter of the Father.

                            What was the apostle Paul's great desire for the be-
                        lievers in Rome? Rom. 15:6.


                           Paul's expression "in the face of Jesus Christ" is full of
                        meaning. When John saw Jesus in vision, he said, "His coun-
                        tenance was as the sun shineth in his strength." When he saw
                        his Lord on the mount of transfiguration, "His face did shine
                        as the sun." But he had also seen his Master's face etched in
                        agony, both in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross.
                        John saw Him, as "a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with
                        grief," sweat great drops of blood, fulfilling the prophecy of
                        Isaiah that "His visage was so marred more than any man."
                        Isa. 52:14. In all this the Father was also suffering with His
                        Son.

                           How did the apostle Paul say our Lord learned? Heb.

                        worship. Here God revealed the whole plan of salvation. While
                        we do not have the same form of earthly sanctuary today, yet
                        in the heavenly sanctuary the way of salvation is even more
                        completely revealed; for the High Priest who officiates there
                        is the One who sacrificed Himself for us. When Jesus died, He
                        occupied "the double position of offerer and of offering, of
                        priest and of victim."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                        Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 933.

                           What cleansing was given to Isaiah? Isa. 6:7.




                           This redemptive element must be a vital part of our wor-
                        ship or it will mean little. Sinners must be helped to find sal-
                        vation and Christians a new purification and infilling. But
                        worship is also educative. It is sometimes said that "worship
                        is an art." One does not have to be a college graduate to
                        worship truly. On the other hand, certain types of education
                        may even imperil worship by undermining confidence in God's
                        Word.
 THINK IT THROUGH          Do I realize the need of being taught of God to wor-
                        ship? Am I willing to learn?

Learning to Worship LESSON 11                                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                             March 8
           Part 4     "Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of
  MAKING WORSHIP Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
           VITAL whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,
        Acts 4:10 even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole."

                          This miracle was not something that had been planned by
                       Peter and John. These men were going into the temple at the
                       hour of prayer (Acts 3:1) when the crippled man was healed.
                       He then entered with them into the temple, and the people
                       saw him walking, leaping, and praising God. The miracle
                       could not be denied.
                          When the religious leaders saw what had happened, they
                       challenged Peter and John, and this gave the apostles another
                       opportunity to bear witness of their living Lord. This was not
                       a Sabbath morning meeting, but "the hour of prayer." What
                       better time could there be to study ways of making our wor-
                       ship more vital than the prayer meeting? While prayer is not
                       the whole of worship, it certainly is the heartbeat and lifeblood
                       of the church.

                          When the Jewish leaders began to examine Peter and
                       John, what did they discover? Acts 4:13.




                          Nothing will make a worship service so real as the con-
                       sciousness that the one leading out has "been with Jesus." The
                       whole congregation will feel the impact of that experience. A
                       sense of God's presence in a leader's life can lead even little
                       children to respond with reverence and love. Children of pri-
                       mary age are naturally eager to be led into a deeper experience
                       of worship. And nothing that primary workers do is of more
                       significance than to teach these young minds the meaning of
                       fruitful worship.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Are all the different age groups of our church being
                       led into the experience of genuine worship week by
                       week?

          VALUE OF and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
           WORSHIP ye shall find rest unto your souls."
      Maft. 11:28, 29
                            Ours is a restless generation. All over the world men and
                         women with hungry hearts, thirsting minds, and broken spirits
                         stand hopelessly with searching eyes and listening ears, longing
                         for soul rest that seems to elude them. In an age when God
                         is anathema and worship is regarded as a superstitious prac-
                         tice, heaven's message is going to all the world: "Fear God,
                         and give glory to Him . . . : and worship Him." Rev. 14:7.

                           How does Isaiah express God's lament? What does
                         God say about the wicked? Isa. 48:18; 57:20, 21.


                            Professor Jung, of Zurich, in his book, Modern Man in
                         Search of a Soul, page 264, says: "During the past thirty years,
                         people from all the civilized countries of the earth have con-

                         —that is to say, over thirty-five—there has not been one whose
                         problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious
                         outlook on life. . . . And none of them has really been healed
                         who did not regain his religious outlook."

                             What was the counsel given to Job in the midst of his
                         trial? Job. 22:21.


                            The real purpose of worship is to deepen one's knowledge
                         of God. "In a knowledge of God all true knowledge and real
                         development have their source. ... The mind of man is brought
                         into communion with the mind of God, the finite with the
                         Infinite. The effect of such communion on body and mind and
                         soul is beyond estimate."—Education, page 14.

                            What was our Lord's reply to Satan when tempted to
                         satisfy His material needs? Luke 4:4.


 THINK IT THROUGH           Is the peace of God filling my life? Am I really giving
                         glory to God by living a life of contentment and joy?

                     calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity,
       Isa. 1:11-13 even the solemn meetings."

                         When Isaiah brought that message of rebuke to his people,
                      it was really a challenge to their whole routine of worship,
                      which was a meaningless insult to God. He called their wor-
                      ship "an abomination." It was nothing more than a hollow
                      ritual.

                         What does the Lord say about those who do His work
                      carelessly or negligently? Jer. 48:10, margin. (Or see
                      RSV.)




                         What did the apostle Paul say about both his praying
                       and his singing? 1 Cor. 14:15.



                           Peter said, "Gird up the loins of your mind." 1 Peter 1:13.
                       It is possible to sing the hymns, kneel in prayer, and listen to
                       the reading of God's Holy Word while our minds are far away.
                       With David we should say, "Bless the Lord, 0 my soul: and
                       all that is within me, bless His holy name." Ps. 103:1.
                           "Well would it be for young and old to study and ponder
                       and often repeat those words of Holy Writ that show how
                       the place marked by God's special presence should be re-

       1 John 4:9-11 God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."

                            No other service in the church brings us into closer com-
                         munion with our Lord and with each other than does the
                        -Lord'S—Supper. It is both a memorial and an anticipation.
                            Every service of worship must lead people into the con-
                         sciousness of the presence of God. Not only the order and
                         content of the service, but also the progression and dynamic
                         appeal of each part, should inspire the spirit of true worship.
                            "The ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper are two
                         monumental pillars, one within and one without the church.

                         their Lord? Luke 24:35.



                            The Communion service is designed to preserve the inner
                         unity of fellowship so characteristic in the early church. Those
                         first Christians assembled together in private homes, in cata-
                         combs, in the caves of the earth. And at times they met before
                         the break of day. In that fellowship of faith they met around
                         the table of the Lord. Not only did they belong to something,
                         they believed in Someone. Theirs was not only a fellowship
                         of faith, it was a fellowship without frontiers. The spirit of
                         unity kept them in the bonds of peace.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Do I really enjoy the Communion service? Is it a privi-
                         lege or a duty?

       John 6:53, 54     him up at the last day."

                            The Latin word sacramentum was used in connection with
                        the oath taken by Roman soldiers. The early Christians adopted
                        it, relating it to the secret of God's revealed grace to His peo-
                        ple. Later, when the simplicity of the gospel was lost, this
                        word became attached to a number of elaborate services in
                        the church. But the two sacraments our Saviour particularly
                        emphasized were the Lord's Supper and baptism. In these
                        Christ pledged Himself to be our Redeemer. Through the new
                        covenant we become the children of God and joint heirs with
                        Christ. And every blessing that heaven can bestow in both
                        this life and the life to come is ours through the blood of
                        Christ.
                            "The administration of the Sacrament [the Lord's Supper]
                        was to keep before the disciples the infinite sacrifice made for
                        each of them individually as a part of the great whole of
                        fallen humanity."—The Desire of Ages, page 659.
                            It is possible, however, for us to be partakers of the em-
                        blems of our Lord's broken body and yet receive no blessing
                        from it. "Judas the betrayer was present at the sacramental
                        service. He received from Jesus the emblems of His broken
                        body and His spilled blood." Yet all the time he "cherished
                        his sullen, revengeful thoughts."—Ibid., p. 653.

                            What does God promise to make known to those who
                         fear Him? Ps. 25:14.



                            How enduring is the Lord's mercy to those who keep
                         His covenant? Ps. 103:17, 18.


 THINK IT THROUGH           Am I spending time each day in the contemplation
                         of God's love? Or do I just take it for granted?

                        It was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the
                        disciples. Whenever they met together to commemorate His

                           How did the apostle Peter, writing years later, refer

                           What was one of the causes of the Lord's condemna-

                        Mal. 1:7, 8.



                           The record •of these spiritual lapses of God's ancient people
                        has been preserved for our learning that we might sense the
                        sacredness of the Communion service, which points backward
                        to His death and forward to His second coming. Looking
                        forward to that time, Jesus said: "Verily I say unto you, that
                        He shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down to meat,
                        and will come forth and serve them." Luke 12:37. Think of
                        Jesus serving us as He served the disciples of old! When
                        rightly understood, the Communion service speaks more clearly
                        to our understanding than does any other worship experience.
 THINK IT THROUGH         When I partake of the Communion, do I really com-
                        mune with my Lord?

       John 13:7, 8
                         The Communion service has been given to the church to
                      develop our faith in God and a deeper fellowship with one
                      another.
                         "Looking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully com-
                      prehend the magnitude and meaning of the sacrifice made by
                      the Majesty of heaven. The plan of salvation is glorified be-
                      fore us, and the thought of Calvary awakens living and sacred
                      emotions in our hearts. Praise to God and the Lamb will be
                      in our hearts and on our lips; for pride and self-worship
                      cannot flourish in the soul that keeps fresh in memory the
                      scenes of Calvary.
                         "He who beholds the Saviour's matchless love will be ele-
                      vated in thought, purified in heart, transformed in character."
                       —The Desire of Ages, page 661.

                          How did Paul say we should keep the feast? 1 Cor.
                       5:8.


                          The preparatory service, "the lesser baptism," was given us
                       by Christ to wash away "the leaven of malice and wicked-
                       ness." That is why fermented wine and bread made with
                       leaven are out of place as symbols of Christ's body. Fermenta-
                       tion is the symbol of sin and death, and there was nothing in
                       Christ deserving of death. He was a "Lamb without spot and
                       without blemish." Therefore, in celebrating this memorial of
                       our Lord's suffering, we should use unleavened bread and un-
                       fermented wine.

                          How did the apostle Paul describe the cup and the
                       bread? 1 Cor. 10:16.

  THINK IT THROUGH        Do I regard it as a privilege to serve a fellow member
                       of Christ's body? Do I sense that to serve another in the
                       place of Christ is not humiliation but exaltation?

                        reverence and respect for the sacred service of God."—Ibid.

                            What did Jesus say the disciples ought to do for one
                         another? John 13:13-16.



                            While this ordinance, like baptism by immersion, began to
                         fall into disuse with the growth of apostasy, yet it never com-
                         pletely disappeared. Ambrose, bishop of Milan, one of the
                         strong leaders of the fourth century, taught that Christ's com-
                         mand concerning this ordinance was literal. The Celtic churches
                         of ancient Britain as well as the churches in Gaul continued
                         to practice feet washing, which was frequently called "the
                         lesser baptism."
                            Bernard of Clairvaux, one of the outstanding leaders of
                         the medieval church, says, "Feet washing is a cleansing of those
                         daily offenses which seem inevitable for those who walk in
                         the dust of the world."—International Standard Bible Ency-

 THINK IT THROUGH          When I meet at the Lord's table, have all feelings of
                         envy, jealousy, and pride been washed from my life?

         Gal. 5:1, 13
                           In carrying out our Lord's command in this "ordinance of
                        service," plans should be laid to make it a truly worshipful
                        experience. Just as our Lord came "not to be ministered unto,
                        but to minister," having left us an example that we should
                        follow His steps, so we should gladly serve one another, re-
                        membering that in so doing we are following "His steps."
                        1 Peter 2:21. To do service for a king is an honor. To serve
                        in the place of a king is exaltation.
                            "The only greatness is the greatness of humility. The only

                            Feet washing is not an "ordinance of humiliation" as some
                         have wrongly expressed it, but rather an "ordinance of service."
                            "This ordinance is to encourage humility, but it should
                         never be termed humiliating, in the sense of being degrading

                         who follow His example? John 13:17.


                            "His disciples, in performing the same rite, pledged them-

                         ordinance is rightly celebrated, the children of God are brought
                         into a holy relationship, to help and bless each other. They
                         covenant that the life shall be given to unselfish ministry."

      Rev. 19:1, 5, 6 for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth."

                          No other passage in all of Scripture is more sublime than
                       these verses in the Revelation. This is the climax of all wor-
                       ship offered by human beings to the Eternal God. All such
                       songs are based on the victorious redemption provided by
                       Christ Jesus. Compare Rev. 5:9. From the day of Adam's
                       disobedience down through all the tragic centuries of history,
                       man has been a wanderer from God.

                       the Bible? And what was the reply? Gen. 3:9, 10.



                         What has been God's constant invitation since the

       THE ANGELS thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto
       Rev. 7:11, 12 our God forever and ever. Amen."

                          The angels of God love to sing His praises, to declare His
                       power, and to prostrate themselves before Him in adoration.
                       And someday, if faithful, we too will join with the angelic
                       choir. If we would voice our praise then, we must begin now.
                       When the angels offer their worship, they use the word
                       "amen," which means "so let it be," or "we want it so." Can
                       we say "amen" to everything God permits to come into our
                       lives?
                          To say "amen" while being flogged for Christ's sake; to say
                       "amen" when being dispossessed of all that life holds dear; to
                       say "amen" when we lose our employment for Christ's sake;
                       to say "amen" when loved ones turn upon us in ridicule, even
                       influencing others to reject us—this is not easy. But as the
                       hymn writer says: "It is the way the Master went. Should
                       not His servants tread it still?"

                          How did the apostle Paul express his confidence in
                       the outworking of God's plan for those who love the
                       Lord? Rom. 8:28.




                          After having been stoned and having nearly lost
                       his life, how did Paul react? Acts 14:22.




                         What did he say to the Romans about tribulation?
                       Rom. 5:3.

                       hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out of every
          Rev. 5:8, 9 kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."

                           Nothing is more sublime than the worship offered by these
                        elders as they voice the praise of the redeemed.

                           Where are they situated? Rev. 4:4.


                          These that take their place around the throne are associated
                        with Christ in His work of ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
                        They are twenty-four in number, corresponding with the
                        twenty-four courses of priests in ancient Israel.

                          What is the theme of the twenty-four elders' song?
                        Rev. 5:9.


                           This chorus of redemption is followed by the angels' chorus,
                        which is a sevenfold doxology. Then the whole creation sings
                        the praises of the victorious Lamb.
                           Another description of this praise session is found in Rev.
                        7:9-12. Here the redeemed, "a great multitude, which no man
                        could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
                        tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
                        with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a
                        loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon
                        the throne, and unto the Lamb." Verses 9, 10.

                           Who joined in this song? What did they say? Rev.
                        7:11, 12.


 THINK IT THROUGH          Can I join with the elders in their song of praise for
                        redemption?


  "It is the great victory in suffering    by right of purchase, mankind as His
and death which inspires the song, and     own; and the price was His blood. It
makes them sing, 'Thou art worthy';        is well to notice the harmony between

   Luke 15:20,22,24 was lost, and is found."

                           The Bible is primarily the record of the movements of God
                        in human history. It is clearly demonstrated that He is seeking
                        us. When one learns of God's attitude toward him, it leads to
                        a change in his attitude toward God.

                           How did the apostle John express this? 1 John 4:19.



                           Love demands expression. The psalmist said: "Let the re-
                        deemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed from
                        the hand of the enemy." "0 give thanks unto the Lord, for
                        He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever." Ps. 107:2, 1.
                           We express our love to God in our worship. How different
                        the world appears when viewed through the eyes of those who
                        understand the moral nature of God! We then can take the
                        long view of history. No longer do we see the universe, or the
                        myriad universes, as a great impersonal system chained by the
                        laws of astronomy, biology, geology, and anthropology. Instead
                        we see creation as the handiwork of a personal God, who loves
                        us and has redeemed us by great sacrifice.

                            What did Paul say about the creation? Rom. 8:22.

              Part 5      "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath
        GOD'S SELF- created these things, that bringeth out their host by num-
      REVELATION IN ber: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of
        CHRIST AND His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth."
         CREATION
          Isa. 40:26     The whole universe reveals the Creator. Whether we study
                     astronomy or theology, the science of the stars or the scieiice
                     of salvation, we are led to worship Him who is "before all
                     things" and by whom "all things consist" for we realize that
                     "in Him we live, and move, and have our being."
                         There is much neglect of public worship today in some
                     circles, the reason being, in the words of Dr. John Kennedy:
                     "Men have in their minds antiquated conceptions of God.
                     . . . They have had in their childhood some rudimentary reli-
                     gious instruction. The God they were taught to believe in was
                     a child's God, and they have never advanced in religion beyond
                     the teachings of their childhood. . . .
                         "A man would think shame of himself if in other fields of
                     knowledge he did not advance beyond the conceptions of his
                     childhood. Yet some men . . . are still in the religious nursery
                     with infant pictures on its walls."—The God Whom We Ignore,
                     pages 156, 157.
                         No generation before us in all history has had such scientific
                     evidence of God's power.

                            How does the apostle Paul say that men can under-
                         stand the invisible things of God? Rom. 1:20.



                            The words "His eternal power and Godhead" are deeply
                         significant. There is abundant evidence to convince anyone,
                         even the unbeliever, that God exists. Through the prophet
                         Isaiah God says, "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who
                         hath created these things." Isa. 40:26. These mighty constella-
                         tions did not come into existence by a mere inanimate force.
                         They were created by a personal God.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Is mine only a childish comprehension of God? Or
                         do I encourage thoughts of God's greatness, His majesty,
                         and His eternal love?



   "God is the foundation of every-         tion. Ignorance may seek to support
thing. All true science is in harmony       false views of God by appeals to sci-
with His works; all true education leads    ence, but the book of nature and the

Worship in Eternity    LESSON 13                                        ❑ Friday
                                                                         March 24
           Part 6     "And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make
  WORSHIP IN THE all things new. And He said unto me, Write: for these
 EARTH MADE NEW words are true and faithful. . I am Alpha and Omega,
                   the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is
      Rev. 21:5, 6 athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."

                          In order to be partakers of all that God has in store
                       for His people, what must we be? Rev. 21:7.



                          How did Paul regard the sufferings of this present life
                       as compared with what awaits the overcomer? Rom. 8:18.



                          How does John describe the worship of those who are
                       victorious over the world? Rev. 15:2.


                         The people in this victorious group are not just standing in
                       mute adoration of the glories of God. They are singing.

                          What is the theme of their song? Rev. 15:3.



                          What a paean of praise will ascend to God when the re-
                       deemed of all the ages meet together to sing the song of Moses
                       and the Lamb! The angels of God cannot join in this song,
                       for they have never experienced the slavery of sin and the joy
                       of deliverance. All God's creatures worship Him, but the wor-
                       ship of redeemed men throughout eternal ages will be differ-
                       ent.
 THINK IT THROUGH        As I have reseen God in the experience of study and
                       worship, have I been remade by the Holy Spirit?


   "The more men learn of God, the          "The entire universe is clean. One
greater will be their admiration of His pulse of harmony and gladness beats

              Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
                    South American Division
   In behalf of more than a quarter of a million Sabbath School
members in the South American Division, I wish to express our
gratitude for the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering Overflow in the
second quarter of 1969. It represented more than $100,000. It pro-
vided funds for new dormitory space on the campus of our Theo-
logical Training College in Chile; dormitory provisions at the
Espirito Santo Academy in Brazil; and benefits for our Northeast
Brazil College.
   Again this quarter, we plan to provide additional facilities:
   1. New dining room, Uruguay Academy.
   2. Completion of Loma Linda Sanitarium, Argentina.
   3. New girls' dormitory, Ecuador Academy.
   In some of our dormitories there are five and six students in one
small room. Many times the need for space is so great that worthy
students are unable to find a place in our institutions. South Amer-
ica has 125,000 young people, only 25,000 of whom are in Adventist
schools.
   This is the golden hour to channel every youthful talent into the
mold of Christian education. Your liberality will make it possible
to open the door for many of our boys and girls who have been
denied an opportunity of Christian education for lack of facilities.
