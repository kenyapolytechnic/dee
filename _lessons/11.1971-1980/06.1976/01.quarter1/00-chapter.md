SALISBURY.
               Dear Fellow Sabbath School Members,
RHODESIA.

TELE%          Inyazura Secondary School.   For many years our Inyazura Secondary
R H 4 I 2 7    School in the Zambesi Union has trained scores of African youth to
               become not only faithful Seventh-day Adventists, but also prepared
               them to enter Solusi College to be trained as denominational work-
               ers.   With an enrolment of over 430 students the present facilities
               are splitting at the seams,   More and more girls are seeking to
               enrol, and the limited dormitory space must be expanded.

               The importance of training the hand as well as the head is receiving
               renewed emphasis, and a new domestic science building for the girls
               and expanded provision for teaching industrial arts to the boys is
               a necessity for this phase of the teaching program to play its vital
               role.   Last but not least, the facilities for the teaching of scient
               require upgrading, if this school is to maintain the standard of edu.
               cation expected of it.

               Church Buildings, African Homelands.   In the interesting territory .
               the Southern Union we find that in the African homelands, now in the
               process of development, over fifty-five new towns and cities are beit
               constructed.   Over one hundred towns and cities remain to be built!
               In the nine homelands embracing all these towns and cities, a capita
               city is to be built for each one of these African states-in-the-
               making.

               Now is the golden day of opportunity, while building lots are availat
               to drive down our stakes, and erect a church and African pastor's hol
               as a center to shepherd the flock and for evangelism in each of thee:

               We thank you in anticipation in the name of our Lord and Saviour for
               your contribution toward the solution of our need.

                                                                  (Signed)
                   DAYBREAK SERIES FOR 1976
    This issue of the Adult Lessons begins the second year of the Daybreak Series.
This series is a development of the primary principles which emerge from the
three angels' messages of Revelation 14. Note that the series is not intended to
be a study of Revelation 14 directly.
    It may be helpful in studying the lessons to have some idea of how they fit
into the series. Thus an explanation is given in the following paragraphs of how
each quarter's lessons during 1976 relate to the curriculum plan.
    The second angel's message announces Babylon's fall which results from
making all nations drink of her wine. This wine represents the teachings of
Babylon that are in opposition to the everlasting gospel given by the first angel.
The third message warns against worship of the beast or his image. This worship
is in opposition to the worship of the Creator called for by the first angel. Thus
the second and third messages present opposition to the gospel and the worship
of the Creator. The three messages are given in the time of judgment and do
not reach their complete fulfillment until the coming of Jesus.
    But the opposition of Babylon and the beast to God's message and worship
 did not begin with the sounding of the three messages. Babylon and the beast
 reach back into history and are subjects of prophecy. Thus a study of the prin-
 ciples that underlie the actions of Babylon and the beast, as these are revealed
 in the Bible, can aid us in understanding better the nature of the last day conflict
 summarized in the second and third angels' messages. To accomplish this pur-
 pose we will, during this quarter, identify the principles of rebellion and trace
 these principles from the rebellion in heaven to the empires of earth; and we
 will study the prophecies of apostasy within the church.
     Next quarter we will return to the area of the curriculum plan relating to the'
 revelation of the everlasting gospel by the first angel and study the ways God
 reveals Himself to man.
     The third quarter will bring us to the area of the curriculum plan emerging
 from the call of the first angel to fear God. To fear God is to fear to sin. This
 area includes God's hatred of sin and the separation from God that has resulted
 from disobedience. This will be approached through a study of the book of
 Hebrews, where Jesus is seen as the mediator between God and His estranged
 children.
     In the fourth quarter the call to worship God will be made more meaningful
  by a study of worship in all the Bible.
     If you find this explanation helpful, you may wish to preserve it during 1976,
  as this overview will not be repeated this year.

            LOVE CHALLENGED AND VINDICATED
                                   Introduction
     One does not live very long before one senses that something is wrong, very
wrong with the world. The dead mockingbird on the sidewalk, the pet dog flung
to the side of the road by a speeding automobile, the thorn on the stem support-
ing a beautiful flower—these are matters that raise questions in the young open-
ing mind. The shadows and the highlights grow more distinct and sharp as one
matures. The human predicament seems mysterious. There seems to be an
eternal conflict between happiness and sorrow, between good and evil. Indeed,
to many, life seems absurd and senseless.
     But in the Bible the veil is drawn aside, and meaning and purpose are given
to human experience. The Scriptures begin with a revelation of God, the Creator
of all that is good. Man is not the result of mere chance. Rather, he was created
in the image of God by One who had beneficent plans and purposes for His
creation.
     The Scriptures disclose the fact that the marring of the universe has come
about by the insurrection of one of the highest intelligent beings close to the
throne of God.
     What we witness in the earth, behind all the interaction of mankind, is a moral
 conflict between God and the principles of righteousness on the one hand, and
Satan and the principles of unrighteousness on the other. God's will, expressed
 in His law, is based on a two-fold principle of love (supreme love to God, and
 impartial love to one's fellow beings). Satan's will, the fallen creature's will, is
 based on the principle of selfishness. Self is god; others are exploited for the
 benefit of selfish interests.
     These two principles—love and selfishness—have been in conflict since the
 original rebellion and the later fall of Adam and Eve.
     In our lessons this quarter we shall focus on the moral controversy which
 lies beneath the apparent surface of human existence. We shall begin with a
 study of God our Creator, for He is the moral Governor of our universe, and all
 creation is subject to His laws, both physical and moral.
     We shall then briefly survey the origin of evil and analyze the issues raised
 by Lucifer. In subsequent lessons we shall follow the controversy by means of
 Bible prophecies, especially those of Daniel. Through the prophecies God en-
 courages His people with regard to the outcome of the conflict.
     We shall see the outworking of the divine and satanic principles in the lives
 of individuals and kingdoms. We shall see how Satan has carried on the same
 controversy through the organized ecclesiastical apostasy foretold by the
  prophets. We shall note that the conflict is also being fought within the ranks
  of Christian groups where genuine truth is taught. Every human mind is affected
  by this conflict. We shall see how the plan of salvation is the answer to the
  problem of sin and is capable of bringing every penitent sinner into full har-
 mony with the Creator.
     Finally, we shall study how God will resolve the issues in this great moral
  controversy in heaven and earth and will bring an end to the conflict with the
  full approval of intelligent beings—both those who were loyal to Him and those
  who rebelled. God will be vindicated; Satan, and all who adhere to his prin-
  ciples, will be condemned and destroyed. "The world is not without a ruler.
  The program of coming events is in the hands of the Lord. The Majesty of
  heaven has the destiny of nations, as well as the concerns of His church, in
  His own charge."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 753.

           into our world; but when God is rejected,

                   eign in the universe is central to Christian faith. Only God can
                   give meaning and direction to human existence. In a knowl-
                   edge of God the Christian finds the true nature of his origins
                   and the plan and purpose of life.
                      What testimony does the natural world give to the exis-
                   tence of God? Acts 14:15-17; Rom. 1:20; Ps. 19:1.

                      "Upon all created things is seen the impress of the Deity.
                   Nature testifies of God. The susceptible mind, brought in con-
                   tact with the miracle and mystery of the universe, cannot but
                   recognize the working of infinite power."—Education, p. 99.
                      Who has made the fullest disclosure of the character and
                   existence of God? John 1:18; 14:8, 9.

                      "God saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed
                   to portray both His personality and His character. He sent His
                   Son into the world to manifest, so far as could be endured by
                   human sight, the nature and the attributes of the invisible
                   God."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 419.
                      Nature is blighted by sin; only a few of the human race
                   observed the Saviour. What, then, provides the Christian his
                   only trustworthy source for learning about God and the divine
                   purpose? Heb. 1:1, 2; 2 Tim. 3:15-17.

                       "God has given in the Scriptures sufficient evidence of their
                   divine authority. His own existence, His character, the truth-
                   fulness of His word, are established by testimony that appeals
                   to our reason; and this testimony is abundant."—Education,
                   p. 169.

THINK IT THROUGH     What meaning would life hold for me if there were no
                   God?
                       "The real evidence of a living God is not merely in theory;
                   it is in the conviction that God has written in our hearts, illu-
                   minated and explained by His word. It is in the living power
                   in His created works, seen by the eye which the Holy Spirit
                   has enlightened."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 325.

         Part 2      What two truths about the Deity did Jesus teach?
  THREE IN ONE        "And Jesus answered him, The first of all the command-
                  ments is, Hear, 0 Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord" (Mark
                  12:29).
                      "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
                  the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"
                  (Matt. 28:19).
                     The paradox of a triune monotheism (Trinity) is not ex-
                  plained in the Scriptures. It is, however, a truth that is vital to
                  the understanding of the plan of salvation.
                     "The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out
                  in conjectures regarding the nature of God; but the effort will
                  be fruitless. This problem has not been given us to solve. . . .
                  Here silence is eloquence. The Omniscient One is above dis-
                  cussion....
                      "We are as ignorant of God as little children, but as little
                  children we may love and obey Him."—Testimonies, vol. 8,
                  p. 279.
                      How is God the Father described? How are we to address
                  Him? 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Matt. 6:9.
                     "All that man needs to know or can know of God has been
                  revealed in the life and character of His Son."—Testimonies,
                  vol. 8, p. 286.
                      Upon occasion what claims and acknowledgments did
                  Jesus make and accept? John 8:58; 10:30; 20:28.
                    "Christ was God essentially, and in the highest sense. He
                 was with God from eternity, God over all, blessed forever-
                 more."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, April 5, 1906.
                     What other divine Person belongs to the Godhead? Matt.
                 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14.
                    "The nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery. Men cannot
                 explain it, because the Lord has not revealed it to them. . . .
                 Regarding such mysteries, which are too deep for human un-
                 derstanding, silence is golden."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                 p. 52.
THINK IT THROUGH     What application to daily living are Christians to make
                 from the Bible's teaching about the triune God? John 17:21,
                 22. In what areas of life ought I to make this application?
                     "There are three living powers of the heavenly trio; in the
                 name of these three great powers—the Father, the Son, and
                 the Holy Spirit—those who receive Christ by living faith are
                 baptized, and these powers will co-operate with the obedient
                 subjects of heaven in their efforts to live the new life in Christ."

          Part 3 "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou
 HIS GREATNESS hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting
                    to everlasting, thou art God" (Ps. 90:2).
                       The Scriptures reveal five characteristics of the divine na-
                   ture.
                       What aspects of the nature of Deity are indicated in each
                   of the following passages?
                      1. Ps. ,90:2 (see text above).
                       2. Rev. 19:6.
                      3. Jer. 23:23, 24.
                      4. Isa. 46:9, 10.
                      5. Mal. 3:6.
                       "Let no one venture to explain God. Human beings cannot
                   explain themselves, and how, then, dare they venture to explain
                   the Omniscient One? ...
                      "God always has been. He is the great I AM. . . . He is the
                   high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity. . . . With Him there
                   is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. . . . He is infinite
                   and omnipresent. No words of ours can describe His greatness
                   and majesty."—Medical Ministry, p. 92.
                     What significance do these aspects of our God have for us
                   who love Him?
                      1. Eternity (everlasting) Ps. 36:9; cf. John 17:2.
                      2. Omnipotent (all-powerful) Isa. 40:26-31.
                      3. Omnipresence (everywhere present) Heb. 13:5, 6.
                      4. Omniscience (all-knowing) Ps. 139:1-6.
                      5. Immutability (unchanging) Isa. 40:8.
                      "I know not where His islands lift
                          Their fronded palms in air;

                      "He that ruleth in the heavens is the one who sees the end
                   from the beginning—the one before whom the mysteries of
                   the past and the future are alike outspread, and who, beyond
                   the woe and darkness and ruin that sin has wrought, beholds
                   the accomplishment of His own purposes of love and blessing.

The God Who Is There LESSON 1                                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   December 31

         Part 4  What does the apostle declare the fundamental aspect of
 A GOD OF LOVE God's character to be?
                      "And we have known and believed the love that God hath
                   to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
                   God, and God in him" (1 John 4:16).
                      The English word, "love," is not so meaningful to us because
                   of its wide range of use. The Greek language employs four
                   main words to describe "love." The New Testament uses only
                   two. The word in our text is agape, the most common New Tes-
                   tament word for love.
                      The agape kind of love is not a superficial emotion, but a
                   principal attitude of the mind. It is outgoing, and always seeks
                   the highest good of the person loved, whether that person be
                   good or evil. See Matt. 5:44-48.
                      In what forms is the divine attribute of love revealed be-
                   fore the universe? Ex. 33:19. See also 34:5-7.
                      Mercy, graciousness, long-suffering are different expressions
                   of the quality of love. Chesed, the Hebrew equivalent of agap6
                   (here translated "goodness") denotes steadfast love,' selfless
                   kindness, favor, mercy.
                      The divine attribute of love ever seeks the highest good of
                   each intelligent being. That highest good may require discipline,
                   but such action will not be vindictive. It will be in the best
                   interests of the creature and the creation.
                       "God's love has been expressed in His justice no less than
                   in His mercy. Justice is the foundation of His throne, and the
                   fruit of His love."—The Desire of Ages, p. 762.
                     In what act did the Godhead disclose the depths and the
                   quality of divine love? 1 John 4:10.
                       "All the paternal love which has come down from generation
                   to generation through the channel of human hearts, all the
                   springs of tenderness which have opened in the souls of men,
                   are but as a tiny rill to the boundless ocean when compared
                   with the infinite, exhaustless love of God."—Testimonies, vol.
                   5, p. 740.
THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it important to Christian experience (in daily life
                   or crisis) to have a correct understanding of God's character?
                      "In order to endure the trial before them, they [command-
                   ment keepers] must understand the will of God as revealed in
                   His word; they can honor Him only as they have a right con-
                   ception of His character, government, and purposes, and act
                   in accordance with them."—The Great Controversy, p. 593.

The God Who Is There LESSON 1                                        ❑ Thursday
                                                                       January 1

          Part 5   "I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne. . . . Above it
     A HOLY GOD stood the seraphims. . . . And one cried unto another, and
                   said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is
                   full of his glory" (Isa. 6:1-3).

                      "Holiness is the foundation of God's throne; sin is the op-
                   posite of holiness; sin crucified the Son of God."—Testimonies
                   to Ministers, p. 145. "The crowning glory of Christ's attributes
                   is His holiness. . . . He is declared to be glorious in His holi-
                   ness. Study the character of God."—Counsels to Parents,
                   Teachers, and Students, p. 402.
                      The term "holiness" by which God is described refers to
                   His moral excellence. He is free from moral evil. His character
                   is absolute perfection, infinite purity. Because God is holy, His
                   word is truth. His dealings with the universe are righteous.
                   Because God is holy, He is the source and standard of the
                   right. His will, as expressed in His law, is "holy, and just, and
                   good" (Rom. 7:12). Justice is God's holiness expressing His
                   hatred of sin and His judgment upon it.
                      What effect did an understanding of God's holy character
                   have on Isaiah? Isa. 6:1-8.

                       "The contrast between the feeble praise which he had been
                   accustomed to bestow upon the Creator and the fervid praises
                   of the seraphim, astonished and humiliated the prophet. He
                   had for the time being the sublime privilege of appreciating
                   the spotless purity of Jehovah's exalted character. . . .
                       "In the light of this matchless radiance that made manifest
                   all he could bear in the revelation of the divine character, his
                   own inward defilement stood out before him with startling clear-
                   ness. His very words seemed vile to him."—Ellen G. White
                   Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1140.
                      What standard has God set for His children? 1 Peter
                   1:15, 16.

THINK IT THROUGH      How would a disclosure of God such as Isaiah experienced
                   affect me? Ponder the question asked in Isaiah 33:14. Read
                   verses 15-17.

                       "That which our people must have interwoven with their life
                   and character is the unfolding of the plan of redemption and
                   more elevated conceptions of God and His holiness, brought
                   into the life. The washing of the robes of character in the blood
                   of the Lamb is a work that we must attend to earnestly while
                   every defect of character is to be put away."—Counsels to

SOURCE OF LIFE the origin of the earth and of humanity?

                 17:28.
                    "From Him all life proceeds. Only in harmony with Him can

                 to place one's self out of harmony with the universe, to intro-

                     What kind of response should every intelligent being make
                 to his Creator? See Rev. 7:11; 14:7 (last part).
                    "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is
                 the Creator."—The Great Controversy, p. 436.
                    "'The true ground of divine worship ... is found in the dis-
                 tinction between the Creator and His creatures. This great fact
                 can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.'—
                 J. N. Andrews, History of the Sabbath, chapter 27." (Quoted in
                 The Great Controversy, pp. 437, 438.)
                    When an intelligent being acknowledges God as the Creator
                 of all things and the Sustainer of life, he immediately recognizes
                 that he owes to Him his full allegiance, love, and obedience.
                 He is not his own, but is dependent upon the gracious care of
                 his Maker. He recognizes that he is accountable to God for the
                 use of all his powers and possessions.
THINK IT THROUGH     Some think man evolved from animal ancestry. The Bible
                 depicts life as originating by the creative action of God. How
                 does my personal conviction about ,the origin of human life
                 affect my daily thought and conduct?
                    "By the first angel, men are called upon to 'fear God, and
                 give glory to Him' and to worship Him as the Creator of the
                 heavens and the earth. In order to do this, they must obey His
                 law. Says the wise man: 'Fear God, and keep His command-
                 ments: for this is the whole duty of man.' Ecclesiastes 12:13.
                 Without obedience to His commandments no worship can be
                 pleasing to God."—The Great Controversy, p. 436.

    SALVATION
                      What is this "mystery" or "hidden wisdom" of which Paul
                   speaks? See Eph. 6:19. When did the Godhead devise it?

                      "The salvation of the human race has ever been the object
                   of the councils of heaven. The covenant of mercy was made
                   before the foundation of the world. It has existed from all eter-
                   nity, and is called the everlasting covenant. So surely as there
                   never was a time when God was not, so surely there never was
                   a moment when it was not the delight of the eternal mind to
                   manifest His grace to humanity."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                   SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 934.
                      Sometime in eternity before the creation of this earth the
                   Godhead laid the plan of salvation. It was a costly plan that
                   was devised to meet the contingency of rebellion. The divine
                   prescription to meet the moral disease of sin, which one day
                   would convulse the universe, was locked in the heart of infinite
                   love to be "kept secret for long ages." Rom. 16:25, RSV.

                      What did the Godhead purpose to give mankind if the
                   race sinned? 2 Tim. 1:9, 10.

                      Grace is God's unlimited, all-inclusive, transforming love
                   toward sinful men and women—His attitude of compassion and
                   mercy toward us who are undeserving sinners. The term is also
                   used in the sense of God's power to save a sinner from sin.
                      "We ourselves owe everything to God's free grace. Grace in
                   the covenant ordained our adoption. Grace in the Saviour ef-
                   fected our redemption, our regeneration, and our exaltation to
                   heirship with Christ. Let this grace be revealed to others."—

THINK IT THROUGH      As a Christian why do I wish the gospel plan to be suc-
                   cessful?

                       "Those who think of the result of hastening or hindering the
                   gospel think of it in relation to themselves and to the world.
                   Few think of its relation to God. Few give thought to the suffer-
                   ing that sin has caused our Creator. All heaven suffered in
                   Christ's agony; but that suffering did not begin or end with His
                   manifestation in humanity. The cross is a revelation to our dull
                   senses of the pain that, from its very inception, sin has brought
                   to the heart of God."—Education, p. 263.

 FOREORDAINED    "Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
                   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain con-
                   versation . . . ; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a
                   lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was fore-
                   ordained before the foundation of the world" (1 Peter 1:18-20).
                      "The throne of God must not bear one stain of crime, one
                   taint of sin. In the councils of heaven, before the world was
                   created, the Father and the Son covenanted together that if
                   man proved disloyal to God, Christ, one with the Father, would
                   take the place of the transgressor, and suffer the penalty of
                   justice that must fall upon him."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                   SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1070.
                     How does Peter indicate that Christ's death did not hap-
                   pen. by mere chance or malice? Acts 2:23.
                      Neither Roman nor Jew was forced to crucify the Saviour,
                   but, through the choices they made, both the nature of sin and
                   the character of God were revealed.
                      What did the central provision of a substitute require of
                   God the Son in order to accomplish the atoning death? Phil.
                   2:5-7. See also John 1:14 (first part).
                      In taking human nature Christ took Adam's place and thereby
                   became the Head of the race.
                      "The reconciliation of man to God could be accomplished
                   only through a mediator who was equal with God, possessed
                   of attributes that would dignify, and declare him worthy to treat
                   with the Infinite God in man's behalf, and also represent God
                   to a fallen world. Man's substitute and surety must have man's
                   nature, a connection with the human family whom he was to
                   represent, and, as God's ambassador, he must partake of the
                   divine nature, have a connection with the Infinite, in order to
                   manifest God to the world, and be a mediator between God
                   and man."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, December 22,

          Part 3   "Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and
     LIFE ONLY from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to
                 whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory
     IN CHRIST of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the
                   hope of glory" (Col. 1:26, 27).
                      The experience described by the phrase "Christ in you"
                   (see also Gal. 2:20) is accomplished by the indwelling pres-
                   ence of the Holy Spirit in the believer. Thus the human will is
                   submissive to Christ's will, and the life reflective of His attri-
                   butes. Christ, through His Spirit, lives on earth again in the per-
                   son of His child.
                      Since the sinful human will is not submissive to God, and
                   the sinner's character reflects instead the attributes of Satan,
                   the passage in Colossians 1:26, 27 hints at the provision the
                   Godhead made to break the power of sin in the life and to
                   transform the character.
                      What is the divine provision to break the controlling power
                   of sin in the life? John 14:16-18.
                       There are two aspects of sin in human existence that the
                   plan was designed to meet. First, the penalty for sin would be
                   met by our divine-human Substitute, Jesus Christ, by His aton-
                   ing death. Second, the power of sin in the life would be broken
                   by the indwelling Christ through the medium of the Holy Spirit.
                       "The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and
                   without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail.
                   . . . Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the
                   mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would
                   come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine
                   power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been
                   wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that
                   the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes
                   a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as
                   a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated ten-
                   dencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His
                   church."—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.
                      What traits will the Holy Spirit be able to develop in the
                   person who is under His control? Gal. 5:22, 23.
                       "The Spirit that reveals, also works in him the fruits of righ-
                   teousness. . . . What is the character of the fruit borne?— The
                   fruit of the Spirit is 'love,' not hatred; 'joy,' not discontent and
                   mourning; 'peace,' not irritation, anxiety, and manufactured

        Part 4    What ultimate future did the Godhead agree to give those
     DESTINIES penitent sinners who would accept the plan?
   DETERMINED    "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, prom-
                   ised before the world began" (Titus 1:2).
                      "In Him [Christ] was life, original, unborrowed, underived.
                   This life is not inherent in man. He can possess it only through
                   Christ. He cannot earn it; it is given him as a free gift if he
                   will believe in Christ as his personal Saviour. . . . This is the
                   open fountain of life for the world."—Selected Messages, bk. 1,
                   pp. 296, 297.
                      What also did the Godhead agree to prepare for the re-
                   deemed? Matt. 25:34.
                      The text reads literally in the original, "Inherit the has-been-
                   prepared-for-you kingdom from the foundation of world." The
                   Greek tense denotes a completed action. Yet the verse points

                   sioned the restored earth before the original earth was created!
                      "Human language is inadequate to describe the reward of
                   the righteous....
                      "There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and beside
                   them waving trees. . . . There the wide-spreading plains swell
                   into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God rear their lofty
                   summits. On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams,
                   God's people, so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a
                   home."—The Great Controversy, p. 675.
                      What ultimate destiny did the Godhead also determine
                   for Satan, his angels, and followers? Matt. 25:41.
                     The Greek tense of the verb "prepared" is the same as in
                   verse 34 and relates back to the same time and councils.
THINK IT THROUGH      What insight into God's character have you gained in
                   knowing that the ultimate destinies of righteousness and re-
                   bellion were determined in eternity?
                       "A life of rebellion against God has unfitted them [those who
                   follow Satan] for heaven. Its purity, holiness, and peace would
                   be torture to them; the glory of God would be a consuming
                   fire. They would long to flee from that holy place. They would
                   welcome destruction, that they might be hidden from the face
                   of Him who died to redeem them. The destiny of the wicked
                   is fixed by their own choice. Their exclusion from heaven is
                   voluntary with themselves, and just and merciful on the part
                   of God....
                       "It is in mercy to the universe that God will finally destroy
                   the rejecters of His grace."—The Great Controversy, p. 543.

           Part 5   What did the Godhead intend for the intelligent universe
     THE PLAN IN to see as the plan became operative in the earth?
      OPERATION     "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers
                   in heavenly places might be known by the church the mani-
                   fold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which
                   he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Eph. 3:10, 11).

                      God foresaw the origin of evil and the outbreak of rebellion.
                   He knew He would be challenged by intelligent beings created
                   by Him. Divine motives, commands, and sovereignty would be
                   questioned. The plan was, therefore, so devised by Infinite
                   Wisdom that its operation would disclose to the universe the
                   many facets of the divine character and purposes.
                      God intends that His church on earth should be a demonstra-
                   tion, in embryo as it were, of the final fulfillment of His eternal
                   purposes for the universe. To fallen and unfallen intelligences
                   alike the church is to show forth the wisdom of the perfect
                   principles on which the divine government rests.

                     What heavenly beings does the apostle Peter describe as
                   desiring to understand the plan of salvation? 1 Peter 1:10-12.

                       "The plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper pur-
                   pose than the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that
                   Christ came to the earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants
                   of this little world might regard the law of God as it should be
                   regarded; but it was to vindicate the character of God before
                   the universe."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 68.

THINK IT THROUGH     What kind of witness to God's grace do I present to a
                   watching universe in my daily life? in times of crisis?

                       "The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts
                   through the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is
                   effecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with all his
                   triumphant boasting, with all his confederacy of evil united
                   against God and the laws of His government, stands viewing
                   them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delu-
                   sions. They are to him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels
                   of God, seraphim and cherubim, the powers commissioned to
                   cooperate with human agencies, look on with astonishment
                   and joy, that fallen men, once children of wrath, are through

         Part 6   What was the ultimate goal to be achieved by the plan of
        DIVINE salvation?
    OBJECTIVES    "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foun-
                 dation of the world, that we should be holy and without
                 blame before him in love... .

                 gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are
                 in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him" (Eph. 1:4, 10).
                     The emergence of sin would bring disharmony into the
                 peaceful universe of holy beings. Rebellion would cause divi-
                 sion. To be successful the plan would have to heal a terrible
                 rupture. To restore harmony it would have to meet four basic
                 objectives:
                     1. To vindicate the character, law, and government of God
                         all of which had been challenged.
                     2. To secure the loyalty of intelligent beings who had not
                         joined the renellion but who would be confused by it.
                     3. To effect the salvation of all repentant members of the
                         rebelling human family.
                     4. To destroy Satan, the other fallen angels, and impenitent
                         man; and to erase the effects of sin.
                     In the final executive phase of the judgment, what will
                 both the loyal and disloyal confess? Rom. 14:10-12.
                     Notice these striking statements from The Great Controversy:
                     "The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of

                     "With all the facts of the great controversy in view, the
                  whole universe, both loyal and rebellious, with one accord
                  declare: 'Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints.' "

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my present religious experience a drudgery or a delight?
                  What can I do to make it harmonious with His will?
                      "This earth is the place of preparation for heaven. The time
                  spent here is the Christian's winter. Here the chilly winds of
                  affliction blow upon us, and the waves of trouble roll against
                  us. But in the near future, when Christ comes, sorrow and
                  sighing will be forever ended. Then will be the Christian's sum-

                   are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they
                   are without excuse" (Rom. 1:20).
                      "His invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity,
                   has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made"
                   (RSV).
                      See also Ps. 19:1.
                       "Why did not our heavenly Father carpet the earth with
                   brown or gray? He chose the color that was most restful, the
                   most acceptable to the senses. . . . Without this covering the
                   air would be filled with dust, and the earth would appear like
                   a desert. Every spire of grass, every opening bud and blooming
                   flower is a token of God's love, and should teach us a lesson
                   of faith and trust in Him."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 75.
                      Although the Godhead cooperated in the creation of the
                   universe, who was the active agent? Heb. 1:1, 2; John 1:1-3,
                   10, 14.
                       "The hand that sustains the worlds in space, the hand that
                   holds in their orderly arrangement and tireless activity all things
                   throughout the universe of God, is the hand that was nailed
                   to the cross for us."—Education, p. 132.
                      How extensive is the natural creation? Col. 1:16; Isa.
                   40:26; 45:12.
                      For what purpose was the natural universe brought into
                   existence? Rev. 4:11.
                      "It pleased God to bring the universe into existence and to
                   give life to its creatures. . . . There was nothing desirable from
                   His point of view in being alone in an empty universe. It pleased
                   Him that the universe should be peopled with intelligent beings,
                   capable of appreciating and reflecting His infinite love and per-
                   fect character. This was His purpose in creating them."—SDA

THINK IT THROUGH      God never intended the natural creation to be worshiped.
                   However, as a Christian how may it minister to my spiritual
                   experience? See Matt. 6:26-30; Psalm 8.
                      "Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind. Nothing is

                   With whom are the angels particularly associated?. Rev.
                5:11; Heb. 1:7; Ps. 103:20.
                   The term "angel" derives from the Greek word aggelos (pro-
                nounced ahng/e1i5s) meaning "messenger." Angels are also'
                designated "ministers," the Greek word meaning "one who
                serves in religious or spiritual things."
                   "Angels are God's ministers, radiant with the light ever
                flowing from His presence and speeding on rapid wing to exe-
                cute His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 34.
                   Toward whom has God particularly directed the ministry
                of angels? Heb. 1:14; Ps. 91:11; Matt. 18:10.
                    "The angels of glory find their joy in giving,—giving love
                and tireless watchcare to souls that are fallen and unholy.
                Heavenly beings woo the hearts of men; they bring to this dark
                world light from the courts above; by gentle and patient min-
                istry they move upon the human spirit, to bring the lost into a
                fellowship with Christ which is even closer than they themselves
                can know."—The Desire of Ages, p. 21.
                   What Biblical evidence is there that there are other created
                intelligent beings in the universe besides angels and man-
                kind? Col. 1:16; Rev. 12:12; 1 Peter 3:22; Eph. 3:10, 11.
                   Peter distinguishes between "angels" and "authorities and
                powers" who became subject to Christ at His ascension. Since
                this was not true of fallen angels and earthly powers, it is prob-
                ably to be understood as referring to the unfallen angels and
                worlds who then fully acknowledged His lordship.
                   How can I cooperate with the ministry of the angels in my

  IMAGE OF GOD     "But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
                   that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou
                   visitest him? Thou modest him a little lower than the angels;

                   came from the Creator's hand, he bore, in his physical, mental,
                   and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker. . . . It was His

                   reveal this image—the more fully reflect the glory of the Crea-

                      Being made in the "image of God" permitted what kind
                   of relationship to be established between the Creator and
                   man? This relationship will be restored in the new earth.

                      "The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and
                   his kingdom ruleth over all" (Ps. 103:19).
                     "Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne:
                   mercy and truth shall go before thy face" (Ps. 89:14).
                      Since holy love is the chief attribute of God, all created
                   beings were placed under a governing authority that provided
                   the highest good for each individual and the creation as a
                   whole. There existed an atmosphere of love conducive to the
                   perfect growth and development of all the faculties of intelli-
                   gent beings. "Love for God was supreme, love for one another
                   impartial."—The Great Controversy, p. 493.
                      What right has God given to each of the intelligent beings
                   He has created? Deut. 30:19; Jude 6.
                      The evidence of this right is seen in the simple test required
                   of our first parents (Gen. 2:17), a similar test on other worlds
                   (Early Writings, p. 40), and the fact that some of the angels
                   chose to rebel against the divine rule. "God desires from all
                   His creatures the service of love—homage that springs from
                   an intelligent appreciation of His character. He takes no pleas-
                   ure in a forced allegiance, and to all He grants freedom of
                   will, that they may render Him voluntary service."—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 493.
                      What makes it evident that man was placed on probation
                   —that none had a natural immortality? Rom. 6:23; 1 Cor.
                   15:51-53.
                      "Like the angels, the dwellers in Eden had been placed upon

                   could have been no development of character; their service
                   would not have been voluntary, but forced. Therefore He gave
                   them the power of choice—the power to yield or to withhold

         Part 5     Among which of the intelligent beings in God's creation
     THE FIRST  did sin and rebellion arise?
        REBEL       "God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them
                   down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to
                   be reserved unto judgment" (2 Peter 2:4).

                      "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
                   their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
                   under darkness unto judgment of the great day" (Jude 6).

                      Do the Scriptures give any hint to suggest that the divine
                   rule of love was at fault to cause the rebellion?
                      "Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God
                   was in no wise responsible for the entrance of sin; that there
                   was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency in
                   the divine government, that gave occasion for the uprising of
                   rebellion. Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason
                   can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it is
                   to defend it."—The Great Controversy, pp. 492, 493.

                      The angelic revolt developed through the instigation of the
                   angel Lucifer. What was his original position and character?
                   Eze. 28:12-15.

                      "Evil originated with Lucifer, who rebelled against the gov-
                   ernment of God. Before his fall he was a covering cherub,
                   distinguished by his excellence. God made him good and
                   beautiful, as near as possible like Himself."—Ellen G. White
                   Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1163.
                      The title, "cherub that covereth" brings to mind the ark of the
                   covenant. Each of two cherubs spread a wing each over the sa-
                   cred chest. The title suggests that Lucifer stood within the
                   presence of God's glory and assisted in communicating the di-
                   vine will to the other angels and the universe. The dissatisfac-
                   tion of such a personage made his deceptions among the
                   angels well-nigh overwhelming.

                   not a great leader of that rebellion? Is not Satan the life and

                   28:17).
                       "For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven,

                      "I will rival the Most High" (verse 14, Jerusalem Bible).
                      What do these passages suggest as to how Lucifer began
                   a course of action which eventually led to his revolt?
                      "Satan fell because of his ambition to be equal with God.
                   He desired to enter into the divine counsels and purposes, from
                   which he was excluded by his own inability, as a created being,
                   to comprehend the wisdom of the Infinite One. It was this am-
                   bitious pride that led to his rebellion."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p.
                   702.
                       What appears to have been the spark which started this
                   highly positioned angel in a wrong course of reasoning?
                       "When God said to His Son, 'Let us make man in our image,'
                   Satan was jealous of Jesus. He wished to be consulted con-
                   cerning the formation of man, and because he was not, he was
                   filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred."—Early Writings, p. 145.
                      Of what two sins does Jesus say Lucifer was guilty in
                   heaven? John 8:44. Whom did he murder? See 1 John 3:15.
                     Unsuspected by his fellow angels because of his position,
                   Lucifer began to poison their minds against God.
                     When Lucifer gained sufficient support from the angels he
                   had alienated, he openly defied God. What were the results?
                   Rev. 12:7-9.
                     "Satan thought that if he could carry the angels of heaven

                       Does this mean that sin is only the casual breaking of a

                   is the law equated? What really is the law?
                      "The law is to be presented to its transgressors, not as
                   something apart from God, but rather as an exponent of His
                   mind and character. As the sunlight cannot be separated from
                   the sun, so God's law cannot be rightly presented to man apart
                   from the divine Author."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 371.
                   Sin is thus opposition to the personal will of God.
                      Are good and just laws, designed for the good of the gov-
                   erned, restrictive? See 1 John 5:3; Deut. 10:12, 13.
                      Does love place limits? When a mother forbids her child
                   to touch a hot iron, her love has placed limits upon the child
                   by means of her expressed will. Is her law "arbitrary," or is it
                   dictated by her loving concern?
                      What did Lucifer do? 1 John 3:8. From this verse what may
                   we infer about Lucifer's challenge of the law of God?
                       "He reiterated his claim that angels needed no control, but
                   should be left to follow their own will, which would ever guide
                   them right. He denounced the divine statutes as a restriction
                   of their liberty and declared that it was his purpose to secure
                   the abolition of law; that, freed from this restraint, the hosts of
                   heaven might enter upon a more exalted, more glorious state
                   of existence."—The Great Controversy, p. 499.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what way is today's emphasis on situational ethics a
                   reflection of the original challenge of God's law? How do I
                   know what is the loving thing to do in a given situation?
                       "This work of opposition to the law of God had its beginning
                   in the courts of heaven, with Lucifer."—Selected Messages, bk.
                   1, p. 222.
                       "Since their natures were holy, he urged that the angels
                   should obey the dictates of their own will."—The Great Contro-

                                                                       January /9

        Part 2   Since Lucifer spurned God's law and governing control,
    IMPUGNING what kind of lying among the angels would he have done?
        GOD'S    "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your
    CHARACTER father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and
                   abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When
                   he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and
                   the father of it" (John 8:44).
                       In calling God's law into question, Lucifer in effect raised
                   doubts about the character of God. If the divine laws are re-
                   strictive and not beneficial, then God must have had bad or ul-
                   terior motives in placing the intelligent creation under such
                   laws.
                       Notice three statements from The Great Controversy:
                       "It was his policy to perplex the angels with subtle argu-
                   ments concerning the purposes of God."—Page 497.
                       "He had sought to falsify the word of God and had misrep-
                   resented His plan of government before the angels, claiming
                   that God was not just in laying laws and rules upon the inhabi-
                   tants of heaven; that in requiring submission and obedience
                   from His creatures, He was seeking merely the exaltation of
                   Himself."—Page 498.
                       "He . . . had declared that while the Creator exacted self-
                   denial from all others, He Himself practiced no self-denial and
                   made no sacrifice."—Page 502.
                      When God questioned Adam and Eve after their sin, how
                   did they meet the confrontation of their error? Whom did
                   they blame? Gen. 3:9-12.
                       Neither admitted guilt. Both justified themselves by passing
                   blame, ultimately implying that blame was due to God.
                       "The discord which his own course had caused in heaven,
                   Satan charged upon the law and government of God. All evil
                   he declared to be the result of the divine administration. He
                   claimed that it was his own object to improve upon the statutes
                   of Jehovah....
                       "To the very close of the controversy in heaven, the great
                   usurper continued to justify himself."—The Great Controversy,
                   p. 498, 499.
THINK IT THROUGH      It is sometimes suggested that the enforcement of rules
                   creates rebellion in the home and school. What do you think?
                       "With one accord, Satan and his host threw the blame
                   of their rebellion wholly upon Christ, declaring that if they had
                   not been reproved, they would never have rebelled."—Ellen G.

         Part 3         "How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the
                   morning! . . . For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend
       SEEKING
                   into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God:
 INDEPENDENCE      . . . I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be
     FROM GOD      like the most High" (Isa. 14:12-14).
                      What do the "I's" inform us about Lucifer's idea of what
                   a creature's relationship should be to his Creator?
                        The primary sin of the creature is to attempt to be indepen-
                   dent of the Creator, to be his own center and god. "Self-idolatry
                   . . . lies at the foundation of all sin."—Gospel Workers, p. 114.
                   Lucifer's charges against the law, government, and character
                   of God hid from the angels his real intent: to gain independence
                   from the divine sovereignty.
                        "Sin originated in self-seeking. Lucifer, the covering cherub,
                   desired to be first in heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 21. "Not
                   content with his position, . . . he ventured to covet homage
                   due alone to the Creator. Instead of seeking to make God
                   supreme in the affections and allegiance of all created beings,
                   it was his endeavor to secure their service and loyalty to him-
                   self."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 35. "He gloried in his
                   brightness and exaltation, and aspired to be equal with God."
                   —The Great Controversy, p. 495.
                        What fundamental truth was God attempting to teach
                   Israel by the 40-year miracle of the manna? Deut. 8:3.
                      Sin is more than the mere breaking of a rule; it is the asser-
                   tion of the will to be independent of God. See Romans 14:23.
                   True repentance is more than the confession of a wrong; it is
                   the surrender of the will to God and a dependence upon Him.
                     In contrast to Lucifer, what perfect example did Jesus give
                   us? John 6:38; Matt. 26:39.
                      "His confidence in His heavenly Father was unlimited. His
                   obedience and submission were unreserved and perfect"—

                      "Selfishness is the essence of depravity, and because human
                   beings have yielded to its power, the opposite of allegiance to
                   God is seen in the world today. Nations, families, and individ-
                   uals are filled with a desire to make self a center. Man longs
                   to rule over his fellow men. Separating himself in his egotism
                   from God and his fellow beings, he follows his unrestrained
                   inclinations. He acts as if the good of others depended on

Principles of Rebellion LESSON 4                                  ❑   Wednesday
                                                                       January 21

          Part 4       "And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before
 FINDING FAULT     the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand
                   to resist him. And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke
    WITH GOD'S     thee, 0 Satan; . . . is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
         MERCY     Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood be-
                   fore the angel. And he . . . spake . . . , saying, Take away
                   the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold,
                   I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will
                   clothe thee with change of raiment" (Zech. 3:1-4).

                      This vision depicts the spiritual condition of the Jewish
                   exiles returned from Babylonian captivity. The priest in filthy
                   clothing is representing the nation in its sinful condition. He
                   is asking for mercy. Satan is depicted as resisting—protesting
                   an act of mercy on God's part to the sinful nation. The vision
                   reflects Lucifer's claim that justice and mercy are incom-
                   patible, that God could not in fairness show mercy and for-
                   giveness.
                      How was this issue reflected at other times in Bible history?
                   Jude 9; Rev. 12:10.
                      "In the opening of the great controversy, Satan had declared
                   that the law of God could not be obeyed, that justice was in-
                   consistent with mercy, and that, should the law be broken, it
                   would be impossible for the sinner to be pardoned. Every sin
                   must meet its punishment, urged Satan; and if God should remit
                   the punishment of sin, He would not be a God of truth and
                   justice. When men broke the law of God, and defied His will,
                   Satan exulted. It was proved, he declared, that the law could
                   not be obeyed; man could not be forgiven. Because he, after
                   his rebellion, had been banished from heaven, Satan claimed
                   that the human race must be forever shut out from God's favor.
                   God could not be just, he urged, and yet show mercy to the
                   sinner."—The Desire of Ages, p. 761.
                     How would the Godhead eventually meet this charge?
                   Rom. 3:23-26.

THINK IT THROUGH      What are my attitudes toward backsliders who have been
                   rebaptized? Do I fellowship with them graciously?

                      "Through Jesus, God's mercy was manifested to men; but
                   mercy does not set aside justice. The law reveals the attributes
                   of God's character, and not a jot or tittle of it could be changed
                   to meet man in his fallen condition. God did not change His
                   law, but He sacrificed Himself, in Christ, for man's redemp-
                   tion."—The Desire of Ages, p. 762.

         Part 5      "Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
       DENYING   mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world,
                 and the glory of them; and saith unto him, All these things
       CHRIST'S  will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me" (Matt.
     AUTHORITY   4:8, 9).
                     The third temptation reflects the bitter antagonism of Satan
                 which he developed in heaven toward Christ. What did he
                 presume to demand of the Son of God?
                    "It was in seeking to exalt himself above the Son of God
                 that Satan had sinned in heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 129.
                    "This prince of angels aspired to power which it was the
                 prerogative of Christ alone to wield. . . .
                     "'Why,' questioned this mighty angel, 'should Christ have
                 the supremacy? Why is He thus honored above Lucifer?' "—
                 The Great Controversy, pp. 494, 495.
                     "When Satan learned the purpose of God, he was envious
                 at Christ, and jealous because the Father had not consulted
                 him in regard to the creation of man."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3,
                 p. 36.
                     Who at the head of the loyal angels opposed Lucifer and
                 the rebelling angels? Rev. 12:7-9.
                     "Michael" in Hebrew means "Who is like God?" An identifi-
                 cation of Michael may be made by comparing Jude 9; 1 Thes-
                 salonians 4:16; and John 5:28. Christ is the One who is like
                 God and raises the dead. "Michael was known amongst the
                 ancient Jews as the angel or prince who had special charge
                 of the nation of Israel. The very best Jewish writers concur
                 in teaching that the name 'Michael' is the same as the title
                 `Messiah.' "—Joseph Parker, The People's Bible, vol. 16, p.
                 438; cited in Questions on Doctrine (Washington, DC: Review
                 and Herald Publishing Assoc., 1957), p. 74.
                     When did Satan's full malice break upon Christ? See Luke
                 22:53; Eph. 6:12.
                     "The pent-up fires of envy and malice, hatred and revenge,
                 burst forth on Calvary against the Son of God, while all heaven
                 gazed upon the scene in silent horror."—The Great Contro-

THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do to prevent attitudes of envy and jealousy
                 from taking root in my mind? Matt. 20:28; 1 Cor. 12:12-27.
                     "God dispenses His gifts as it pleases Him. . . . It is in
                 God's order that some shall be of service in one line of work,
                 and others in other lines—all working under the selfsame Spirit.
                 The recognition of this plan will be a safeguard against emula-

    REBELLION
                      "And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
                   called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world:
                   he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out
                   with him" (Rev. 12:9).
                     "0 the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowl-

                   ways are past finding out!" (Rom. 11:33).
                      "Many mysteries yet remain unrevealed. How much that is
                   acknowledged to be truth is mysterious and unexplainable to
                   the human mind! How dark seem the dispensations of Provi-
                   dence! What necessity there is for implicit faith and trust in
                   God's moral government!"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1091.
                      The existence of evil has been, and is, a great perplexity
                   to the human mind. Human suffering is the lot of good and
                   bad. These sufferings often cause sinful man to blame God.
                   And at times even the righteous are perplexed.
                       Why did the Godhead permit the angelic rebels to live and
                   to exercise their powers?
                       "Even when it was decided that he could no longer remain
                   in heaven, Infinite Wisdom did not destroy Satan. Since the
                   service of love can alone be acceptable to God, the allegiance
                   of His creatures must rest upon a conviction of His justice and
                   benevolence. The inhabitants of heaven and of other worlds,
                   being unprepared to comprehend the nature or consequences
                   of sin, could not then have seen the justice and mercy of God
                   in the destruction of Satan. Had he been immediately blotted
                   from existence, they would have served God from fear rather
                   than from love. The influence of the deceiver would not have
                   been fully destroyed, nor would the spirit of rebellion have
                   been utterly eradicated. Evil must be permitted to come to
                    maturity. For the good of the entire universe through ceaseless
                    ages Satan must more fully develop his principles, that his
                    charges against the divine government might be seen in their
                    true light by all created beings, that the justice and mercy
                    of God and the immutability of His law might forever be placed
                    beyond all question."—The Great Controversy, pp. 498, 499.

                      The outreaches of the natural sciences continue to demon-
                  strate that our universe operates under marvelous physical
                  laws. There could be no true study of science if the universe
                  were not orderly. Since God's physical laws have a certain
                  regularity about them, they are used by the psalmist to illus-
                  trate the divine faithfulness.
                      Plants yield seed and fruit in harmony with fixed laws deter-

                  the divine will (Gen. 1:14-18). The amazing feat of landing man
                  on the moon would not have been possible without a knowl-

                  the universe.
                      "Everything in nature, from the mote in the sunbeam to the
                  worlds on high, is under law. And upon obedience to these laws
                  the order and harmony of the natural world depend."—Thoughts

                       Physical laws as they function in nature are really descrip-
                  tions of whose operation? Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:17.
                      "Nature in her work testifies of the intelligent presence and
                  active agency of a being who moves in all His works according
                  to His will. It is not by an original power inherent in nature that
                  year by year the earth yields its bounties and continues its

                  at work guiding this planet. It is God's power momentarily

                                                                     January 26

         Part 2     "Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" (Matt. 6:10).
    GOD'S WILL      God is the moral Governor of the universe. His will is the
       AS LAW    basis of moral law under which all the intelligent beings of His
                 creation live.
                    "While everything in nature is governed by natural law, man
                 alone, as an intelligent being, capable of understanding its
                 requirements, is amenable to moral law. To man alone, the
                 crowning work of His creation, God has given a conscience to
                 realize the sacred claims of the divine law, and a heart capable
                 of loving it as holy, just, and good; and of man prompt and
                 perfect obedience is required. Yet God does not compel him
                 to obey; he is left a free moral agent."—Selected Messages,
                 bk. 1, p. 216.
                    The phrase "man alone" means that as far as this earth is
                 concerned, man is the only creature on earth amenable to
                 moral law. Intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe are
                 also amenable.
                     How do loyal angels regard the will of God as it is ex-
                 pressed to them in divine commands? Ps. 103:20.
                     "Everything in nature . . . is under law. . . . So there are
                 great principles of righteousness to control the life of all in-
                 telligent beings, and upon conformity to these principles the
                 well-being of the universe depends. Before this earth was
                 called into being, God's law existed. Angels are governed by
                 its principles, and in order for earth to be in harmony with
                 heaven, man also must obey the divine statutes."—Thoughts
                 From the Mount of Blessing, p. 48.
                     Since moral law is grounded in the will and character of
                 God, how permanent would it be? Ps. 90:2; Mal. 3:6.
                     "The moral law was never a type or a shadow. It existed
                  before man's creation, and will endure as long as God's throne
                  remains. God could not change or alter one precept of His
                  law in order to save man: for the law is the foundation of His
                  government. It is unchangeable, unalterable, infinite, and eter-
                  nal."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
                 6, p. 1097.
THINK IT THROUGH      Why are divine laws sometimes compared to a "path"?
                  See Ps. 119:35. What is the significance of the figure?
                     "Many are the temptations and besetments on every side
                  to ruin the prospects of young men, both for this world and
                  the next. But the only path of safety is for young and old to
                  live in strict conformity to the principles of physical and moral
                  law. The path of obedience is the only path that leads to
                  heaven."—Temperance, p. 60.

         Part 3   According to Jesus, upon what two principles does the
         BASIC Old Testament—"the law and the prophets"—rest?
 RELATIONSHIPS    "Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
                   all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
                   This is the first and great commandment. And the second is
                   like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On
                   these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets"
                   (Matt. 22:37-40).
                      Old Testament instruction is in reality an exposition and an
                   application of the moral law, and we have in Jesus' statement
                   the essential principles of that law. It is this great law of love
                   which is the foundation of the divine government.
                      "Before the entrance of evil there was peace and joy
                   throughout the universe. All was in perfect harmony with the
                   Creator's will. Love for God was supreme, love for one another
                   impartial."—The Great Controversy, p. 493.
                      "The law given upon Sinai was the enunciation of the prin-
                   ciple of love, a revelation to earth of the law of heaven."—
                   Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 46.
                       How were our first parents created? With what kind of
                   attitudes and character? Gen. 1:26, 27; 1 John 4:16.

                       In view of the principles expressed by Paul in Romans
                   13:8-10, what should have been Adam's natural response to
                   any of God's commands? Would this also be true of other holy
                   intelligences in the universe?
                      "In heaven, service is not rendered in the spirit of legality.
                   When Satan rebelled against the law of Jehovah, the thought
                   that there was a law came to the angels almost as an awaken-
                   ing to something unthought of. . . . Obedience is to them no
                   drudgery. Love for God makes their service a joy."—Thoughts

                       "No man has pure love to God unless he has unselfish love
                   for his brother. But we can never come into possession of this
                   spirit by trying to love others. What is needed is the love of
                   Christ in the heart. When self is merged in Christ, love springs
                   forth spontaneously. The completeness of Christian character
                   is attained when the impulse to help and bless others springs
                   constantly from within—when the sunshine of heaven fills the

         Part 4 What does the psalmist ask the Creator to do for him?
   MAN LEARNS   "Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
     HIS DUTY understanding, that I may learn thy commandments" (Ps.
                   119:73.)
                      What was true of the converted psalmist would have also
                   been true of perfect man before the Fall, and is true of penitent
                   man after the Fall. Those who truly love God desire to know
                   His will. They delight to obey.
                      "The law of God existed before man was created. The angels
                   were governed by it. Satan fell because he transgressed the
                   principles of God's government. After Adam and Eve were
                   created, God made known to them his law. It was not then
                   written, but was rehearsed to them by Jehovah."—Spiritual
                   Gifts, vol. 3, p. 295.
                      "These two great principles [of the law] embrace the first
                   four commandments, showing the duty of man to God, and the
                   last six, showing the duty of man to his fellowman. The prin-

                   worded to meet the case of fallen intelligences. This was nec-
                   essary in consequence of the minds of men being blinded by
                   transgression."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

                      What Biblical evidence is there for inferring that Adam's
                   descendants knew the ten precepts of the Decalogue before
                   the giving of the law at Sinai? First table: Gen. 35:1-4; 2:1-3;
                   Second table: Gen. 4:8-11; 6:5, 11; 9:22, 23; 12:11-19; 27:11-
                   13, 35, 36; 31:30, 32; 39:7-9.
                       The book of Genesis briefly sketches the first 2500 years of
                   human history, so we cannot expect too much detail. However,
                   these passages, and others which could be cited, give clear
                   evidence that mankind had a sense of right and wrong as de-
                   fined by the Decalogue. Since the Bible indicates that the law
                   was not written down until Sinai, we infer that the Lord gave
                   it orally to Adam, who in turn transmitted it to his progeny.
THINK IT THROUGH     Why does obedience to God's moral law of the Ten Com-
                   mandments promote physical health?
                      "The love of Jesus in the soul will banish all hatred, selfish-
                   ness, and envy; for the law of the Lord is perfect, converting
                   the soul. There is health in obedience to God's law. The affec-
                   tions of the obedient are drawn out after God. Looking unto
                   the Lord Jesus, we may encourage and serve one another. The
                   love of Christ is shed abroad in our souls, and there is no dis-
                   sension and strife among us."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

        Part 5           "I see that all things come to an end,
A PERFECT LAW                but thy commandment has no limit" (Ps. 119:96, NEB).
                       The moral law of the Ten Commandments is no mere check-
                   list of rules. Its precepts reflect the character of its Author;
                   its spiritual nature reaches into the intents and motives of the
                   heart.
                       Examine the following passages and compare the attributes
                   of God's character with the descriptions of the law.

                   b.    Rev. 15:3                 b. Rom. 7:12; 1 John 5:3
                   c.    Ps. 25:8                  c. Rom. 7:12
                   d.    Ps. 11:7                  d. Ps. 119:172

                   g.    Ps. 90:2                  g. Ps. 111:7, 8
                      How do the above passages show that it would be impos-
                   sible for God to abolish the Ten Commandments?
                       "The God of heaven has placed a benediction upon them
                   that keep the commandments of God. Shall we stand as a
                   peculiar people of God, or shall we trample upon the law of
                   God and say it is not binding? God might just as well have
                   abolished Himself. In the law every specification is the char-
                   acter of the infinite God."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1104.
                       "Our duty to obey this law is to be the burden of this last
                   message of mercy to the world. God's law is not a new thing.
                   It is not holiness created, but holiness made known. It is a code
                   of principles expressing mercy, goodness, and love. It presents
                   to fallen humanity the character of God, and states plainly the
                   whole duty of man."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 1, pp. 1104, 1105.
                      How do the Ten Commandments differ from human codes
                   of conduct? Rom. 7:12, 14; Matt. 5:27, 28.
                       "The law of God . . . reaches to the thoughts and feelings.
                   . . . If the law extended to the outward conduct only, men
                   would not be guilty in their wrong thoughts, desires, and de-
                   signs. But the law requires that the soul itself be pure and the
                   mind holy, that the thoughts and feelings may be in accordance
                   with the standard of love and righteousness.—Selected Mes-

Principles of Righteousness LESSON 5                                   ❑   Friday
                                                                       January 30

         Part 6   "0 that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then
    OBEDIENCE: had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the
                waves of the sea" (Isa. 48:18).
     SECRET OF
    HAPPINESS     In this passage what did God imply was the secret for
                   true and lasting happiness for the nation of Israel?
                      God intended Israel to illustrate the divine principles to the
                   populations of earth and heaven. Peace and happiness would
                   have followed upon their obedience. Just so, happiness would
                   have deepened in the sinless universe if Lucifer had not per-
                   sisted in his challenges.
                      Carried out in everyday life, the principle of impartial love
                   would lead to honor and respect for lawful authority—parental,
                   church, school, and state. It would lead one to do all those
                   things which would tend to promote the health, happiness, and
                   welfare of one's fellow beings.
                       If God were loved supremely, He alone would have first
                   place in the life. He would be worshiped in spirit and in truth.
                   All that was holy and sacred to God would be revered and
                   respected. The holy Sabbath would be as a golden clasp, bind-
                   ing the child of God to the heavenly Father. A vertical love re-
                   lationship with God would motivate such a horizontal love rela-
                   tionship with all other members of society that it would seem
                   that heaven had come to earth!
                       Such was the society of heaven before Lucifer's disaffection.
                   Such will be the society of the redeemed when the plan of sal-
                   vation is completed.
                     After an elusive quest for happiness, what did the wise
                   man conclude was best for man? Ecc. 12:13.
                      "Obedience to the law is essential, not only to our salvation,
                   but to our own happiness and the happiness of all with whom
                   we are connected. 'Great peace have they which love thy law:
                   and nothing shall offend them' (Ps. 119:165)."—Selected Mes-
                   sages, bk. 1, pp. 218, 219.
THINK IT THROUGH      What fruits has disobedience to the Creator's will brought
                   to human society? My personal disobedience has brought
                   what results to me?
                       "Our world is a vast lazar house, a scene of misery that we
                   dare not allow even our thoughts to dwell upon. Did we realize
                   it as it is, the burden would be too terrible. Yet God feels it
                   all. In order to destroy sin and its results He gave His best
                   Beloved, and He has put it in our power, through co-operation
                   with Him, to bring this scene of misery to an end."—Education,

                                        ruler.' He claimed that it was im-
                                        possible that forgiveness should be
                                        granted to the sinner, and therefore

  FALL OF MAN          "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
                   and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
                   all have sinned" (Rom. 5:12).
                       "God placed man under law, as an indispensable condition
                   of his very existence. He was a subject of the divine govern-
                   ment, and there can be no government without law. . . With-
                   out freedom of choice, his obedience would not have been
                   voluntary, but forced. There could have been no development
                   of character. Such a course would have been contrary to God's
                   plan in dealing with the inhabitants of other worlds. It would
                   have been unworthy of man as an intelligent being, and would
                   have sustained Satan's charge of God's arbitrary rule."—Pa-
                   triarchs and Prophets, p. 49.
                       Analyze the temptation and Fall in Gen. 3:1-6. Eve took
                   three steps which Adam also eventually took. What was the
                   first step by which Satan (by means of the serpent) created
                   an atmosphere?
                      Having succeeded in planting in Eve's mind a doubt and
                   a distrust of God, Satan suspected that she would take two
                   further steps on her own. What were they?
                      "There was nothing poisonous in the fruit itself, and the sin
                   was not merely in yielding to appetite. It was distrust of God's
                   goodness, disbelief of His word, and refection of His authority,
                   that made our first parents transgressors, and that brought into
                   the world a knowledge of evil. It was this that opened the door
                   to every species of falsehood and error."—Education, p. 25.
                      The similarity between the fall of Eve (and later Adam) and
                   that of Lucifer should be noted. Eve came to cherish a distrust
                   of God's character. Distrust led her to disbelieve the necessity
                   of His command. The next step was open disobedience. The
                   sequence was triggered by a suggested appeal to assert her
                   independence and become like God. Adam traversed the same
                   steps under Eve as his temptress.
THINK IT THROUGH       Why does God view so seriously what we regard as small
                   sins?
                      "Adam yielded to temptation and as we have the matter of
                   sin and its consequence laid so distinctly before us, we can
                   read from cause to effect and see the greatness of the act is
                   not that which constitutes sin; but the disobedience of God's
                   expressed will, which is a virtual denial of God, refusing the
                   laws of His government."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

                   brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works
                   were evil, and his brother's righteous" (1 John 3:12).
                      "He [Cain] permitted his mind to run in the same channel
                   that led to Satan's fall—indulging the desire for self-exaltation
                   and questioning the divine justice and authority."—Patriarchs
                   and Prophets, p. 71.
                      In the account of Cain and Abel we catch a glimpse of the
                   deadly serious controversy as it began to appear in the earth.
                   At times it is seen in a warfare against the "seed of the woman"
                   (God's followers) by the "seed" of the serpent (Satan's follow-
                   ers). The first fruit of the satanic principle of self was self-justifi-
                   cation (Gen. 3:9-13); the second was murder.
                      What was the experience which produced such anger in
                   Cain's mind against Abel? Gen. 4:2-5.
                      In the brief account we see two reactions to the law and
                   authority of God. Abel loved God supremely. Touched by the
                   divine compassion which had provided a plan, he offered the
                   prescribed typical sacrifice, trusting in the merits of the coming
                   Saviour (Heb. 11:4). His love for God led him to have a concern
                   for Cain. The older brother, however, showed his contempt for
                   the Creator by the kind of offering he brought. Thus without
                   the fear of God before his eyes, he was led in his anger at
                   Abel's loyalty to break the law's second principle and to murder
                   his own brother.
                      What was Cain's punishment? Gen. 4:11-15. What was the
                   divine purpose in sparing his life?
                       "In sparing the life of the first murderer, God presented
                   before the whole universe a lesson bearing upon the great
                   controversy. . . . Fifteen centuries after the sentence pro-
                   nounced upon Cain, the universe witnessed the fruition of his
                   influence and example, in the crime and pollution that flooded
                   the earth."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 78.
THINK IT THROUGH     What influence do loyal, radiant Christians have on me?
                   Do they anger or humble me?
                      "There are many who have outgrown their advent faith. They
                   are living for the world, and while saying in their hearts, as they
                   desire it shall be, 'My Lord delayeth His coming,' they are
                   beating their fellow servants. They do this for the same reason
                   that Cain killed Abel."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 77.

         FLOOD
                      "Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him
                   not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
                   imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened" (Rom.
                   1:21).

                      What was one of the prime factors in the deepening rebel-
                   lion against God in the earth? Gen. 6:1, 2.

                       "The children of Seth, attracted by the beauty of the daugh-
                   ters of Cain's descendants, displeased the Lord by intermarry-
                   ing with them.... Mingling with the depraved, they became like
                   them in spirit and in deeds; the restrictions of the seventh
                   commandment were disregarded, 'and they took them wives of
                   all which they chose.' . . . Sin spread abroad in the earth like
                   a deadly leprosy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 81, 82.

                       What was the result of displacing God from the center of
                   life in that age? Luke 17:26, 27; Gen. 6:5, 11.

                      "The holy inhabitants of other worlds were watching with
                   the deepest interest. . . . In the condition of the world that ex-
                   isted before the Flood they saw illustrated the results of the
                   administration which Lucifer had endeavored to establish in
                   heaven, in rejecting the authority of Christ and casting aside
                   the law of God. In those high-handed sinners of the antedilu-
                   vian world . . every emotion, every impulse and imagination,
                   was at war with the divine principles of purity and peace and
                   love. It was an example of the awful depravity resulting from
                   Satan's policy to remove from God's creatures the restraint of
                   His holy law."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 78, 79.

                      What message and with what success did Noah offer those

         Part 4    As the descendants of Noah began to multiply, a group
    THE TOWER of them migrated away from the others to establish them-
                selves in what area?
      OF BABEL
                      "And the whole earth was of one language, and of one
                   speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east,
                   that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
                   there" (Gen. 11:1, 2).
                      See also Dan. 1:1, 2.
                      "As their numbers increased, apostasy soon led to division.
                   Those who desired to forget their Creator and to cast off the
                   restraint of His law felt a constant annoyance from the teach-
                   ing and example of their God-fearing associates, and after a
                   time they decided to separate from the worshipers of God."
                   —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 118.
                      What instruction had God originally given Adam and had
                   repeated to Noah? Gen. 1:28; 9:1.
                      In opposition to the divine plan what did the people in
                   Shinar decide to do? What were they apparently attempting
                   to establish? Gen. 11:3, 4; 10:8-10.
                       The founding of the world's first kingdom at Babel appears
                   also to have been the first organized attempt to defy the author-
                   ity and government of God. While the records are brief, it is
                   clear that the decision to build the city and the tower was in
                   opposition to the divine command to scatter over the earth and
                   subdue it. The sin was not in building a city but in rejecting
                   the divine authority which had commanded dispersion for the
                   future good of all.
                       "This confederacy was born of rebellion against God. The
                   dwellers on the plain of Shinar established their kingdom for
                   self-exaltation, not for the glory of God. Had they succeeded,
                   a mighty power would have borne sway, banishing righteous-
                   ness and inaugurating a new religion. The world would have
                    been demoralized. . . . The law of Jehovah would have been
                   ignored and forgotten."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 213, 214.
THINK IT THROUGH      As a Christian, what encouragement may I derive from the
                   Babel account? See Gen. 11:5-8.
                      "God bears long with the perversity of men, giving them am-
                   ple opportunity for repentance; but He marks all their devices
                   to resist the authority of His just and holy law. From time to
                   time the unseen hand that holds the scepter of government is
                   stretched out to restrain iniquity. Unmistakable evidence is
                   given that the Creator of the universe, ... is the Supreme Ruler
                   of heaven and earth, and that none can with impunity defy His
                   power."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 123.

                                                                      February 5

         Part 5 When men insist on following their own evil purposes,
        SODOM what does God permit?
                      "And even as they did not like to retain God in their
                   knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do
                   those things which are not convenient" (Rom. 1:28).
                      In asserting his independence of God the individual thinks
                   to gain a more exalted state of existence and vast freedom. But
                   the long history of sin has proved a fundamental truth: If man
                   will not worship what is above him, he will worship that which
                   is beneath him. Sodom is an exhibit of the depth of moral
                   degradation and pollution to which the human mind can de-
                   scend when self is made the center of existence.
                      What were some of the factors which led the inhabitants
                   of Sodom into a preoccupation with sexual perversion? Eze.
                   16:49, 50.
                       "The people openly defied God and His law and delighted
                   in deeds of violence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 157. Note
                   the violations of the divine principles. The people were proud,
                   haughty, self-centered, and independent of God. Abundantly
                   supplied with food, they did not need to engage in physically
                   tiring labor; this situation also provided them with much leisure.
                   They had no care for the less fortunate among them. Turned
                   inward upon themselves, they sought meaning in degrading
                   perversions of their physical powers.
                      Because God does not immediately punish men in their
                   rebellion and sins, how do they often react? Eccl. 8:11.
                      When Lot endeavored to warn his sons-in-law of the im-
                   pending doom of the vile city, "he seemed to his sons-in-law
                   to be jesting" (Gen. 19:14, RSV).
                      What warning did God intend the judgment and destruc-
                   tion of Sodom to give to succeeding generations of men?
                   Jude 7; 2 Peter 2:6.
THINK IT THROUGH      In what profitable ways am I using my leisure time?
                      "There is nothing more desired among men than riches and
                   leisure, and yet these gave birth to the sins that brought de-
                   struction upon the cities of the plain. Their useless, idle life
                   made them a prey to Satan's temptations, and they defaced the
                   image of God. . . . Idleness is the greatest curse that can fall
                   upon man, for vice and crime follow in its train. .. . Satan lies
                   in ambush. . . . He is never more successful than when he
                   comes to men in their idle hours."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

         Part 6       "Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy
    ABRAHAM        country, and from thy kindred, . . . unto a land that I will
                   shew thee: and I will make of thee a great nation . . . : and
   AND ISRAEL      in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed" (Gen.
                   12:1-3).
                      "The Lord finally left the hardened transgressors to follow
                   their evil ways, while He chose Abraham, of the line of Shem,
                   and made him the keeper of His law for future generations."
                   —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 125.
                      With the call of Abraham God initiated a new program from
                   the divine side of the controversy. He would organize Abra-
                   ham's descendants into a nation to whom He would entrust
                   a true knowledge of Himself, His law, and His plan of salva-
                   tion. As the nation lived in obedience to God, they would re-
                   veal to the earth and the universe the blessed fruits of supreme
                   love for God and impartial love for one's fellows. The nation
                   would be His agent to earth's inhabitants, and through it would
                   come the Redeemer of all mankind.
                      When the nation was organized at Sinai, what did God
                   say they would be? Ex. 19:5, 6.
                      To assist them in discharging their task, where did the
                   Lord strategically place Israel? Eze. 5:5.
                      With what did the Lord entrust the nation? Rom. 3:1, 2;
                   9:4, 5.
                      "God had separated them [Israel] from the world, that He
                   might commit to them a sacred trust. He had made them the
                   depositaries of His law, and He purposed, through them, to
                   preserve among men the knowledge of Himself. Thus the light
                   of heaven was to shine out to a world enshrouded in darkness."
                   —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 314.
                      As God's agent what would Israel offer to the world which
                   was following satanic principles? John 4:22. What did God
                   intend His temple in Israel to become? Isa. 56:6, 7.
                     Israel was to be a model of the divine rule; the other nations
                   would reflect the principles of Satan.

      Righteousness
      Exalts a Nation
     In   a world controlled by Satanic agencies, those who remain
                  true to God are protected by His love.
  "It is an abomination to kings to       slow torture. These and other inhu-
commit wickedness: for the throne is      man practices reveal the cruelty of
established by righteousness" (Prov.      this nation. Their royal inscriptions
16:12).                                  continually exult over the number
                                         of enemies killed, captives carried

         Part 1  Why was Jonah, a prophet of Israel, sent on a mission to
GOD'S CONCERN Nineveh?
  FOR NATIONS    "Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of
                   Amittai, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and
                   cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me"
                   (Jonah 1:1, 2).
                      Nineveh, one of the great cities of antiquity and sometime
                   capital of the Assyrian kingdom, was built by Nimrod after the
                   dispersion from Babel (Gen. 10:8-11, RSV; see SDA Bible Com-
                   mentary). The walls, still discernible, indicate a perimeter of
                   about seven and one-half miles, enclosing 1640 acres. Since
                   no city in Palestine exceeded 20 acres, except Jerusalem (86
                   acres), the Assyrian capital appeared as "an exceeding great
                   city."
                      In what spiritual condition was this pagan city? Jonah 1:2;
                   3:8; 4:11.
                       "In the time of its temporal prosperity Nineveh was a center
                   of crime and wickedness....
                       "Yet Nineveh, wicked though it had become, was not wholly
                   given over to evil. . . . [God] perceived in that city many who
                   were reaching out after something better and higher, and who,
                   if granted opportunity to learn of the living God, would put
                   away their evil deeds and worship Him."—Prophets and Kings,
                   pp. 265, 266.
                       The situation that was fast obtaining in Nineveh was similar
                   to that of the antediluvian world. The satanic principle of selfish-
                   ness ruled, with the natural result of the violation of the second
                   table of the law. But the principles of righteousness were not
                   wholly effaced, and a representative from God's organized
                   people was sent to warn them of coming judgment. The intent
                   was to awaken the people to their deep spiritual need.
                       In another age how did Paul also appeal to the still ex-
                   isting moral sense of pagans? Acts 17:30, 31; 24:25.
THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do to reach my neighbors with Christ's last
                   message in the place where I live?
                       "God's messengers in the great cities are not to become
                   discouraged over the wickedness, the injustice, the depravity,
                   which they are called upon to face while endeavoring to pro-
                   claim the glad tidings of salvation. . . . In every city, filled
                   though it may be with violence and crime, there are many who
                   with proper teaching may learn to become followers of Jesus.
                   Thousands may thus be reached with saving truth and be led
                   to receive Christ as a personal Saviour."—Prophets and Kings,

         Part 2    How many times did God request Jonah to go with His
   A PREACHER message to Nineveh? Why do you suppose the prophet was
                so reluctant?
     PROVIDED
                      "And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second
                   time, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and
                   preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee" (Jonah 3:1, 2).
                       "As the prophet thought of the difficulties and seeming im-
                   possibilities of this commission, he was tempted to question
                   the wisdom of the call. From a human viewpoint it seemed as
                   if nothing could be gained by proclaiming such a message in
                   that proud city. He forgot for the moment that the God whom
                   he served was all-wise and all-powerful. While he hesitated,
                   still doubting, Satan overwhelmed him with discouragement."
                   —Prophets and Kings, p. 266.
                      As the Spirit of God convicted the consciences of the peo-
                   ple under Jonah's preaching, what amazing thing took place?
                   Jonah 3:5-9; Matt. 12:41.
                     What was the Creator's response to the repentance of the
                   Assyrians? Jonah 3:10.
                      "Their doom was averted, the God of Israel was exalted and
                   honored throughout the heathen world, and His law revered."
                   —Prophets and Kings, p. 271.
                      The success of Jonah's preaching among that portion of the
                   human family whose knowledge of God had largely faded is
                   encouraging, for the task is still before the church to witness
                   to similar cultures in our times.
                     Unfortunately, how did Jonah, in the face of heaven's
                   success, fail to represent God's character? Jonah 41-11.
                      "He should have been the first to rejoice because of God's
                   amazing grace; but instead he allowed his mind to dwell upon
                   the possibility of his being regarded as a false prophet. Jealous
                   of his reputation, he lost sight of the infinitely greater value of
                   the souls of that wretched city."—Prophets and Kings, p. 271.
THINK IT THROUGH      Am I a modern Jonah, reluctant to share my faith? How
                   can I overcome this reserve?
                      "As witnesses for Christ, we are to tell what we know, what
                   we ourselves have seen and heard and felt. . . . We can tell
                   how we have tested His promise, and found the promise true.
                   We can bear witness to what we have known of the grace of
                   Christ. This is the witness for which our Lord calls, and for

          Part 3 "Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught: speak
        HUMAN the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us" (Isa. 8:10).
     ALLIANCES   The story of Jonah and his relations with Nineveh indicates
       UNWISE that God is concerned for the safety and salvation of heathen
                   nations. But this does not mean that God's chosen people were
                   to feel free to turn to those nations for help in time of national
                   danger. God is the only true source of help when the enemy
                   threatens. See 2 Chron. 16:1-8.
                      In this part of the lesson we see how Ahaz, king of Judah
                   (about 734 BC) was threatened by two political powers to the
                   north of his kingdom, Syria and Israel (Isa. 7:1).
                      In his concern for national safety he thought of allying him-
                   self with Assyria in order to avert danger. But God sent a mes-
                   sage to him through Isaiah (Isa. 7:3-7). Ahaz was not to worry
                   about human threats, because God had everything in control.
                     To assure Ahaz that God would protect Judah, what did
                   God offer to do? With what response? Isa. 7:10-12.
                       Rather than trust in the omnipotent God, what political
                   alliance did Ahaz form to solve his problem? 2 Kings 16:7-9.
                      Ahaz made a serious mistake in allying two governments
                   built on diametrically opposing principles. Judah was grounded
                   in God's law which made God central in the life, resulting in
                   impartial love to man. Self was god in Assyria, and cruelty to
                   man was commonplace.
                     What important counsel did the prophet give Ahaz and his
                   people who wished to rely on Assyria? Isa. 8:12, 13.
                      Ahaz came under the rebuke of God because he chose to
                   trust in a heathen power for help rather than in the Lord, the
                   true Ruler. This double allegiance was designated by God as
                   spiritual adultery. See Eze. 16:14, 15, 17. Isaiah appealed for
                   freedom from any compromising entanglements.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I have any connections with unbelievers which tend
                   to draw me away from Christ? See 2 Cor. 6:14-18. Should I
                   cut all relationships with those not of my faith? John 17:15
                   helps to clarify this question.

Righteousness Exalts a Nation LESSON 7                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   February 11

        Part 4   What spiritual factor was important to Israel's civil suc-
     NATIONS cess?
                 "If you obey the voice of the Lord your God, being careful
  UNDER GOD'S to do all his commandments which I command you this day,
     CONTROL the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations of
                 the earth" (Deut. 28:1, RSV).
                     Governments have been ordained by God for the happiness
                 of human life. See Rom. 13:1. Governments rule in the sphere of
                 the second table of the law to provide orderly social life. Gov-
                 ernments may not know of the Creator, but they are respon-
                 sible nevertheless for the just care of their peoples and fair
                 dealings with other nations. Violation of the principle under-
                 girding the second table of the law by any government is sow-
                 ing the seeds of its own destruction. This is the lesson of his-
                 tory.
                     "To understand these things,—to understand that righteous-
                 ness exalteth a nation' . . . ,—this is to understand the philos-
                 ophy of history....
                     "In the word of God only is this clearly set forth. Here is
                 shown that the strength of nations, as of individuals, is not
                  found in the opportunities or facilities that appear to make
                  them invincible; it is not found in their boasted greatness. It is
                  measured by the fidelity with which they fulfill God's purpose."
                 —Prophets and Kings, p. 502.
                      Because Ahaz and the nation failed to trust God, what did
                  God permit the "ally" to do? Isa. 8:7, 8.
                      Although God overruled the invasions of Assyria to dis-
                  cipline sinful Judah, what really motivated the Assyrians?
                 Isa. 10:5-14.
                     The Assyrians developed an efficient army, including siege
                  machines and cavalry. They were cruel to the conquered, at
                  times decapitating, piling their heads at the gates of the ruined
                  city, or impaling the victims on stakes. Spared captives were
                  stripped naked at times to be led away. Entire populations were
                  often transplanted. The arrogant Assyrians reflected the spirit
                  of Satan. No government built on human slaughter can long
                  exist.
THINK IT THROUGH      What are my aims in life? Is it sometimes necessary to
                  "tread on a few toes" to establish a principle?
                      "A well-nigh universal disregard of the law of Jehovah is
                  rapidly making the world like the cities of Sodom and Gomor-
                  rah. ... Iniquity and crime of every order are found in the high

           Part 5   Why did Hezekiah believe that Judah (loyal to God at
A GOD IN ISRAEL this time) would not be subjugated by Assyria?
                      "Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed
                   for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with
                   him: for there be more with us than with him: with him is
                   an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us,
                   and to fight our battles" (2 Chron. 32:7, 8).
                      Approximately a hundred years earlier God had been gra-
                   cious to the Assyrian nation through the preaching of Jonah.
                   But Assyria had long since lost the fear of God and was now
                   attempting the conquest of Judah, the remnant of God's peo-

                      "The rulers of Assyria, instead of using their unusual bless-
                   ings for the benefit of mankind, became the scourge of many
                   lands. Merciless, with no thought of God or their fellow men,

                   above the Most High. God had sent Jonah to them with a
                   message of warning, and for a season they humbled them-
                   selves before the Lord of hosts and sought forgiveness. But
                   soon they turned again to idol worship and to the conquest of
                   the world."—Prophets and Kings, p. 363.
                       In his last invasion of Palestine what boastful message
                   did Sennacherib send to the Hebrew nation in an attempt to
                   frighten the people into surrender? Isa. 36:18-20.
                      Sennacherib was diverted with part of his force to meet an
                   Egyptian army advancing into Palestine from the south. Before
                   the other portion of his army besieged Jerusalem, he sent an-
                   other challenge in the form of a letter.
                      What was the substance of Hezekiah's prayer as he spread

                      "He [God] has often permitted matters with nations, with

                   terference might become marked. Then He has let the fact be

                      To what pinnacle of self-adulation had Nineveh and As-
                   syria reached a century and a half after Jonah? Zeph. 2:15.
                      In this proud boast, "I am, and there is none beside me,"
                   the Assyrians usurped the place of God and violated the first
                   table of the law. Satan was speaking again through this earthly
                   power.
                      The book of Nahum announces the day of judgment on
                   Nineveh and Assyria. What statement does God make three
                   times? What is the significance of the repetition? Nahum
                   1:2, 3.
                      God is jealous in the sense that He will not accept a divided
                   allegiance. Once Nineveh had repented and had turned to
                   Him. But in time the Assyrians went back to their idolatry, be-
                   coming merciless in their conquests of other peoples. The
                   blood of their inhuman slaughters called for justice.
                      How effective would be the final destruction of the As-
                   syrians and their capital? Nahum 1:8-10, 14.
                      So closely did Assyria assimilate the proud, self-centered
                   spirit of Satan that its judgment of total extinction is a type
                   of the final eradication of sin. Sin will never arise again, be-
                   cause "a tested and proved creation will never again be turned
                   from allegiance to Him whose character has been fully mani-
                   fested before them as fathomless love and infinite wisdom."

                      In 612 BC the combined armies of Nabopolassar and Cyax-
                   ares, kings of Babylon and of the Medes respectively, attacked
                   Nineveh. In three months the city fell. Assyria's day of grace

       HEAVEN
                   As the Assyrian power vanished in the Near East near the
                close of the seventh century BC, the neo-Babylonian Empire
                arose under Nabopolassar and his son Nebuchadnezzar to fill
                the political vacuum. It was during the reign of the latter that
                God revealed to him through the prophet Daniel that there was
                a God in heaven who was in control of the rise and fall of politi-
                cal kingdoms until the end of human history when God himself
                would establish His eternal kingdom.
                   What was the substance of Nebuchadnezzar's dream which
                none could tell him except God's prophet? Dan. 2:31-35.
                     Give Daniel's brief but comprehensive interpretation of
                 the dream. With what kingdom did it begin? Dan. 2:36-45.
                    It has been generally accepted by Christians that the image
                 of Nebuchadnezzar's dream depicted the four world kingdoms
                 of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. The division of
                 the Roman Empire, symbolized by the iron and clay and repre-
                 senting the nations of Western Europe, would be followed by
                 the destruction of all human kingdoms and the setting up of
                 the divine rule over the earth.
                    Thus in a sweeping prophetic portrayal we are informed of
                 the outcome of the great controversy between the principles
                 of righteousness and of evil—between God and Satan—as it
                 is being fought out in the political arena of human life.
                     How were these four powers, and the division of the
                 fourth, depicted to Daniel on a later occasion? Dan. 7:1-7,
                 15-18, 23, 24.
                    Daniel 2 presents a simple outline of succeeding powers.
                 But Daniel 7 portrays them as wild, rapacious beasts and dis-
                 closes the satanic endeavor to work through these kingdoms.
                 Haughty and despotic at times, they acted as though they were
                 not amenable to either God or man. At times God revealed His
                 principles of righteousness to their leaders by His representa-
                 tives with some success.
THINK IT THROUGH     Why are political powers not permanent? What is the spir-
                 itual dimension to human government?
                     Babylon, which "seemed so stable and enduring, . . . has
                 perished. . . . So perished the Medo-Persian kingdom, and the
                 kingdoms of Grecia and Rome. And so perishes all that has
                 not God for its foundation. Only that which is bound up with
                 His purpose, and expresses His character, can endure. His
                 principles are the only steadfast things our world knows."—

          Part 2 As captives required to study in the schools of Babylon,
LOYALTY TO GOD what did Daniel and his friends decide to do about the king's
                   diet supplied to them?
                      "But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
                   himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine
                   which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the
                   eunuchs that he might not defile himself" (Dan. 1:8).
                       At the outset of Daniel's captivity the lesser officers of the
                   Babylonian court were given an example of fidelity to the law
                   of the God of heaven by Daniel and his three friends. Although
                   the Bible does not mention the other royal captives of Judah,
                   we have this record that Daniel and his friends chose not to
                   eat the king's food.
                       "A portion having been offered to idols, the food from the
                   king's table was consecrated to idolatry; and one partaking of
                   it would be regarded as offering homage to the gods of Baby-
                   lon. In such homage, loyalty to Jehovah forbade Daniel and
                   his companions to join. Even a mere pretense of eating the
                   food or drinking the wine would be a denial of their faith. To
                   do this would be to array themselves with heathenism, and to
                   dishonor the principles of the law of God."—Prophets and
                   Kings, p. 481.
                      While the prince of the eunuchs was unwilling to change
                   their diet, what plan did Daniel courteously present to Melzar
                   who had the immediate charge of them? Dan. 1:11-16.
                     What success did these young men attain in their studies
                   under the Babylonians? Dan. 1:17-20.
                       "They followed the rules of life that could not fail to give
                   them strength of intellect. They sought to acquire knowledge
                   for one purpose—that they might honor God. They realized that
                   in order to stand as representatives of true religion amid the
                   false religions of heathenism they must have clearness of in-
                   tellect and must perfect a Christian character. . . . Constantly
                   praying, conscientiously studying, keeping in touch with the

                      "As in the case of Daniel, in exact proportion as the spir-
                   itual character is developed, the intellectual capabilities are
                   increased. He who loves God with all his heart and his neigh-

           Part 3 What satanic principle did Nebuchadnezzar display in his
      OBEDIENCE angry command to the three Hebrew young men?
     VINDICATED   "Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, 0
                 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my
                 gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
                 . . . If ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into
                 the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God
                 that shall deliver you out of my hands?" (Dan. 3:14, 15).
                     "Force is the last resort of every false religion. At first it
                 tries attraction, as the king of Babylon tried the power of music
                 and outward show. If these attractions, invented by men in-
                 spired by Satan, failed to make men worship the image, the
                 hungry flames of the furnace were ready to consume them."
                 —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
                 p. 976.
                     What was the significance of the king's building an image
                 entirely of gold and commanding its worship? Dan. 3:1-6.
                     When Daniel revealed the king's forgotten dream and gave
                 its meaning, Nebuchadnezzar was amazed and openly acknowl-
                 edged "your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings" (Dan.
                 2:47). But his pride eventually reasserted itself. The dream
                 indicated that Babylon was only a head of gold—that it would
                 pass away. He would make an entire image of gold—like the
                 one he had seen in the dream—"symbolic throughout of Baby-
                 lon as an eternal, indestructible, all-powerful kingdom, which
                 should break in pieces all other kingdoms and stand forever."
                 —Prophets and Kings, p. 504. This was a defiant act inspired
                 by Satan.
                     How was the true God signally honored before that vast

The Rise and Fall of Empires LESSON 8                                ❑   Wednesday
                                                                         February 18

        Part 4   While Satan "the prince of this world" (John 12:31) and
    RULERS BY mighty men seem to govern earth's affairs, who truly rules,
               working out His purposes?
   PERMISSION
                      "To the intent that the living may know that the most
                   High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom-
                   soever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men" (Dan.
                   4:17).
                       The great moral controversy between God and Satan greatly
                   complicates for human understanding the affairs of this world.
                   Satan, prince of this world by usurpation, seeks to rule and
                   control the earth through various kingdoms and agencies. Be-
                   cause of the nature of the controversy, God, the rightful Ruler,
                   permits Satan's operations, for thus the fruits of the satanic
                   principles are demonstrated. On the other hand God must limit
                   Satan by His divine intervention lest Satan totally corrupt and
                   destroy the race. God also rules by initiating events to disclose
                   the principles of righteousness.
                       "God has revealed in His law the principles that underlie
                   all true prosperity both of nations and of individuals. 'This is
                   your wisdom and your understanding,' Moses declared to the
                   Israelites of the law of God. 'It is not a vain thing for you; be-
                   cause it is your life.' Deuteronomy 4:6; 32:47. The blessings
                   thus assured to Israel are, on the same conditions and in the
                   same degree, assured to every nation and every individual....
                      "The power exercised by every ruler on the earth is Heaven-
                   imparted; and upon his use of the power thus bestowed, his
                   success depends."—Education, p. 174.
                      How did God illustrate to Nebuchadnezzar the true pur-
                   pose of government and the secret of political success? Dan.
                   4:19-27. Note especially verse 21.
                      Ellen White, commenting on the philosophy of history, noted
                   that a nation's strength is related to its fulfillment of the purpose
                   of God. She observed that Nebuchadnezzar was symbolized by
                   a large tree, and that the purposes served by the tree repre-
                   sent "the character of a government that fulfills God's purpose
                   —a government that protects and upbuilds the nation."—Edu-

THINK IT THROUGH      What part did loyal witnessing have to do with the con-
                   version of the king, or was it due only to the acts of God?
                      "King Nebuchadnezzar, before whom Daniel so often hon-
                   ored the name of God, was finally thoroughly converted, and
                   learned to 'praise and extol and honour the King of heaven.' "

                       In what way did this haughty pride involve the violation
                   of the first table of the law? Jer. 50:14, 24, 29, 38.
                      In what manner did this same despotic spirit violate the
                   principle undergirding the second table of the law? Isa.
                   14:4-6; Hab. 2:5, 12.
                       In these portrayals of Babylon we do not see "the glory of
                   the kingdoms" (Isa. 13:19), but we see the "lion"—proud, des-
                   potic, and cruel—reflecting the attributes of the devil who sim-
                   ilarly walks about "seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8).
                       "Instead of being a protector of men, Babylon became a
                   proud and cruel oppressor. The words of Inspiration picturing
                   the cruelty and greed of rulers in Israel reveal the secret of
                   Babylon's fall and of the fall of many another kingdom since
                   the world began."—Education, p. 176.
                      Although Satan largely controlled Babylon, what did God
                   seek to do for its rulers and peoples? Jer. 51:9.
                      Since Israel as a nation was in apostasy, God's acts in be-
                   half of Babylon had to be done through individuals. "Yet
                   through the very humiliations that Israel's departure from Him
                   had invited, God gave Babylon evidence of His supremacy, of
                   the holiness of His requirements, and of the sure results of
                   obedience. And this testimony He gave, as alone it could be

        Part 6  What was Babylon's last impious act performed by Bel-

   OF WRONG-    "But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
       DOING they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and
                   thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have

                   is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified" (Dan.
                   5:23).
                      Whose vessels were used? Dan. 5:1-4.
                        "In that last night of mad folly, Belshazzar and his lords had
                   filled up the measure of their guilt and the guilt of the Chaldean
                   kingdom. No longer could God's restraining hand ward off the
                   impending evil, Through manifold providences, God had sought
                   to teach them reverence for His law.... Because of the strange
                   perversity of the human heart, God had at last found it nec-
                   essary to pass the irrevocable sentence. Belshazzar was to fall,
                   and his kingdom was to pass into other hands."—Prophets and
                   Kings, p. 530.
                       What act of God suddenly threw the blasphemous revelry
                   into confusion? Dan. 5:5-9.
                      "Hushed was the boisterous mirth, while men and women,
                   seized with nameless terror, watched the hand slowly tracing
                   the mysterious characters. Before them passed, as in pano-
                   ramic view, the deeds of their evil lives; they seemed to be
                   arraigned before the judgment bar of the eternal God."—Proph-
                   ets and Kings, p. 524.
                      Before interpreting the strange words, what history did
                   Daniel recall to the king? What should he have learned from
                   this? Dan. 5:18-24.
                      What was the meaning of the strange words written on

                  it, Arise, devour much flesh" (Dan. 7:5).
                      See also Dan. 8:3, 4, 20.
                      These are the prophetic descriptions of Medo-Persia, the
                  early dual nature of the monarchy being symbolized by the
                  manner of the bear's rising. The three ribs represent Lydia
                  (Asia Minor), Babylon, and Egypt—the three principal areas of

                      What plan which appealed to the pride of Darius the
                  Mede was devised by jealous underlings to destroy Daniel,
                  the leading president? Dan. 6:4-15. See Eph. 6:12.
                      "In the conspiracy thus formed, Satan had played an impor-
                  tant part. The prophet was high in command in the kingdom,
                  and evil angels feared that his influence would weaken their
                  control over its rulers. It was these satanic agencies who had
                  stirred the princes to envy and jealousy; it was they who had
                  inspired the plan for Daniel's destruction."—Prophets and
                  Kings, p. 540.
                      God overruled the satanic plot by such a marvelous deliver-
                  ance (Dan. 6:16-23), that not only was Darius constrained to
                  inform his entire dominion of the God of Daniel (6:25-27), but
                  Cyrus the Great, who shortly succeeded him, was impressed
                  to do just what Satan wished to prevent.
                      What predictions had God made about Cyrus about 150
                  years before his conquest of Babylon? Isa. 44:28; 45:1-5, 13.
                     "The deliverance of Daniel from the den of lions had been
                  used of God to create a favorable impression upon the mind of
                  Cyrus the Great."—Prophets and Kings, p. 557.
                     In response to these prophecies of Isaiah, what decree
                  did King Cyrus issue? Ezra 1:1-4.
                     In this incident we have a striking example of an earthly
                 kingdom openly and willingly responding to and cooperating
                 with the will of God. Without the intervention of God the cap-

                 of salvation, but the participation of a Persian ruler forwarded it.

                                                                      February 23

         Part 2  How did the Samaritans attempt to hinder the returning
  GOD PROVIDES Jews from building the temple as commanded by Cyrus?
                      "Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the
                   people of Judah, and troubled them in building, and hired
                   counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the
                   days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius
                   king of Persia" (Ezra 4:4, 5).
                      Cyrus issued his decree in the summer of 537 BC. After
                   organizing the return, the exiles under Zerubbabel probably
                   started homeward in the spring of 536 BC. In the fall they set
                   up the altar, kept the Feast of Tabernacles, and submitted their
                   orders for material to the proper Persian officials (Ezra 3:1-7).
                   The following year the temple cornerstone and the foundation
                   were laid (Ezra 3:8-13).
                      At this time the Samaritans requested permission to join
                   the Jews in building the temple, but they were refused (4:1-3).
                   They retaliated with continuous attempts to halt the work and
                   to hinder the Jews from establishing themselves. They hired
                   legal help to work at court to prevent the implementation of
                   the decree.
                      How did Daniel react to opposition to the restoration of the
                   nation and the temple? Dan. 10:2, 3.
                     After three weeks of earnest prayer by Daniel, Gabriel
                   appeared. What had he been doing? Dan. 10:12, 13.
                      Supernatural forces operate behind the scenes. "While Satan
                   was striving to influence the highest powers in the kingdom of
                   Medo-Persia to show disfavor to God's people, angels worked
                   in behalf of the exiles. . . . Through the prophet Daniel we are
                   given a glimpse of this mighty struggle between the forces of
                   good and the forces of evil. For three weeks Gabriel wrestled
                   with the powers of darkness, seeking to counteract the influ-
                   ences at work on the mind of Cyrus; and before the contest
                   closed, Christ Himself came to Gabriel's aid. . . . The victory
                   was finally gained."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 571, 572.
THINK IT THROUGH     Does the work of the Lord seem hindered in your area?
                   What can you do to get it moving again?
                      "Prayer moves the arm of Omnipotence. He who marshals
                   the stars in order in the heavens, whose word controls the
                   waves of the great deep, the same infinite Creator will work
                   in behalf of His people if they call upon Him in faith. He will
                   restrain the forces of darkness until the warning is given to
                   the world and all who will heed it are prepared for the conflict."

         Part 3  Through a series of strange events, who found herself in
          GOD a position of influence at a critical time for Israel?
     OVERRULES      "For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and
                 deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but
                 you and your father's house will perish. And who knows
                 whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time
                 as this?" (Esther 4:14, RSV).
                     "Occasions of indulgence such as are pictured in the first
                 chapter of Esther, do not glorify God. But the Lord accom-
                 plishes His will through men who are nevertheless misleading
                 others....
                     "Through the experience that brought Esther to the Medo-
                 Persian throne, God was working for the accomplishment of
                 His purposes for His people. That which was done under the
                 influence of much wine worked out for good to Israel."—Ellen

                     Mordecai's ancestors were part of the 10,000 captives Nebu-
                 chadnezzar took into captivity in 597 BC along with their king,
                 Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) (see Esther 2:6). He, and many other
                 dispersed Jews, did not return to Palestine but continued to
                 live in Mesopotamia.
                     Ahasuerus (known in secular history as Xerxes; 486-465 BC)
                 ruled a far-flung empire, some 3000 miles from east to west
                 (Esther 1:1). Esther apparently entered the Persian court soon
                 after his return from his defeat at the hands of the Greeks
                 (Salamis, 480 BC).
                     What plot did Haman, a high official in the court, persuade
                 Ahasuerus to decree? Why? Esther 3:5, 6, 8-11, 13.
                     Haman simply reflected the thoughts and intents of another.
                 "Satan himself, the hidden instigator of the scheme, was trying
                 to rid the earth of those who preserved the knowledge of the
                 true God."—Prophets and Kings, p. 601.

                     "The decree that will finally go forth against the remnant
                 people of God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus
                 against the Jews. Today the enemies of the true church see
                 in the little company keeping the Sabbath commandment, a
                 Mordecai at the gate. The reverence of God's people for His
                 law is a constant rebuke to those who have cast off the fear

God's True People LESSON 9                                       ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   February 25

        Part 4  What three Persian rulers made and implemented decrees
  DECREES AND which eventually restored the Jewish state?
     PROPHETS   "And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered
                   through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zecha-
                   riah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, ac-
                   cording to the commandment of the God of Israel, and accord-
                   ing to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes
                   king of Persia" (Ezra 6:14).
                      Although neither Cyrus nor his son Cambyses counter-
                   manded the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, the anti-
                   temple policy of the False Smerdis resulted in halting the
                   work. In the latter part of August, 520 BC, approximately 16
                   years after the decree of Cyrus, Haggai the prophet was in-
                   spired to encourage the leaders and people to arise and com-
                   plete the temple. Two months later Zechariah also gave mes-
                   sages to encourage the people.
                       When Tatnai, governor of the region, inquired of Darius I
                   if the Jews had a right to build as they claimed, what further
                   decree did this monarch make? Ezra 6:6-13.
                      With this implementation in 519 BC the Jews speedily fin-
                   ished the temple, dedicating it in 515 BC (Ezra 6:15).
                      Under the reign of Artaxerxes I what final political rights
                   did the nation receive? Ezra 7:13, 14, 24-26.

                      From his title it would appear that Ezra was an official in
                   charge of Jewish affairs in the imperial court. He was com-
                   missioned to take back to Palestine all Jews who wished to
                   go, and to reorganize the nation's judicial system along the
                   lines of the mosaic code with full authority over life and death.
                   Thus the Jewish state (under Persian sovereignty) was fully
                   restored. The decree of Artaxerxes was made in 457 BC, be-
                   coming operative in the early fall of that same year. This im-
                   portant date became the starting point of Daniel's time prophecy
                   of the first advent of the Messiah (Dan. 9:25).
                     In 444 BC, 13 years later, whoni did Artaxerxes send as
                   governor of Judah to rebuild Jerusalem? Neh. 2:1-8.

                   but make the iron hot by striking. Slow, easy, indolent move-
                   ments will do nothing for us in this work. We must be instant
                   in season, out of season. These are critical times for work. By
                   hesitation and delay we lose many good opportunities."—Evan-

                                                                     February 26

          Part 5  What world empire succeeded the power of Medo-Persia?
  PREPARATION     "Another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule
       FOR THE over all the earth" (Dan. 2:39).
  FIRST ADVENT    "After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which
                 had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had
                 also four heads; and dominion was given to it" (Dan. 7:6).
                     How was it described in another vision? What did the
                 "great horn" and the "four notable ones" represent? Dan.
                 8:5-8, 21, 22.
                     At this point in the prophecies of Daniel we enter into the
                 silent span of the intertestamental period. There are no inspired
                 writers, and so we are not given any insight into the contro-
                 versy between God and Satan at this time. Malachi, the last of
                 the Old Testament prophets (about 425 BC), presents a dis-
                 couraging picture of a sin-blinded, complacent Israel who re-
                 fuses correction.
                     Daniel 2, 7, and 8 predict the rise of Grecia. The latter proph-
                 ecy names the empire and refers to its first king, Alexander
                 the Great, and the subsequent divisions of his conquests.
                     "The conquest of the ancient East by Alexander the Great
                 (331 B.C.) was followed by a more permanent cultural invasion
                 by Greek language, customs, ideas, and religion. Eventually,
                 attempts by Antiochus Epiphanes to Hellenize the Jews, that
                 is, to compel them to adopt Greek culture, provoked the most
                 determined resistance. . . . Led by Judas Maccabaeus and
                 other members of his family, later known as Maccabees or
                 Hasmonaeans, the Jews heroically defeated the forces of An-
                 tiochus and secured their own freedom (164 B.C.). Among the
                 Jews, particularly those of the more wealthy and educated
                 classes and those residing beyond the borders of Palestine,
                 there was a gradual tendency to adopt Greek culture. Such
                 Jews were known as Hellenists and constituted the liberal ele-
                 ment of Jewish society. But most of those who lived in Judea
                 clung tenaciously to the customs and religion of their fore-
                 fathers."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 51.
                     While Satan sought to corrupt the true faith through the
                 spreading of Greek culture, God was overruling. Greek became
                 the common language of the Mediterranean world, thus provid-
                 ing a widely understood tongue for the broad distribution of
                 the Scriptures and facilitating communication between diverse
                 peoples. Without violating man's will, God was preparing the
                 world for the spread of Christianity.
THINK IT THROUGH     How should I line up my life's energies, seeing that the
                 cause of God will ultimately triumph?

         Part 6 What world kingdom succeeded the Grecian? What aspects
   ROME AND of this power are particularly noted?
 GOD'S PEOPLE   "And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron: . . .
               and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces
               and bruise" (Dan. 2:40).
                    "And behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and
               strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured
               and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet
               of it" (Dan. 7:7).
                    "Rome won her territory by the force or the fear of her
               armed might. . . . Crushing one opponent after another, she
               finally became the aggressive, irresistible conqueror of the Med-
               iterranean world and Western Europe."—SDA Bible Commen-
               tary, on Dan. 2:40.
                    Under the symbol of a little horn what land did Rome sub-
                jugate? How was it treated? Dan. 8:9, 10, 24.
                    Palestine became a part of the Empire of Rome in 63 BC.
               Some 12,000 Jews alone were slain in Pompey's capture of the
                temple site. Later revolts cost the lives of others. Herod the
                Great's reconquest of the Jews (40-37 BC) resulted in further
                carnage. The land lay under the bloody hand of the wily Edo-
                mite who did not scruple to destroy Bethlehem's infants if per-
                chance he might destroy Jesus, an apparent rival.
                      According to Gabriel, when would the Messiah appear,
                minister, and die? Dan. 9:25-27.
                    Applying the year-day principle, we find that the period of
                sixty-nine weeks (483 days = years) from the fall of 457 BC
                (Artaxerxes' decree restoring the Jewish state) extends to the
                autumn of AD 27, when Jesus was baptized by water and the
                 Holy Spirit and began His official ministry as the Messiah.
                 After a ministry of three and one half years, Jesus was cruci-
                 fied by Roman authority in the spring of AD 31; but His dis-
                 ciples continued to preach to the Jews until AD 34, at which
                 time the gospel was also given to the Gentiles.
                    Satan's attempts, through Rome, to crush the true faith—
                 and the Messiah as well—were foiled. The iron legions which
                 broke all national resistance also brought political unity to the
                 empire from Britain to the Euphrates. The Jewish religion was
                 given legal status. Well-established roads and routes of travel,
                 together with the freedom and safety to move at all times, pro-
                 vided the climate for the rapid spread of Christianity in the
                 apostolic age.
THINK IT THROUGH . Why is it that heavy oppression often forwards God's cause
                 instead of hindering it?

         Part 1      According to Paul's prediction how did the "man of sin"
       A FALSE    system come into existence?
         CLAIM       "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall
                 not come, except there come a falling away first, and that
                 man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth
                 and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is
                 worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,
                 shewing himself that he is God" (2 Thess. 2:3, 4).
                     Satan first continued his controversy with God on a large
                 scale through pagan nations whom he sought to control. In the
                 Christian era he brought about a compromised form of the
                 Christian religion/through which he has influenced the lives
                 of millions.
                     From early times Christians have recognized that the "little
                 horn" (Daniel 7), "the man of sin" (2 Thessalonians 2), and the
                 leopardlike beast (Revelation 13) depict the same power.
                     "This compromise between paganism and Christianity re-
                 sulted in the development of 'the man of sin' foretold in proph-
                 ecy as opposing and exalting himself above God. That gigantic
                 system of false religion is a masterpiece of Satan's power—a
                  monument of his efforts to seat himself upon the throne to rule
                  the earth according to his will."—The Great Controversy, p. 50.
                     What clues does Daniel provide to identify this power?
                 Dan. 7:8, 20, 21, 24, 25.
                     Note the following: (1) Location: It would rise in Western
                 Europe (among the ten horns). (2) Time: It would rise "after
                 them," that is, sometime subsequent to AD 476, the date as-
                 signed for Western Rome's final dissolution. (3) Its rise would
                 succeed the overthrow of three of the other horn powers. (4)
                 It would differ from the other horns in that it deals also with
                 religious matters. (5) It would be a blaspheming power speak-
                 ing "great words against the most High." (6) It would be a
                 persecuting power which would "wear out the saints of the
                 most High." (7) This power would hold supremacy for a sym-
                 bolic "time and times and the dividing of time," interpreted in
                 Revelation as 1260 symbolic days, that is, 1260 literal years
                 (Rev. 12:6, 14).
                     These identifying marks do not deal with personalities, but
                 point unerringly to the papal system, a church organization
                  which developed out of Christianity, and whose bishop was
                  legally recognized as the head of Christendom in the sixth
                 century.
THINK IT THROUGH     Why would Satan be more successful working through a
                 Christian organization than through pagan nations?
                     "The path of error often appears to lie close to the path of

         Part 2   "And he shall . . . think to change times and laws" (Dan.

      SABBATH     "And it cast down the truth to the ground; and it prac-
                  ticed, and prospered" (Dan. 8:12).
                     Daniel 7 covers the same ground as Daniel 2, but with
                  emphasis on the fourth beast and its little horn and the heav-
                  enly judgment scene. Daniel 8 covers essentially the same area
                  with its little horn representing both the pagan and papal
                - phases of Rome.

                     Satan in heaven challenged the law of God. Through the
                  Christian church how has he continued this attack?
                     "'The Pope is of so great authority and power that he can
                modify, explain, or interpret even divine laws' . . . (translated
                from Lucius Ferraris, 'Papa II,' Prompta Bibliotheca, Vol. VI,
                pp. 25-29)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Dan. 7:25 (p. 831).
                     The most important _change Rome has attempted to make in
                 the Ten Commandments has been that of promoting Sunday
                 sacredness in place of the seventh-day Sabbath.
                     Historical records indicate that "the church at Rome early
                 developed a preference for Sunday; and the increasing im-
                 portance attached to Sunday in the early church, at the ex-
                 pense of the Sabbath, closely parallels Rome's gradual rise to
                 power.... Roman influence prevailed to make the observance
                 of Sunday a matter of church law, as it did with many other
                 practices such as the worship of Mary, the veneration of saints
                 and angels, the use of images, and prayers for the dead."—
                 SDA Bible Commentary, on Dan. 7:25 (p. 833).
                      Why would Satan seek to make an attack upon the fourth
                 commandment? Ex. 20:8-11.
                      "The great apostate . . . had dared to change the only pre-
                  cept of the divine law that unmistakably points all mankind to
                  the true and living God. In the fourth commandment, God is
                  revealed as the Creator. . . . It was as a memorial of the work
                  of creation that the seventh day was sanctified as a rest day

        FALSE  (Dan. 7:25).
     TEACHING     "And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to
                   blaspheme his name" (Rev. 13:6).
                       Blasphemy may be defined as an indignity offered to God in
                   words, writing, etc., or in claiming the attributes or preroga-
                   tives of the Deity.
                      According to the prophecies, of what would the Christian
                   apostasy be guilty?
                      In his original charges Satan questioned the character of
                   God and misrepresented the Deity to the angels and the other
                   intelligent beings in the universe. Through the Christian apos-
                   tasy he continues to distort God's character.
                       What position does the leadership of this apostasy assume
                   in Christendom? 2 Thess. 2:4.
                      Since this Christian apostasy claims to represent God on
                   earth, it is evident that its acts and teachings will be regarded
                   by the multitudes as reflecting the character of the Christian's
                   God.
                      Such non-Scriptural doctrines as eternal torment, limbo, and
                   purgatory distort the divine character into that of a tyrant.
                   The hundreds of years of intolerance and persecution likewise
                   belie God's true character, and that spirit still prevails.
                      "It is Satan's constant effort to misrepresent the character
                   of God, the nature of sin, and the real issues at stake in the
                   great controversy. His sophistry lessens the obligation of the
                   divine law and gives men license to sin. At the same time he
                   causes them to cherish false conceptions of God so that they
                   regard Him with fear and hate rather than with love. The cruelty
                   inherent in his own character is attributed to the Creator; it is
                   embodied in systems of religion and expressed in modes of
                   worship."—The Great Controversy, p.. 569.

                   the teachings of the apostasy which distorts the divine char-
                   acter? Rev. 17:1, 2, 4. See also 1 Cor. 11:25.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is the Christian apostasy so appealing to the minds
                   of millions both educated and uneducated?
                      "The papacy . . . is prepared for two classes of mankind,
                   embracing nearly the whole world—those who would be saved
                   by their merits, and those who would be saved in their sins.

  A FALSE ROLE called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth
                   in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God"
                   (2 Thess. 2:4).
                      The papacy has always been characterized by its extensive
                   claims to speak and act for God.
                      Writes a Roman authority: "'The pope is of so great dignity
                   and so exalted that he is not a mere man, but as it were God,
                   and the vicar of God....
                      "'The Pope is crowned with a triple crown, as king of
                   heaven and of earth and of the lower regions' . . . (translated
                   from Lucius Ferraris, 'Papa II,' Prompta Bibliotheca, Vol. VI,
                   pp. 25-29)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Dan. 7:25 (p. 831).
                      The apostasy has arrogated to itself the power to absolve
                   sins, a right belonging only to God (Luke 5:20, 21). It has in-
                   terposed a human priesthood between God and man, asserting
                   that divine grace is to be found in the sacraments administered
                   by that priesthood. Other un-Biblical assumptions include papal
                   infallibility and the claim of the priesthood to be able to change
                   bread and wine into the literal body and blood of Christ in the
                   mass.
                      How extensively has this Christian apostasy controlled
                   mankind religiously and politically in the past? What is proph-
                   esied of the future? Rev. 13:3, 7, 8.
                       "The Roman Catholic Church, with all its ramifications
                   throughout the world, forms one vast organization under the
                   control, and designed to serve the interests, of the papal see.
                   Its millions of communicants, in every country on the globe,
                   are instructed to hold themselves as bound in allegiance to
                   the pope....
                       "History testifies of her artful and persistent efforts to in-
                   sinuate herself into the affairs of nations; and having gained
                   a foothold, to further her own aims, even at the ruin of princes
                   and people."—The Great Controversy, p. 580.            -
                       The usurpation of authority over the lives and consciences
                   of others reflects the continuing aim of Satan to assert his
                   independence of God.

                                                                        March 4

         Part 5    "Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host,
         FALSE and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place
                of his sanctuary was cast down. And an host was given him
     MEDIATION against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it
                 cast down the truth to the ground" (Dan. 8:11, 12).
                      "And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God . . .
                 and his tabernacle" (Rev. 13:6).
                      According to these prophecies what would the Christian
                 apostasy take away, cast down, and blaspheme?
                     The Hebrew word translated "daily" is tamid and has the
                 sense of "continual." It is often used in connection with the
                 earthly sanctuary with reference to the continual functioning
                 of the altars, the lamps, and the table of shewbread. Thus the
                 phrase "daily sacrifice" stands for the ministration in the
                 sanctuary.
                     Since the "little horn" of Daniel 8 represents Rome in both
                 its pagan and its papal phases, the casting down of the sanc-
                 tuary could refer to either the earthly type or the heavenly
                 reality. However, since the Christian apostasy occurred in the
                 Christian era, the emphasis of the prophecy is upon the heav-
                 enly sanctuary (see Heb. 8:1, 2) and Christ's priestly ministra-
                 tion there.
                     "Pagan Rome took away the 'daily,' and cast down the
                 sanctuary. But pagan Rome was succeeded by papal Rome,
                 which in just as marked a manner has 'taken way' the 'daily'
                 ministry of Christ in His heavenly sanctuary. Christ 'ever liveth
                 to make intercession' for those who 'come unto God by Him.'
                 . . . But the papacy has called attention away from the heav-
                 enly intercessor and His sanctuary ministry, and focused it.on
                 a system of salvation by works, on the confessional, and on
                 the sacrifice of the mass instead of on Christ's mediation as
                 our High Priest in heaven. The system has almost completely
                 diverted attention from Christ as mediator and has deprived
                 men of the benefits of His ministry, and thus has 'trodden
                 down' or defiled the sanctuary."—T. H. Jemison, Christian
                 Beliefs, (Pacific Press, 1959), p. 217.
                     Satan originally charged that God could not be both just
                 and merciful. But the plan of salvation marvelously blends these
                 two attributes. Hence, his warfare continues through the apos-
                 tasy to divert earth's millions from a true understanding of the
                 atoning death of Christ and His mediatorial ministry in their
                 behalf. Thus also continues the war against Christ.

                      The papacy acknowledges that it has persecuted, and it de-
                 fends its actions. It has never renounced the use of force. The
                 "Holy Office" of the Inquisition, formally established by Pope
                 Innocent III (1215), became a cruel instrument in the hands of
                 the apostasy to root out dissent. The universe must have
                 watched in horror as professed Christians slaughtered their

                  ception and force. The papal violations of the first table of the

 GOOD AND BAD sowed good seed in his field: but while men slept, his enemy
                   came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
                   But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
                   then appeared the tares also" (Matt. 13:24-26).
                      What instruction did the householder give his servants
                   when they asked if they should weed out the tares? Matt.
                   13:27-30.
                     Summarize Christ's explanation of His parable of the
                   wheat and tares. Matt. 13:37-43.
                      The good seed, sown in the field of the world, springs up as
                   loyal followers of God; that is, true believers in the Christian
                   church. Since the tares are sown among the good seed, the
                   parable presents a picture of the church—all professed fol-
                   lowers of God—but in reality a mixture of genuine and false
                   believers.
                      "The good seed represents those who are born of the word
                   of God, the truth. The tares represent a class who are the fruit
                   or embodiment of error, of false principles. . . .
                      "By bringing into the church those who bear Christ's name
                   while they deny His character, the wicked one causes that
                   God shall be dishonored, the work of salvation misrepresented,
                   and souls imperiled."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 70, 71.
                      Sometimes new Christians are discouraged by the pride and
                   sin which they discover in the church. Nonmembers may be
                   repulsed by some misrepresentation of Christ. Both groups fail
                   to realize that the great moral controversy is reflected in the
                   heart of every human being, even where Christian principles
                   are espoused. "Children of the wicked one" may be professed
                   Christians who reflect the satanic attitudes toward God's law.
                   They are represented as being an offense and as doing "iniq-
                   uity" (verse 41); that is, they are in their words and actions
                   violating the principles of God's law.
                       How long will the evidence of this moral conflict be seen
                   in the church? Matt. 13:30, 39-41.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it that Jesus has authorized the church to disfellow-
                   ship in some instances (Matt. 16:19; 18:15-18), but not in
                   others? Matt. 13:28-30.
                      "Christ has plainly taught that those who persist in open sin
                   must be separated from the church, but He has not committed
                   to us the work of judging character and motive. . . . Should
                   we try to uproot from the church those whom we suppose to

  OF GOODNESS 8:13).
                      The parable dealing with four kinds of soil into which the
                   seed of truth may fall gives us an insight into why some
                   Christians apostatize.
                       What is it that causes spiritual life to die out in the heart
                   of a stony-ground hearer?
                      "Many who make a profession of religion are stony-ground
                   hearers. Like the rock underlying the layer of earth, the selfish-
                   ness of the natural heart underlies the soil of their good de-
                   sires and aspirations. The love of self is not subdued."—Christ's
                   Object Lessons, p. 46.
                       "The effort to serve both self and Christ makes one a stony-
                   ground hearer, and he will not endure when the test comes
                   upon him."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 50.
                       The spirit of self-centeredness, of independence of God, is
                   reflected in some Christians. Such an attitude violates the first
                   table of the law by putting self before God. True conversion
                   brings about a full surrender of the will, a full dependence
                   upon God.
                       "The new birth is a rare experience in this age of the world.
                   This is the reason why there are so many perplexities in the
                   churches. Many, so many, who assume the name of Christ are
                   unsanctified and unholy. They have been baptized, but they
                   were buried alive. Self did not die, and therefore they did not

                       What counsels are given the truly converted to prevent
                   them from becoming tarelike? Heb. 3:12-14; 2 Peter 3:17.
                      "The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect

                   we are in danger of growing careless and of deviating from

                   [He prates] against us with malicious words: . . . neither cloth
                   he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that
                   would, and casteth them out of the church" (3 John 9, 10).
                       Diotrephes was a tare in the church, lording his authority
                   over the members under him. He reflected the haughty spirit of
                   Satan.
                       What desire sometimes created strife even among the
                   Master's twelve disciples? Matt. 18:1; Luke 22:24.
                       "The strife for the highest place was the outworking of that
                   same spirit which was the beginning of the great controversy
                   in the worlds above. . . . Lucifer desired God's power, but not
                   His character. He sought for himself the highest place, and
                   every being who is actuated by his spirit will do the same.
                   Thus alienation, discord, and strife will be inevitable. Dominion
                   becomes the prize of the strongest. The kingdom of Satan is a
                   kingdom of force; every individual regards every other as an
                   obstacle in the way of his own advancement, or a steppingstone
                   on which he himself may climb to a higher place."—The Desire
                   of Ages, pp. 435, 436.
                      What counsel did Christ and the apostle Peter give for
                   those who would be leaders in the church? Matt. 20:26-28;
                   1 Peter 5:1-3.
                       What are some of the qualities of a good pastor? What
                   attitude is to be rejected? John 10:11-13; 1 Thess. 2:3-9; Phil.
                   2:19-21.
                      "Those who occupy the position of undershepherds are to
                   exercise a watchful diligence over the Lord's flock. This is not
                   to be a dictatorial vigilance, but one that tends to encourage
                   and strengthen and uplift....
                      "The spirit of the true shepherd is one of self-forgetfulness.
                   He loses sight of self in order that he may work the works of
                   God."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 526, 527.
THINK IT THROUGH       Why should a Christian not neglect attending the services
                   of the church even if he feels that its leadership is not repre-
                   sentative of the gospel? See Matt. 23:1-3.
                       "While Christ is sowing the good seed, Satan is sowing the
                   tares. There are two opposing influences continually exerted
                   on the members of the church. One influence is working for
                   the purification of the church, and the other for the corrupting
                   of the people of God."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 46.

                                                                         March 10

         Part 4   From time to time how does Satan seek to weaken and to
      DIVISIVE divide the cause of God on earth?
     DOCTRINE     "And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is
                   Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred,
                   saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow
                   the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God stand-
                   eth sure, having this seal, The Lord knovieth them that are
                   his" (2 Tim. 2:17-19).
                       "Christians are often content to rely upon those in the church
                   who are considered special students of the Bible, instead of
                   diligently studying the Scriptures for themselves. Consequently,
                   when error is presented they are often at a loss to distinguish
                   between it and truth."—SDA Bible Commentary, on 2 Tim. 2:18.
                       How do false teachers arrive at their divisive doctrinal
                   teachings which make them very deceptive? 2 Cor. 2:17; 4:1,
                   2; 2 Peter 3:15, 16.
                      A common practice of false teachers who have arisen
                   through the years in the Seventh-day Adventist Church is com-
                   mented on by Ellen White: "It will be found that those who
                   bear false messages will not have a high sense of honor and
                   integrity. They will deceive the people, and mix up with their
                   error the Testimonies of Sister White, and use her name to
                   give influence to their work. They make such selections from
                   the Testimonies as they think they can twist to support their
                   positions, and place them in a setting of falsehood, so that
                   their error may have weight and be accepted by the people."
                   —Testimonies to Ministers, p. 42.
                     Of what have Christians been warned to expect within the
                   church? 2 Peter 2:1-3; 2 Cor. 11:13-15; Matt. 24:24.
                      The introduction of divisive teachings into the ranks of God's
                   people recalls Satan's procedure in heaven of misrepresenting
                   the character of God. This is one way in which the "dragon"
                   makes war with the "remnant" of God's people (Rev. 12:17).

THINK IT THROUGH      As a child of God in what way may I best prepare myself
                   to avoid being deceived by false teachings presented within
                   or without the church?
                      "It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn
                   from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light
                   and encourage others to follow his example. We should day
                   by day study the Bible diligently, weighing every thought and
                   comparing scripture with scripture. With divine help we are to
                   form our opinions for ourselves."—The Great Controversy, p.

           Part 5   When many of the early Christians in Judea were cut off
        LOVE AND from their former employments because of their faith, what
                  unselfish act did Barnabas (and others) do to meet the need?
     SELFISHNESS
                    "And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas,
                 (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite,
                 and of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and brought
                 the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet" (Acts 4:36, 37).
                    Barnabas and his brethren demonstrated the beauty of lives
                 that were in harmony with the divine law. Supreme love for
                 God led them to deny themselves and to show a loving concern
                 for their needy brethren even at personal sacrifice.
                    "Thus it was in the early church; and when in the church of
                 today it is seen that by the power of the Spirit the members
                 have taken their affections from the things of the world, and
                 that they are willing to make sacrifices in order that their fel-
                 lowmen may hear the gospel, the truths proclaimed will have
                 a powerful influence upon the hearers."—The Acts of the
                 Apostles, p. 71.
                     In contrast to the unselfish spirit of Barnabas how did
                 Ananias and Sapphira falsify their giving? Acts 5:1-11.
                    "Infinite Wisdom saw that this signal manifestation of the
                 wrath of God was necessary to guard the young church from
                 becoming demoralized. . . . It was designed as a warning to
                 the church, to lead them to avoid pretense and hypocrisy, and
                 to beware of robbing God."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
                 73, 74.
                     What motivated Demas, a long-time minister, to desert
                 Paul when he was imprisoned in a Roman dungeon? 2 Tim.
                 4:10.
                    "For worldly gain, Demas bartered every high and noble
                 consideration."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 455.
                    In contrast to Demas's perfidy, how did Paul describe the
                 steadfastness of Aquila and Priscilla? Rom. 16:3-5.
                    The experiences of Ananias and Sapphira and of Demas in-
                 dicate that Christianity has never been without its tares. The
                 truth is perfect, but the people are imperfect, revealing the
                 controversy in each life. Christ is the perfect Pattern to emulate
                 (Matt. 16:24).
THINK IT THROUGH     What is the most important thing the Holy Spirit can do for
                 us with respect to the conflict between love and selfishness?
                  "Love to man is the earthward manifestation of the love of
               God. . . . When we love the world as He has loved it, then for
               us His mission is accomplished. We are fitted for heaven; for
               we have heaven in our hearts."—The Desire of Ages, p. 641.

          Part 6      What is the true evidence of discipleship?
 UNITY IN LOVE        "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one
                   another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
                   By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
                   love one to another" (John 13:34, 35).
                      "When men are bound together, not by force or self-interest,
                   but by love, they show the working of an influence that is
                   above every human influence. Where this oneness exists, it is
                   evidence that the image of God is being restored in humanity,
                   that a new principle of life has been implanted. It shows that
                   there is power in the divine nature to withstand the supernat-
                   ural agencies of evil, and that the grace of God subdues the
                   selfishness inherent in the natural heart."—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 678.
                      What is the source of love? Rom. 5:5.
                       "God's law is fulfilled only as men love Him with heart,
                   mind, soul, and strength, and their neighbor as themselves. It
                   is the manifestation of this love that brings glory to God in the
                   highest, and on earth peace and good will to men. The Lord
                   is glorified when the great end of His law is attained. It is the
                   work of the Holy Spirit from age to age to impart love to hu-
                   man hearts, for love is the living principle of brotherhood."

                      Unfortunately, what tarelike conduct at times mars the
                   church? 1 Cor. 3:3; 6:1-8, -18-20.
                       "Lawsuits between brethren are a reproach to the cause of
                   truth. Christians who go to law with one another expose the
                   church to the ridicule of her enemies and cause the powers
                   of darkness to triumph. They are wounding Christ afresh and
                   putting Him to open shame. By ignoring the authority of the
                   church, they show contempt for God, who gave to the church
                   its authority."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 306.
                      What is the basic secret for preserving unity in the family
                   of God? Eph. 4:1-3, 31, 32.

                   tion in my church?
                      "The reason for all division, discord, and difference is found
                   in separation from Christ. Christ is the center to which all
                   should be attracted; for the nearer we approach the center, the

                      In the daily service ,penitent sinners confessed their sins
                  and were forgiven as they trusted in the merits of the prom-
                  ised Redeemer, typified in the sacrifices. By means of the ritual
                  their confessed sins were transferred in figure to the sanctuary.
                  In this sense the sanctuary became defiled. It was cleansed on
                  the Day of Atonement by a special ritual.
                      The daily ritual had to do with the cleansing of persons; the
                  yearly had to do with the cleansing of the sanctuary. In other
                  words, the daily ritual taught in type that aspect of the plan
                  of salvation which was concerned with saving the sinner from
                  his sins and in restoring him to the image of God. The yearly
                  ritual taught in type the final eradication of sin and Satan, the
                  banishment of sin and its effects from the universe.
                      "Once each year their minds were carried forward to till
                  closing events of the great controversy between Christ anti
                  Satan, the final purification of the universe from sin and sin-
                  ners."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 358.
                     The yearly ritual centered on two goats—one for the Lord
                  and one for Azazel ("scapegoat," see margin). What was the
                  function of each goat? Lev. 16:8, 9, 15-22.

                    This figurative eradication of sin typified the final judgment
                  when God will set things right.
                     Who was intimately involved in this typical judgment
                  scene? Lev. 16:30, 34.

                      The two goats typify Christ and Satan, and imply by type
                  the final resolution of the great controversy begun in heaven.
                  The death of Christ, typified by the shedding of the blood of
                  the Lord's goat fully atones for all who have placed their trust
                  in Him. This is the heart of God's answer to the problem of
                  sin. The banished scapegoat (for Azazel) typified Satan upon
                  whom the final responsibility for sin will be placed. Like the
                  goat he will be banished to the wilderness of this chaotic earth
                  during the millennium and will die in the destruction of sin at
                  its end.

  THE RECORDS Christ....
 FOR JUDGMENT   "So then every one of us shall give account of himself to
                   God" (Rom. 14:10, 12).
                       What supplies the evidence of the thoughts, motives, and
                   acts of each individual in the judgment? Rev. 20:12; Jer. 2:22;
                   Mal. 3:16.
                       "The books of record in heaven, in which the names and
                   the deeds of men are registered, are to determine the decisions
                   of the judgment."—The Great Controversy, p. 480.
                       The Bible states plainly that all have sinned (Rom. 3:23);
                   hence, all are under the divine judgment of death (Rom.
                   6:23). When a penitent sinner accepts the gospel, where is
                   his name recorded? Luke 10:20; Phil. 4:3.
                        In the typical service moral responsibility for sins was
                   figuratively transferred from the penitent to the sanctuary. In
                   reality, how is it transferred, and to whom? Heb. 9:28; 10:12;
                   1 John 1:9.
                       "In the new covenant the sins of the repentant are by faith
                   placed upon Christ and transferred, in fact, to the heavenly
                   sanctuary."—The Great Controversy, p. 421.
                       The sanctuary type makes it evident that when sin was
                   forgiven it was not blotted out. The sinner was freely forgiven,
                   but the sin remained in the sanctuary until the Day of Atone-
                   ment. This shows another aspect of God's dealing with sin
                   that goes beyond the forgiveness of the individual. For the
                    moment the sanctuary had assumed responsibility; the sinner
                    was free. So Christ is our Substitute and Surety as we put our
                   trust in Him.
                        Since all whose names are not in the book of life are
                    already under condemnation, who are the persons involved
                   in the investigative phase of the judgment?
                      "In the typical service only those who had come before God
                   with confession and repentance, and whose sins, through the
                   blood of the sin offering, were transferred to the sanctuary, had
                   a part in the service of the Day of Atonement. So in the great
                   day of final atonement and investigative judgment the only
                   cases considered are those of the professed people of God."
                   —The Great Controversy, p. 480.
THINK IT THROUGH      Why should a genuine Christian have no fear of the in-
                   vestigative phase of the judgment?
                     "If Christ is my Saviour, my sacrifice, my atonement, then I
                   shall never perish. Believing on Him, I have life forevermore."

    JUDGMENT         "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was
                 cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: which, when
                 it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered
                 the good into vessels, but cast the bad away" (Matt. 13:
                 47, 48).

                 Lessons, p. 122.
                    Sometimes it is asked why it is necessary for God to investi-
                 gate in judgment those who have professed faith in Christ. In
                 answer we must note that the investigative phase of judgment
                 is not for the omniscient God who reads the future as the pres-
                 ent and who is acquainted with every life. This judgment is for
                 the benefit of loyal beings in the universe who are not omni-
                 scient. Here they have an opportunity to see God's fairness in
                 dealing with man.
                    One purpose of the investigative phase is to sift out the
                 genuine believer from the false. The parables of the net, the
                 wheat and tares, and the ten virgins show that not all whose
                 names are in the book of life remain faithful or will be saved.

                    What basic test will be applied in this judgment? Matt.
                 7:21-23; James 2:8-12.

                    When the life record of a genuine believer is examined,
                 what will his High Priest do for him? Rev. 3:5. What must He
                 do if the professed believer is a false disciple? Ex. 32:33.

                     Christ's second-apartment ministry in the heavenly court is
                 His last work in behalf of His true people. God will clear those
                 who have trusted in the provisions of the plan of salvation. The
                 loyal universe would question the taking of sinners into heaven;
                 Satan would protest too. The records depict the sins and fail-
                 ures of God's people, but they also demonstrate how Christians
                 have laid hold of the merits of Christ, surrendering their lives
                 fully to Him. "Jesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their
                 penitence and faith, and . . . [claims] for them forgiveness."
                 —The Great Controversy, p. 484. On this basis He secures their
                 acquittal and blots out the record of their sins.
                     The prophecies of Daniel 8 and 9 and the doctrine of the
                 sanctuary focus on the heavenly judgment scene in which
                 God's people are cleared to enter the kingdom at the second
                 advent.

         Part 4    "And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw
  ACQUITTAL IN there a man which had not on a wedding garment: and he
                saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having
 THE JUDGMENT a wedding garment? . . . Bind him hand and foot, and take
                 him away. . . . For many are called, but few are chosen"
                 (Matt. 22:1 1-14).
                     The parable of the wedding garment sketches the gospel
                 invitation in the Christian era. Two appeals are made to the
                 nation of Israel (by Christ before the cross; by the apostles
                 after the cross, verses 3, 4). The invitation is rejected; the mes-
                 sengers mistreated. In turn Israel is rejected as God's agent.
                 Jerusalem is destroyed and the nation scattered (verse 7). The
                 third invitation goes to the world (verses 8, 9).
                    Throughout the Christian era what kinds of persons have
                 responded to the gospel invitation? Matt. 22:10.
                    Before the invited guests participate in the wedding feast,
                 an inspection by the king takes place. What does this inspec-
                 tion of professed Christians represent? Matt. 22:11-14.
                    "By the king's examination of the guests at the feast is rep-
                 resented a work of judgment. The guests at the gospel feast
                 are those who profess to serve God, those whose names are
                 written in the book of life. But not all who profess to be Chris-
                 tians are true disciples. Before the final reward is given, it must
                 be decided who are fitted to share the inheritance of the righ-
                 teous....
                    "It is while men are still dwelling upon the earth that the
                 work of investigative judgment takes place in the courts of
                 heaven. The lives of all His professed followers pass in review
                 before God. All are examined according to the record of the
                 books of heaven, and according to his deeds the destiny of
                 each is forever fixed."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 310.
                   What does the garment, a gift from the king, represent?
                 What did Paul wish to be found having? Phil. 3:8, 9.
                    "When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united
                 with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind becomes
                 one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to
                 Him; we live His life. This is what it means to be clothed with
                 the garment of His righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon
                 us He sees, not the fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and
                 deformity of sin, but His own robe of righteousness, which is

        Part 5      "And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hun-
     THE TIME    dred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed" (Dan. 8:14).
       OF THE       The Hebrew reads: "Unto evening morning two thousand
  JUDGMENT—I     and three hundred." The sequence of evening-morning reflects
                 the Hebrew concept of a "day" as given in the Creation ac-
                 count: "And there was evening and there was morning, one
                 day" (Gen. 1:5, RSV.) Thus the expression in Daniel 8:14 means
                 simply "two thousand and three hundred days." The Jewish
                 translators of the Greek Septuagint evidently understood the
                 expression this way since their translation reads: "Unto eve-
                 ning and morning."
                    This time period distressed Daniel. He apparently thought
                 there was to be a delay in the return of Israel.
                    To what prophecies did Daniel turn to study in his per-
                 plexity? Dan. 9:1, 2. See also Jer. 25:1-14; 29:1-14.

                    It was now the first year of Darius the Mede (538 BC). Reck-
                 oning from his own captivity (605 BC), the prophet realized
                 that the 70-year exile was nearly over. He now sought God in
                 prayer to fulfill His promises (Dan. 9:3-19).
                     What explanation of the 2300-day prophecy did Gabriel
                 later give? Dan. 9:21-27.
                    In stating that the 70 weeks (a prophetic expression in which
                 a day symbolizes a year: 7 x 70 = 490 days-years) were to be
                 set apart for Israel, Gabriel, in effect, assured Daniel that the
                 exiles and the temple would be restored. He now announces
                 the time for the advent of the Messiah.
                    Since the 70 weeks (490 years) logically make up the first
                 part of the 2300 years, what starting point for both did Ga-
                 briel give? Dan. 9:25.
                    The decree of Artaxerxes I which restored Jewish autonomy
                 became effective in the fall of 457 BC. Twenty-three hundred
                 years from that date brings us to the fall of 1844. Since this
                 date falls in the Christian era, the cleansing of the sanctuary
                 concerns Christ's final ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
                    "While the investigative judgment is going forward in heaven,
                 while the sins of penitent believers are being removed from the
                 sanctuary, there is to be a special work of purification, of put-
                 ting away of sin, among God's people upon earth. This work
                 is more clearly presented in the messages of Revelation 14.

       OF THE      in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
 JUDGMENT—II       prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy" (Dan. 9:24).
                      This 490-year period was a time of high destiny for Israel,
                   the climax to which all their history and worship focused—
                   Messiah's appearance and redemption. "To make an end of
                   sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
                   everlasting righteousness" refer to the redemptive acts of
                   Christ. The supreme sacrifice of Calvary (verses 26, 27) makes
                   possible the final destruction of sin, atonement for penitent
                   sinners, and righteousness through His merits.
                      According to the prophecy, what was to be anointed?
                      The Hebrew phrase qodesh qodashim translated "the most
                   Holy" is used more than forty times in the Old Testament in
                   connection with the sanctuary and its related objects, and not
                   to persons. The RSV translates the phrase in Dan. 9:24 as "a
                   most holy place." What "most holy place" is referred to?
                      "In view of the fact that the Hebrew phrase cannot elsewhere
                   be shown to refer definitely to a person, and in view of the
                   fact that the heavenly sanctuary is under discussion in the
                   larger aspects of the vision . . . , it is reasonable to conclude
                   that Daniel is here speaking of the anointing of the heavenly
                   sanctuary prior to the time of Christ's inauguration as high
                   priest."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Dan. 9:24.
                       What other prophecies foretold the priestly ministry of the
                   Messiah? Ps. 110:1, 4; Isa. 53:12.
                      The prophecies foretold that the Messiah would be a priest
                   after the order of Melchizedek. Now in Daniel the anointing of
                   a sanctuary in connection with the Messiah is announced. The
                   divine spotlight thus shifts within the continuous visions of
                   chapters 8, 9 from the earthly typical sanctuary, which ceased
                   to have meaning at the cross (see Dan. 9:27; Matt. 27:51), to
                   the heavenly antitypical sanctuary.
                      The 490-year portion of the visions thus pointed to the re-
                   demptive acts of Christ on earth and to His ministration in the
                   heavenly sanctuary as man's High Priest. The 2300-year portion
                   focuses upon His closing ministration there, a work of judg-
                   ment, cleansing and restoring it to its rightful state.
THINK IT THROUGH      While God the Father is over all (Dan. 7:9, 10), why has
                   He entrusted all judgment to Christ? See John 5:22, 27.
                      "He who took humanity upon Himself, and in this world lived
                   a perfect life, is to judge us."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 185.

            Out of the fires of persecution and trial in the
       last days, God's church will emerge as a vindication of
                     His love and righteousness.

         Part 1      Considering the issues of the moral controversy we have
  VINDICATION     been studying, how will the last generation of God's true
                  believers vindicate Him on the earth?
 BY HIS PEOPLE
                      "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
                  the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. . . .
                      "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the
                  cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head
                  a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle" (Rev. 14:
                  12, 14).
                      God will close the great moral controversy between Satan
                  and Himself on two planes: (1) By divine action in the heavenly
                  sanctuary court. Here God's people will be vindicated. (2) By
                  a final movement on earth of His people who will come into
                  full harmony with His law, and will remain loyal to Him at all
                  costs as they preach God's last messages of appeal to the
                  world. Thus, the people that God vindicates in the judgment
                  have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the vindi-
                  cation of God.
                      "The church is God's appointed agency for the salvation of
                  men. It was organized for service, and its mission to carry the
                  gospel to the world. From the beginning it has been God's
                  plan that through His church shall be reflected to the world
                  His fulness and His sufficiency. The members of the church,
                  those whom He has called out of darkness into His marvelous
                  light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the repository
                  of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church will
                  eventually be made manifest, even to 'the principalities and
                  powers in heavenly places,' the final and full display of the
                  love of God. Ephesians 3:10."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 9.
                     What are the basic points of the last appeal from God to
                  be given to the entire earth? Rev. 14:6-12, 14.
                    The last appeal continues to be "the everlasting gospel,"
                 with special warnings about the last-day situation.
                    Since the emphases of the second and the third angels come
                 later than the first angel, and since the second advent is not
                 a formal judgment, it is reasonable to conclude that the first
                 angel's announcement, "the hour of his judgment is come,"
                 refers to the opening of the heavenly sanctuary court of judg-
                 ment in heaven in 1844. Thus, since that date, the final vindi-
                 cation of God has been going on in, heaven and in earth.
THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways does my life testify favorably to the char-
                 acter of the God I profess to serve?
                    "The world does not so much need men of great intellect as

                      Since the "Ancient of days" represents God the Father,
                   where is this solemn judgment held? See "The Great Contro-
                   versy," pages 479, 480.

                   who wait before the Lord and are ever attendant on His will.
                   The angels perform an important part in the judgment. They
                   function as both 'ministers and witnesses' (GC 479).
                       "Was set. Or, 'began to sit.' Daniel is shown the final judg-
                   ment in both its phases, investigative and executive."—SDA
                   Bible Commentary, on Dan. 7:10.
                       In comparing Daniel 2 and 7 we see that the latter vision
                   introduces two new features: (1) The rise and career of the
                   horn with the eyes and mouth of a man which we have earlier
                   identified as the Christian apostasy, and (2) the scene depict-
                   ing final judgment in the court of heaven.
                       The importance of this vision is underscored by the fact that
                   its essential elements are stated three times: verses 1-14, 15-22,
                   and 23-27.
                      According to the context of this vision who is especially
                   being reviewed and judged? Dan. 7:11, 21, 22, 26.

                      It is clear that one aspect of this judgment deals with the
                   matter: Who is going to have the dominion? Four world king-
                   doms sought for control; likewise the little horn. The judgment
                   sits at some time after the horn's special period of rule (1260
                   days-years: AD 538 to AD 1798). Decisions will be made in
                   favor of Christ and His people, but against the horn whose
                   destruction is decreed (verses 11, 26).

THINK IT THROUGH      The judgment pronounced upon the serpent (Gen. 3:14,
                   15) was really upon whom? The judgment pronouncement
                   upon the little horn is really a final judgment on whom?

                      "In the judgment of the universe God will stand clear of
                   blame for the existence or continuance of evil. It will be dem-
                   onstrated that the divine decrees are not accessory to sin.
                   There was no defect in God's government, no cause for dis-
                   affection."—The Desire of Ages, p. 58.

                 desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be
                 trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand
                 and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed"
                 (Dan. 8:13, 14).
                     "The prophecy of Dan. 8:14 announces the time for the be-
                 ginning of this special work [of the antitypical Day of Atone-
                 ment]. The cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary comprehends
                 the entire work of final judgment, beginning with the investiga-
                 tive phase and ending with the executive phase, which results
                 in the permanent eradication of sin from the universe.
                     "A significant feature of the final judgment is the vindication
                 of God's character before all the intelligences of the universe.
                 The false charges that Satan has lodged against the govern-
                 ment of God must be demonstrated as utterly groundless. God
                 must be shown to have been entirely fair in the selection of
                 certain individuals to make up His future kingdom, and in the
                 barring of others from entrance there. The final acts of God
                 will evoke from. men the confessions, 'Just and true are thy
                 ways' (Rev. 15:3), 'Thou art righteous, 0 Lord' (Rev. 16:5), and,
                 'True and righteous are thy judgments' (Rev. 16:7)."—SDA
                 Bible Commentary, on Dan. 8:14 (p. 845).
                   What was Daniel shown about a desolating little horn
                 power? What was Gabriel's explanation? Dan. 8:9-12, 23-25.
                    Gabriel does not name the little horn power, but a compari-
                 son of this horn with the terrible nondescript beast of chapter 7
                 and the daring words and actions of its little horn leave no
                 doubt that the horn of chapter 8 is symbolizing the careers of
                 the same two powers, that is pagan and papal Rome.
                     What would the horn attack and cast down which would
                 in time be cleansed and restored? Dan. 8:11-14.
                    Pagan Rome destroyed the temple in Jerusalem (AD 70), but
                 Papal Rome has defamed the throne of God by depriving men
                 of the true knowledge of saving righteousness. through Christ,

                    "He shall be broken without hand" (Dan. 8:25).
                     Through the spyglass of prophecy we are permitted to glance
                 ahead and see that all the accusations Satan made in heaven
                 (lesson 4) will be condemned in the day of judgment.
                     In a sense, God—His character, law, government—has been
                 on trial before the universe ever since Lucifer raised his chal-
                 lenges. The divine answer to the rebellion has been the plan
                 of salvation, centering in Christ's sinless life, atoning death,
                 and mediatorial ministry. The universe has watched the out-
                 working of the satanic principle of selfishness and the divine
                 principle of love. In a very real sense, God will be cleared—and
                 Satan condemned—by the entire universe.
                     "The plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper pur-
                 pose than the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that
                 Christ came to the earth; . . . but it was to vindicate the char-
                 acter of God before the universe. . . . The act of Christ in
                  dying . . . would justify God and His Son in their dealing with
                 the rebellion of Satan. It would establish the perpetuity of
                 the law of God and would reveal the nature and results of sin."
                 —Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 68, 69.
                     Satan's high-handed charges defiled the divine throne. He
                  was expelled from heaven. On earth he has continued to "blas-
                 pheme his name, and his tabernacle" (Rev. 13:6). The proph-
                  ecies of Daniel 7 and 8 (and related ones in 2 Thess. 2; Rev.
                  13 and 17) show that Satan has continued to promote the same
                  challenges and to usurp God's authority through the activities
                 of the "little horn."
                      Through this power Satan has succeeded far beyond what
                  he could have done through pagan nations, since it has become
                  a moral voice in the world. Millions regard the Christian apos-
                  tasy as the only moral force worth reckoning with today.
                      Thus the judgment in the heavenly sanctuary which declares
                  the "little horn" guilty and orders its destruction renders, in
                  effect, a verdict against Satan. The judgment of the horn is a
                  final judgment on Satan and a vindication of God "with the full
                  approval of the loyal universe. The issues raised by Satan will
                  thus be decided in the heavenly court in favor of God.

                                                                       March 25

         Part 5      Who will sit on these thrones of judgment in heaven? (See
   JUDGING THE     Rev. 20:6.) Who will be judged?
       WICKED         "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment
                   was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were
                   beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God,
                   and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image,
                   neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in
                   their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thou-
                   sand years" (Rev. 20:4).
                      When will this judgment take place? Where? See verse 6;
                   1 Thess. 4:16-18.
                        "During the thousand years between the first and the second
                   resurrection the judgment of the wicked takes place. . . . At
                   this time the righteous reign as kings and priests unto God.
                   ... In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their
                   acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case
                   according to the deeds done in the body. Then the portion
                   which the wicked must suffer is meted out, according to their
                   works; and it is recorded against their names in the book of
                   death."—The Great Controversy, pp. 660, 661.
                      How extensive will this judgment be? Who besides man-
                   kind will be examined? 1 Cor. 6:2, 3.

                       Human probation closes with the completion of Christ's work
                   as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Rev. 15:5-8). This was
                   a ministry of judgment and vindication, and, as far as man
                   was concerned, dealt with those whose names were written
                   in the book of life. The judgment of fallen angels and impeni-
                   tent sinners by the saints during their millennial reign with
                   Christ in heaven is an examination and a review of the issues
                   involved in the controversy as begun and carried out by Satan
                   and the fallen angels. There would naturally be many questions
                   why persons were lost. The millennial phase of the judgment
                   will provide an opportunity for the redeemed to be fully satis-
                   fied with all of God's acts in dealing with the sin problem, just
                   as the investigative phase will satisfy the unfallen universe.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it particularly fitting for John to be shown martyrs
                   and persecuted saints on the thrones in judgment?

                      "The day of His vengeance hastens, when all who have
                   transgressed His law and oppressed His people will meet the
                   just recompense of their deeds; when every act of cruelty or
                   injustice toward God's faithful ones will be punished as though
                   done to Christ Himself."—The Great Controversy, p. 48.

God's Rule Vindicated LESSON 13                                        ❑ Friday
                                                                        March 26

        Part 6     "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
    EXECUTION    Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his
                 body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or
  OF SENTENCE    bad" (2 Cor. 5:10).
                     Inasmuch as the intelligent creation resides in a universe
                 which is under moral law, amenability to God cannot be es-
                 caped. All mankind, and the fallen angels as well, must stand
                 at the bar of God.
                    When does the executive phase of the judgment take
                 place? Where? Rev. 20:11-15. See also Matt. 25:31-33; Prov.
                 11:31.
                    All mankind will be present: the redeemed within the city;
                 the lost and the fallen angels outside. The loyal universe will
                 witness. "The judgment scene will take place in the presence
                 of all the worlds; for in this judgment the government of God
                 will be vindicated, and His law will stand forth as 'holy, and
                 just, and good.' .. . Sin will not then appear attractive, but will
                 be seen in all its hideous magnitude."—Ellen G. White Com-
                 ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 986.
                     What will the intelligent creation involved in this phase
                 of judgment confess? Rom. 14:10, 11.
                    "As soon as the books of record are opened, and the eye
                 of Jesus looks upon the wicked, they are conscious of every
                 sin which they have ever committed. They see just . . . how
                 far pride and rebellion have carried them in the violation of the
                 law of God."
                    "It is now evident to all that the wages of sin is not noble
                 independence and eternal life, but slavery, ruin, and death."
                     "Satan sees that his voluntary rebellion has unfitted him for
                 heaven. . . . His accusations against the mercy and justice of
                 God are now silenced. The reproach which he has endeavored
                 to cast upon Jehovah rests wholly upon himself. And now Satan
                 bows down and confesses the justice of his sentence."—The
                 Great Controversy, pp. 666, 668, 670.
                    The executive phase of judgment will elicit from the lost a
                 free admission of the rightness of God in His acts. Thus the
                 judgment in its three phases fully vindicates God.
                    According to Jesus, on what principle of the law will ac-
                 quittal or condemnation hang? Matt. 25:34-46.
                    Lack of love for their fellowmen (a violation of the second
                 table of the law) indicates that self is central (a violation of
                 the first table). Only divine grace received into the life can
                 produce supreme love to God and impartial love to others.
