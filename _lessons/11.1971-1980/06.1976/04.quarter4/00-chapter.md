                                                Pope Paul VI, in a historical meeting with Latin-American bishops held
                                      in Medellin, Colombia, listened to an important document prepared by a group of
CO NFERENCE OF SEVE NTI-I-




                                      delegates. Among other things, the document said: "Youth represent the most
                                      numerous group of society in Latin-America, a new and extraordinary pressure
                                      group." Facing this declaration, the Pope added: "For us, they constitute the
                                      most important theme, worthy of our principal interest."

                                                Are we unaware as a church of this "new and extraordinary pressure
                                      group"? Are we giving this new awakening generation priority treatment?
                                                To say that the future belongs to this young generation seems to be a
                                      truism destitute of major importance. However, for us in South America, this
                                      declaration has a tremendous significance because of the result of a gallopping
                                      demographic growth, SS% of the population is under 21 years of age.
                                                As a church, we are conscious of our rights and responsibilities in
                                      front of this new generation. For this reason, we are dedicating the 13th Sab-
                                      bath overflow of this quarter to two educational institutions: Northeast Brazil
                                      College, administered by the East Brazil Union and to a new academy in the
                                      territory of the South Chile Conference.
                                                During more than three decades, Northeast Brazil College has prepared
                                      pastors and evangelists who, with great fevor and extraordinary dedication, are
                                      proclaiming the redeeming power of Christ in different areas of the country.
                                      However, in spite of their good contribution to the mission field, this
                                      institution needs an appropriate theology department to function even better.
                                      One half of the overflow of this quarter will be applied towards the construction
                                      of a building for the Theology Department.
                                                The other half will be destined to building a secondary school in
                                      South Chile, a dream held by our Chilean brethren who desire to-see their

                                                We are certain that the members of the Sabbath School in all the world

WORSHIP-A BIBLE DOCTRINE
                                      Introduction

   Ordinarily, when we think of doctrines, we think of such Biblical teachings as the
atonement, salvation by faith, the sanctuary, the grace of God, the second coming of
Christ, and the law of God. The worship o.f God has not always been included among-
the doctrines of the church. But, according to the Bible, it deserves such recognition.
   From Genesis to Revelation worship is one of the great themes. It was one of the
issues in the great controversy between good and evil. It was the basis of the first
table of the law. It was central to the life-style of both the Old and the New Testaments.
It was the subject of much of the poetry of the Bible. It was a prominent theme of the
prophets. It was one of the concerns of Christ. It was part of the experience of the
early Christian church.
   For the Seventh-day Adventist, worship is included in his unique charter, the three
angels' messages. His life is centered in his church; but sometimes he thinks of his
church as organization, people, activity, or dogma rather than as a group of
worshipers. His Sabbath may be only a day of rest (man-centered) rather than a day of
reverence (God-centered).
   The purpose of this series of lessons is to explore what the Bible has to say about
worship. Six lessons are from the Old Testament, six from the New, and one (lesson
eleven) is of a general nature. Some lessons are basically historical, some are
theological, some deal with practical issues. All are intended to enhance the worship
relationship between the Christian and his God.
   It is hoped that a study of this subject will make all types of worship more
meaningful. Nothing will contribute more to the spiritual health of the church than for
its members to worship God as individuals, for its families to worship Him in family
 prayers, for groups of all kinds to join in worship, and for the Sabbath service to be the
climax of the worship experience.

with whom He could establish a
relationship; and (3) this relationship
was to be marked by love,
dependence, respect, and reverence
on the part of His creatures.
   The plan of this lesson is to study
certain incidents connected with the
dawn of human history that illustrate
the worship relationship that man was
to have with his Creator.
   It will be observed that the
relationship between God and man in
the book of Genesis is very personal.
Man relates to God either as an
individual or as part of a family. Public
worship was in its infancy. One of the
most striking phenomena of this
period of man's history was the
theophaby, the personal appearance
of God to man. This intimate
relationship produced an attitude
toward God that needs to be
recaptured by those who love and
worship God in these times.

                   sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work
                   which God created and made" (Gen. 2:2, 3).

                        What is the purpose of the Sabbath?

                         The book of Genesis opens by presenting the basic reason for
                      worship—God is the Creator, and we are His creatures. God
                      evidently intended that this relationship should be
                      memorialized, for He established the Sabbath as a weekly
                      reminder of His creatorship. In blessing and sanctifying a day,
                      He recognized time as a fundamental symbol of worship. The
                      first worship symbol He gave to Man was not a tree, a building,
                      or an animal, but twenty-four hours recurring every seven days.
                      Could anything be more basic, more universal than time? This
                      symbol could not be changed by geography, by culture, or by
                      the passing of the years. To man, time is basic. And when God
                      set apart a period of time, He thereby made it possible for man to
                      have the opportunity and the leisure to worship Him.
                          "After resting upon the seventh day, God sanctified it, or set it
                      apart, as a day of rest for man. Following the example of the
                      Creator, man was to rest upon this sacred day, that as he should
                      look upon the heavens and the earth, he might reflect upon
                      God's great work of creation; and that as he should behold the
                      evidences of God's wisdom and goodness, his heart might be
                      filled with love and reverence for his Maker.
                          "In Eden, God set up the memorial of His work of creation, in
                      placing His blessing upon the seventh day. The Sabbath was
                      committed to Adam, the father and representative of the whole
                      human family. Its observance was to be an act of grateful
                      acknowledgment, on the part of all who should dwell upon the
                      earth, that God was their Creator and their rightful Sovereign;
                      that they were the work of His hands and the subjects of His
                      authority."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 47, 48.

THINK IT THROUGH        What is the relationship between divine worship and God's
                      act as Creator? (See Ex. 20:8-11.)

                        "'The Sabbath therefore lies at the very foundation of divine
                      worship, for it teaches this great truth in the most impressive
                      manner, and no other institution does this. The true ground of

                      worship, is found in the distinction between the Creator and His
                      creatures. This great fact can never become obsolete, and must
                      never be forgotten.'—J. N. Andrews, History of the Sabbath,

                                                                   September 27
           Part 2     "And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
   TWO BROTHERS     the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he
    AND AN ALTAR    also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.
                    And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but
                    unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was
                    very wroth, and his countenance fell" (Gen. 4:3-5).

                      Why did Cain and Abel bring offerings to God?

                      "The sacrificial offerings were ordained by God to be to man a
                    perpetual reminder and a penitential acknowledgment of his sin
                    and a confession of his faith in the promised Redeemer. They
                    were intended to impress upon the fallen race the solemn truth
                    that it was sin that caused death."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
                    68.
                      This was a part of man's worship after his expulsion from
                    Eden.
                      This incident teaches us that worship has a theological basis.
                    Man is not free to worship in any way he sees best. There are
                    theological reasons for the manner in which God is worshiped,
                    and these reasons must not be ignored. Worship is acceptable
                    only when it is carried out according to God's direction.

                      Why was Cain's worship not acceptable?

                       "Cain came before God with murmuring and infidelity in his
                    heart in regard to the promised sacrifice and the necessity of the
                    sacrificial offerings. His gift expressed no penitence for sin. He
                    felt, as many now feel, that it would be an acknowledgment of
                    weakness to follow the exact plan marked out by God, of
                    trusting his salvation wholly to the atonement of the promised
                    Saviour. He chose the course of self-dependence. He would
                    come in his own merits. He would not bring the lamb, and
                    mingle its blood with his offering, but would present his fruits,
                    the products of his labor."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 72.

 THINK IT THROUGH    What should worshipers learn today from the experience of
                    Cain and Abel? (See Jude 11.)

                       "The class of worshipers who follow the example of Cain
                    includes by far the greater portion of the world; for nearly every
                    false religion has been based on the same principle—that man
                    can depend upon his own efforts for salvation."—Patriarchs
                    and Prophets, p. 73.
                       True worship, then, must maintain those attitudes and
                    employ those symbols that are in harmony with the correct
                    theology of salvation.

         WORSHIP
                    What does this text reveal about the worship of God?

                        "In his [Enos'] time a more formal worship was begun. Man
                     had of course called upon the Lord before Enos' birth, but as
                     time went on a more pronounced distinction arose between
                     those who worshiped the Lord and those who defied Him. The
                     expression 'to call upon the name of the Lord' is used frequently
                     in the OT to indicate, as it does here, public worship (Ps. 79:6;
                     116:17; Jer. 10:25; Zeph. 3:9)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                     Gen. 4:26.
                        Early worship was generally personal. God talked with Adam
                     and Eve in the garden. But when mankind became divided
                     between those who worshiped God and those who did not, the
                     worshipers of God united and bore their witness of their
                     allegiance to their Creator in a public way. We can see in this
                     development the seeds of what later became the church—in
                     both its Old Testament and its New Testament form.
                        "'To Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
                     name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.'
                     The faithful had worshiped God before; but as men increased,
                     the distinction between the two classes became more marked.
                     There was an open profession of loyalty to God on the part of
                     one, as there was of contempt and disobedience on the part of
                     the other.
                        "Before the Fall our first parents had kept the Sabbath, which
                     was instituted in Eden; and after their expulsion from Paradise
                     they continued its observance. They had tasted the bitter fruits
                     of disobedience, and had learned what every one that tramples
                     upon God's commandments will sooner or later learn—that the
                     divine precepts are sacred and immutable, and that the penalty
                     of transgression will surely be inflicted. The Sabbath was
                     honored by all the children of Adam that remained loyal to God.
                     But Cain and his descendants did not respect the day upon
                     which God had rested. They chose their own time for labor and
                     for rest, regardless of Jehovah's express command."—
                     Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 80, 81.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What does this story of the beginning of public worship tell
                     us today? (See Heb. 10:25.)

                        A close personal relationship between the individual and God
                     is as essential today as in the times of Adam and Abel and Seth.
                     But the witness of group worship is also essential in order to
                     keep alive the worship of God in the world.

Worship at the Dawn of History              LESSON 1              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  September 29
          Part 4   "And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every
       THE ALTAR clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
   BESIDE THE ARK offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet savour;
                 and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground
                 any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is
                 evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every
                 thing living, as I have done. While the earth remaineth,
                 seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
                 winter, and day and night shall not cease" (Gen. 8:20-22).

                      What was the relation between Noah's worship and God's
                    covenant?

                       "In the joy of their release Noah did not forget Him by whose
                    gracious care they had been preserved. His first act after leaving
                    the ark was to build an altar and offer from every kind of clean
                    beast and fowl a sacrifice, thus manifesting his gratitude to God
                    for deliverance and his faith in Christ, the great sacrifice. This
                    offering was pleasing to the Lord; and a blessing resulted, not
                    only to the patriarch and his family, but to all who should live
                    upon the earth. . . . Here was a lesson for all succeeding
                    generations. Noah had come forth upon a desolate earth, but
                    before preparing a house for himself he built an altar to God. His
                    stock of cattle was small, and had been preserved at great
                    expense; yet he cheerfully gave a part to the Lord as an
                    acknowledgment that all was His. In like manner it should be our
                    first care to render our freewill offerings to God. Every
                    manifestation of His mercy and love toward us should be
                    gratefully acknowledged, both. by acts of devotion and by gifts
                    to His cause."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 105, 106.


 THINK IT THROUGH     What does Noah's experience tell us about worship?

                      1. Worship was an expression of gratitude to God. Worship
                    has been defined as a redeemed man's response to his
                    Redeemer. Noah had been saved. He did not forget to thank his
                    Saviour.
                      2. Worship was an expression of faith. Noah understood the
                    symbolism of the slain beasts. So today our songs, our prayers,
                    our gifts, our sermons are expressions of our faith in God.
                      3. God's gracious covenant was His response to Noah's
                    worship. God's promises today are fulfilled in the lives of those
                    who worship Him.
                      4. Noah was willing to assume the cost of worship. He gave of
                    his possessions, and in so doing he set an example of liberality.

                                                                      September 30
            Part 5   "And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy
      ABRAHAM, THE seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the
      ALTAR-BUILDER Lord, who appeared unto him" (Gen. 12:7).

                        How did Abraham reveal his dedication by his worship?

                         Abraham had migrated from Ur to Haran, and in response to
                      God's call he migrated again to Canaan. He was 75 years of age
                      and had accumulated considerable property. His move not only
                      involved inconvenience, but also danger, for "the Canaanite
                      was then in the land." But God did not forget His faithful
                      servant. He appeared to him, made a promise to him, and
                      Abraham responded by building an altar for worship.
                         The next verse of Genesis 12 tells us that he moved on to "a
                      mountain on the east of Bethel," and there he built another
                      altar. Chapter 13 has him returning to the altar near Bethel after
                      a trip to Egypt, "and there Abram called on the name of the
                      Lord" (verse 4). Later in the same chapter, Abraham "removed
                      his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in
                      Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord" (verse 18).
                         The altar on the plains of Mamre seemed to be his center of
                      worship for a long time. One more altar was very significant in
                      Abraham's life—the altar he built on one of the mountains in the
                      land of Moriah. There he indicated his complete dedication to
                      God, and there God's covenant with Abraham was repeated
                      again.
                         "Abraham, 'the friend of God,' set us a worthy example. His
                      was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it
                      was set up his altar, calling all within his encampment to the
                      morning and evening sacrifice."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
                      128.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What message does Abraham, the altar builder, have for
                      us?

                         "Like the patriarchs of old, those who profess to love God
                      should erect an altar to the Lord wherever they pitch their tent. If
                      ever there was a time when every house should be a house of
                      prayer, it is now. Fathers and mothers should often lift up their
                      hearts to God in humble supplication for themselves and their
                      children. Let the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the
                      altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice, while the wife
                      and children unite in prayer and praise. In such a household
                      Jesus will love to tarry."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 144.
                         Family worship is an important aspect of the worship of God.
                      Are we as faithful in this respect as was Abraham? Do we gather
                      our families together to read the Bible, to pray, and to praise
                      God? (Compare Gen. 18:18, 19.)

                                                                       October 1
          Part 6   "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
     JACOB MEETS Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and
        HIS LORD said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the
                 house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose
                 up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for
                 his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top
                 of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel" (Gen.
                 28:16-19).

                      What was the background of this experience?

                      Jacob had incurred his brother Esau's wrath by obtaining the
                    birthright by fraud. Fleeing from his brother's threats of
                    violence, he made an overnight stop on his way to Haran. During
                    that memorable night Jacob was given the vision of the ladder
                    connecting earth and heaven. God appeared to Jacob and
                    renewed the promise that had been made to Abraham.
                      Jacob had reason to feel alone when he arrived at his
                    stopping place. But God assured him, "I am with thee, and will
                    keep thee" (Gen. 28:15). Jacob responded to this revelation by
                    setting up a pillar as a memorial and by naming the spot Bethel.
                      "In accordance with the custom of commemorating impor-
                    tant events, Jacob set up a memorial of God's mercy, that
                    whenever he should pass that way he might tarry at this sacred
                    spot to worship the Lord. And he called the place Bethel, or the
                    'house of God.' With deep gratitude he repeated the promise
                    that God's presence would be with him; and then he made the
                    solemn vow, 'If God will be with me, ... this stone ... shall be
                    God's house: and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give
                    the tenth unto Thee.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 187.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What are the lessons to be learned from this experience?

                      In this case, the worship of God was motivated by a deep
                    sense of forgiveness. When we get ourselves into trouble—as
                    Jacob did—knowing full well that our misfortunes have come as
                    the result of our own wrongdoing, it is easy to feel that God has
                    forsaken us. But when, in a circumstance like this, God takes
                    the initiative and assures us of His love and forgiveness, we are
                    overwhelmed with gratitude and appreciation.
                      This sense of gratitude to a forgiving God is one of the
                    greatest incentives to real, heartfelt worship.
                      "Jacob felt that God had claims upon him which he must
                    acknowledge, and that the special tokens of divine favor
                    granted him demanded a return. So does every blessing
                    bestowed upon us call for a response to the Author of all our
                    mercies."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 187.

                                          their deliverance from Egypt was that
                                          they might relearn the art of
                                          worshiping their God. They could
                                          never function effectively as God's
                                          chosen people until they learned how
                                          to worship Him in the right way.
                                             Referring to the Exodus, the
                                          psalmist says, "He brought forth his
                                          people with joy, and his chosen with
                                          gladness: and gave them the lands of
                                          the heathen: and they inherited the
                                          labour of the people; that they might
                                          observe his statutes, and keep his
                                          laws" (Ps. 105:43-45). God's laws and
                                          statutes regarding His worship were
                                          difficult to observe in slavery;
                                          therefore God removed His people
                                          from slavery so that they might
                                          worship Him. In fact, the entire
                                          Exodus project would have had no
                                          lasting, significance if the Hebrews had
                                          merely secured their liberty from the
                                          Egyptians but had never relearned the
                                          worship of their God.
                                             This lesson is dedicated to a story of
                                          how a nation of slaves learned, step by
                                          step, the meaning and beauty of a life
                                          of worship. From these incidents, we
                                           may learn better how to worship God
                                          in our day.

                                                                        October 3

  OF THE SABBATH     every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
                     seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day" (Ex.
                     16:29, 30).

                        At what point in the Exodus experience was the Sabbath
                     first stressed?

                        An interesting sequence of events occurred following the
                     deliverance from Egypt at the Red Sea:
                        First, there was the song of Moses (Ex. 15:1-19). This was a
                     song of praise to God and was an act of worship on the part of a
                     grateful people. "Like the voice of the great deep, rose from the
                     vast hosts of Israel that sublime ascription.... Far over desert
                     and sea rang the joyous refrain, and the mountains re-echoed
                     the words of their praise—'Sing ye to Jehovah, for He hath
                     triumphed gloriously.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 288,
                     289.
                        Second, there was the sweetening of the bitter waters at
                     Marah and the encampment by the wells of Elim. The people
                     had to learn that their God wouldn't let them die of thirst.
                        Third, there was the food crisis and the giving of the manna in
                     the Wilderness of Sin. Again, the people had to learn that their
                     God wouldn't let them starve.
                        A certain degree of security having been attained, God
                     restored the Sabbath. True, it had not been entirely forgotten in
                     Egypt, but it had been observed with great difficulty. Every
                     preparation day they were to gather a double portion of manna
                     so that they would not need to labor on the Sabbath. For forty
                     years the manna kept coming. It served as a reminder of God's
                     care for His people; and every seventh day they were reminded
                     of their obligation to celebrate a day of worship.

THINK IT THROUGH      What practical lessons come to us from God's provision for
                     Sabbath manna? (See Neh. 9:19-21.)

                       "God requires that His holy day be as sacredly observed now
                     as in the time of Israel. The command given to thp Hebrews
                     should be regarded by all Christians as an injunction from
                     Jehovah to them. The day before the Sabbath should be made a
                     day of preparation, that everything may be in readiness for its
                     sacred hours. In no case should our own business be allowed to
                     encroach upon holy time. . . . Work that is neglected until the
                     beginning of the Sabbath should remain undone until it is past.
                     This course might help the memory of these thoughtless ones,
                     and make them careful to do their own work on the six working
                     days."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 296.

Worship and the Exodus             LESSON 2                            ❑ Monday
                                                                        October 4
            Part 2     "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Ex. 20:3).
  THE FIRST TABLE
      OF THE LAW       How do the first four commandments relate to worship?

                        The first four commandments of the Decalogue were
                     intended to make secure the place of God in the hearts and lives
                     of believers.
                        "Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, uncreated One, Himself
                     the Source and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme
                     reverence and worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other
                     object the first place in his affections or his service. Whatever
                     we cherish that tends to lessen our love for God or to interfere
                     with the service due Him, of that do we make a god."—
                     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 305.
                        The second commandment is an extension of the first.
                        "The second commandment forbids the worship of the true
                     God by images or similitudes.... The attempt to represent the
                     Eternal One by material objects would lower man's conception
                     of God. . . .
                        "In prohibiting the worship of false gods, the second
                     commandment by implication enjoins the worship of the true
                     God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 306.
                        The third commandment of the first table is designed to
                     guarantee reverence for God's name.
                        "All should meditate upon His majesty, His purity and
                      holiness, that the heart may be impressed with a sense of His
                      exalted character; and His holy name should be uttered with
                      reverence and solemnity."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 307.
                        And, finally, the day of rest and worship that had been
                      observed with such difficulty in Egypt, and that had been
                      restored in connection with the giving of the manna in the
                      Wilderness of Sin—this was to be the most effective reminder of
                      the worship of the true God.
                        "All who keep the seventh day signify by this act that they are
                      worshipers of Jehovah."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 307.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What is the usual attitude to church worship in the modern
                     world? Do I go to church for the right reasons?

                        To a great extent, worship is considered by today's churches
                     as celebration—"celebration of life," as some put it. The idea of
                     deep reverence for a God who is the Creator and Father of us all
                     is often rejected by the modern mind. One of the challenges to
                     God's church today is to teach men to "worship him that made
                     heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters"
                     (Rev. 14:7). This calls for a reaffirmation of the first four
                     commandments.

           Part 3   "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among
     THE PORTABLE them" (Ex. 25:8).
          CHURCH
                    What were some of the characteristics of this portable
                  church that God instructed Israel to construct?

                       1'. It was to be built by the offerings of Israel (Ex. 25:1-7).
                       2. It was to be built according to a plan revealed by God (Ex.
                           25:9).
                       3. The structure was to center in an ark which was to be
                           highly reverenced as the point where God would
                           communicate with man (Ex. 25:10-22).
                       4. The table of shewbread, the candlestick, the altar of
                           incense, the curtains, the boards, the roof, the veils were
                           all exquisitely beautiful, constructed of the most valuable
                           materials (Ex. 25:23 through 26:37).
                       5. An altar was constructed in the court which was a center
                           for the daily worship of the people (Ex. 27:1-21).
                       "No language can describe the glory of the scene presented
                     within the sanctuary—the gold-plated walls reflecting the light
                     from the golden candlestick, the brilliant hues of the richly
                     embroidered curtains with their shining angels, the table, and
                     the altar of incense, glittering with gold; beyond the second veil
                     the sacred ark, with its mystic cherubim, and above it the holy
                     Shekinah, the visible manifestation of Jehovah's presence; all
                     but a dim reflection of the glories of the temple of God in
                     heaven, the great center of the work for man's redemption."—
                     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 349.

                       What happened when the first worship service was held at
                     this tabernacle? Ex. 40:34, 35.

                       Exodus 40 tells the dramatic story of the erecting of the
                     tabernacle. The structure was to be set up, the furniture
                     arranged, the laver filled with water, the implements anointed,
                     the priests sanctified, the bread set in order, the candles lighted.
                     Incense was burned for the first time in the first apartment, and a
                     burnt offering was offered on the altar in the court.

THINK IT THROUGH       How much am I contributing to the support of my church?

                       "The murmurings of the Israelites and the visitations of God's
                     judgments because of their sins are recorded as a warning to
                     after-generations. And their devotion, their zeal and liberality,
                     are an example worthy of imitation. All who love the worship of
                     God and prize the blessing of His sacred presence will manifest
                     the same spirit of sacrifice in preparing a house where he may
                     meet with them."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 344.

         WORSHIP and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn
         SERVICES thereon the fat of the peace offerings. The fire shall ever be
                  burning upon the altar; it shall never go out" (Lev. 6:12, 13),

                       There was a deep spiritual meaning in this ever-burning
                    flame. "The Jews affirm that it burned continuously until the
                    Babylonian captivity. Some even claim that it never went out
                    until the final destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70."—SDA Bible
                    Commentary, on Lev. 6:13. God, the true object of Israel's
                    worship was not here today and gone tomorrow. Whatever sins
                    they might commit, the flame still burned on their altar.
                    Whatever dangers they might face, the fire never went out.
                    There was a permanence in the worship of the eternal God.

                      What did the daily worship service include?

                      "The daily service consisted of the morning and evening
                    burnt offering, the offering of sweet incense on the golden altar,
                    and the special offerings for individual sins. . . .
                      "Every morning and evening a lamb of a year old was burned
                    upon the altar, with its appropriate meat offering, thus
                    symbolizing the daily consecration of the nation of Jehovah,
                    and their constant dependence upon the atoning blood of
                    Christ. . . .
                      "In the offering of incense the priest was brought more
                    directly into the presence of God than in any other act of the
                    daily ministration.... As in that typical service the priest looked
                    by faith to the mercy seat which he could not see, so the people
                    of God are now to direct their prayers to Christ, their great High
                    Priest, who, unseen by human vision, is pleading in their behalf
                    in the sanctuary above. . . .
                       "The most important part of the daily ministration was the
                    service performed in behalf of individuals."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, pp. 352-354.

 THINK IT THROUGH     In what way did the daily worship service of Israel set an
                    example for us? (See Ps. 5:3; 55:16, 17; 88:13.)

                        "The hours appointed for the morning and the evening
                      sacrifice were regarded as sacred, and they came to be
                      observed as the set time for worship throughout the Jewish
                      nation. . . . In this custom Christians have an example for
                      morning and evening prayer. While God condemns a mere
                      round of ceremonies, without the spirit of worship, He looks
                      with great pleasure upon those who love Him, bowing morning
                      and evening to seek pardon for sins committed and to present
                      their requests for needed blessings."—Patriarchs and

            Part 5   "And he shall make an atonement for the holy place,
        THE YEARLY because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and
       CELEBRATIONS because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall
                   he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth
                   among them in the midst of their uncleanness" (Lev. 16:16).


                         The greatest of the yearly worship services was the Day of
                     Atonement.
                         "Once a year, on the great Day of Atonement, the priest
                     entered the most holy place for the cleansing of the sanctuary.
                     The work there performed completed the yearly round of
                     ministration. . . .
                         "Every man was to afflict his soul while the work of atonement
                     was going forward. All business was laid aside, and the whole
                     congregation of Israel spent the day in solemn humiliation
                     before God, with prayer, fasting, and deep searching of
                     heart."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 355.
                         "Thus in the ministration of the tabernacle, and of the temple
                     that afterward took its place, the people were taught each day
                     the great truths relative to Christ's death and ministration, and
                     once each year their minds were carried forward to the closing
                     events of the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the
                     final purification of the universe from sin and sinners."—
                     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 358.
                        In addition to the Day of Atonement and the weekly Sabbath,
                     there were several other important worship events during the
                     year. Among these were the new moons (Num. 28:11-15); the
                     Passover (Exodus 12), the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Ex.
                     12:15-20), and the ceremony of the wave sheaf (Lev. 23:10-14);
                     Pentecost (the Feast of Weeks) (Lev. 23:15-21); the blowing of
                     trumpets (Lev. 23:24, 25); and the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev.
                     23:34-43). See SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, pp. 708-710.
                        These ancient religious celebrations are mentioned to
                     illustrate how large a place public and private worship held in
                     the lives of the people. A substantial part of the resources and
                     time of the average Israelite was spent in activities related to the
                     worship of his God. But this continual round of worship was not
                     a means of appeasing deities, as in heathen religions. The
                     Israelites' worship, at its best, was a recognition of the
                     goodness of God and an acceptance of the provisions made by
                     God to solve the sin problem. So the worship was rational and
                     ethical. It avoided religious frenzy and incantation.

                      connection with our worship of God?

          Part 6   "You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of
     THE WORSHIP meeting, and wash them with water. And you shall take the
        LEADERS garments, and put on Aaron the coat and the robe of the
                 ephod, and the ephod, and the breastpiece, and gird him with
                 the skilfully woven band of the ephod; and you shall set the
                 turban on his head, and put the holy crown upon the turban.
                 And you shall take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head
                 and anoint him. Then you shall bring his sons, and put coats
                 on them, and you shall gird them with girdles and bind caps on
                 them; and the priesthood shall be theirs by a perpetual stat-
                 ute. Thus you shall ordain Aaron and his sons" (Ex. 29:4-9,
                 RSV).
                      By whom did God plan that the worship services of Israel
                    should be administered?
                       "By divine direction the tribe of Levi was set apart for the
                    of the sanctuary.... The priesthood, however, was restricted to
                    the family of Aaron. Aaron and his sons alone were permitted to
                    minister before the Lord."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 350. .

                      Did ordination to the priesthood ensure faithfulness on the
                    part of those ordained? Lev. 10:1, 2.
                      "Strange fire. Ordinary fire. It was not taken from the altar of
                    burnt offering, whose fire God Himself had kindled and which
                    was therefore sacred (ch. 16:12, 13). In the court of the
                    congregation there were hearths where the priests prepared
                    their food, and it may be that Nadab and Abihu took their
                    common fire from thence."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Lev.
                    10:1.
                      Of whom was the high priest a type? Heb. 4:14.

 THINK IT THROUGH     In the New Testament church, who assumes the responsi-
                    bility of leading the congregation in worship? (See 1 Tim.
                    3:1-7.)

                       In the Christian church God ordained a ministry in place of a
                    priesthood. While the ministry is a gift of the Spirit, the minister
                    is ordained to his work by the church. His work is varied. He may
                    be an evangelist, a pastor, a teacher, an administrator; or his
                    work may be a combination of these functions. One of his
                    responsibilities is worship leadership. He plans worship
                    services and preaches to the worshipers. He conducts
                    communion services and leads out in prayer meetings. In these
                    functions he may be assisted by laymen; in fact the work of the
                    elder and deacon is a function of the total ministry of the
                    church.

       APOSTASY AT Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that
        THE JORDAN thence he might see the utmost part of the people" (Num.
                   22:41).

                        Balak, the king of Moab, called upon Balaam, a free-lance
                     prophet, to curse Israel who were camped on the plains of
                     Moab. Balaam was torn between his loyalty to God and his
                     desire for the honorarium promised him by Balak. The first
                     location selected by Balak for Balaam to curse Israel was "the
                     high places of Baal." The third site chosen by Balak in his
                     unsuccessful effort to persuade Balaam to curse Israel was
                     Mount Peor, "where was a temple devoted to the licentious
                     worship of Baal, their god."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 449.
                        Failing in his efforts to curse Israel, Balaam suggested
                     another approach to the destruction of Israel. "The plan pro-
                     posed by Balaam was to separate them from God by enticing
                     them into idolatry. If they could be led to engage in the licen-
                     tious worship of Baal and Ashtaroth, their omnipotent Protector
                     would become their enemy, and they would soon fall a prey to
                     the fierce, warlike nations around them. This plan was readily
                     accepted by the king, and Balaam himself remained to assist in
                     carrying it into effect."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 451.
                        The plan nearly succeeded. The worship of Baal was all
                     around the camp of Israel. Soon Midianitish women began to
                     appear in the camp. "It was the object of these women, in their
                     association with the Hebrews, to seduce them into transgres-
                     sion of the law of God, to draw their attention to heathen rites
                     and customs, and lead them into idolatry."—Patriarchs and
                     Prophets, p. 454. Israelites were induced to attend feasts of
                     Baal, and soon "Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor" (Num.
                     25:3). Thousands died as the result of this apostasy.

THINK IT THROUGH       Does Israel's tragic experience on the borders of the
                     Promised Land have any message for us? (See 2 Peter 2:15.)

                       "As we approach the close of time, as the people of God stand
                     upon the borders of the heavenly Canaan, Satan will, as of old,
                     redouble his efforts to prevent them from entering the goodly
                     land. He lays his snares for every soul. It is not the ignorant and
                     uncultured merely that need to be guarded; he will prepare his
                     temptations for those in the highest positions, in the most holy
                     office; if he can lead them to pollute their souls, he can through
                     them destroy many. And he employs the same agents now as he
                     employed three thousand years ago. By worldly friendships, by

                       It should be noted that the term "Baalim" is the plural of
                    "Baal." The Canaanite worship had many gods. Also
                    "Ashtoreth" was a goddess of the Canaanites.
                       Judges 2 summarizes a trend that plagued Israel for
                    generations. Israel would apostatize into Baal worship. God
                    would deliver them into the hands of their enemies. Israel would
                    repent, and God would raise up a judge to deliver them. Then
                    the cycle would begin again.
                       One fascinating story from this sequence is the story of Gid-
                    eon (Judges 6 through 8). Israel had sinned, and the Midianites
                    and Amalekites conquered them. "And the children of Israel
                    cried unto the Lord." God called Gideon to be the deliverer. His
                    first act was to throw down his father's altar of Baal, cut down
                    the grove beside it, and replace the altar with an altar to
                    Jehovah. Then followed the fascinating story of the reduction of
                    the army to the faithful 300, of the breaking of the pitchers and
                    the blowing of the trumpets, and of the routing of the
                    Midianites. After 40 years of quiet, Gideon died. "And it came to
                    pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel
                    turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made
                    Baal-berith their god" (Judges 8:33).
                       After a while the enemies of Israel—the Ammonites and the
                    Philistines—conquered again. "The children of Israel cried
                    unto the Lord, saying, We have sinned against thee, both
                    because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim"
                    (Judges 10:10). This time it was Jephthah who delivered his
                    people. And so the cycle continued with monotonous regular-
                    ity. It seemed that Israel would never learn.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What can we learn from the up-and-down experience of
                    Israel during the time of the judges?

                      The final paragraph of the chapter, "The Earlier Judges," in
                    Patriarchs and Prdphets, contains the following statement:
                      "Like Israel, Christians too often yield to the influence of the
                    world and conform to its principles and customs, in order to
                    secure the friendship of the ungodly; but in the end it will be
                    found that these professed friends are the most dangerous of
                    foes. The Bible plainly teaches that there can be no harmony
                    between the people of God and the world."—Page 559.

The Battle With Baal          LESSON 3                                  ❑ Tuesday
                                                                        October 12
           Part 3   "And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
      REFORMATION do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the
       IN WORSHIP strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
                  your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only; and he will
                  deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. Then the children
                  of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the
                  Lord only" (1 Sam. 7:3, 4).

                        Samuel was not only a competent judge, but a great spiritual
                     leader. He "visited the cities and villages throughout the land,
                     seeking to turn the hearts of the people to the God of their
                     fathers; and his efforts were not without good results. After
                     suffering the oppression of their enemies for twenty years, the
                     Israelites 'mourned after the Lord.' Samuel counseled them, 'If
                     ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the
                     strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your
                     hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him only.' Here we see that
                     practical piety, heart religion, was taught in the days of Samuel
                     as taught by Christ when He was upon the earth."—Patriarchs
                     and Prophets, p. 590.

                       How did Samuel follow up this new reformation?1 Sam. 7:5.

                        He issued a call for all Israel to come together at Mizpeh, and
                     he said, "I will pray for you unto the Lord." Here is an indication
                     of Samuel's deeply spiritual leadership which began a
                     reformation that kept the worship of Baal in check for many
                     years. The meeting at Mizpeh included fasting, repentance, and
                     offerings. It also included prayer for deliverance from the
                     Philistines who were threatening to attack. God intervened and
                     turned the Philistines back with a storm, and the Israelites
                     pursued them.
                       Samuel recognized the importance of memorials to help
                     Israel remember to worship their God. "Then Samuel took a
                     stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name
                     of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us"
                     (1 Sam. 7:12). At his home "he built an altar unto the Lord"
                     (verse 17).

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the difference between wholehearted and half-
                     hearted worship?

                       "With all your heart." It was with this expression that Samuel
                     addressed Israel both at Mizpeh and at Gilgal. (1 Samuel 12:20).
                     This was the secret of Israel's success. When their hearts were
                     divided between Baal and Jehovah, they could not be blessed.
                     When their commitment to God was complete, He could lead
                     and protect them.

The Battle With Baal         LESSON 3                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 13
           Part 4     In the coronation of King Saul, what part was played by a
  THE SCHOOLS OF    company of prophets?
    THE PROPHETS
                      "And after that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is
                    the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
                    thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a
                    company of prophets coming down from the high place with a
                    psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
                    and they shall prophesy: and the Spirit of the Lord will come
                    upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be
                    turned into another man."
                      "And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
                    Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs
                    came to pass that day" (1 Sam. 10:5, 6, 9).

                      One of the greatest factors in the battle against Baal was the
                    influence of the prophets of God. This great institution of divine
                    prophecy was kept alive by "the schools of the prophets,"
                    mentioned so often in the writings of Ellen White.
                       "The schools of the prophets were founded by Samuel to
                    serve as a barrier against the widespread corruption, to provide
                    for the moral and spiritual welfare of the youth, and to promote
                    the future prosperity of the nation by furnishing it with men
                    qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders and counselors. In
                    the accomplishment of this object Samuel gathered companies
                    of young men who were pious, intelligent, and studious. These
                    were called the sons of the prophets. As they communed with
                    God and studied His word and His works, wisdom from above
                    was added to their natural endowments."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 593.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can we be led to shun false worship and worship God
                    aright?

                       "Let the youth be led to understand the object of their
                    creation, to honor God and bless their fellow men; let them see
                    the tender love which the Father in heaven has manifested
                    toward them, and the high destiny for which the discipline of
                    this life is to prepare them, the dignity and honor to which they
                    are called, even to become the sons of God, and thousands
                    would turn with contempt and loathing from the low and selfish
                    aims and the frivolous pleasures that have hitherto engrossed
                    them. They would learn to hate sin and to shun it, not merely
                    from hope of reward or fear of punishment, but from a sense of
                    its inherent baseness, because it would be a degrading of their
                    God-given powers, a stain upon their Godlike manhood."—

The Battle With Baal          LESSON 3                                  ❑ Thursday
                                                                         October 14

             Part 5     "And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long
      ELIJAH MEETS    halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him:
           A CRISIS   but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not
                      a word" (1 Kings 18:21).

                         What was the condition of Israel at the time of Elijah?
                         King Ahab and his heathen wife, Jezebel, brought Israel to an
                      all-time low, spiritually. "The dark shadow of apostasy covered
                      the whole land. Images of Baalim and Ashtoreth were
                      everywhere to be seen. Idolatrous temples and consecrated
                      groves, wherein were worshiped the works of men's hands,
                      were multiplied. The air was polluted with the smoke of the
                      sacrifices offered to false gods. Hill and vale resounded with the
                      drunken cries of a heathen priesthood who sacrificed to the
                      sun, moon, and stars."—Prophets and Kings, p. 115.

                         How did Elijah bring this worship conflict to a point of deci-
                      sion? 1 Kings 17:1.
                         The followers of Baal believed that "the treasures of heaven,
                      the dew and the rain, came not from Jehovah, but from the
                      ruling forces of nature."—Prophets and Kings, p. 120. Elijah
                      challenged the power of Baal by announcing to the king that
                      there would be a long famine. For three years and a half no rain
                      fell, and finally in the confrontation on Mount Carmel it was
                      made clear that the prophets of Baal were helpless. The heathen
                      worship that had so completely engulfed Israel was proved
                      false. The prophets of Baal were slain, and the way was opened
                      for a new era in the history of Israel.
                         But the work of Elijah was not done. A brief detour of discour-
                      agement and a rendezvous with God in the wilderness prepared
                      him for the remainder of his mission.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How can you tell whether a worship service glorifies God or
                      not? (See Matt. 15:9.)
                         "In the exaltation of the human above the divine, in the praise
                      popular leaders, in the worship of mammon, and in the placing
                      of the teachings of science above the truths of revelation,
                      multitudes today are following after Baal. . . .
                         "Yet this apostasy, widespread as it has come to be, is not
                      universal. Not all in the world are lawless and sinful; not all have
                      taken sides with the enemy. God has many thousands who have
                      not bowed the knee to Baal."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 170,
                      171.
                        "If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him" is
                      a relevant challenge in the 1970s.

The Battle With Baal        LESSON 3                                   ❑ Friday
                                                                      October 15
          Part 6     Why was Israel finally taken into captivity?
  THE RESULTS OF
   BAAL WORSHIP      "And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he
                   made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
                   against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
                   went after the heathen that were round about them,
                   concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that they
                   should not do like them. And they left all the commandments
                   of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, even
                   two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of
                   heaven, and served Baal" (2 Kings 17:15, 16).

                     What part did heathen practices of worship play in the final
                   downfall of Israel? 2 Kings 17:18.

                     "The iniquity in Israel during the last half century before the
                   Assyrian captivity was like that of the days of Noah, and of every
                   other age when men have rejected God and have given
                   themselves wholly to evil-doing. The exaltation of nature above
                   the God of nature, the worship of the creature instead of the
                   Creator, has always resulted in the grossest of evils. Thus when
                   the people of Israel, in their worship of Baal and Ashtoreth, paid
                   supreme homage to the forces of nature, they severed their
                   connection with all that is uplifting and ennobling, and fell an
                   easy prey to temptation. With the defenses of the soul broken
                   down, the misguided worshipers had no barrier against sin and
                   yielded themselves to the evil passions of the human heart....
                      "Such were some of the results that had followed the setting
                   up of the two calves of gold by Jeroboam. The first departure
                   from established forms of worship had led to the introduction of
                   grosser forms of idolatry, until finally nearly all the inhabitants
                   of the land had given themselves over to the alluring practices
                   of nature worship."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 281, 282.

THINK IT THROUGH    Why do God's people sometimes suffer calamities? (See
                   Hosea 4:6.)

                     It was the worship of Baal rather than God that sealed the fate
                   of Israel. "Moses traced the evils that would result from a
                   departure from the statutes of Jehovah. Calling heaven and
                   earth to witness, he declared that if, after having dwelt long in
                   the Land of Promise, the people should introduce corrupt forms
                   of worship and bow down to graven images and should refuse
                   to return to the worship of the true God, the anger of the Lord
                   would be aroused, and they would be carried away captive and
                   scattered among the heathen."—Prophets and Kings, p. 295.

                     It is important how and whom we worship.

The Temple and
Its Dedication
  "Behold, I build an house to the         1. Solomon understood the reason
lame of the Lord my God, to dedicate     for a house of worship. It was not to
Ito him, and to burn before him sweet    glorify its builder or to nourish the

                                            (1 Kings 6:21, 22)
                                         2. The Temple Conserved the
                                            Past (2 Chron. 5:2, 5, 10)

                                            Forgiveness (2 Chron. 6:21)
                                         5. Solomon's Prayer for the

            Part 1   "So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and
        THE TEMPLE he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle;
         DEMANDED and he overlaid it with gold. And the whole house he overlaid
          THE BEST with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole
                   altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold" (1 Kings
                   6:21, 22).

                        This passage is merely a sample indicating the quality of
                     materials and workmanship that went into the temple.
                        "Of surpassing beauty and unrivaled splendor was the
                     palatial building which Solomon and his associates erected for
                     God and His worship. Garnished with precious stones,
                     surrounded by spacious courts with magnificent approaches,
                     and lined with carved cedar and burnished gold, the temple
                     structure, with its broidered hangings and rich furnishings, was
                     a fit emblem for the living church of God on earth, which
                     through the ages has been building in accordance with the
                     divine pattern, with materials that have been likened to 'gold,
                     silver, precious stones,' polished after the similitude of a
                     palace.' 1 Corinthians 3:12; Psalm 144:12. Of this spiritual
                     temple Christ is 'the chief Cornerstone.' "—Prophets and
                     Kings, p. 36.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is it possible to spend too much in the building of God's
                     house?

                       If such an output of energy and wealth was appropriate in
                     Solomon's day in erecting a national temple for the worship of
                     God, should not we provide the best we can today for local
                     buildings for His worship?
                       "Many act as though the Creator of the heavens and the earth,
                     He who has made everything that is lovely and beautiful in our
                     world, would be pleased to see a house erected for Him without
                     order or beauty. Some build large, convenient houses for
                     themselves, but cannot afford to spend much upon a house
                     which they are to dedicate to God. Every dollar of the means in
                     their hands is the Lord's. He has lent it to them for a little while,
                     to use to His glory; yet they hand out this means for the
                     advancement of the cause of God as though every dollar thus
                     expended were a total loss.
                       "God would not have His people expend means extravagantly
                     for show or ornament, but He would have them observe
                     neatness, order, taste, and plain beauty in preparing a house for
                     Him in which He is to meet with His people. Those who build a
                     house for God should manifest as much greater interest, care,
                     and taste in its arrangement as the object for which it is
                     prepared is higher and more holy than that for which common
                     dwelling houses are prepared."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 257.

The Temple and Its Dedication             LESSON 4                   ❑ Monday
                                                                     October 18
          Part 2   "Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the
      THE TEMPLE heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
       CONSERVED Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
        THE PAST the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion. . . .
                   "And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
                 congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
                 tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up....
                   "There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which
                 Moses put therein at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant
                 with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt"
                 (2 Chron. 5:2, 5, 10).

                      What was the purpose of this procedure?

                       God does not change. Centuries may come and go, nations
                    may rise and fall, cultures may appear and disappear, but God is
                    the same yesterday, today, and forever. This being true, there
                    needs to be continuity in His worship. This does not mean that
                    customs and forms may not change; but it does mean that the
                    realities of the past will not be lightly laid aside.
                       Nearly five hundred years had passed since God gave Moses
                    the tables of stone, since the ark of the covenant was
                    constructed. But the passing of five centuries had not lessened
                    the importance of these elements in Israel's worship.
                       "At the appointed time the hosts of Israel, with richly clad
                    representatives from many foreign nations, assembled in the
                    temple courts. The scene was one of unusual splendor.
                    Solomon, with the elders of Israel and the most influential men
                    among the people, had returned from another part of the city,
                    whence they had brought the ark of the testament. From the
                    sanctuary on the heights of Gibeon had been transferred the
                    ancient 'tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels
                    that were in the tabernacle' (2 Chronicles 5:5); and these
                    cherished reminders of the earlier experiences of the children
                    of Israel during their wanderings in the wilderness and their
                    conquest of Canaan, now found a permanent home in the
                    splendid building that had been erected to take the place of the
                    portable structure."—Prophets and Kings, p. 38.
                       These objects from the past were more than antiques. They
                    preserved the content of the worship of God in a day when
                    books were scarce and the past might have been easily
                    forgotten. Let us beware of a "now" religion that ignores the
                    heritage of the past. As Seventh-day Adventists, we have often
                     repeated: "We have nothing to fear for the future except as we
                    shall forget the way the Lord has led us."—Testimonies to
                    Ministers, p. 31.

            Part 3   "And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
     GOD'S PROMISES Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
         REGARDING walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all
       THE TEMPLE my commandments, to walk in them; then will I perform my
                   word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: and I will
                   dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my
                   people Israel" (1 Kings 6:11-13).

                        What relation does this promise have to worship?

                         "In the midst of the architectural description is inserted a
                      brief notice of the Lord's promise concerning the Temple....
                         "One of the reasons the Lord sent His word at this time was
                      that Solomon needed to be kept in constant remembrance of
                      his solemn responsibilities to Heaven. Even when a man is
                      engaged in working for the Lord, and is acting upon His
                      command and in fulfillment of His design, it is possible to forget
                      the necessity of continued rededication of purpose. The danger
                      is always present that he will take steps that will forfeit the divine
                      blessing. Again and again the Lord sends to His people
                      messages destined to remind them of the vital importance of
                      holding to basic principles which alone will ensure continued
                      prosperity, peace, and blessing."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                      1 Kings 6:11.

THINK IT THROUGH        In what circumstances can God bless a project to set up a
                      church building?

                        It was as if God had said to Solomon: Solomon, you are
                      building Me a great temple at the cost of much labor and wealth.
                      But remember, Solomon, this temple and its services will not
                      take the place of obedience to My will. In order for the services
                      of the temple to be significant, they must be performed by a
                      priesthood and a people who are dedicated to Me and who are
                      sensitive to My guidance. And remember, Solomon, I desire
                      earnestly to fulfill My promises and to have a close relationship
                      with Israel. I will not forsake Israel, but they may forsake Me.
                        True worship can never exist apart from a close relationship
                      with God. It becomes mechanical and meaningless without the
                      obedience prompted by love, but it is one of life's greatest
                      experiences when its sacred rites are performed in the fear of
                      God. Every time a church is dedicated to the worship of God, it
                      would be appropriate to remember God's word to Solomon.
                      God says to His people today: If you will follow Me, if you will
                      dedicate your lives to Me, if you will become involved in
                      unselfish service, if you will witness for Me to the world, I will be
                      with your church, and I will bless your services, your worship,
                      your activities, and your witness.

The Temple and Its Dedication              LESSON 4               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    October 20
         Part 4   "Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant,
SOLOMON'S PRAYER and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this
 FOR FORGIVENESS place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven;
                and when thou hearest, forgive" (2 Chron. 6:21).

                      How did Solomon's prayer reveal that Solomon understood
                    that God's promises were conditional?

                      Solomon did not presume upon the goodness of God merely
                    because he had built Him a magnificent temple. Solomon's
                    prayer, as the king knelt in the presence of the multitude, was
                    primarily a prayer for forgiveness. Worship was more than an
                    expression of emotion, it was an acceptance of responsibility.
                      Solomon asked that Israel might be forgiven whenever their
                    sins against God got them into trouble and they repented. "If
                    there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, . . . if their
                    enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever
                    sore or whatsoever sickness there be: then what prayer or what
                    supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy
                    people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his
                    own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house: then
                    hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
                    render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart
                    thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children
                    of men:) that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as
                    they live in the land which thou gayest unto our fathers"
                    (2 Chron. 6:28-31).

 THINK IT THROUGH    What part do confession and forgiveness play in our life and
                    worship? (See Ps. 51:17.)

                       As Solomon prayed, he was standing in the shadow of the
                    temple that contained the mercy seat, the emblem of God's
                    forgiveness. He was deeply involved in sacrifices, the Old
                    Testament symbol for mediating the forgiveness of God. The
                    worship of God is always involved in asking and receiving God's
                    forgiveness. Confession is a basic element in worship, and the
                    true worshiper may have every reason to believe that his sins are
                    forgiven. The Old Testament emphasis on confession and
                    forgiveness in worship prefigured the New Testament gospel
                    which revolves around the same theme.
                       "The conditions of obtaining mercy of God are simple and
                    just and reasonable. The Lord does not require us to do some
                    grievous thing in order that we may have the forgiveness of sin.
                    We need not make long and wearisome pilgrimages, or perform
                    painful penances, to commend our souls to the God of heaven
                    or to expiate our transgression; but he that confesseth and
                    forsaketh his sin shall have mercy."—Steps to Christ, p. 37.

     THE WORSHIPING name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm;
          STRANGER if they come and pray in this house; then hear thou from the
                   heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all
                   that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth
                   may know ... that this house which I have built is called by thy
                   name" (2 Chron. 6:32, 33).

                            "One of the most touching portions of Solomon's dedicatory
                         prayer was his plea to God for the strangers that should come
                         from countries afar to learn more of Him whose fame had been
                         spread abroad among the nations."—Prophets and Kings, p. 66.
                         This part of the prayer is sandwiched between the eloquent
                         pleas for forgiveness that precede and follow it.

                           Why did Solomon include this request in his prayer? Isa.
                         56:7.

                            The temple was intended not only as a center of worship for
                         Israel, but as a lighthouse for all nations. The temple worship
                         was to have a missionary dimension. Solomon apparently
                         recognized that this phase of the worship of God might be lost.
                         And it was. "When the Temple was first established, Solomon
                         remembered the strangers of other lands, that they too might
                         hear of God's covenant of grace and come to the Temple to
                         worship Him. Israel was to be a light that was to enlighten the
                         world. Had they been faithful to their divine mission, the nation
                         would not have perished, but would have continued to grow till
                         it embraced all the nations of earth, till Jerusalem would have
                         become the world's metropolis, and its Temple would have
                         become the source of a river of life to bring health and healing to
                         all."—SDA Bible Commentary, on 1 Kings 8:43.

     THINK IT THROUGH      Does the worship of God still have a missionary dimension?

                            "We spend millions of dollars on evangelism, and rightly so;
                         but the results of our evangelistic efforts will be dissipated if our
                         new converts are driven away by an irreverent, unsatisfying
                         Sabbath service. We engage in lay activities that take us up and
                         down the streets of our cities with literature and with invitations
                         to enroll in Bible courses. This is good ; but are we deterred from
                         the finest possible missionary activity—bringing our non-
                         Adventist friends to our churches—by failure to provide
                         worshipful Sabbath services? . . .

         Part 6   "Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire
     GOD HEARD came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering
SOLOMON'S PRAYER and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house.
                And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord,
                because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house. And
                when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
                and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed
                themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
                and worshipped, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good;
                for his mercy endureth forever" (2 Chron. 7:1-3).

                      "The king had done everything within his power to encourage
                   the people to give themselves wholly to God and His service,
                   and to magnify His holy name. And now once more, as at Gibeon
                   early in his reign, Israel's ruler was given evidence of divine
                   acceptance and blessing. In a night vision the Lord appeared to
                   him with the message: 'I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen
                   this place to Myself for an house of sacrifice. If I shut up heaven
                   that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the
                   land, or if I send pestilence among My people; if My people,
                   which are called by My name, shall humble themselves, and
                   pray, and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways; then
                   will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal
                   their land. Now Mine eyes shall be open, and Mine ears attent
                   unto the prayer that is made in this place. For now have I chosen
                   and sanctified this house, that My name may be there forever:
                   and Mine eyes and Mine heart shall be there perpetually.' Verses

                       "Almost imperceptibly he [Solomon] began to trust less and
                    less in divine guidance and blessing, and to put confidence in
                    his own strength.... Yielding to the temptations incident to his
                     success and his honored position, he forgot the Source of his
                     prosperity."—Prophets and Kings, p. 55.

                    communion with God?

                       "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
                    things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them

                    take thy crown" (Rev. 3:11). The fact that we have worshiped
                    God, and that He has answered our prayers, does not excuse us
                    from vigilance.

LESSON 5 October 24-30



Isaiah's Concern
About Worship
  "With joy you will draw water from
the wells of salvation. And you will say
in that day:
  "'Give thanks to the Lord,
     call upon his name;
  make known his deeds among the
nations,
     proclaim that his name is exalted.

  "'Sing praises to the Lord, for he has
done gloriously;
     let this be known in all the earth.
  Shout, and sing for joy, 0 inhabitant
of Zion,
     for great in your midst is the Holy
   One of Israel' " (Isa. 12:3-6, RSV).
   There was much in Isaiah's day to
bring discouragement to the sensitive
soul of the prophet.
   "The times in which Isaiah was to
labor were fraught with peculiar peril
to the people of God. The prophet was
to witness the invasion of Judah by the
combined armies of northern Israel
and of Syria; he was to behold the
Assyrian hosts encamped before the
chief cities of the kingdom. . . .
   "But the dangers from without,
overwhelming though they seemed,
were not so serious as the dangers
from within. Itwas the perversity of his
people that brought to the Lord's
servant the greatest perplexity and the
deepest depression. . . .
   "The outlook was particularly
discouraging as regards the social
conditions of the people. . . . Justice
was perverted, and no pity was shown
the poor. . . .
   "With oppression and wealth came
pride and love of display, gross
drunkenness, and a spirit of revelry.
   .And in Isaiah's day idolatry itself no
longer provoked surprise. . . .
Iniquitous practices had become so          LESSON OUTLINE

  Yet for sixty years Isaiah was a
prophet of hope to Israel, and with
great sensitivity he called Israel to the
worship of God.

                         ! cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly" (Isa. 1:12,
                                                                  13, RSV).


                        In the Old Testament prophets there is a continual struggle
                     between religious formality and spiritual experience. Isaiah is
                     joined by Jeremiah, Hosea, Amos, Micah, and others in warning
                     against the danger of going through the motions of religion
                     without understanding the real nature of service for God.
                         "Judah was still, outwardly, a very religious nation. Great
                     numbers of sacrifices were offered at the Temple, but there was
                     little true religion. While maintaining the external forms of
                     religion the professed people of God had forgotten what it was
                     that God really wanted of them. They were willing to offer
                     sacrifices, but not to give their hearts to the Lord. They knew the
                     forms of religion, but they did not understand their need of a
                     Saviour or the meaning of righteousness. Isaiah endeavored to
                     bring the people to their senses. . . . By a series of pointed
                     questions he hoped to bring home to them the fact that a
                     religion consisting only of outward forms was an offense in the
                     sight of God."8SDA Bible Commentary, on Isa. 1:11.

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways may we substitute formalism for godliness?

                        "In every age, a majority of the professed followers of Christ
                     have disregarded those precepts which enjoin self-denial and
                     humility, which require modesty and simplicity of conversation,
                     deportment, and apparel. The result has ever been the
                     same,—departure from the teachings of the gospel leads to the
                     adoption of the fashions, customs, and principles of the world.
                     Vital godliness gives place to a dead formalism. The presence
                     and power of God, withdrawn from those world-loving circles,
                     are found with a class of humbler worshipers, who are willing to
                     obey the teachings of the Sacred Word. Through successive
                     generations, this course has been pursued. One after another,
                     different denominations have risen and, yielding their simplic-
                     ity, have lost, in a great measure, their early power."—Messages

            Part 2     "Their land is filled with idols;
A WARNING AGAINST        they bow down to the work of their hands,
     IDOL WORSHIP        to what their own fingers have made" (Isa. 2:8, RSV).

                       One of the great problems of Isaiah's day was that of the
                     worship of idols. It seemed a hopeless task to wean his people
                     away from the gods of their neighbors. Isaiah resorted to
                     sarcasm in his attempt to get his idea across. (Read Isaiah 44:-
                     12-21.)

                         "14. The rain. Men may plant the seed from which the tree
                     sprouts, but only God can make it grow. Without the power of
                     God there would be no tree from which to carve an idol!
                         "15. Yea, he maketh a god. It is a mere matter of chance
                     which piece of wood is used for fuel and which for the idol!
                         "16. He burneth part. The folly of making a god out of
                     something a man has the power to destroy!
                         "He roasteth roast. Dead Sea scroll 110Is' reads, 'upon his
                     charcoal he sits.'
                         "17. Deliver me. The wood could not have delivered itself
                     from the fire had he chosen to burn it instead of worship it! How
                     foolish of a man who has used most of his wood for fuel to shape
                     one of the leftover sticks into an idol and expect it to have the
                     strength and the intelligence to save his life!
                         "18. They have not known. Men who do worship images have
                     little knowledge. Their foolish hearts are dark, and though they
                     profess to be wise they are fools (Rom. 1:21-23). . . .
                         "19. The stock of a tree. Literally, 'the dry wood of a tree.' He
                     who worships an idol merely pays reverence to a block of wood.
                     He talks to it and bows down before it, little thinking that it
                     would be as sensible to make his requests to a staff. . . .
                         "20. He feedeth on ashes. How foolish a man would be to
                     make a meal of ashes, expecting nourishment from them. It is
                     equally foolish to think that an idol can benefit man.
                         "21. Remember these. God calls Israel to heed what He has
                     said about the folly of worshiping idols. Israel belongs to God;
                     they are to serve Him."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Isa.
                     44:14-21.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What experience was intended to save both the ancient and
                     the modern church from idolatry? (See Ex. 31: 13-17.)

                       "The Lord designed that by a faithful observance of the Sab-
                     bath command, Israel should continually be reminded of their
                     accountability to Him as their Creator and their Redeemer.
                     While they should keep the Sabbath in the proper spirit, idolatry

     ISAIAH'S VISION
             OF GOD      "In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon
                       a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
                       Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings; with two
                       he covered his face and with two he covered his feet, and with
                       two he flew. And one called to another and said:
                         " 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;
                         the whole earth is full of his glory.'
                       "And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of
                       him who called, and the house was filled with smoke" (Isa.
                       6:1-4, RSV).


                           "In the year that king Uzziah died, Isaiah was permitted in

                        sanctuary were drawn aside, and a throne high and lifted up,
                        towering as it were to the very heavens, was revealed to his
                        gaze. An indescribable glory emanated from a personage on the
                       throne, and His train filled the temple, as His glory will finally fill
                       the earth. Cherubim were on either side of the mercy-seat, as
                        guards round the great king, and they glowed with the glory that
                       enshrouded them from the presence of God. As their songs of
                        praise resounded in deep, earnest notes of adoration, the pillars
                        of the gate trembled, as if shaken by an earthquake. These holy
                       beings sang forth the praise and glory of God with lips
                        unpolluted with sin. The contrast between the feeble praise
                       which he had been accustomed to bestow upon the Creator and
                       the fervid praises of the seraphim, astonished and humiliated
                       the prophet. He had for the time being the sublime privilege of
                       appreciating the spotless purity of Jehovah's exalted
                       character."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

THINK IT THROUGH         What does Isaiah's experience tell us about worship?


                          Parts 4-6 of this lesson continue to answer this question. The
                       first lesson is that the worshiper must "see the Lord." He may
                       not receive a vision of the temple in heaven, as Isaiah did,
                       nevertheless he will become conscious of the presence of God.
                       This consciousness will shut out the world, and make him
                       sensitive to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This realization of
                       the presence of God comes only to the person who has
                       prepared himself for it by dedication and commitment. Only the
                       pure in heart will see God. (See Matt. 5:8.)

Isaiah's Concern About Worship              LESSON 5             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 27
           Part 4  "Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a
 ISAIAH'S HUMILITY man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of
IN GOD'S PRESENCE unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of
                  hosts" (Isa. 6:5).

                     Did Isaiah really mean that he was in need of personal
                   forgiveness and transformation?

                      "Isaiah had denounced the sin of others; but now he sees
                   himself exposed to the same condemnation he had pronounced
                   upon them. He had been satisfied with a cold, lifeless ceremony
                   in his worship of God. He had not known this until the vision was
                   given him of the Lord. How little now appeared his wisdom and
                   talents as he looked upon the sacredness and majesty of the
                   sanctuary. How unworthy he was! how unfitted for sacred
                   service! His view of himself might be expressed in the language
                   of the apostle Paul, '0 wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
                   me from the body of this death?' "—Ellen G. White Comments,
                   SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1139.

THINK IT THROUGH    After we have had a glimpse of God, what is the next step in
                   worship and Christian experience?

                      "It is not enough to perceive the loving-kindness of God, to
                   see the benevolence, the fatherly tenderness, of His character. It
                   is not enough to discern the wisdom and justice of His law, to
                   see that it is founded upon the eternal principle of love. Paul the
                   apostle saw all this when he exclaimed, 'I consent unto the law
                   that it is good.' The law is holy, and the commandment holy,
                   and just, and good.' But he added, in the bitterness of his
                   soul-anguish and despair, 'I am carnal, sold under sin.' Romans
                   7:16, 12, 14. He longed for the purity, the righteousness, to
                   which in himself he was powerless to attain, and cried out, '0
                   wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of
                   death?' Romans 7:24, margin. Such is the cry that has gone up
                   from burdened hearts in all lands and in all ages."—Steps to
                   Christ, p. 19.
                      What does a deep feeling of spiritual need have to do with the
                   worship of God? Here, again, worship and salvation are closely
                   related. A glimpse of God makes us feel our need of Him.
                   Feeling our need puts us in the attitude where God can help us.
                   God's action in forgiving our sins and transforming our lives
                   causes us to come to Him in grateful adoration and worship. In
                   fact, a real experience of conversion and regeneration cannot
                   be separated from the experience of worship. The closer our
                   relation to God, the more anxious we will be to worship Him, and
                   the more we worship Him, the closer will be our relationship to
                   God.

               Part 5     What effect does a genuine worship experience have on the
     ISAIAH RECEIVES    personal life?
      GOD'S BLESSING
                          "Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal
                        in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the
                        altar: and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath
                        touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
                        purged" (Isa. 6:6, 7).

                           When we really see God, respond to Him, and recognize our
                        need, He responds by forgiving our sins and transforming our
                        lives. One of the primary purposes of worship is to keep us in
                        touch with the One whose transforming friendship can make us
                        what we ought to be. This cleansing and converting power can
                        only be experienced if our worship is sincere. Mere formalities
                        will leave our lives empty and unchanged.
                           "As they [God's people in the last days] look by faith into the
                        holy of holies, and see the work of Christ in the heavenly
                        sanctuary, they perceive that they are a people of unclean
                        lips,—a people whose lips have often spoken vanity, and whose
                        talents have not been sanctified and employed to the glory of
                        God. Well may they despair as they contrast their own weakness
                        and unworthiness with the purity and loveliness of the glorious
                        character of Christ. But if they, like Isaiah, will receive the
                        impression the Lord designs shall be made upon the heart, if
                        they will humble their souls before God, there is hope for them.
                        The bow of promise is above the throne, and the work done for
                        Isaiah will be performed in them. God will respond to the peti-
                        tions coming from the contrite heart."—Ellen G. White
                        Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1139.

THINK IT THROUGH         When we go to the church to worship, what can ensure that
                        we experience God's transforming grace?

                            "Our meetings should be made intensely interesting. They
                        should be pervaded with the very atmosphere of heaven. Let
                        there be no long, dry speeches and formal prayers merely for
                        the sake of occupying the time. All should be ready to act their
                        part with promptness, and when their duty is done, the meeting
                        should be closed. Thus the interest will be kept up to the last.
                        This is offering to God acceptable worship. His service should
                        be made interesting and attractive and not be allowed to
                        degenerate into a dry form. We must live for Christ minute by
                        minute, hour by hour, and day by day; then Christ will dwell in
                        us, and when we meet together, His love will be in our hearts,
                        welling up like a spring in the desert, refreshing all, and making
                        those who are ready to perish, eager to drink of the waters of
                        life."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 609.

Isaiah's Concern About Worship              LESSON 5                   ❑ Friday
                                                                      October 29
           Part 6    What is the relation between worship and a sense of
  ISAIAH ACCEPTS mission?
GOD'S COMMISSION
                     "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I
                  send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me"
                  (Isa. 6:8).

                      "As he [Isaiah] stood in the portico of the temple, the Lord
                   revealed Himself to him. The veil of the temple was withdrawn,
                   the door lifted, and he had a view of the holy of holies within the
                   veil. He saw the God of Israel before the throne high and lifted
                   up, and the train of His glory filled the temple. As Isaiah senses
                   his own sinfulness, he cries out, 'I am a man of unclean lips, and
                   I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.' And there was
                   seen the hand that took the live coal from off the altar, and
                   touched his lips, and bade him be clean. Then he was ready to
                   go with the message, and he said, 'Send me'; for he knew that
                   the Spirit of God would be with the message.
                      "To those who are engaged in the work of God, in the
                   conversion of souls, it would seem as though it was impossible
                   to reach the obdurate heart. This is how Isaiah felt, but when he
                   saw that there was a God above the cherubim, and that they
                   were ready to work with God, he was ready to carry the
                   message."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
                   tary, vol. 4, p. 1141.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can we summarize Isaiah's contribution toward a
                    clearer understanding of the worship of God?

                     Isaiah was tremendously concerned about his people. They
                   had lost sight of the real meaning of worship, and many of them
                   were worshiping idols. To help him meet this great need, God
                   gave him a vision. When he saw God, he felt his own need. When
                   he felt his own need, God met that need. When God met his
                   need, Isaiah was equipped to go on God's mission. This is the
                   model of the authentic worship of God in every age. Every
                   service of worship, be it personal, family, or church, should
                   have these ingredients—a glimpse of God, a feeling of humility,
                   an experience of transformation, and a dedication to mission.
                     "To everyone who becomes a partaker of His grace the Lord
                   appoints a work for others. Individually we are to stand in our lot
                   and place, saying, 'Here am I; send me.' Isaiah 6:8. Upon the
                   minister of the word, the missionary nurse, the Christian
                   physician, the individual Christian, whether he be merchant or
                   farmer, professional man or mechanic—the responsibility rests
                   upon all. It is our work to reveal to men the gospel of their
                   salvation. Every enterprise in which we engage should be a
                   means to this end."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 148.

                     in seven, but every day; not for a brief span, but for all time. Our
                     love to God and our praise to Him should be a daily matter. Every
                     day God sends unnumbered blessings to His children, and there
                     is every reason why we should praise Him daily."—SDA Bible
                     Commentary, on Ps. 145:2.

                       What specific reasons for praising God are listed in this
                     psalm?

                       God's greatness (verse 3); God's works (verses 4-6); God's
                     goodness (verses 7-9); God's kingly power (verses 10-13); God's
                     ability to restore (verse 14); God's liberality (verses 15, 16);
                     God's nearness (verses 18, 19).
                       Praise for the goodness and power of God will change our
                     attitude toward life. "Then let us educate our hearts and lips to
                     speak the praise of God for His matchless love. Let us educate
                     our souls to be hopeful and to abide in the light shining from the
                     cross of Calvary."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 253.
                       In both The Ministry of Healing, (p. 435) and Testimonies (vol.
                     8, p. 283), Ellen White quotes Psalm 145:3-21, and comments,
                     "As we learn more and more of what God is, and of what we
                     ourselves are in His sight, we shall fear and tremble before
                     Him."

THINK IT THROUGH       To what extent do I lack this sense of the greatness,
                     goodness, and power of God that would make me reverent
                     and worshipful?

                       In describing the final scenes of the great controversy, Ellen
                     White says, "God's wisdom, His justice, and His goodness stand
                     fully vindicated. It is seen that all His dealings in the great
                     controversy have been conducted with respect to the eternal
                     good of His people and the good of all the worlds that He has
                     created. 'All Thy works shall praise Thee, 0 Lord; and Thy saints
                     shall bless Thee.' "—The Great Controversy, pp. 670, 671.
                       Is my reverence for God and my knowledge of Him great
                     enough today so that it will be the natural thing for me to join in
                     His praise at the end of the drama of the ages?

  Worship in the Psalms           LESSON 6                              ❑ Monday
                                                                       November 1
              Part 2     "The Lord looseth the prisoners: the Lord openeth the eyes
     PRAISE FOR THE    of the blind: the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the
RD'S RIGHTEOUS ACTS    Lord loveth the righteous: the Lord preserveth the strangers;
                       he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the
                       wicked he turneth upside down" (Ps. 146:7-9).

                         What similar Old Testament text did Jesus quote at the
                       synagogue at Nazareth?

                          "The Spirit of the Lord.God is upon me; because the Lord
                       hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath
                       sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
                       captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound"
                       (Isa. 61:1). (Note that when Jesus referred to this text in Luke
                       4:18, He added the phrase, "and recovering of sight to the
                       blind.")

                         What other reasons for worshiping God are listed in Psalm
                       146?

                         1. God is Creator (verse 6).
                         2. God "keepeth truth for ever" (RSV; "keeps faith")
                            (verse 6).
                         3. God is the judge (verse 7).
                         4. God feeds the hungry (verse 7).
                         5. God will reign forever (verse 10).

   THINK IT THROUGH     What do passages like these tell us about the privilege of
                       worshiping God?

                         Every one of us, every day, is the recipient of multiplied
                       blessings from God. As Paul said, "In him we live, and move, and
                       have our being" (Acts 17:28). These blessings include provision
                       for our temporal needs, forgiveness for sins, ability to overcome
                       sin, security in an insecure world, divine companionship, the
                       fellowship of the church, and hope of eternal life. Surely these
                       blessings are reason enough for praise and worship.
                         "Every step in life may bring us closer to Jesus, may give us a
                       deeper experience of His love, and may bring us one step nearer
                       to the blessed home of peace. Then let us not cast away our
                       confidence, but have firm assurance, firmerthan ever before....
                       Let us look to the monumental pillars, reminders of what the
                       Lord has done to comfort us and to save us from the hand of the
                       destroyer. Let us keep fresh in our memory all the tender
                       mercies that God has shown us,—the tears He has wiped away,
                       the pains He has soothed, the anxieties removed, the fears
                       dispelled, the wants supplied, the blessings bestowed,—thus
                       strengthening ourselves for all that is before us through the
                       remainder of our pilgrimage."—Steps to Christ, p. 125.

                                                                      November 2
            Part 3   "Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our
     PRAISE FOR THE God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. The Lord doth
      LORD'S FAVOR build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of
      TO JERUSALEM Israel" (Ps. 147:1, 2).

                       What does this statement about "Jerusalem" mean to us?

                       To the Israelites, Jerusalem was the center of national and
                     spiritual life, a symbol of their relationship to their God. The
                     nearest parallel we have today is the church. It is appropriate to
                     apply the statements of Psalm 147 to the church.

                       What does God do for His people that should inspire their
                     praise and worship?

                        1. He gathers the outcasts (verse 2).
                        2. He heals the brokenhearted (verse 3).
                        3. He has infinite power and understanding (verse 5).
                        4. He lifts up the meek (verse 6).
                        5. He subdues the wicked (verse 6).
                        6. He provides food (verses 8, 9, 14).
                        7. He provides security (verse 13).
                        8. He blesses their children (verse 13).
                        9. He provides peace (verse 14).
                       10. He provides water for the land (verses 16-18).
                       11. He reveals His laws (verse 19).

                        "How precious are the lessons of this psalm. We might well
                     devote study to the last four psalms of David."—Fundamentals
                     of Christian Education, p. 371.

THINK IT THROUGH       What do these promises to the church mean to me person-
                     ally?

                        "Whatever your anxieties and trials, spread out your case
                     before the Lord. Your spirit will be braced for endurance. The
                     way will be open for you to disentangle yourself from
                     embarrassment and difficulty. The weaker and more helpless
                     you know yourself to be, the stronger will you become in His
                     strength. The heavier your burdens, the more blessed the rest in
                     casting them upon your Burden Bearer.
                        "Circumstances may separate friends; the restless waters of
                     the wide sea may roll between us and them. But no
                     circumstances, no distance, can separate us from the Saviour.
                     Wherever we may be, He is at our right hand, to support,
                     maintain, uphold, and cheer."—The Ministry of Healing, p.72.

Worship in the Psalms           LESSON 6                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     November 3
           Part 4      "Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens:
    ALL CREATION    praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise
    EXHORTED TO     ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him,
 PRAISE THE LORD    all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye
                    waters that be above the heavens" (Ps. 148:1-4).

                      Psalm 148 is divided into two parts: the praise of God in
                    heaven (verses 1-6), and the praise of God on earth (verses
                    7-14).

                      What is meant by praising God "from the heavens"?

                      The kingdom of God encompasses the entire universe. This
                    psalm not only pictures all the beings of the universe praising
                    God, but it also personifies the sun, moon, and stars, and other
                    created things as returning praise to their Creator.
                      The same sentiment is found in Psalm 103: "Bless the Lord, ye
                    his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments....
                    Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his
                    pleasure. Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his
                    dominion: bless the Lord, 0 my soul" (verses 20-22).

                      Under what circumstances are the followers of God to offer
                    their praises to Him? Ps. 146:2; 145:1, 2.

                      Praise for God is appropriate under many circumstances. In
                    Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 108, 109, there is a section that connects
                    singing of psalms of praise with churches and church schools:
                      "I saw in different places new companies of believers being
                    raised up and meetinghouses being erected.... In the basement
                    of the church, above ground, I was shown a room provided for a
                    school where the children could be educated in the truths of
                    God's word. . . .
                       "As the work was being pressed forward, I heard the voices of
                    children and parents singing: . . .
                       'Praise ye the Lord from the heavens:
                      Praise Him in the heights.
                      Praise ye Him, all His angels:
                      Praise ye Him, all His hosts.
                       Praise ye Him, sun and moon:
                       Praise Him, all ye stars of light.' Psalm 148:1-3.
                       "The companies that are raised up need a place of worship.
                    Schools are needed where Bible instruction may be given to the
                    children."

THINK IT THROUGH      Since the above instruction was given, churches and
                    schools have been multiplied around the world. Do the
                    praises of God still reverberate in these buildings? It is this
                    spirit of worship that makes them effective.

                                                                      November 4

            Part 5     What place does joy have in the worship God?
 ISRAEL EXHORTED
        TO PRAISE      "Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his
         THE LORD    praise in the congregation of saints. Let Israel rejoice in him
                     that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King"
                     (Ps. 149:1, 2).

                       This brief psalm stresses the joy of worship. "Let Israel
                     rejoice." "Let the children of Zion be joyful." "Let the saints be
                     joyful in glory" (verse 5).
                       "The religious life is not one of gloom and of sadness but of
                     peace and joy coupled with Christlike dignity and holy so-
                     lemnity. We are not encouraged by our Saviour to cherish
                     doubts and fears and distressing forebodings; these bring no
                     relief to the soul and should be rebuked rather than praised. We
                     may have joy unspeakable and full of glory."—Evangelism, p.
                     180.
                       "God desired to bring all peoples under His merciful rule. He
                     desired that the earth should be filled with joy and peace. He
                     created man for happiness, and He longs to fill human hearts
                     with the peace of heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 290.
                       "Anciently the Lord bade Israel, when they met together for
                     His service, 'Ye shall eat before the Lord your God, and ye shall
                     rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
                     households, wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee.'
                     Deuteronomy 12:7. That which is done for the glory of God
                     should be done with cheerfulness, with songs of praise and
                     thanksgiving, not with sadness and gloom. . . .
                       "It should be a pleasure to worship the Lord and to take part in
                     His work."—Steps to Christ, p. 103.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can the Christian maintain a spirit of happiness? (See
                     Ps. 19:8.)

                       "Those who in everything make God first and last and best,
                     are the happiest people in the world."—Messages to Young
                     People, p. 38.
                       "A meek and quiet spirit will not be ever looking out for
                     happiness for itself, but will seek for self-forgetfulness and find
                     sweet content and true satisfaction in making others
                     happy."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 536.
                       "True happiness springs from a heart at peace with
                     God."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
                     7, p. 942.
                       A happy Christian life tends to produce a worshiping
                     Christian, because happiness must be expressed in praise and
                     gratitude. If we were happier, might it be pdssible that our
                     worship would be more spontaneous?

                    in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts:
                    praise him according to his excellent greatness. Praise him
                    with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and
                    harp. Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with
                    stringed instruments and organs. Praise him upon the loud
                    cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. Let
                    every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the
                    Lord" (Ps. 150:1-6).

                      "The service of song was made a regular part of religious
                    worship, and David composed psalms . . . to be sung by the
                    people in their journeys to the national altar at the annual feasts.
                    The influence thus exerted was far-reaching, and it resulted in
                    freeing the nation from idolatry. Many of the surrounding
                    peoples, beholding the prosperity of Israel, were led to think
                    favorably of Israel's God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 711.

                      What is the function of sacred music in our day?

                      "As the children of Israel, journeying through the wilderness,
                    cheered their way by the music of sacred song, so God bids His
                    children today gladden their pilgrim life. There are few means
                    more effective for fixing His words in the memory than
                    repeating them in song. And such song has wonderful power. It
                    has power to subdue rude and uncultivated natures; power to
                    quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to promote harmony
                    of action, and to banish the gloom and foreboding that destroy
                    courage and weaken effort.
                       "It is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart
                    with spiritual truth. Flow often to the soul hard-pressed and
                    ready to despair, memory recalls some word of God's,—the
                    long-forgotten burden of a childhood song,—and temptations
                    lose their power, life takes on new meaning and new purpose,
                    and courage and gladness are imparted to other souls!"—
                    Education, pp. 167, 168.
                       "Let praise and thanksgiving be expressed in song. When
                    tempted, instead of giving utterance to our feelings, let us by
                    faith lift up a song of thanksgiving to God. . . .
                       "Song is a weapon that we can always use against
                    discouragement. As we thus open the heart to the sunlight of
                    the Saviour's presence, we shall have health and His
                    blessing."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 254.

Jesus
and Worship
  "But the hour cometh, and now is,
when the true worshippers shall
worship the Father in spirit and in
truth: for the Father seeketh such to
worship him. God is a Spirit: and they
that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth" (John 4:23, 24).
  The woman at Jacob's well had
raised a question regarding the proper
place to worship God—Jerusalem or
Samaria? Jesus answered her question
by describing the nature of true
worship.
   "Not by seeking a holy mountain or
a sacred temple are men brought into
communion with heaven. Religion is
not to be confined to external forms
and ceremonies. The religion that
comes from God is the only religion
that will lead to God. . . . Wherever a
soul reaches out after God, there the
Spirit's working is manifest, and God
will reveal Himself to that soul."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 189.
  This concept of worship appears
again and again in the teachings of
Jesus. He saw the futility of the formal
worship of the day. He recognized that
spiritual worship was fast
disappearing. As a result, one
important aspect of His work was "to
establish an altogether different
worship."—The Desire of Ages, p. 157.
The purpose of this lesson is to
explore Jesus' teaching regarding
worship, to examine the respects in
which it is "altogether different," and
to make applications to the life of the
Christian today.
  It is inevitable that Jesus should have
had something to say about worship.
One theologian has said, "Christian
worship is the most momentous, the
most urgent, the most glorious action
that can take place in human life." If
this be true, surely Jesus would not       has done for us. Worship, therefore, is

            Part 1   How did Jesus show His concern for reverence for the place
     JESUS TEACHES of worship and divine services?
        REVERENCE
                     "And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
                   Jerusalem, and found in the temple those that sold oxen and
                   sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: and
                   when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all
                   out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out
                   the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto
                   them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my
                   Father's house an house of merchandise" (John 2:13-16).

                          "He [Jesus] acted as He did because God's house was being
                       desecrated. In the Temple there was worship without reverence.
                       ... Worship without reverence can be a terrible thing.... It may
                       be the use of the house of God for purposes and in a way where
                       reverence and the true function of God's house is forgotten. In
                       that Temple court at Jerusalem there would be arguments
                       about prices, disputes about coins that were worn and thin, the
                       clatter of the market place in the court of the house of God. That
                       particular way of irreverence may not be common now, but
                       there are other ways of offering an irreverent worship to
                       God."—From The Gospel of John, translated and interpreted by
                       William Barclay (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1956),
                       vol. 1, pp. 98, 99. Used by permission.
                          "So great was the confusion that the worshipers were
                      disturbed, and the words addressed to the Most High were
                      drowned in the uproar that invaded the temple."—The Desire of
                      Ages, p. 155.
                          "The priests and rulers were called to be the representatives
                      of God to the nation; they should have corrected the abuses of
                     'the temple court. They should have given to the people an
                      example of integrity and compassion. Instead of studying their
                      own profit, they should have considered the situation and needs
                      of the worshipers, and should have been ready to assist those
                      who were not able to buy the required sacrifices. But this they
                       did not do. Avarice had hardened their hearts."—The Desire of

THINK IT THROUGH       What lessons does Jesus' cleansing of the temple have for
                     us?

                       1. The church is a house for prayer, and not a place where we
                     buy or sell.
                       2. The church is where our thoughts are turned to God and
                     His goodness, and not to man and his wickedness.
                       3. The church is a place where we "tread softly" because we
                     do not want to draw attention away from God and to ourselves.

Jesus and Worship        LESSON 7                                    ❑ Monday
                                                                    November 8
          Part 2   What prerequisite to effective worship did Jesus describe in
  JESUS RELATES the Sermon on the Mount?
WORSHIP AND LIFE
                   "Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
                 rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave
                 there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be
                 reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift"
                 (Matt. 5:23, 24).

                     What life situation does this text suggest?

                      Picture a sincere follower of God who had saved for many
                   months to present a gift to God. He is on his way to the altar
                   where this gift will be dedicated, when it occurs to him that his
                   neighbor is angry with him as a result of a business deal. What
                   should he do? Could he not make his peace with his neighbor
                   after he returns home from the religious service? No. Jesus
                   says, Leave your gift. Go all the way home. Find your neighbor
                   and straighten up the dispute. Then come back to the altar and
                   offer your gift.

                     What does this text tell us about worship?

                     "The act of offering a personal 'gift,' or sacrifice, was
                   considered to be among the most holy and important of all
                   religious acts, but even it must take second place under the
                   circumstances set forth. It is possible that the 'gift' here
                   mentioned was a sacrifice made to secure divine forgiveness
                   and favor. Christ insists that men must make things right with
                   their fellow men before they can be reconciled with God (see
                   Matt. 6:15; 1 John 4:20). The more important obligation takes
                   precedence over one of less importance. Reconciliation is more
                   important than sacrifice."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Matt.
                   5:24.
                     "Many are zealous in religious services, while between them
                   and their brethren are unhappy differences which they might
                   reconcile. God requires them to do all in their power to restore
                   harmony. Until they do this, He cannot accept their
                   services."—The Desire of Ages, p. 311.

THINK IT THROUGH     Which is more important, to attend the church service, or to
                   be at peace with one's brethren?

                     Just as a sin offering for a theft would be ineffective until the
                   stolen goods were returned, so an endeavor to go through the
                   forms of worshiping God is a mockery if we lack kindness,
                   compassion, and forgiveness for our fellowman.

              Part 3   Under what conditions is worship meaningless?
      JESUS RELATES
       WORSHIP AND     "This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
          OBEDIENCE honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But
                     in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
                     commandments of men" (Matt. 15:8, 9).

                         What is the background of this passage?

                         A delegation of scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem
                      questioned Jesus because His disciples did not observe the
                      ceremonial washings that were considered so important by the
                      Jews. Jesus replied by pointing out the hypocrisy of one of their
                      traditions that made it possible for them to evade their
                      responsibility to look after the needs of their parents. He thus
                      revealed the inconsistency of their religion which demanded
                      meticulous observance of ceremonies but permitted neglect of
                      the needs of aging parents. In order to reinforce His reproof
                      Jesus paraphrased Isaiah 29:13. A study of this passage in
                      Isaiah and the parallel Gospel passages in Matthew 15 and Mark
                      7 reveals a great truth: God demands obedience as an evidence
                      of the genuineness of worship. The heart and the hands must
                      support what the mouth proclaims.

THINK IT THROUGH        Can a person worship God acceptably when he has not yet
                      put away a known sin?

                         "Although God dwells not in temples made with hands, yet He
                      honors with His presence the assemblies of His people. He has
                      promised that when they come together to seek Him, to
                      acknowledge their sins, and to pray for one another, He will
                      meet with them by His Spirit. But those who assemble to
                      worship Him should put away every evil thing."—Prophets and
                      Kings, p. 50.
                         Cain's worship was not acceptable because it was contrary to
                      divine direction. Israel's many lapses into Baal worship were
                      self destructive because Baal worship was immoral. The
                      worship of Israel in the time of the prophets was unacceptable
                      because the worshipers were violating the basic principles of
                      human relations. Savonarola is quoted as saying, "True
                      worship consists of holiness of life."
                        "It [the divine Spirit] will give us a willing obedience to all His
                      requirements. This is true worship. It is the fruit of the working
                      of the Holy Spirit. By the Spirit every sincere prayer is indited,
                      and such prayer is acceptable to God. Wherever a soul reaches
                      out after God, there the Spirit's working is manifest, and God
                      will reveal Himself to that soul. For such worshipers He is
                      seeking. He waits to receive them, and to make them His sons
                      and daughters."—The Desire of Ages, p. 189.

         TO PRAY are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in

                    knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him"
                    (Matt. 6:5, 7, 8).

                      Why did Jesus warn against ostentation?

                       "The Jewish system of prayer made ostentation very easy.
                    The Jew prayed standing, with hands stretched out, palms
                    upwards, and with head bowed. Prayer had to be said at 9 am, 12
                    midday, and 3 pm. It had to be said wherever a man might be,
                    and it was easy for a man to make sure that at these hours he
                    was at a busy street corner, or in a crowded city square, so that
                    all the world might see with what devotion he prayed. It was easy
                    for a man to halt on the top step of the entrance to the
                    synagogue, and there pray lengthily and demonstratively, so
                    that all men might admire his exceptional piety. It was easy to
                    put on an act of prayer which all the world might see."—From
                    The Gospel of Matthew, translated and interpreted by William
                    Barclay (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1958), vol. 1, p.
                    196. Used by permission.

                      Why did Jesus warn against repetition?

                      "There was an attempt to pile up every possible title and
                    adjective in the address of the prayer to God.... There is one
                    Jewish prayer which actually begins with sixteen different
                    adjectives attached to the name of God. There was a kind of
                    intoxication with words. When a man begins to think more of
                    how he is praying than of what he is praying, his prayer dies
                    upon his lips."—From The Gospel of Matthew, translated and
                    interpreted by William Barclay, vol. 1, p. 196.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can we be guilty of ostentation and repetition in
                    prayer?

                      The whole point of prayer is communion with God. The
                    person who prays the same prayer over and over again, with
                    practically no variation, is as guilty of repetition as were the
                    religionists of old.

                    Amen" (Matt. 6:9-13).

                        What does Jesus' model prayer teach us about prayer?

                       Corporate prayer. Jesus counseled his followers to go alone
                     into their "closet" to pray, yet His prayer used the first person
                     plural—"Our" Father—Give "us" "our" daily bread—Forgive
                     "us" "our" debts—Lead "us" not into temptation—Deliver "us"
                     from evil. Jesus wished His praying followers to identify
                     themselves with other people and to include them in their
                     prayers.
                       Prayer should include praise. The first three petitions of the
                     Lord's prayer extol the name, the kingdom, and the will of God.
                     All true prayer must recognize the greatness of God. The prayer,
                     in Matthew's record, also closes on this note.
                       Prayer may include petition. "The first half of the prayerJesus
                     has taught us is in regard to the name and kingdom and will of
                     God—that His name may be honored, His kingdom established,
                     His will performed. When you have thus made God's service
                     your first interest, you may ask with confidence that your own
                     needs may be supplied. If you have renounced self and given
                     yourself to Christ you are a member of the family of God, and
                     everything in the Father's house is for you."—Thoughts From
                     the Mount of Blessing, p. 110.

                        What is the relation between prayer and worship?

                        Prayer includes worship„ Prayer is also one of the most
                      significant aspects of Christian experience. It is on our knees
                      that we come to know and worship God; and it is on our knees
                      that we find spiritual strength and fulfillment. The relationship
                      between the worship of God and Christian living becomes real
                      in the experience of prayer.

THINK IT THROUGH        How should we use the Lord's Prayer in structuring our own
                      prayer life?

                       Jesus said, "After this manner ... pray ye." He did not intend
                     that Christians should limit themselves to repeating the Lord's
                     Prayer. He expected that our prayers would be characterized by
                     the same simplicity, the same reverence, the same concerns
                     that are found in the model prayer.

           Part 6   "And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man,
    JESUS TEACHES and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord
WORSHIPFUL SABBATH also of the sabbath" (Mark 2:27, 28).
      OBSERVANCE
                    There are seven recorded miracles of Jesus performed on
                  the Sabbath:

                      1. The healing of the lame man at Bethesda (John 5:1-15).
                      2. The demoniac in the synagogue (Mark 1:21-28).
                      3. Peter's mothei'-in-law (Mark 1:29-31).
                      4. The man with a withered hand (Mark 3:1-6).
                      5. The man born blind (John 9:1-41).
                      6. The crippled woman (Luke 13:10-17).
                      7. The man with dropsy (Luke 14:1-6).
                     Each miracle demonstrated proper Sabbath keeping.

                       What should be our attitude toward Sabbath keeping as part
                     of our worship?

                        "The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless
                     inactivity. The law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the
                     Lord; the toil that gains a livelihood must cease; no labor for
                     worldly pleasure or profit is lawful upon that day; but as God
                     ceased His labor of creating, and rested upon the Sabbath and
                     blessed it, so man is to leave the occupations of his daily life,
                     and devote those sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and
                     to holy deeds."—The Desire of Ages, p. 207.
                        "No other institution which was committed to the Jews
                     tended so fully to distinguish them from surrounding nations as
                     did the Sabbath. God designed that its observance should
                     designate them as His worshipers. It was to be a token of their
                     separation from idolatry, and their connection with the true
                     God. But in order to keep the Sabbath holy, men must
                     themselves be holy. Through faith they must become partakers
                     of the righteousness of Christ. When the command was given to
                     Israel, 'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,' the Lord
                     said also to them, 'Ye shall be holy men unto Me.' Ex. 20:8;
                     22:31. Only thus could the Sabbath distinguish Israel as the
                     worshipers of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 283.

  THINK IT THROUGH     How should the Sabbath hours be spent? (See Matt. 12:12.)

                       "God has given man six days in which to do his own work and
                     carry on the usual business of life; but He claims one day, which
                     He has set apart and sanctified. He gives it to man as a day in
                     which he may rest from labor and devote himself to worship and
                     the improvement of his spiritual condition."—Testimonies, vol.

the means of building a church of

experience of meeting together. And

   The New Testament church was
continually meeting together. A
congregation of 500 met with the Lord
after His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:6),
and another group of 120 met in an
upper room after the resurrection
(Acts 1:15). Part of the experience of
the 3000 converts at Pentecost was
"fellowship" (Acts 2:41, 42). When

       PRAISES GOD with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and
                   having favour with all the people" (Acts 2:46, 47).

                       What are some of the examples of "praising God" found in
                     the records of the life of the New Testament church?

                       1. Regarding the very first Christians, immediately following
                     the ascension, it is said, "And they worshipped him, and
                     returned to Jerusalem with great joy: and were continually in
                     the temple, praising and blessing God" (Luke 24:52, 53).
                       2. When Peter and John were released from prison (Acts 4),
                     they returned to the church and recounted their experiences.
                     "And when they [the church] heard that, they lifted up their
                     voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God,
                     which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in
                     them is" (Acts 4:24).
                       3. Throughout the New Testament are statements of praise
                     which very likely were used in the services of the church. A good
                     example is Ephesians 3:20, 21: "Now unto him that is able to do
                     exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according
                     to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church
                     by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."

THINK IT THROUGH       What are different ways of praising God in our worship
                     services?

                         "The church of God below is one with the church of God
                     above. Believers on the earth and the beings in heaven who
                     have never fallen constitute one church. Every heavenly
                     intelligence is interested in the assemblies of the saints who on
                     earth meet to worship God. In the inner court of heaven they
                     listen to the testimony of the witnesses for Christ in the outer
                     court on earth, and the praise and thanksgiving from the
                     worshipers below is taken up in the heavenly anthem, and
                     praise and rejoicing sound through the heavenly courts
                     because Christ has not died in vain for the fallen sons of Adam.
                     ... Let us remember that our praises are supplemented by the
                     choirs of the angelic host above.
                         "Then as you meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, sing praises to

                         "While we review, not the dark chapters in our experience,

 PRAYS FOR HELP
                   "And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto
                 thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
                 by stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and
                 wonders may be done by the name of the holy child Jesus"
                 (Acts 4:29, 30).

                     Peter and John had healed a lame man in the temple. Peter
                   followed the healing by preaching a powerful sermon in which
                   he bore witness to his Lord. The authorities threw them in jail
                   overnight, but the result of the day's work was many
                   conversions (Acts 4:4). The next day Peter and John were called
                   before the authorities and, again, Peter bore eloquent witness
                   to Christ. Afraid to punish them further because of public
                   sentiment, the rulers let them go with a solemn warning to quit
                   preaching in the name of Jesus. Peter and John gave no
                   assurances of compliance with these commands. As soon as
                   they were released, they sought out a group of fellow believers
                   and related their experiences. Then this group of Christians
                   offered the prayer recorded in Acts 4:24-30. After ascribing
                   praise and honor to God, they continued their worship by
                   making the requests found in our text for today.
                     It is interesting to note that these persecuted believers did not
                   ask for deliverance from trouble; they didn't pray for wisdom to
                   avoid persecution; or for God to punish their enemies. They
                   prayed for boldness to preach the gospel. They prayed that
                   more people might be healed, even though the healing of the
                   day before had been the cause of their trouble.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do we go to God, not merely to receive bless-
                   ings for ourselves, but to receive power to minister to the
                   needs of the world?

                     Prayers for boldness to witness and clear manifestations of
                   the power of God were an important part of worship for the
                   apostles. Such. prayers are no less important today.
                     "God does not mean that any of us should become hermits or
                   monks and retire from the world in order to devote ourselves to
                   acts of worship. The life must be like Christ's life—between the
                   mountain and the multitude. He who does nothing but pray will
                   soon cease to pray, or his prayers will become a formal routine.
                   When men take themselves out of social life, away from the
                   sphere of Christian duty and cross bearing; when they cease to
                   work earnestly for the Master, who worked earnestly for them,
                   they lose the subject matter of prayer and have no incentive to
                   devotion."—Steps to Christ, p. 101.

                       "And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where
                     they were assembled together; and they were all filled with
                     the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
                     And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and
                     of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things
                     which he possessed was his own; but they had all things
                     common. And with great power gave the apostles witness of
                     the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon
                     them all" (Acts 4:31-33).

                        Note that the tremendous achievements described in this
                      passage came as the result of an act of worship—prayer. It was
                      "when they had prayed" that the Holy Spirit fell upon them.
                        "By the grace of Christ the apostles were made what they
                      were. It was sincere devotion and humble, earnest prayer that
                      brought them into close communion with Him. They sat
                      together with Him in heavenly places. They realized the
                      greatness of their debt to Him. By earnest, persevering prayer
                      they obtained the endowment of the Holy Spirit, and then they
                      went forth, weighted with the burden of saving souls, filled with
                      zeal to extend the triumphs of the cross. And under their labors
                      many souls were brought from darkness to light, and many
                      churches were raised up."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 32.

THINK IT THROUGH        If the church is to be successful in accomplishing the great
                      commission of preaching the gospel to all the world, what
                      must be a vital part of their spiritual experience? (See Eph.
                      6:18.)

                         "Shall we be less earnest than were the apostles? Shall we
                      not by living faith claim the promises that moved them to the
                      depths of their being to call upon the Lord Jesus for the
                      fulfillment of His word, 'Ask, and ye shall receive'? John 16:24. Is
                      not the Spirit of God to come today in answer to earnest,
                      persevering prayer, and fill men with power? Is not God saying
                      today to His praying, trusting, believing workers, who are
                      opening the Scriptures to those ignorant of the precious truth
                      they contain: 'Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
                      world'? Matthew 28:20. Why, then, is the church so weak and
                      spiritless?
                         "As the disciples, filled with the power of the Spirit, went forth
                      to proclaim the gospel, so God's servants are to go forth
                      today."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 32.
                        As in the time of the apostles, fervent prayer will be followed
                      by the infilling of the Spirit, unity, power, and grace. Those who
                      worship God come to know God and go to serve God.

THE CHURCH PRAYS remembered in the worship of the church?
     FOR ALL MEN
                    "I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
                  intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for
                  kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet
                  and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is
                  good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will
                  have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of
                  the truth" (1 Tim. 2:1-4).

                       Timothy was a young pastor and evangelist, and Paul was
                    giving him counsel regarding the conduct of his ministry. No
                    doubt Paul recognized the danger that the church would limit
                    its prayers to things pertaining to themselves.
                       "The gospel embraces Christian and non-Christian. Prayer is
                    to be made for all men. The Emperors and rulers and governors
                    for whom this letter bids us to pray were not Christians; they
                    were in fact hostile to the Church; and yet they were to be borne
                    to the throne of grace by the prayers of the Church. For the true
                    Christian there is no such thing as an enemy in all this world.
                    None is outside his prayers, for none is outside the love of
                    Christ, and none is outside the purpose of God, who wishes a//
                    men to be saved."—From The Letters to Timothy, Titus, and
                    Philemon, translated and interpreted by Willaim Barclay

THINK IT THROUGH       Do we pray as earnestly for our rulers as we ought?

                       The following prayer was offered by an early church leader in
                    the time of the persecuting Roman emperor, Domitian:
                       "You, Master, gave them [rulers] imperial power through your
                    majestic and indescribable might, so that we, recognizing it was
                    you who gave them the glory and honor, might submit to them,
                    and in no way oppose your will. Grant them, Lord, health, peace,
                    harmony, and stability, so that they may give no offense in
                    administering the government you have given them.... Direct
                    their plans, 0 Lord, in accord with 'what is good and pleasing to
                    you,' so that they may administer the authority you have given
                    them, with peace, considerateness, and reverence, and so win
                    your mercy. ... Amen."—Cyril C. Richardson, ed. Early Chris-

                       Should we not be more faithful in remembering our rulers in

                      "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
                    teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns
                    and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
                    Lord" (Col. 3:16).

                        "The curtain rises on the birth of Christ to singing by the
                     heavenly choir. Luke records in poetic form the announcement
                     of the angel to Zacharias that to him and his wife Elisabeth
                     would be born the Forerunner of the Messiah. The annunciation
                     to Mary is poetic; and when Mary realized that she was to be the
                     mother of the Christ, her amazement, humility, and gladness
                     found expression in pure poetry (Luke 1:32-35, 47-55). Later
                     when John was born, the tongue of Zacharias was loosed and
                     his joy poured forth in poetry (Luke 1:68-79). When the Holy
                     Child was brought to the Temple in compliance with Jewish
                     custom and Simeon realized that he was seeing the Lord's
                     Christ, he took the child in his arms and blessed God and broke
                     into song (Luke 2:29-35). These poetic utterances were later set
                     to music and became the precious hymns of the early
                     churches."—Gaines Dobbins, The Church at Worship
                     (Nashville: Broadman Press, 1962), p. 69. Used by permission.

                      What are some of the other references to music in the early
                     Christian church?

                       Mark 14:26. "And when they had sung an hymn, they went out
                     into the mount of Olives."See also Eph. 5:19;James 5:13;1 Cor.
                     14:15.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is the church today using the gift of music to the best
                     advantage?

                       "Music can be a great power for good; yet we do not make the
                     most of this branch of worship.... Music should have beauty,
                     pathos, and power. Let the voices be lifted in songs of praise
                     and devotion. Call to your aid, if practicable, instrumental
                     music, and let the glorious harmony ascend to God, an
                     acceptable offering.
                       "But it is sometimes more difficult to discipline the singers
                     and keep them in working order, than to improve the habits of
                     praying and exhorting. Many want to do things after their own
                     style; they object to consultation, and are impatient under
                     leadership. Well-matured plans are needed in the service of
                     God. Common sense is an excellent thing in the worship of the

            Part 6   What did Paul say to Timothy regarding Scripture reading,
      THE CHURCH preaching, and teaching as a part of worship?
       LISTENS TO
        THE WORD     "Till I come, attend to the public reading of scripture, to
                   preaching, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift you have, which
                   was given you by prophetic utterance when the elders laid
                   their hands upon you" (1 Tim. 4:13, 14, RSV).

                       Praise, prayer, and singing are important parts of worship,
                    but they are not enough. The worshiper goes to church to praise
                    God, but he also goes to learn more about God. This is-the
                    reason Scripture is read, lessons are taught, and sermons are
                    preached. Ellen White says, "Much of the public worship of God
                    consists of praise and prayer, and every follower of Christ
                    should engage in this worship. There is also the preaching
                    service, conducted by those whose work it is to instruct the
                    congregation in the word of God."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the
                    Times, June 24, 1886.
                        "When man comes into spiritual contact with God, that is
                    communion; it is worship. Preaching is spiritual worship of the
                    highest order because by means of it God comes directly to the
                    minds and hearts and consciences of men. Through the
                    preacher he stimulates and challenges all the higher qualities of
                    the soul. Hence preaching is indispensable to mature worship.
                    It is preaching that primarily makes worship mature and keeps it
                    so. As people leave church, they are often heard to remark that
                    they enjoyed the service. This may mean only that they had
                    pleasant sensations as they sat in a building that was artistically
                    and architecturally satisfying, as they listened to the music....
                    The sermon if of the right quality forces them to be honest with
                    themselves and with God as to whether they actually are better
                    morally than when they entered. The sermon can do more than
                    anything else to make and keep the worship a personal matter
                    between the soul and God."—I. T. Jones, A Historical Approach
                    to Evangelical Worship, pp. 260, 261.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What power makes preaching effective? (See Acts 1:8.)

                      "It is the efficiency of the Holy Spirit that makes the ministry of
                    the word effective. When Christ speaks through the minister,
                    the Holy Spirit prepares the hearts of the listeners to receive the
                    word. The Holy Spirit is not a servant, but a controlling power.
                    He causes the truth to shine into minds, and speaks through
                    every discourse where the minister surrenders himself to the
                    divine working. It is the Spirit that surrounds the soul with a holy
                    atmosphere, and speaks to the impenitent through words of
                    warning, pointing them to Him who takes away the sin of the
                    world."—Gospel Workers, p. 155.

   Worship in the
;ook of Revelation
Worship in the Book of Revelation                 LESSON 9              ❑ Sunday
                                                                      November 21
            Part 1    "And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings,
         THE LIVING are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they
         CREATURES never cease to sing,
       WORSHIP GOD       'Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
                         who was and is and is to come!' " (Rev. 4:8, RSV).

                        What is the meaning of the term, "living creatures"?

                        The KJV translates this word as "beasts." The translation
                     "living creatures" seems better, as the original word does not
                     indicate to what order of beings these four belong. Apparently
                     they were different from anything the prophet knew; therefore
                     he referred to them merely as "living creatures." "That the
                     description of God's throne and the scene about it in chs. 4 and
                     5 is to be understood symbolically, rather than literally, is clear,
                     for instance, from ch. 5:6, where Christ is described as 'a Lamb
                     as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes,' yet
                     alive and able to come and take the book from the hand of God.
                     Inasmuch as this is obviously a highly symbolic figure, it follows
                     that the whole prophetic incident is to be interpreted in the
                     same way."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 4:1.

                       What was included in the worship of the four living
                     creatures?

                        1. Ascription of holiness to God. The word hagios, translated
                     "holy" is used in reference to things, places, and persons; but
                     its highest application is to God. It is repeated three times for
                     emphasis. It refers to the purity, majesty, and glory of God.
                          "Holy, holy, holy! Though darkness hide Thee,
                          Through the eye of man Thy great glory may not see;
                          Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
                          Perfect in power, in love and purity."
                        2. Ascription of eternal existence to God. Men think of time in
                     terms of past, present, and future; but with God there is no
                     beginning and no end.
                          "Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee,
                          Casting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;
                          Thousands, and ten thousands worship low before Thee,

                                                                    November 22
         Part 2  "Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and
  THE 24 ELDERS power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
   WORSHIP GOD they are and were created" (Rev. 4:11).

                     Who were the 24 elders? (See verse 10.)

                     The Scripture does not tell us directly. Some identify them as
                   redeemed men in harmony with the reading "redeemed us" in
                   the KJV, and assuming that they were among those who were
                   raised from the dead at Christ's resurrection. Others consider
                   them heavenly beings because they minister the prayers of the
                   saints (Rev. 5:8). Whether they are redeemed men or heavenly
                   beings, they are pictured as "clothed in white raiment"
                   symbolizing purity and wearing "crowns of gold" signifying
                   victory.

                     What was distinctive about their song of worship?

                     "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the
                   Creator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence.
                   And wherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship,
                   above the gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the
                   evidence of His creative power. 'All the gods of the nations are
                   idols: but the Lord made the heavens.' Psalm 96:5. `To whom
                   then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift
                   up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
                   things.' Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God
                   Himself that formed the earth and made it:... I am the Lord; and
                   there is none else.' Isaiah 40:25, 26; 45:18. Says the psalmist:
                   'Know ye that the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us, and
                   not we ourselves.' 0 come, let us worship and bow down: let us
                   kneel before the Lord our Maker,' Psalm 100:3; 95:6. And the
                   holy beings who worship God in heaven state, as the reason why
                   their homage is due to Him: 'Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive
                   glory and honor and power: for Thou hast created all things.'
                   Revelation 4:11."—The Great Controversy, pp. 436, 437.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do we have a deep consciousness of the worthiness of God
                   as the object of our worship? Do we revere Him as our
                   Creator? Do we sing with a real sense of appreciation the
                   following hymn?

                      "My Maker and my King, to Thee my all I owe;
                      Thy sovereign bounty is the spring whence all my blessings
                   flow;

                     The creature of Thy hand, on Thee alone I live;
                     My God, Thy benefits demand more praise than I can give."

LIVING CREATURES and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each
   AND 24 ELDERS holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which
        WORSHIP are the prayers of the saints; and they sang a new song,
                 saying,
                   'Worthy are thou to take the scroll and to open its seals,
                   for thou wast slain and by thy blood didst ransom men for
                 God,
                   from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
                   and hast made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
                   and they shall reign on earth' " (Rev. 5:8, 9, RSV).

                     What was the setting of this act of worship?

                     The One who sat on the throne held in His right hand a scroll
                   "sealed with seven seals." An angel shouted, "Who is worthy to
                   open the scroll and break its seals?" (Rev. 5:2, RSV). There was
                   no answer. The prophet wept because no one seemed worthy to
                   unseal the secrets contained in the scroll. Then one of the 24
                   elders spoke: "Weep not," he exclaimed, "the Lion of the tribe
                   ofJudah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open
                   the scroll and its seven seals" (verse 5). No doubt the prophet
                   began to scan the celestial stage for the appearance of a lion;
                   but prophetic vision often brings surprises. "And between the
                   throne and the four living creatures and among the elders, I saw
                   a Lamb standing" (verse 6). Not a lion, but a lamb. Not an
                   ordinary lamb, but a lamb "as though it had been slain"—a
                   bleeding lamb. And it was this Lamb, a symbol of Jesus, who
                   took the scroll from the right hand of God. Twenty-seven times
                   in Revelation, Jesus is spoken of as a Lamb.

                     What do we learn about the gospel as we listen to the
                   heavenly beings worship the Lamb?

                      First, we learn that the saints on earth were not forgotten.
                   Their prayers were symbolized by incense in bowls held by the
                   living creatures and the elders. Second, we are reminded of the
                   efficacy of the blood of the slain Lamb "for thou wast slain and
                   by thy blood didst ransom men for God" (verse 9). Third, we
                   learn of the extent of the work of the gospel, "from every tribe
                   and tongue and people and nation" (verse 9). Fourth, we learn
                   of the ultimate destiny of the redeemed. They will be both kings
                   and priests.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the relation of worship to the gospel?

                     Worship in heaven was tied to the gospel. Worship on earth
                   must likewise exist in the context of the gospel. Christ, His
                   cross, the empty tomb, His ministry in our behalf, must always
                   be the subject of our prayers, songs, and sermons.

         Part 4   What specific reason caused the angels of heaven to sing
     THE ANGELS the praises of the Lamb?
    WORSHIP GOD
                  "And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round
                about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the
                number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and
                thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is
                the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and
                wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing"
                (Rev. 5:11, 12).

                     "Well, then, might the angels rejoice as they looked upon the
                   Saviour's cross; for though they did not then understand all,
                   they knew that the destruction of sin and Satan was forever
                   made certain, that the redemption of man was assured, and that
                   the universe was made eternally secure.'—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 764.

                     What is suggested by the seven-fold song of praise sung by
                   the angelic hosts?

                      The One who hung helplessly on across, who had nowhere to
                   lay His head, who was spat upon and beaten, and who wore a
                   crown of thorns is now revealed as possessing power and
                   riches and honor. The One who was put down so rudely by man
                   is shown to be the Source of wisdom and blessing. The One who
                   gave Himself so completely is now replete with glory and
                   strength. The picture is one of dramatic contrast. On the one
                   hand, a bleeding Lamb—on the other, the angels of God singing
                   an anthem of worship and praise.

THINK IT THROUGH      When we worship, do we recognize as we should the power,
                   riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing of Christ?

                     James Montgomery, a nineteenth century hymn writer,
                   caught the spirit of the angels' song:

                     "Come, let us sing the song of songs-
                       The angels first began the strain-
                     The homage which to Christ belongs:
                       'Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!'

                     Slain to redeem us by His blood,
                       To cleanse from every sinful stain,
                     And make us kings and priests to God:

          Part 5       How does the heavenly worship reach its climax of praise?
 EVERY CREATURE
   WORSHIPS GOD        "And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth,
                     and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that
                     are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory,
                     and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto
                     the Lamb for ever and ever. And the four beasts said, Amen.
                     And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him
                     that liveth for ever and ever" (Rev. 5:13, 14).

                       This magnificent scene portrays every created being joining
                     in worship and praise to God and to the Lamb.
                        "To what point in the great controversy do the symbolic
                     scenes portrayed in chs. 4 and 5 refer? According to DA 834 the
                     song was sung by angels when Christ was installed at the right
                     hand of God after His ascension. Also, according to AA 601, 602;
                     GC 671, this song will be sung by the saints at the establishment
                     of the new earth and by the redeemed and angels in eternity (8T
                     44; cf. PP 541; GC 545, 678). This varied setting suggests that
                     the vision of chs. 4 and 5 is not to be thought of as representing
                     any one specific occurrence in heaven, but as a timeless, highly
                     symbolic portrayal of the victory of Christ and the resulting
                     vindication of God. When so understood, this vision may be
                     seen as representing the attitude of heaven toward the Son and
                     His work since the cross, an attitude that rises to a crescendo as
                     the great controversy comes to its victorious climax."—SDA

                     sake. With the angels, they cast their crowns at the feet of the
                     Redeemer, exclaiming, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to

                                                                    November 26
         Part 6   "After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
   THE REDEEMED could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
    WORSHIP GOD tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb,
                clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried
                with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth
                upon the throne, and unto the Lamb" (Rev. 7:9, 10).

                      How is Revelation 7:9, 10 related to Revelation 4 and 5?

                      Revelation 7 describes the same God, sitting upon the same
                    throne, the same Lamb, the same angels, the same elders, the
                    same living creatures. The one new element in the picture is the
                    multitude of the redeemed. This passage makes John's picture
                    of worship in heaven relevant to us. We may identify with the
                    heavenly worshipers.

                      What will the great occasion be like?

                      "Nearest the throne are those who were once zealous in the
                    cause of Satan, but who, plucked as brands from the burning,
                    have followed their Saviour with deep, intense devotion. Next
                    are those who perfected Christian characters in the midst of
                    falsehood and infidelity, those who honored the law of God
                    when the Christian world declared it void, and the millions, of all
                    ages, who were martyred for their faith. And beyond is the 'great
                    multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and
                    kindreds, and people, and tongues, . .. before the throne, and
                    before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their
                    hands.' Revelation 7:9. Their warfare is ended, their victory won.
                    They have run the race and reached the prize. The palm branch
                    in their hands is a symbol of their triumph, the white robe an
                    emblem of the spotless righteousness of Christ which now is
                    theirs.
                       "The redeemed raise a song of praise that echoes and
                    reechoes through the vaults of heaven: 'Salvation to our God
                    which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.' Verse 10.
                    And angel and seraph unite their voices in adoration. As the
                    redeemed have beheld the power and malignity of Satan, they
                    have seen, as never before, that no power but that of Christ
                    could have made them conquerors. In all that shining throng
                    there are none to ascribe salvation to themselves, as if they had
                    prevailed by their own power and goodness. Nothing is said of
                    what they have done or suffered; but the burden of every song,
                    the keynote of every anthem, is: Salvation to our God and unto
                    the Lamb."—The Great Controversy, p. 665.

               Part 1 What is the basis of the worship of God?
     THE CRISIS OVER
     WORSHIP OF THE   "And worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the
            CREATOR sea, and the fountains of waters" (Rev. 14:7, last part).

                        "We are nearing the close of this earth's history. Satan is
                     making desperate efforts to make himself god. . . . Under the
                     jurisdiction of the man of sin, men have exalted a false standard
                     in complete opposition to God's enactment. Each Sabbath
                     institution bears the name of its author, an ineffaceable mark
                     showing the authority of each. The first day of the week has not
                     one particle of sanctity. It is the production of the man of sin,
                     who strives in this way to counterwork God's purposes.
                        "God has designated the seventh day as His Sabbath. [Ex.
                     31:13, 17, 16 quoted.]
                        "Thus the distinction is drawn between the loyal and the
                     disloyal. Those who desire to have the seal of God in their
                     foreheads must keep the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.
                     Thus they are distinguished from the disloyal, who have
                     accepted a man-made institution in place of the true
                     Sabbath."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                     vol. 7, pp. 980, 981.

THINK IT THROUGH       What difference does the fact that God is the Creator make
                     to us?

                       Only a small minority in the scientific and religious world
                     today accept the Biblical teaching of God as Creator. In place of
                     this basic Christian belief, the theory of evolution has been
                     generally accepted.
                       "The theory of evolution, whether it be of the gradual or the
                     emergent type, leads to two conclusions which are contrary to
                     the teaching of the Scriptures. The first conclusion is that man
                     is evolving in the direction of perfection and needs no
                     regeneration. The second conclusion is that Jesus, far from
                     being perfect God and Man, was simply a steppingstone in the
                     human advance, splendid for His own day but long since
                     out-distanced, out-moded, and thus no 'Saviour' at all. Here the
                     Christian disagrees sharply."—Lindsell and Woodbridge, A
                     Handbook of Christian Truth, (Westwood, N.J.: Fleming H.
                     Revell, 1953), p. 83. Used by permission.
                       "God created man in His own image. Here is no mystery.
                     There is no ground for the supposition that man was evolved by
                     slow degrees of development from the lower forms of animal or
                     vegetable life. Such teaching lowers the great work of the
                     Creator to the level of man's narrow, earthly conceptions."—

             Part 2   What is the basic meaning and purpose of the third angel's
    THE CRISIS OVER message?
THE DAY OF WORSHIP
                      "And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud
                    voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and re-
                    ceive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
                    drink of the wine of the wrath of God" (Rev. 14:9,10, first part).

                        "The truths of the third angel's message have been presented
                      by some as a dry theory; but in this message is to be presented
                      Christ the Living One. He is to be revealed as the first and the
                      last, as the I AM, the Root and the Offspring of David, and the
                      bright and morning Star. Through this messagethe character of
                      God in Christ is to be manifested to the world."—Testimonies,
                      vol. 6, p. 20.

                        Which facet of the three angel's messages has particularly
                      to do with worship? (verses 7, 9).

                        "In Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the
                      Creator; and the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the
                      result of the threefold message, are keeping the command-
                      ments of God. One of these commandments points directly to
                      God as the Creator. The fourth precept declares: 'The seventh
                      day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: .. . for in six days the
                      Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
                      rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
                      day, and hallowed it.' . . .
                        "In contrast to those who keep the commandments of God
                      and have the faith of Jesus, the third angel points to another
                      class, against whose errors a solemn and fearful warning is
                      uttered: `If any man worship the beast and his image, and re-
                      ceive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
                      drink of the wine of the wrath of God.' Revelation 14:9, 10. A
                      correct interpretation of the symbols employed is necessary to
                      an understanding of this message."—The Great Controversy,
                      pp. 437, 438.
                        The chapter in The Great Controversy develops the meaning
                      of these symbols, and then summarizes as follows:
                         "The keeping of God's law, on the one hand, and its violation,
                      on the other, will make the distinction between the worshipers
                      of God and the worshipers of the beast" (pp. 445,446). The most
                      pronounced issue is to be the day of worship.


   THINK IT THROUGH      Do we realize how important the Sabbath is in the great
                       controversy between Christ and Satan? Are we prepared to
                       "preach the Sabbath more fully" so that it may accomplish its
                       purpose in preparing a people for the coming of Jesus?

           Part 3  "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
   WORSHIP IN THE the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
    SETTING OF THE earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
EVERLASTING GOSPEL people" (Rev. 14:6).

                       What is the "everlasting gospel"?

                        "The message proclaimed by the angel flying in the midst of
                     heaven is the everlasting gospel, the same gospel that was
                     declared in Eden when God said to the serpent, 'I will put enmity
                     between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
                     seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel'
                     (Gen. 3:15). Here was the first promise of a Saviour who would
                     stand on the field of battle to contest the power of Satan and
                     prevail against him. Christ came to our world to represent the
                     character of God as it is represented in His holy law; for His law
                     is a transcript of His character. Christ was both the law and the
                     gospel. The angel that proclaims the everlasting gospel proc-
                     laims the law of God; for the gospel of salvation brings men to
                     obedience of the law, whereby their characters are formed after
                     the divine similitude."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 106.
                        "In the prophecy [Rev. 14:6, 7] this warning of the judgment,
                     with its connected messages, is followed by the coming of the
                     Son of man in the clouds of heaven. The proclamation of the
                     judgment is an announcement of Christ's second coming as at
                     hand. And this proclamation is called the everlasting gospel.
                     Thus the preaching of Christ's second coming, the announce-
                     ment of its nearness, is shown to be an essential part of the
                     gospel message."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 227, 228.


  THINK IT THROUGH     How does true worship differ from the false?

                       The angel flying in the midst of heaven with the everlasting
                     gospel to preach to all men calls upon mankind to "fear God,"
                     to "give glory to him," and to "worship him." Apparently this
                     gospel of a saving Christ, soon to come again, is intended to
                     inspire the spirit of worship. We stress the fact that worship is a
                     redeemed man's response to his Redeemer. This should be
                     true, whether a man brings the gospel to another man, or
                     whether an angel brings the gospel to every nation, kindred,
                     tongue, and people.
                       When there is a real acceptance of the saving gospel of the
                     crucified, risen, and soon-coming Christ, there will be a revival
                     of true worship. It cannot be otherwise. To know Him is to love
                     Him and worship Him.

and Worship LESSON 10                                              December 1
           Part 4   "Here is the patience of the saints (Rev. 14:12).
   WORSHIP UNDER    "And he [the lamblike beast] had power to give life unto the
   • DIFFICULTIES image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both
                  speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the
                  image of the beast should be killed" (Rev. 13:15).

                      What does history tell us about the high cost of the worship
                    of God?

                      Daniel was thrown into a den of lions because he refused to
                    obey a decree to worship the king (Dan. 6:4-28).
                      The three Hebrews were thrown into a furnace because they
                    refused to worship a golden image (Dan. 3:1-30).
                      The apostles of Christ were imprisoned, beaten, stoned,
                    crucified because they insisted on worshiping Jesus as Lord.
                      Many early Christianswere punished because they refused to
                    worship the emperor.
                      During the Middle Ages many dissenters were persecuted
                    who could not accept the worship practice of the dominant
                    church.
                      When Protestants became dominant, they sometimes perse-
                    cuted dissenters from their faith. For example, the Puritans
                    exiled Roger Williams of Rhode Island, although they had pre-
                    viously fled from England due to persecution.
                      Christians in recent decades have suffered for their faith and
                    have been denied freedom of worship by some authoritarian
                    regimes.
                      It is not hard to imagine that in the final crisis, with fear and
                    disaster everywhere, those who insist on worshiping their
                    Creator on the Sabbath day will suffer for their faith.

 THINK IT THROUGH    What attitude should Christians take when their desire to
                    worship God brings them into conflict with their enemies?

                      "Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
                    heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
                    you" (Matt. 5:12).
                      "Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
                    but let him glorify God on this behalf."
                      "Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
                    commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a
                    faithful Creator" (1 Peter 4:16, 19).
                      "The prospect of being brought into personal danger and
                    distress, need not cause despondency, but should. quicken the
                    vigor and hopes of God's people; for the time of their peril is the
                    season for God to grant them clearer manifestations of His
                    power.",--Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 370.

              Part 5    When the three angels have completed the proclamation of
       THE ULTIMATE their messages, what great event will take place?
     ACT OF WORSHIP
                        "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud
                      one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
                      crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came
                      out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the
                      cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for
                      thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And he that sat
                     •on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was
                      reaped" (Rev. 14:14-16).


                         What will be the saints' response to the second coming of
                       Jesus? Isa. 25:9.


                          "To His faithful followers Christ has been a daily companion
                       and familiar friend. They have lived in close contact, in constant
                       communion with God. Upon them the glory of the Lord has
                       risen. In them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
                       the face of Jesus Christ has been reflected. Now they rejoice in
                       the undimmed rays of the brightness and glory of the King in His
                       majesty. They are prepared for the communion of heaven; for
                       they have heaven in their hearts.
                          "With uplifted heads, with the bright beams of the Sun of
                       Righteousness shining upon them, with rejoicing that their re-
                       demption draweth nigh, they go forth to meet the Bride-
                       groom, saying, to, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and
                       He will save us.' Isa. 25:9."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 421.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Will the second coming of Christ be a moment of worship?
                         Such an occasion of worship the world has never known! At
                       last the redeemed see their Lord, the object of their faith, their
                       love, their worship. Their adoration knows no bounds. Words
                       cannot express their praise. All their hopes are now fulfilled and
                       their joy is now overflowing.
                         "Throughout the unnumbered host of the redeemed every
                       glance is fixed upon Him, every eye beholds His glory.... Then,
                       as the commanding angels strike the note, every hand sweeps
                       the harp strings with skillful touch, awaking sweet music in rich,
                       melodious strains. Rapture unutterable thrills every heart, and
                       each voice is raised in grateful praise: 'Unto Him that loved us,
                       and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made
                       us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory
                       and dominion for ever and ever.' Revelation 1:5, 6."—The Great

and Worship LESSON 10                                                   December 3
        Part 6   "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will
     WORSHIP IN make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your
      ETERNITY seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that
               from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to
               another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the
               Lord" (Isa. 66:22, 23).

                       The Sabbath worship ties the ages together.
                       "The Sabbath was not for Israel merely, but for the world. It
                     had been made known to man in Eden, and, like the other
                     precepts of the Decalogue, it is of imperishable obligation. Of
                     that law of which the fourth commandment forms a part, Christ
                     declares, 'Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in
                     nowise pass from the law.' So long as the heavens and the earth
                   'endure, the Sabbath will continue as a sign of the Creator's
                     power. And when Eden shall bloom on earth again, God's holy
                     rest day will be honored by all beneath the sun. 'From one
                     Sabbath to another' the inhabitants of the glorified new earth
                     shall go up 'to worship before Me, saith the Lord.' "—The Desire
                    of Ages, p. 283.
                       "When there shall be a 'restitution of all things, which God
                     hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the
                     world began' (Acts 3:21), the creation Sabbath, the day on
                     which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph's tomb, will still be a day of rest
                     and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in praise, as 'from one
                     Sabbath to another' (Isa. 66:23) the nations of the saved shall
                     bow in joyful worship to God and the Lamb."—The Desire of
                     Ages, pp. 769, 770.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the relationship between worship here and worship
                    hereafter?


                       "God teaches that we should assemble in His house to
                    cultivate the attributes of perfect love. This will fit the dwellers of
                    earth for the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for all
                    who love Him. There they will assemble in the sanctuary from
                    Sabbath to Sabbath, from one new moon to another, to unite in
                    loftiest strains of song, in praise and thanksgiving to Him who
                    sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and
                    ever."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 368.
                       "As Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption and
                    the amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan,
                    the hearts of the ransomed thrill with more fervent devotion,
                    and with more rapturous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and
                    ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
                    of voices unite to swell the mighty chorus of praise."—The

    "Be still, and know that I am God"     5. Worship Must Be Accompanied
(Ps. 46:10).                                  by Faith and Dedication
    Visitors at Westminster Abbey are         (Acts 24:14)
handed an information sheet on which       6. Worship Must Be Joyful (Ps.
is printed the following request:             122:1)
               WE ASK YOU
            as you walk around
to remember that you are on holy
                  ground
        to behave with reverence
              to speak quietly
and do not forget to look up very often
if you wish to see the glory of this
                  Church.
    Would this not be a good request to
make of every churchgoer whenever
he enters the church?
    "When every other voice is hushed,
 and in quietness we wait before Him,
the silence of the soul makes more
distinct the voice of God."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 363.
    "If when the people come into the
house of worship, they have genuine
 reverence for the Lord and bear in
mind that they are in His presence,
there will be a sweet eloquence in
silence."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 492.
    In our lesson this week we shall
study the characteristics of true
worship. We shall note that worship is
 not dependent on impressive
architecture, stained glass windows,
and hushed regard for what the
building stands for. True worship may
be assisted by beauty of structure and
an atmosphere of reverence, but more
importantly, it lies deep down in the
heart and life of the worshiper. It must
be accompanied by intelligent
understanding, faith and dedication,
and a life of joy and happiness because
the heart has been cleansed of all sin.
 It expresses itself in order, in
reverence, and above all, in a sense of
the presence of God.

Characteristics of True Worship                 LESSON 11                  ❑ Sunday
                                                                          December 5
             Part 1      "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Cor. 14:40).
      WORSHIP MUST
        BE ORDERLY       What is the background of this verse?

                        Problems had arisen in the worship services at Corinth. The
                      Lord's Supper had degenerated into a meal where the rich
                      enjoyed their delicacies and the poor had little or nothing. The
                      worshipers had failed to discern the meaning of the service.
                      Speaking in tongues had introduced confusion into the
                      services. "For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace"
                      (verse 33). It was to this situation that Paul addressed himself
                      when he said, "Let all things be done decently and in order."

                        Why should the principle of order apply to the services of
                      the church today?

                         "It is God's will that all parts of His service shall be managed in
                      an orderly, becoming manner, which will impress those
                      strangers who may attend, as well as the regular attendants,
                      with the elevated, ennobling character of the truth and its power
                      to cleanse the heart."—Evangelism, p. 207.
                        "There should be rules in regard to the time, the place, and
                      the manner of worshiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that
                      pertains to the worship of God, should be treated with
                      carelessness or indifference."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 491.
                        "God gave rules of order, perfect and exact, to His ancient
                      people. Has His character changed? Is He not the great and
                      mighty God who rules in the heaven of heavens? Would it not be
                      well for us often to read the directions given by God Himself to
                      the Hebrews, that we who have the light of the glorious truth
                      shining upon us may imitate their reverence for the house of
                      God?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 496.

THINK IT THROUGH        How would you implement the following suggestions?

                         1. Enter the sanctuary quietly and on time.
                         2. Sit quietly and thoughtfully while waiting for the service
                            to begin.
                         3. Participate in the hymns and responsive readings.
                         4. Concentrate on the prayers.
                         5. Contribute to the offering as a part of worship.
                         6. Listen appreciatively to the musical numbers.
                         7. Give undivided attention to the sermon.
                         8. Avoid causing any distractions or disturbances that
                            would break the reverent silence of the hour of worship.
                         9. Remember that God's presence is not on an altar or in a
                            pulpit, but in the heart of each worshiper.
                        10. Leave the sanctuary quietly and reverently.

Characteristics of True Worship            LESSON 11                 ❑ Monday
                                                                    December 6
         Part 2   "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an
   WORSHIP MUST offering, and come before him: worship the Lord in the beauty
    BE BEAUTIFUL of holiness" (1 Chron. 16:29).

                     What do we understand by the phrase, "the beauty of
                   holiness"?

                      "True worship is a matter of beauty as well as holiness. Clad in
                   their holy vestments, the ancient priests engaged in a service of
                   worship that was both beautiful and impressive. But beauty of
                   form and symbol is not an adequate demonstration of the
                   'beauty of holiness.' The term may be regarded as including a
                   spirit of quiet reverence, inward devotion and outward piety,
                   devout earnestness and joyous gratitude. Neither heaven nor
                   earth can know any greater beauty than the beauty of true
                   holiness."—SDA Bible Commentary, on 1 Chron. 16:29.
                      "Worship may be tested by the principle of beauty.... There is
                   an inseparable relation between beauty and goodness, ugliness
                   and evil. All that men call beautiful may not be good and all that
                   men adjudge ugly may not be bad, but whatever is holy is
                   beautiful and whatever is evil is ugly. Ugliness in worship is
                   intuitively repulsive. No matter what its outward appearance, a
                   house of worship may be made beautiful by the tender, loving
                   care of its members. No matter how barren of aesthetic
                   adornment, a service of worship may be made beautiful by the
                   reverent spirit of leaders and congregation. Walls may be kept
                   painted, windows may be cleaned, the interior of the sanctuary
                   may be immaculate, the hymnbooks may be neatly bound, the
                   atmosphere may be that of reverence. To the worshipers the
                   place and the service of worship should always be
                   beautiful."—Gaines Dobbins, The Church at Worship, p. 135.

THINK IT THROUGH     About 1869 Ellen White wrote a letter to a man who was
                   complaining about the expense of building a church. She said:
                   "Many act as though the Creator of the heavens and the earth,
                   He who has made everything that is lovely and beautiful in our
                   world, would be pleased to see a house erected for Him without
                   order or beauty. . . .
                     "Many of our people have become narrowed in their views.
                   Order, neatness, taste, and convenience are termed pride and
                   love of the world. A mistake is made here. Vain pride, which is
                   exhibited in gaudy trappings and needless ornaments, is not
                   pleasing to God. But He who created for man a beautiful world,
                   and planted a lovely garden in Eden with every variety of trees
                   for fruit and beauty, and who decorated the earth with most
                   lovely flowers of every description and hue, has given tangible
                   proofs that He is pleased with the beautiful."—Testimonies, vol.

      WORSHIP MUST am the Lord" (Lev. 19:30).
       BE REVERENT
                      What lessons can we learn from the reverence that God
                    expected for the ancient sanctuary?

                         "From the sacredness which was attached to the earthly
                      sanctuary, Christians may learn how they should regard the
                      place where the Lord meets with His people. There has been a
                      great change, nqt for the better, but for the worse, in the habits
                      and customs of the people in reference to religious worship.
                     The precious, the sacred, things which connect us with God are
                      fast losing their hold upon our minds and hearts, and are being
                     brought down to the level of common things. The reverence
                     which the people had anciently for the sanctuary where they
                     met with God in sacred service has largely passed away.
                     Nevertheless, God Himself gave the order of His service,
                     exalting it high above everything of a temporal nature."—
                     Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 491.
                        The preceding quotation is the second paragraph of a
                     ten-page chapter entitled "Behaviour in the House of God." The
                     chapter will be quoted often in this lesson, and should be read
                     by each student and teacher. It reflects the condition of public
                     worship in the Seventh-day Adventist Church nearly a century
                     ago.
                        It is significant that this was the very time in the history of the
                     church when Ellen White was expressing great concern about
                     neglect of the doctrine of salvation by faith. Can it be that there
                     is a relationship between proper worship and a proper
                     experience of salvation? The thesis of these lessons is that
                     worship is a redeemed man's response to his Redeemer. If a
                     professed Christian lacks the vital experience of a relationship
                     with Christ, the lack will reveal itself in his neglect of worship.

THINK IT THROUGH       What effect does this lack of reverence have on our
                     families?

                       "Brethren, will you not devote a little thought to this subject
                     and notice how you conduct yourselves in the house of God and
                     what efforts you are making by precept and example to cultivate
                     reverence in your children?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 494.
                       "The education and training of the youth should be of a
                     character that would exalt sacred things and encourage pure
                     devotion for God in His house. Many who profess to be children
                     of the heavenly King have no true appreciation of the
                     sacredness of eternal things. Nearly all need to be taught how to
                     conduct themselves in the house of God. Parents should not
                     only teach, but command, their children to enter the sanctuary
                     with sobriety and reverence."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 496.

                                                                 December 8
         Part 4    "For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
  WORSHIP MUST altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom
  BE INTELLIGENT therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you" (Acts
                17:23).


                    What part does the mind play in the worship of God?


                      "God wants attentive hearers. It was while men slept that
                  Satan sowed his tares."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 493.
                      "If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting
                  begins, let them maintain a true spirit of devotion by silent
                  meditation, keeping the heart uplifted to God in prayer that the
                  service may be of special benefit to their own hearts and lead to
                  the conviction and conversion of other souls."—Testimonies,
                  vol. 5, p. 492.
                      "Because of the irreverence in attitude, dress, and deport-
                  ment, and lack of a worshipful frame of mind, God has often
                  turned His face away from those assembled for His worship....
                      "God is to be the subject of thought, the object of worship;
                  and anything that attracts the mind from the solemn, sacred
                  service is an offense to Him."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 499.
                      "When the word is spoken, you should remember, brethren,
                  that you are listening to the voice of God through his delegated
                  servant. Listen attentively. Sleep not for one instant, because by
                  this slumber you may lose the very words that you need
                  most—the very words which, if heeded, would save your feet
                  from straying into wrong paths. Satan and his angels are busy
                  creating a paralyzed condition of the senses so that cautions,
                  warnings, and reproofs shall not be heard; or if heard, that they
                  shall not take effect upon the heart and reform the life.
                  Sometimes a little child may so attract the attention of the
                  hearers that the precious seed does not fall into good ground
                  and bring forth fruit. Sometimes young men and women have so
                  little reverence for the house and worship of God that they keep
                  up a continual communication with each other during the
                  sermon. Could these see the angels of God looking upon them
                  and marking their doings, they would be filled with shame, with
                  abhorrence of themselves."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 493.
                      These quotations tell us that true worship involves thought,
                  careful attention, alertness, freedom from distractions. Worship
                  is not merely a feeling accompanying a liturgy. The hymns of
                  worship should have meaning; prayers should not be mere
                  repetitions of clichés; and sermons should present to listeners
                  the claims and assurances of Christ.

               Part 5     "But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
       WORSHIP MUST     call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all
     BE ACCOMPANIED     things which are written in the law and in the prophets" (Acts
        BY FAITH AND    24:14).
          DEDICATION
                          What gives meaning to ceremonies of worship?

                           "The magnificence of the first temple, and the imposing rites
                        of its religious services, had been a source of pride to Israel
                        before their captivity; but their worship had oftti mes been lack-
                        ing in those qualities which God regards as most essential. The
                        glory of the first temple, the splendor of its service, could not
                        recommend them to God; for that which is alone of value in His
                        sight, they did not offer. They did not bring Him the sacrifice of a
                        humble and contrite spirit.
                           "It is when the vital principles 6f the kingdom of God are lost
                        sight of, that ceremonies become multitudinous and extrava-
                        gant. It is when the character building is neglected, when the
                        adornment of the soul is lacking, when the simplicity of godli-
                        ness is despised, that pride and love of display demand magnif-
                        icent church edifices, splendid adornings, and imposing
                        ceremonials. But in all this God is not honored. He values His
                        church, not for its external advantages, but for the sincere piety
                        which distinguishes it from the world. He estimates it according
                        to the growth of its members in the knowledge of Christ, accord-
                        ing to their progress in spiritual experience. He looks for the
                        principles of love and goodness. Not all the beauty of art can
                        bear comparison with the beauty of temper and character to be
                        revealed in those who are Christ's representatives.
                           "A congregation may be the poorest in the land. It may be
                        without the attractions of any outward show; but if the members
                        possess the principles of the character of Christ, angels will
                        unite with them in their worship. The praise and thanksgiving
                        from grateful hearts will ascend to God as a sweet oblation."—
                        Prophets and Kings, pp. 565, 566.

 THINK IT THROUGH         How may we be certain that our worship is genuine?

                            Every Christian should ask himself certain questions as he
                        enters the house of God: (1) Do I have faith? Do I really believe in
                        God as my Father and Christ as my Saviour? (2) Am I humble
                        and repentant? Do I come in the spirit of a suppliant, or am I
                        filled with pride? (3) Am I allowing God to transform and perfect
                        my character? (4) Do I enter God's house with a deep desire to
                        know Him better and to love Him more? (5) Do I bring to the
                        worship of God a love for my fellow worshipers and for the world
                        like that of the love of Christ? (6) Am I eager to worship God?
                            Worship and Christian experience cannot be separated.

                                                                    December 10
           Part 6     What spirit should characterize meetings for worship?
    WORSHIP MUST
       BE JOYFUL      "I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house
                    of the Lord" (Ps. 122:1).

                      Many people equate religious services with boredom. They
                    fail to sense how exhilarating it can be to withdraw from the
                    ordinary pursuits of life to give honor to God. Several years ago,
                    the writer with his wife and daughter stood on a road corner in
                    England and watched a carriage pass by in which were riding
                    Queen Elizabeth, her husband, her sister, her mother, and other
                    notables. The crowd gathered on that road corner were not
                    bored. There was rapt attention as the carriage passed by. Some
                    were so excited that they forgot to snap their cameras! Folk
                    went home that day with a feeling of satisfaction that they had,
                    for a brief moment, been in the presence of royalty. How much
                    greater is the privilege of enjoying the fellowship of the God of
                    heaven. Worship is a happy experience.
                      "Our God is a tender, merciful Father. His service should not
                    be looked upon as a heart-saddening, distressing exercise. It
                    should be a pleasure to worship the Lord and to take part in His
                    work. God would not have His children, for whom so great
                    salvation has been provided, act as if He were a hard, exacting
                    taskmaster. He is their best friend; and when they worship Him,
                    He expects to be with them, to bless and comfort them, filling
                    their hearts with joy and love. The Lord desires His children to
                    take comfort in His service and to find more pleasure than

   It is this humiliation of the Son of
God that the Christian celebrates
when he participates in the
foot-washing service. He is not
revealing how humble he himself is,
but rather he is remembering how
humble Christ was. This meaning of
the ordinance of feet washing is made
clear in the following quotations:
   "This ordinance is Christ's
appointed preparation for the
sacramental service. While pride,
variance, and strife for supremacy are
cherished, the heart cannot enter into
fellowship with Christ. We are not
prepared to receive the communion of
His body and His blood. Therefore it
was that Jesus appointed the memorial
of His humiliation to be first
observed."—The Desire of Ages, p.

                    them with the towel wherewith he was girded" (John 13:3-5).

                        What unfortunate spirit existed among the disciples?

                        "There was 'strife among them, which of them should be
                      accounted the greatest.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 643.
                        It is a sad fact that human beings obtain much of their
                      satisfaction out of rising above their fellowmen. Man is
                      laboriously and agonizingly trying to climb a ladder. The
                      competition is keen and the resentment runs deep. The
                      disciples of Jesus were caught up in this struggle.

                        What particular situation increased the dissension?

                        "At a feast it was customary for a servant to wash the feet of
                     the guests, and on this occasion preparation had been made for
                     the service. The pitcher, the basin, and the towel were there, in
                     readiness for the feet washing; but no servant was present, and
                     it was the disciples' part to perform it. But each of the disciples,
                     yielding to wounded pride, determined not to act the part of a
                     servant. All manifested a stoical unconcern, seeming uncon-
                     scious that there was anything for them to do. By their silence
                     they refused to humble themselves."—The Desire of Ages, p.
                     644.

                        What was Jesus' problem under these circumstances?

                        "How was Christ to bring these poor souls where Satan would
                     not gain over them a decided victory? How could He show that a
                     mere profession of discipleship did not make them disciples, or
                     insure them a place in His kingdom? How could He show that it
                     is loving service, true humility, which constitutes real great-
                     ness? How was He to kindle love in their hearts, and enable
                     them to comprehend what He longed to tell them?"—The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 644.

                       How did Jesus solve this problem?

                       He washed their feet. He revealed His humility in contrast to
                     their pride.

                     characterized the disciples?

                                                                   December 13
          Part 2     "Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him,
  PETER OBJECTS    Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto
                   him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know
                   hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my
                   feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part
                   with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only,
                   but also my hands and my head" (John 13:6-9).

                     What was Peter thinking as Jesus knelt to wash his feet?

                      It was Peter, months before, who had made the great
                   confession, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God"
                   (Matt. 16:16). The very fact that Peter recognized so clearly who
                   it was that was going to wash his feet added to his
                   astonishment. "Peter could not bear to see his Lord, whom he
                   believed to be the Son of God, acting the part of a
                   servant."—The Desire of Ages, p. 645. When Jesus insisted on
                   washing his feet, "Peter surrendered his pride and self-will"
                   (page 646). Something happened to Peter when he recognized
                   the humility of his Lord. Along with his brethren, Peter was now
                   able to "concede to another the highest place" (page 646).

THINK IT THROUGH     What lesson does Peter's experience hold for us?

                     "Like Peter and his brethren, we too have been washed in the
                   blood of Christ, yet often through contact with evil the heart's
                   purity is soiled. We must come to Christ for His cleansing grace.
                   Peter shrank from bringing his soiled feet in contact with the
                   hands of his Lord and Master; but how often we bring our sinful,
                   polluted hearts in contact with the.heart of Christ! How grievous
                   to Him is our evil temper, our vanity and pride! Yet all our
                   infirmity and defilement we must bring to Him. He alone can
                   wash us clean. We are not prepared for communion with Him
                   unless cleansed by His efficacy."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 646,
                   649.
                     Peter's experience teaches us an additional truth from the
                   foot-washing service. Jesus was not only establishing a
                   memorial of His humiliation; He was also giving a symbol of
                   cleansing. Jesus saw His self-giving life, not as an end in itself,
                   but as a means of salvation. So when Jesus washed the feet of
                   His disciples, He was not only saying, I am willing to accept any
                   humiliation, even the cross; but he was also saying, I want to
                   wash you from your pride. These two meanings supplement
                   each other. Jesus gave Himself for us. This is the gospel.
                      Peter never forgot this lesson. Years later he wrote, "For
                   Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
                   that he might bring us to God" (1 Peter 3:18).
                      May we never forget this lesson!

               Part 3     "Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I
               JESUS    then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
     ESTABLISHES THE    ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an
        MEMORIAL OF     example, that ye should do as I have done to you" (John
     HIS HUMILIATION    13:13-15).

                         Was Jesus merely advising humble Christian service, or
                        was He establishing an ordinance?

                         . "Now, having washed the disciples' feet, He said, 'I have given
                        you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.' In
                        these words Christ was not merely enjoining the practice of
                        hospitality. More was meant than the washing of the feet of
                        guests to remove the dust of travel. Christ was here instituting a
                        religious service. By the act of our Lord this humiliating cere-
                        mony was made a consecrated ordinance. It was to be observed
                        by the disciples, that they might ever keep in mind His lessons of
                        humility and service."—The Desire of Ages, p. 650.

                         If Jesus intended this service to be observed, why was it not
                        mentioned by the other Gospel writers?

                          The probability is that this service was practiced and taken for
                        granted by the early believers. By the time John wrote his Gos-
                        pel (AD 90-100) it may be that the service was being neglected.
                        John's emphasis may have been an effort to reemphasize the
                        importance of the foot-washing service.

                          Is it reasonable to believe that Christ intended that the
                        foot-washing service should continue to be observed?

                           One author has observed that "the two realities of the Upper
                        Room—on the one hand, bread and wine; on the other hand, a
                        basin and towel—are equally sacramental and are a part of the
                        one great Reality."—Leonard Griffith, The Eternal Legacy From
                        an Upper Room, p. 44.
                           Another author says, "The feetwashing introduces an aspect
                        of the Lord's Supper which surely must have been present in the
                        mind of Christ but to which the bread and cup alone simply do
                        not give adequate expression. With the bread and cup alone,
                        the service concludes with the participants as mere recipients
                        of the body of Jesus. The feetwashing makes them pledged and
                        active members of the body of Christ."—Vernard Eller, In Place

  THAN HIS LORD"
                   What practical application does this passage have to
                  Christian living?

                      Just as Jesus emptied Himself for the sake of man, so His
                    followers should be willing to be servants one to another. The
                    Christian should participate in the foot-washing service and
                    also be ready and willing to render loving service to Christians
                    and non-Christians. "As we have therefore opportunity, let us
                    do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the
                    household of faith" (Gal. 6:10). The Christian has something to
                    give beyond that of the public or private welfare agency. In
                    addition to food, clothing, medical care, child care, employ-
                    ment, the Christian has a peculiar brand of love and concern
                    that gives meaning and hope to those in need.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it hard to assume the role of a servant?

                       "I was pointed to the Majesty of heaven. When He whom
                    angels worshiped, He who was rich in honor, splendor, and
                    glory, came to the earth, and found Himself in fashion as a man,
                    He did not plead His refined nature as an excuse to hold Himself
                    aloof from the unfortunate. In His work He was found among the
                    afflicted, the poor, distressed; and needy ones. Christ was the
                    embodiment of refinement and purity; His was an exalted life
                    and character; yet in His labor He was found not among men of
                    highsounding titles, not among the most honorable of this
                    world, but with the despised and needy. 'I came,' says the divine
                    Teacher, 'to save that which was lost.' Yes; the Majesty of
                    heaven was ever found working to help those who most needed
                    help. May the example of Christ put to shame the excuses of that
                    class who are so attracted to their poor selves that they consider
                    it beneath their refined taste and their high calling to help the
                    most helpless. Such have taken a position higher than their
                    Lord, and in the end will be astonished to find themselves lower
                    than the lowest of that class whom their refined, sensitive
                    natures were shocked to mingle with and work for. True, it may
                    not always be agreeable to unite with the Master and become
                    co-workers with Him in helping the very class who stand most in
                    need of help; but this is the work which Christ humbled Himself
                    to do. Is the servant greater than his Lord? He has given the
                    example, and enjoins upon us to copy it. It may be disagreeable,
                    yet duty demands that just such a work be performed."—

                     "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John
                  13:17).

                      What does this tell us in respect to duty in the Christian life?

                       Many have been led to believe that recognizing Christian duty
                    is equivalent to salvation by works. Duty is not an ugly word.
                    "Love has a twin sister, which is duty."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p.
                    195. In fact, there is a close relationship between faith and duty.
                    "No one can believe with the heart unto righteousness, and
                    obtain justification by faith, while continuing the practice of
                    those things which the Word of God forbids, or while neglecting
                    any known duty."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 396.
                       "But while God can be just, and yet justify the sinner through
                    the merits of Christ, no man can cover his soul with the
                    garments of Christ's righteousness while practicing known
                    sins, or neglecting known duties. God requires the entire
                    surrender of the heart, before justification can take place; and
                    in order for man to retain justification, there must be continual
                    obedience, through active, living faith that works by love and
                    purifies the soul."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 366.

THINK IT THROUGH      What does this text teach us regarding Christian worship?

                       The expression, "these things," in John 13:17 seems to imply
                   two things. Jesus is telling His followers that they will find
                   happiness in fulfilling the role of a servant. He is making a
                   tremendous appeal for Christian service to all people of all
                   classes. But He is doing more than this. He is establishing an
                   ordinance to become a part of Christian worship—an ordinance
                   that will commemorate the humiliation of Jesus and that will
                   teach the spirit of humility that makes Christian service
                   possible. Every time we celebrate the foot-washing service we
                   think (1) of Jesus who "humbled himself, and became obedient
                   unto death" and (2) of our fellowmen who demand our love and
                   service in the spirit of Jesus. Thus this act of worship at a
                   Communion service becomes a perpetual reminder of our Lord
                   and of our duty. And happiness is a by-product of loving our
                   Lord and our fellowmen.
                       "The test of sincerity is not in words, but in deeds. Christ does
                   not say to any man, What say ye more than others? but, 'What do
                   ye more than others?' Matt. 5:47. Full of meaning are His words,
                   'If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.' John 13:17.
                   Words are of no value unless they are accompanied with
                   appropriate deeds."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 272.

The Memorial of His Humiliation             LESSON 12                CI Friday
                                                                  December 17
           Part 6    What is the sequel to the "emptying" described in
HUMILIATION GIVES   Philippians 2:5-8?
          WAY TO
    GLORIFICATION     "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him
                    a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus
                    every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things on
                    earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue
                    should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
                    the Father" (Phil. 2:9-11).

                      Verses 5 to 8 of Philippians 2 describe Jesus giving up the
                    form of God and becoming a slave in the likeness of men. This
                    self-givingwent so far as to include the most humiliating form of
                    execution—the cross. But after reaching the bottom, so far as
                    humiliation is concerned, Jesus is honored by His Father; He
                    receives a "new name," symbolic of His new status in God's
                    universe, and He receives the worship of the universe.

                      What added meaning does the glorification of Jesus give to
                    the feet washing ordinance?

                      "Christ would have His disciples understand that although He
                    had washed their feet, this did not in the least detract from His
                    dignity. 'Ye call Me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I
                    am.' And being so infinitely superior, He imparted grace and
                    significance to the service. No one was so exalted as Christ, and
                    yet He stooped to the humblest duty. That His people might not
                    be misled by the selfishness which dwells in the natural heart,
                    and which strengthens by self-serving, Christ Himself set the
                    example of humility. He would not leave this great subject in
                    man's charge. Of so much consequence did He regard it, that
                    He Himself, One equal with God, acted as servant to His
                    disciples. While they were contending for the highest place, Hel
                    to whom every knee shall bow, He whom the angels of glory
                    count it honor to serve, bowed down to wash the feet of those
                    who called Him Lord."—The Desire of Ages, p. 649.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What do the humiliation and glorification of Jesus tell us
                    about Christian worship?

                      Christ's humiliation gives us an added incentive to worship.
                    He bowed low to cleanse us from sin; in grateful response, we
                    bow low in reverent worship. And the glory of worship is
                    compounded by the fact that we are recognizing the King of
                    kings and Lord of lords. He came a long way to redeem us, and
                    He returned a long way to reclaim His place by the side of His
                    Father. Should not we be willing to give of our very best both in
                    our personal and corporate worship of Him?

      GREAT SERMON
                       "Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh
                     to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall
                     never thirst."
                       "Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
                     Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
                     ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
                     blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
                     For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed"
                     (John 6:35, 53-55).

                        Under what circumstances did Jesus preach this sermon?

                        It was Passover time, just a year before the Lord's Supper was
                      instituted. The Galilean ministry of Jesus was drawing to its
                      close, and thousands were following Him..lt was in this setting
                      that Jesus fed the 5000 with the loaves and fishes.
                        This miracle inflamed the enthusiasm of the crowds, and they
                      determined to crown Him king. Here, they thought, was the
                      leader who could assure their national independence and
                      security. After dismissing the crowd, Jesus went into a
                      mountain by Himself. The disciples had headed their boat
                      across the sea toward Capernaum. A storm came up, and Jesus
                      appeared, walking on the sea. Soon they were safely on the
                      shore.
                        The next day, many of the people who had been fed
                      miraculously the day before found Jesus. They were still filled
                      with enthusiasm to follow Him as their new leader. But Jesus
                      cooled their zeal with His sermon on the bread of life.

                        What was the message of Jesus' sermon?

                        Jesus insisted that they believe on Him as the "bread of life."
                      He talked to them about His Father, about faith, about
                      everlasting life. He presented Himself as a personal Saviour, not
                      as a national leader. This was not what the people wanted.
                      "From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
                      more with him" (verse 66). Surely the disciples must have
                      thought back to this event when Jesus talked about His body
                      and His blood at the Lord's Supper.

THINK IT THROUGH        How do we eat the flesh and drink the blood of Jesus?

                        "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive
                      Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins,
                      and that we are complete in Him.... What food is to the body,

                 desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say
                 unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in
                 the kingdom of God" (Luke 22:14-16).


                      What was the relationship between the ancient Passover
                    Feast and the new Lord's Supper?


                       The Passover Feast was a memorial of Israel's deliverance
                    from Egypt by Moses. The Lord's Supper was to be a memorial
                    of man's deliverance from sin by Christ.
                       "Christ was standing at the point of transition between two
                    economies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb
                    of God, was about to present Himself as a sin offering, that He
                    would thus bring to an end the system of types and ceremonies
                    that for four thousand years had pointed to His death. As He ate
                    the Passover with His disciples, He instituted in its place the
                    service that was to be the memorial of His great sacrifice. The
                    national festival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The
                    service which Christ established was to be observed by His
                    followers in all lands and through all ages.
                       "The Passover was ordained as a commemoration of the
                    deliverance of Israel from Egyptian bondage. God had directed
                    that, year by year, as the children should ask the meaning of this
                    ordinance, the history should be repeated. Thus the wonderful
                    deliverance was to be kept fresh in the minds of all. The
                    ordinance of the Lord's Supper was given to commemorate the
                    great deliverance wrought out as the result of the death of
                    Christ. Till He shall come the second time in power and glory,
                    this ordinance is to be celebrated. It is the means by which His
                    great work for us is to be kept fresh in our minds."—The Desire
                    of Ages, pp. 652, 653.


THINK IT THROUGH       What practical application does the apostle Paul make of
                     the fact that Christ is "our passover"? (See 1 Cor. 5:7.)


                       Paul is referring to a case of immorality in the Corinthian
                     Church. He recalls that the Israelites were required on the day
                     before the Passover to light a candle and search the house for
                     leaven, a symbol of sin. Every bit of leaven must be cleaned out.
                     So, Paul says, before Christ's sacrifice can be effective for us,
                     sin must be cleaned out of our lives and out of the church. This,
                     of course, is possible only through the power of God.

            Part 3    "Now when the even was come, he sat down with the
       THE TRAITOR twelve. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that
      AT THE FEAST one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding
                   sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord,
                   is it I? And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand
                   with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The Son of man
                   goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom
                   the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he
                   had not been born. Then Judas, which betrayed him,
                   answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast
                   said" (Matt. 26:20-25).

                       What event in the ministry of Jesus was the "turning point"
                     in the experience of Judas?

                         "Christ's discourse in the synagogue concerning the bread of
                     life was the turning point in the history of Judas. He heard the
                     words, 'Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His
                     blood, ye have no life in you.' John 6:53. He saw that Christ was
                     offering spiritual rather than worldly good. He regarded himself
                     as farsighted, and thought he could see that Jesus would have
                     no honor, and that He could bestow no high position upon His
                     followers. He determined not to unite himself so closely to
                     Christ but that he could draw away. He would watch. And he did
                     watch."—The Desire of Ages, p. 719.
                        It is of more than passing interest that Judas started on the
                     downward road when Jesus proclaimed Himself as the Bread of
                     Life. Later he walked out into the darkness to betray his Lord
                     when Jesus instituted the symbols of His broken body and
                     spilled blood. Judas revolted against a crucified Lord, a spiritual
                     Saviour. He wanted a worldly leader, a political deliverer.

                       What was Judas's basic problem?

                        "He loved the Great Teacher, and desired to be with Him. He
                     felt a desire to be changed in character and life, and he hoped to
                     experience this through connecting himself with Jesus.... But
                     Judas did not come to the point of surrendering himself fully to
                     Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 717.
                       He never loved his Lord with all his heart.

                       How well had Judas concealed his treachery? John 13:29.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can a modern disciple fall into the same type of apos-
                     tasy that destroyed Judas?

The Lord's Supper        LESSON 13                                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   December 22
           Part 4   "And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
       THE GIVING eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remem-
       OF THANKS brance of me" (1 Cor. 11:24).

                      Which other descriptions of the Lord's Supper make
                    specific mention of giving of thanks? Luke 22:19; Matt. 26:27;
                    Mark 14:23.
                      The giving of thanks at the Lord's Supper was more than a
                    mere form. We recall previous occasions when Jesus gave
                    thanks before partaking of food—the feeding of the 5000 (John
                    6:11) and the feeding of the 4000 (Matt. 15:36; Mark 8:6). We do
                    not know what the Master said on these occasions, but we can
                    assume that He thanked His Father for the blessings of life. In
                    the case of the Last Supper, the thanksgiving prayer no doubt
                    included thankfulness for deliverance in harmony with the
                    theme of the Passover. But the deliverance about to be wrought
                    by Jesus was far greater than the deliverance from Egypt. The
                    thanksgiving phase became so prominent that the Lord's Sup-
                    per became known as the "Eucharist," a term meaning giving of
                    thanks.

                       What can we learn from Jesus' thanksgiving prayer at the
                    Lord's Supper?
                      "But the Communion service was not to be a season of sor-
                    rowing. This was not its purpose. As the Lord's disciples gather
                    about His table, they are not to remember and lament their
                    shortcomings. They are not to dwell upon their past religious
                    experience, whether that experience has been elevating or de-
                    pressing. They are not to recall the differences between them
                    and their brethren. The preparatory service has embraced all
                    this. The self-examination, the confession of sin, the reconcil-
                    ing of differences, has all been done. Now they are come to meet
                    with Christ. They are not to stand in the shadow of the cross, but
                    in its saving light."—The Desire of Ages, p. 659.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What do we mean/When we speak of "celebrating" the
                    ordinances?
                       This term reminds us of the joy, freedom, and victory that
                    come through Christ whose sacrifice we memorialize. We must
                    not succumb to the popular trend toward considering "celebra-
                    tion" an end in itself. When we assemble for the Lord's Supper,
                    we do not celebrate "life" or "humanness" or some other vague
                    object. We celebrate the life-giving sacrifice of our Lord on
                    Calvary, and we thank God for His provision for our salvation.
                    This means that the Communion service should be a joyous
                    occasion, because it commemorates our Lord's victory over
                    Satan. As His followers, we share His victory.

      THE BREAD AND and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;
           THE CUP this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and
                   gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of
                   the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of
                    sins" (Matt. 26:26-28).

                         What was the meaning of Jesus' words and actions?

                          "In partaking with His disciples of the bread and wine, Christ
                       pledged Himself to them as their Redeemer. He committed to
                       them the new covenant, by which all who receive Him become
                       children of God, and joint heirs with Christ. By this covenant
                       every blessing that heaven could bestow for this life and the life
                       to come was theirs. This covenant deed was to be ratified with
                       the blood of Christ. And the administration of the Sacrament
                       was to keep before the disciples the infinite sacrifice made for
                       each of them individually as a part of the great whole of fallen
                       humanity."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 656, 659.

                         What was meant by "my blood of the new testament
                       [covenant]"?

                         "Jesus spoke of His blood being the blood of the covenant.
                      What did He mean by that? A covenant is a relationship between
                      two people; when two people enter into a covenant, they enter
                      into a relationship with each other. But the covenant of which
                      Jesus spoke was not a covenant between man and man; it was a
                      covenant between God and man. That is to say, it was a new
                      relationship between God and man. What Jesus was saying at
                      the Last Supper was this: 'Because of my life, and above all
                      because of my death, a new relationship has become possible
                      between you and God.' It is as if He said, 'You have seen me; and
                      in me you have seen God; I have told you, I have shown you, how
                      much God loves you; He loves you even enough to suffer this
                      that I am going through; that is what God is like.' Because of
                      what Jesus did for men, the way for men is open to all the
                      loveliness of this new relationship with God."—From The Gos-
                      pel of Matthew, translated and interpreted by William Barclay,
                      vol. 2, pp. 377, 378.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What does the Lord's Supper have to do with Christian
                       worship?

                        The Lord's Supper is the high point of Christian worship. It
                      should be "earth's nearest approach to heaven." The Sabbath
                      on which the Lord's Supper is celebrated should be a special
                      Sabbath with a special meaning for every worshiper.

          Part 6  How did the apostle Paul relate the Lord's Supper and the
    TILL HE COME second coming of Jesus?

                      "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
                    shew the Lord's death till he come" (1 Cor. 11:26).

                      In what words did Jesus refer to His coming when He
                    instituted the Lord's Supper?

                      "But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
                    the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you In my
                    Father's kingdom" (Matt. 26:29).

                      What is the relation between our Lord's death and His
                    second coming?

                      "It is only becau.se of His death that we can look with joy to His.
                    second coming."—The Desire of Ages, p. 660.
                       "At the first feast He attended with His disciples [the wedding
                    feast at Cana], Jesus gave them the cup that symbolized His
                    work for their salvation. At the last supper He gave it again, in
                    the institution of that sacred rite by which His death was to be
                    shown forth 'till He come.' 1 Cor. 11:26. And the sorrow of the
                    disciples at parting from their Lord was comforted with the
                    promise of reunion, as He said , 'I will not drink henceforth of this
                    fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My
                    Father's kingdom.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 149.
                       "The salvation of men depends upon a continual application
                    to their hearts of the cleansing blood of Christ. Therefore, the
                    Lord's Supper was not to be observed only occasionally or
                    yearly, but more frequently than the annual passover."—Ellen
                    G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1090.

 THINK IT THROUGH     When Christians worship at a Communion service, they are
                    looking two directions—backward to the cross and forward to
                    the crown. It was at the same occasion where the Lord's Supper
                    was instituted that Jesus said, "I will come again, and receive
                    you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also" (John
                    14:3). The Communion service should be especially meaningful
                    to Adventists, because it anticipates the great Communion, "the
                    marriage supper of the Lamb" (Rev. 19:9). All except one of
                    those who were in the upper room will be there. Those with
                    whom we have taken Communion on earth will, hopefully, be
                    there. And, best of all, Jesus will be there. Then we will
                    understand fully the meaning of His broken body and the shed
                    blood.
