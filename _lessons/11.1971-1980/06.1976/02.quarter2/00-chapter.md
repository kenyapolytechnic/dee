OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT



        Dear Members of the Sabbath School:

             Afro-Mideast is the focus of world attention and apprehension.   It is whei
        once the garden of Eden blossomed in sinless perfection; where the children of
        Israel slaved under tyrannical Pharaohs; where the Queen of Sheba founded a
        dynasty that has lasted until recently when a new generation took over, and whei
        David Livingstone blazed a trail of modern missions through the Eastern part of
        the then dark continent of Africa.   It is where you will invest your generous
        13th Sabbath Offering this quarter.   We invite you to lighten our burdens and
        to share with us our hopes and aspirations.
             Three worthy projects, out of many, have been carefully selected for their
        crying needs and deserving merits:
             1. Bugema Adventist College in lovely Uganda has been approved by the
        General Conference Department of Education for upgrading to senior status,
        provided we can meet certain requirements, one of which is a library that
        will meet the requirements of a senior college.   Bugema will be the only
        educational institution of this kind in the African section of our Division.
        The time is long overdue when we should provide a full college education to
        our wonderful youth of these great territories: they crave it; the work demanc
        it; God expects it.    Therefore we appeal to you to assist us.
             2. The Middle East College in Lebanon suffers from acute growing pains.
        Over 30 nationalities are represented in the student body.   This institution,
        which is affiliated with Loma Linda University, is in desperate need of dormitor
        facilities for the young men.   The existing dormitory is so built that we can
        add another storey to it provided you will help us with the necessary funds. To
        invest in our youth is to invest in eternal values.   In anticipation that you
        will give heed to our plea we express our gratitude for your help with this
        much-needed addition.
             3. The Africa Herald Publishing House in Kenya is without doubt one of
        the busiest publishing houses anywhere in the world.   Even so it cannot cope
        with the ever-increasing demand of our zealous literature evangelists, of which
        we have about 800 alone in two of our East African unions.   We can sell every-
        thing we can import and produce.   Realizing the important role our literature
        will play in the finishing of the work we feel confident that you, our warmheart
        Sabbath School members, will help Manager D C Swan acquire the equipment so
        desparately needed to increase production; a 2-colour offset press.
             Our hearts go out to you in Christian love and with sincere gratitude for
        all you have done in the past, and for all you are going to do for us this quart
        May God richly bless you!
                                                                   y yours,

I pledge myself to the prayerful study of part of

                                                                 (Signed)
                        GOD IS NOT SILENT
                                 Introduction

    Never have so many known so much and yet understood so little; never has
man been so able, and yet so helpless; so sure, and yet so afraid—as today.
Why is this the case? Does not science answer all his questions? Apparently not.
What about religion? Has not God spoken and answered some of man's basic
questions? Unfortunately there are many, even among the best educated, who
question that God has spoken or that He even exists. Why is He silent, they
ask, if He really exists and is the kind of person Christians claim Him to be?
    The lessons this quarter are a declaration of faith, both that God is, and that
He has not been, is not, and will not be silent. He has spoken and continues to
speak today so that man need not be ignorant on basic issues. Furthermore,
God is not discovered by human search, nor is He created by human need;
God is. He is all that the needs and possibilities of the human race would require
Him to be—the infinite, eternal, personal, loving, speaking God. How urgently
men and women need to hear and to heed the counsel: "the Lord is in his holy
temple: let all the earth keep silence before him" (Flab. 2:20).
    In this quarter's lessons, may every student learn more perfectly the blessing
to be found in keeping silent before the Lord, and listening to the redeeming
yet authoritative words of the God who speaks. In this way faith may be con-
firmed, salvation assured, and calm restored to troubled and fearful hearts.
    On one occasion, after Jesus had used the parable of the unjust judge to
illustrate God's willingness to speak and to act in behalf of men in answer to
their prayers, He asked the plaintive question: "Nevertheless when the Son of
man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" (Luke 18:8). Will faith in the
gospel, the saving trust in the God who speaks to man, be much in evidence
when Christ returns? The answer to that question would seem to depend directly
upon the willingness of each person to believe that there is a God who commu-
nicates with man, who has something meaningful to say to him.
    This quarter, then, is an opportunity for each Sabbath School member to
renew his or her own skills in listening to the voice of God, permitting Him to
show and to tell, through each one, that God is there and that He is not silent.*

                                                                        March 28

        Part 1        What does the psalmist say is a characteristic of God's
          HIS      greatness?
 UNSEARCHABLE         "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his
    GREATNESS      greatness is unsearchable" (Ps. 145:3).

                      The unsearchableness of God should be a constant reminder
                   to man that his comprehension of God will always be limited,
                   and that his attempts to prove the existence of God are likewise
                   beyond his capacity. (See Job 11:7, 8.)

                      What request made by Philip reflects man's desire to see
                   and know the unsearchable God? How did Jesus respond to
                   Philip's request? John 14:8, 9.

                      If man could accept the words of Jesus to Philip at their face
                   value, the great theological quest of the ages would be re-
                   solved. This statement to Philip is perhaps the most profound
                   revelation from God to man about God that was ever made.
                   Surely Christ's life on earth was the crowning revelation to
                   man of that which was and is most essential for him to know
                   about God. It may be said that while Jesus veiled the divine
                   glory from man, He revealed the divine character perfectly. It
                   may also be said that the divine character is the key to the
                   divine glory. (Compare Ps. 145:5-9.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it a good thing that God's greatness is unsearch-
                   able? What does this indicate regarding the limitations of
                   human reason?

                       "It is the duty and privilege of all to use reason as far as
                   man's finite faculties can go; but there is a boundary where
                   man's resources must cease. There are many things that can
                   never be reasoned out by the strongest intellect or discerned
                   by the most penetrating mind. Philosophy cannot determine the
                   ways and works of God; the human mind cannot measure in-
                   finity.
                       "Jehovah is the fountain of all wisdom, of all truth, of all
                   knowledge. There are high attainments that man can reach in
                   this life through the wisdom that God imparts; but there is an
                   infinity beyond that will be the study and the joy of the saints
                   throughout eternal ages. Man can now only linger upon the
                   borders of that vast expanse, and let imagination take its flight.
                   Finite man cannot fathom the deep things of God; for spiritual
                   things are spiritually discerned. The human mind cannot com-
                   prehend the wisdom and power of God."—Ellen G. White Com-

        Part 2        Although God is so high and exalted, with whom does He

 IMMEASURABLE
                       "For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eter-
CONDESCENSION
                   nity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place,
                   with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive
                   the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the con-
                   trite ones" (Isa. 57:15).

                      God's condescension is immeasurable when we consider
                   the position He occupies as the Creator and Ruler of the uni-
                   verse and contrast it with the humblest of men and their posi-
                   tion as sinners. God says He is right there where the need is
                   known and felt to bring about a change and a revival. It does
                   not matter how low man has fallen; there is no depth that God's
                   love cannot reach. (See Ps. 136:23-26.)

                      How did Mary express her concept of God's great con-
                   descension? Luke 1:46-48.

                      Mary is known now as a woman of great consecration and
                   devotion. But when the angel Gabriel came to her, she was a
                   humble maiden unknown except within her immediate circle.
                      We can recognize something of God's great condescension
                   when we remember that Jesus, who was the express image of
                   the Father, was meek and lowly (Matt. 11:29). Furthermore,
                   Jesus, in order to bring us full and free salvation, "emptied
                   himself" (Phil. 2:7, RSV), or "made himself of no reputation"
                   (Phil. 2:7, KJV).

                       In view of God's great condescension, how should you and
                   I relate to one another and to God? Rom. 12:16.

THINK IT THROUGH      To what extent can God be described? How far does the
                   Bible reflect the truth of God?

                      "The Lord speaks to human beings in imperfect speech, in
                   order that the degenerate senses, the dull, earthly perception,
                   of earthly beings may comprehend His words. Thus is shown
                   God's condescension. He meets fallen human beings where
                   they are. The Bible, perfect as it is in its simplicity, does not
                   answer to the great ideas of God; for infinite ideas cannot be
                   perfectly embodied in finite vehicles of thought."—Selected

          Part 3      When God revealed Himself to Moses, what attributes did
            HIS    He emphasize?
     INIMITABLE
                      "And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The
     ATTRIBUTES
                   Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
                   abundant in goodness and truth" (Ex. 34:6).

                       The relationship between God and His servant Moses was
                   so close that Moses asked the Lord to show him His glory.
                   While the Lord indicated to Moses that he could not look upon
                   His face, he was given all the revelation that a human being
                   could endure. The Lord passed before Moses and proclaimed
                   Himself "merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant
                   in goodness and truth."

                      How has God demonstrated His mercy, kindness, and faith-
                   fulness? Hosea 11:9; 2:19, 20; Eph. 2:4-8. Can you give an
                   example from your own experience?

                      It is significant to note that God is eternal (Gen. 21:33),
                   immutable (Num. 23:19), omniscient (Ps. 139:4), omnipresent
                   (Ps. 139:7-12), etc. Yet it is not these characteristics that He
                   presents to man, although they are characteristics that properly
                   belong to God. The emphasis is on a personal relationship to
                   man in which God is gracious, loving, faithful, etc. God's power
                   and deity are the guarantee that He can do what He sets out
                   to do. His love and faithfulness are the assurance that we
                   need not despair in our sins.

THINK IT THROUGH      In view of God's goodness to us, how should we respond
                   to Him? Am I a good reflector of God's image in relation to
                   my fellowmen?

                       "Even though a church may be composed of poor and un-
                   educated and unknown persons, yet if they are believing, pray-
                   ing members, their influence will be felt for time and for eter-
                   nity. If they go forth in simple faith, replying upon the promises
                   of the Word of God, they may accomplish great good. If they
                   let their light shine, Christ is glorified in them, and the interests
                   of His kingdom are advanced. If they have a sense of their in-
                   dividual accountability to God, they will seek for opportunities
                   to work, and will shine as lights in the world. They will be
                   examples of sincerity and of zealous fervor in working out God's
                   plan for the salvation of souls."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p.

         Part 4      How does the one true God compare with all other gods?
   HIS SUPREME     What makes Him what He is?
TRANSCENDENCE
                     "Sing unto the Lord, all the earth; shew forth from day to
                   day his salvation. Declare his glory among the heathen; his
                   marvellous works among all nations. For great is the Lord,
                   and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all
                   gods. For all the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord
                   made the heavens" (1 Chron. 16:23-27).


                      Since God is the creator of heaven and earth, we must al-
                   ways approach Him with reverence and awe. In fact we should
                   humbly bow before Him and worship Him. This is what Moses
                   did. (See Ex. 34:8.) Others who were similarly affected were
                   Daniel (Dan. 10:1-9) and John the revelator (Rev. 22:8, 9).

                       What was the response of the prophet Isaiah to the reve-
                   lation of the glory of God in the temple? Isa. 6:1-5.


                      It is interesting to note that Isaiah immediately became con-
                   scious of his sin when he was in the presence of the holy God.
                   Those who receive the clearest and fullest revelation of the
                   character and glory of God are the most conscious of the great
                   gulf between God and man, conscious of the degree to which
                   the character and nature of God transcends the character and
                   nature of man.
                      It is important to note that there is a modern tendency to
                   blur the distinctions between the natural and the supernatural,
                   between man and God, between nature and God, between rea-
                   son and revelation, between nature and grace, and all that dis-
                   tinguishes the life and character of sinful man from the life and
                   character of God. Christians must always keep these distinc-
                   tions sharp. The God who reveals Himself is the unsearchable
                   God, the condescending God, the God who is compassionate
                   and gracious, and also the transcendent God.

THINK IT THROUGH      How will the transcendence of God affect the redeemed
                   through eternity?


                      "Since God is infinite, and in Him are all the treasures of
                   wisdom, we may to all eternity be ever searching, ever learning,
                   yet never exhaust the riches of His wisdom, His goodness, or

          Part 5      How does God relate to His people? What does He do for
            HIS    them?
     BENEFICENT        "The Lord said, Here and now I make a covenant. In full
       ACTIVITY    view of all your people I will do such miracles as have never
                   been performed in all the world or in any nation. All the sur-
                   rounding peoples shall see the work of the Lord, for fearful
                   is that which I will do for you" (Ex. 34:10, NEB).
                       The one true God is known by His mighty acts and His
                   messages of truth, righteousness, and love. In fact, His mes-
                   sages are the unfolding of the meaning of His acts.
                      Among God's mighty and beneficent acts are the covenants
                   He has made with men. First God gave man dominion over all
                   the earth (Gen. 1:28). When man sinned God gave the assur-
                   ance that there would be enmity between Satan and the seed
                   of the woman and that the seed of the woman would triumph
                   (Gen. 3:15). After the Flood God promised seedtime and har-
                   vest and regular cycles of nature (Gen. 8:22). Abraham received
                   a covenant that was repeated to his descendants (Gen. 12:1-4).
                   At Sinai God made a covenant with His people, a covenant
                   which they broke. Then through Jeremiah God promised an-
                   other covenant, a new and better one (Jer. 31:31-34). Thus God
                   has always been engaged in providing for man and helping him
                   out of his difficulties.
                      What do you think is the most significant activity of God
                   on behalf of man? What kind of activity should you and I
                   be engaged in?
                       "God calls upon us to awake, for the end is near. Every
                   passing hour is one of activity in the heavenly courts to make
                   ready a people upon the earth to act a part in the great scenes
                   that are soon to open upon us. . . . The words we utter today
                   in the ears of the people, the works we are doing, the spirit of
                   the message we are bearing, will be a savor of life unto life or
                   of death unto death."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 716.

THINK IT THROUGH     How far is God in control of events taking place in the
                   world today? What evidence do you see of God's activity?

                      In the kingdom "there will be open to the student, history
                   of infinite scope and of wealth inexpressible. Here, from the
                   vantage ground of God's word, the student is afforded a view
                   of the vast field of history and may gain some knowledge of
                   the principles that govern the course of human events. But
                   his vision is still clouded, and his knowledge incomplete. Not
                   until he stands in the light of eternity will he see all things

         Part 6       If we really know God and Jesus Christ, what is a natural
           HIS     consequence?
   LIFE-GIVING
                      "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the
        POWER
                   only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John
                   17:3).

                      It cannot be purely theoretical knowledge which Jesus in-
                   cluded in this precious promise. Such a conclusion could be
                   drawn from the experience of Judas Iscariot who had the same
                   opportunities to know Jesus Christ as did the rest of the apos-
                   tles. But what to them was life eternal was to him death eternal.
                   Therefore it must be a knowing of God that involves a saving
                   relationship to Him and to His Son Jesus Christ whom He has
                   sent. It must involve a relationship of love whereby the love that
                   was in Christ becomes the love that is in the believer, the
                   knower of the one true God.

                       How much does Jesus say we can do for ourselves in the
                   matter of doing good? By contrast, what can our lives produce
                   if we abide in Christ? John 15:5.

                       A process of sanctification and unification takes place in
                   the lives of those who know God and Jesus Christ. And this
                   sanctification and unification is wrapped up with truth. Truth
                   applied to the heart by the Holy Spirit's presence and power
                   is the process or means through which sanctification is to take
                   place and the fruitage of this sanctification will be the unifica-
                   tion of those sanctified. (See John 17:17-21.) How grateful we
                   should be that Jesus' intercessory prayer was not limited to
                   His immediate disciples but included "them also which shall
                   believe on me through their word" (verse 20).

THINK IT THROUGH      How does a knowledge of God effect a change in my life?

                      "In a knowledge of God all true knowledge and real develop-
                   ment have their source. Wherever we turn, in the physical, the
                   mental, or the spiritual realm; in whatever we behold, apart
                   from the blight of sin, this knowledge is revealed. Whatever
                   line of investigation we pursue, with a sincere purpose to ar-
                   rive at truth, we are brought in touch with the unseen, mighty
                   Intelligence that is working in and through all. The mind of
                   man is brought into communion with the mind of God, the finite
                   with the Infinite. The effect of such communion on body and
                   mind and soul is beyond estimate."—Education, p. 14.

     neither was I taught it, but by
    the revelation of Jesus Christ"
               (Gal. 1:12).
                                          Thus without a God who speaks,
                                        man is limited as to what he can
                                        know of the past. He is in the dark
                                        regarding the future and he is con-
                                        fused regarding the meaning of the
                                        present. As a rational being he can-
                                        not live a meaningful life without

                                        him and made it possible for him to
                                        cooperate with his Creator's plans.

   Paul claims that he did not re-      5. The Written Record (Luke 1:3, 4)
ceive his information regarding the     6. God Speaks Today (John 16:13)
gospel by any natural means; he re-
ceived it by revelation. This fact
gives his teaching an authority that
far exceeds the authority of any
merely human source.
   In our lesson this week we look at
the various means that God has used
to reveal Himself to man. One thing
should be made perfectly clear:
man can never know anything about
God unless God is willing to reveal
Himself. This is obviously so from
the very nature of things, because
God antedates everything. How can
anyone know of the process of crea-
tion unless the Creator reveals how
and what He did? Furthermore, we
cannot know anything of the future,
unless the God who is eternal tells
us of His plans and purposes.

        Part 1        "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the
       VISIBLE     world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that
                   are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they
     REFLECTS      are without excuse" (Rom. 1:20).
     INVISIBLE
                      Paul makes it clear that nature reveals God's power and
                   deity. But looking around us we may be convinced that we did
                   not make ourselves, nor did we provide our environment. There
                   must have been a Creator. The psalmist suggests that anyone
                   who thinks otherwise must be a fool. (See Ps. 53:1.)
                      The psalmist is convinced that the heavens declare the glory
                   of God, and though there is no audible speech connected with
                   the communication, the message is clear. (See Psalm 19.)
                      As you look at various aspects of nature, what attributes
                   of God do you find reflected?
                       "Look at the wonderful and beautiful things of nature. Think
                   of their marvelous adaptation to the needs and happiness, not
                   only of man, but of all living creatures. The sunshine and the
                   rain, that gladden and refresh the earth, the hills and seas and
                   plains, all speak to us of the Creator's love."—Steps to Christ,
                   p. 9.
                       "The fruit is first seen in the bud, enclosing the future pear,
                   peach, or apple, and the Lord develops these in their proper
                   season, because they do not resist His working. They do not
                   oppose the order of His arrangements. His works, as seen in
                   the natural world, are not one half comprehended or appre-
                   ciated. These silent preachers will teach human beings their
                   lessons, if they will only be attentive hearers."—Ellen G. White

THINK IT THROUGH      How do you explain the discordant elements in nature
                   such as earthquakes, famines, etc?
                       "God made man perfectly holy and happy; and the fair earth,
                   as it came from the Creator's hand, bore no blight of decay or
                   shadow of the curse. It is transgression of God's law—the law
                   of love—that has brought woe and death. Yet even amid the
                   suffering that results from sin, God's love is revealed. It is
                   written that God cursed the ground for man's sake. Genesis
                   3:17. The thorn and the thistle—the difficulties and trials that
                   make his life one of toil and care—were appointed for his
                   good as a part of the training needful in God's plan for his
                   uplifting from the ruin and degradation that sin has wrought.
                   The world, though fallen, is not all sorrow and misery. In nature
                   itself are messages of hope and comfort. There are flowers
                   upon the thistles, and the thorns are covered with roses."—

         Part 2        What should the experiences of Israel have taught the
  THE MESSAGE      Israelites regarding God?
    OF HISTORY        "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I
                   bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself"
                   (Ex. 19:4).
                      What God did for Israel between Egypt and Canaan should
                   have been an unforgettable revelation of God's tender, loving
                   care. Truly, she had her troubles and tests, as an eaglet tossed
                   out of his lofty nest when unaware of the potential of his grow-
                   ing wings. With what unbelievable precision the parent pinions
                   swoop beneath the helplessly tumbling fledgling, bearing him
                   up to the security of heights to try again. Again and again this
                   occurs, until the youngster discovers the latent coordination
                   and lift of those magnificent wings.
                      So the Lord bore Israel, as on eagles' wings, watching out
                   for her every need, protecting her from her enemies, yet seek-
                   ing always the development of her potential strength—in Him.
                      "The Lord showed them [the Egyptians] by His servant
                   Moses that the Maker of the heavens and the earth is the living
                   and all-powerful God, above all gods. That His strength was
                   mightier than the strongest—that OMNIPOTENCE could bring
                   forth His people with a high hand and with an out-stretched
                   arm. The signs and miracles performed in the presence of
                   Pharaoh were not given for his benefit alone, but for the ad-
                   vantage of God's people, to give them more clear and exalted
                   views of God, and that all Israel should fear Him, and be will-
                   ing and anxious to leave Egypt, and choose the service of the
                   true and merciful God. Had it not been for these wonderful
                   manifestations, many would have been satisfied to remain in
                   Egypt rather than to journey through the wilderness."—Ellen
                   G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1120.

                      Even in the midst of disappointment, frustration and sor-
                   row, what assurance can the believer in Christ gain? Rom.
                   8:28.
                      "In the annals of human history the growth of nations, the
                   rise and fall of empires, appear as dependent on the will and
                   prowess of man. . . . But in the word of God the curtain is
                   drawn aside, and we behold, behind, above, and through all
                   the play and counterplay of human interests and power and
                   passions, the agencies of the all-merciful One, silently, patiently

           Part 3      What does the writer to the Hebrews declare to be the
     REVELATION     climactic revelation of God?
        IN JESUS
                       "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our
                    fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken
                    to us by a Son" (Heb. 1:1, 2 RSV).

                       Without diminishing in the least the revelation of Himself
                    which God gave in His acts of creation, in His saving acts in
                    history—particularly the history of Israel—it is necessary to
                    say that in Jesus, the Christ, the Sent of God, man has been
                    granted the most complete and wholly adequate revelation of
                    God.

                        What were the main features of Christ's condescension?
                    Phil. 2:5-8.

                        God steps down to meet man. This is an eternal character-
                    istic of God, seen in all His recorded acts before Bethlehem's
                    hills echoed to angels' songs. But then, all heaven was poured
                    out in the One Sent from God, the Babe lying in a manger. The
                    infinite, the transcendent God had veiled Himself in the flesh
                    of man that He might "tabernacle" among us. Such condescen-
                    sion is the supreme revelation of the love of God.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I more fully reflect the condescending spirit of my
                    Lord?

                       "After Christ had condescended to leave His high com-
                    mand, step down from an infinite height and assume humanity,
                    He could have taken upon Him any condition of humanity He
                    might choose. But greatness and rank were nothing to Him, and
                    He selected the lowest and most humble walk of life. The place
                    of His birth was Bethlehem, and on one side His parentage was
                    poor, but God, the owner of the world, was His Father.
                       "No trace of luxury, ease, selfish gratification, or indulgence
                    was brought into His life, which was a continual round of self-
                    denial and self-sacrifice. In accordance with His humble birth,
                    He had apparently no greatness or riches, in order that the
                    humblest believer need not say Christ never knew the stress of
                    pinching poverty. Had He possessed the semblance of outward
                    show, or riches, of grandeur, the poorest class of humanity
                    would have shunned His society; therefore He chose the lowly
                    condition of the far greater number of the people."—Ellen G.

        Part 4        What part may individuals play in the revelation of God
  THE WITNESS      to men?
       OF MEN
                     "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation;
                   which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
                   confirmed unto us by them that heard him" (Heb. 2:3).

                      When a person has experienced a relationship with Christ,
                   he is duty bound to go and tell others. He becomes an important
                   channel of communication whereby God reveals Himself to the
                   world.

                     What do men need in order to be effective witnesses for
                   God? Isa. 43:12; Acts 1:8.

                       Men do not have to be perfect in order to be effective wit-
                   nesses for God. The early disciples certainly had their weak-
                   nesses. Look at Peter who denied his Lord; James and John
                   with their overriding ambition to sit, one on the right hand and
                   the other on the left of Christ in the kingdom; Thomas, the
                   doubter, who would not believe until he had put his hands into
                   Christ's wounds and seen with his own eyes. Yet it was to these
                   men that Jesus entrusted the preaching of the gospel, and it
                   was these men who "turned the world upside down" (Acts 17:6).
                       This is not to condone weaknesses or excuse faults. The
                   fact is that all men have their weaknesses and faults. It is to
                   point out that when men accept God's call, it is God who works
                   in and through them to accomplish His purposes. The least that
                   a person can do is to say, "Come" (Rev. 22:17). If God has
                   been good to us we can always say so. (See Ps. 107:2.) Men
                   in the past have sometimes been reluctant to obey God's call.
                   For example, Moses (Ex. 4:1, 10), Jeremiah (Jer. 1:6). Yet God
                   promised to give the power, and they accomplished great good
                   in witnessing for God.

THINK IT THROUGH     Does my life speak louder than my words? Do I turn people
                   away from the truth by carelessness or fanaticism?

                     "Speak as He [Christ] would speak, act as He would act.
                   Constantly reveal the sweetness of His character. Reveal that
                   wealth of love which underlies all His teachings and all. His
                   dealings with men. The humblest workers, in co-operation with
                   Christ, may touch chords whose vibrations shall ring to the.
                   ends of the earth and make melody throughout eternal ages."

           Part 5      In order to make His revelation available to succeeding
     THE WRITTEN    generations, what did God lead such witnesses as Luke to do?
          RECORD
                        "It seemed good to me also, having had perfect under-
                    standing of all things from the very first, to write unto thee
                    in order, most excellent Theophilus, that thou mightest know
                    the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been in-
                    structed" (Luke 1:3, 4).

                       God made provision for those who were eyewitnesses (or
                    their co-workers, as in the case of Luke) of the ministry of Jesus
                    to make a written record of His life. These records would enable
                    those who had never seen nor heard Him to have the essential
                    knowledge of how and why He came.

                       In Jesus' prayer how are later Christians designated?
                    John 17:20.

                       Even in the recorded prayer of Jesus, we ("those who shall
                    believe on me through their word") are included.
                       When those faithful eyewitnesses closed their eyes in death,
                    they would leave behind the inspired record, a confirming wit-
                    ness, left to us in writing. In questions of doubt, in points at
                    issue, there would be the authoritative testimony to which to
                    refer and to appeal.

THINK IT THROUGH       Even the inspired writer of one of the Gospels, and the
                    historian of "The Acts of the Apostles," had the humility to
                    submit his work "for examination and criticism."

                       "Luke, the writer of the book of Acts, and Theophilus, to
                    whom it is addressed, had been pleasantly associated. From
                    Luke, Theophilus had received much instruction and great light.
                    Luke had been Theophilus' teacher, and he still felt a respon-
                    sibility to direct and instruct him, and to sustain and protect
                    him in his work.
                        "At that time it was customary for a writer to send his man-
                    uscript to someone for examination and criticism. Luke chose
                    Theophilus, as a man in whom he had confidence, to perform
                    this important work. He first directs the attention of Theophilus
                    to the record of Christ's life as given in the book of Luke, which
                    had also been addressed by the same writer to Theophilus....

                    and books."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

        Part 6       Beside the recorded testimony about Jesus, what other
   GOD SPEAKS      means remained for God's revelation of Himself?
        TODAY
                      "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will
                   guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but
                   whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will
                   shew you things to come" (John 16:13).

                      What a comfort to know that the Father and the Son have
                   not abandoned the church. Jesus promised the apostles, "I will
                   not leave you comfortless" (John 14:18). (The Greek word for
                   "comfortless" means "orphans.") Through the ministry of the
                   Holy Spirit the Father and the Son would make their "abode"
                   with the men and women who love Jesus. (See verse 23.)

                       How long will the Holy Spirit maintain His ministry to the
                   followers of the Lord? John 14:16. See also Eph. 4:12, 13.

                      It is vital for us to recognize that the various means which
                   God has chosen to use in• His revelation of Himself are not ac-
                   tually in conflict with each other.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I be sure that I am understanding the Bible
                   aright? How do I relate to scientific facts that seem to contra-
                   dict the Bible?

                       If we find contradictions between two propositions, each
                   coming from an inspired source, there must be something
                   wrong with our understanding of the propositions. We should
                   look for a deeper meaning, an inner harmony. God, who is the
                   Author of science and the. Scriptures cannot contradict Himself.
                       Are we sure that all that poses as science is true science?
                   Are we sure that the interpretation we give to the Scriptures
                   is the right interpretation? There is a "science falsely so called"
                   (1 Tim. 6:20). And there are interpretations that are twisted.
                   (See 2 Peter 3:16.)
                        "Since the book of nature and the book of revelation bear
                   the impress of the same master mind, they cannot but speak
                   in harmony. By different methods, and in different languages,
                   they witness to the same great truths. Science is ever discover-
                   ing new wonders; but she brings from her research nothing that,
                   rightly understood, conflicts with divine revelation. The book
                   of nature and the written word shed light upon each other. They
                    make us acquainted with God by teaching us something of the
                    laws through which He works."—Education, p. 128.

         Part 1       When God had completed His work of creation, how did
     A PERFECT     He describe it?
      CREATION        "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, be-
                   hold, it was very good" (Gen. 1:31).
                       Thus Scripture summarizes and evaluates the work of God's
                   hand during the six days of Creation week leading up to the
                   first Sabbath day—it was very good." (See verses 1-30.)
                       And it could have stayed that way; indeed, it should have.
                   But it did not. Hence all our woe and sorrow. The Bible records
                   four thousand years of strife, bloodshed, disease, and death
                   as a result.
                       What were some of the immediate consequences of the
                   first sin committed by our first parents? Gen. 3:10, 14-24.
                       Note the following consequences:
                       1. Separation from God.
                       2. Estrangement between man and the rest of creation.
                       3. Struggle for survival on the part of all creatures.
                       4. Pain in childbirth and many other aspects of life.
                       5. The domination of man over woman.
                       6. The ground is cursed so that it brings forth weeds and
                   thorns.
                       7. Death and separation from loved ones.
                       The question may be asked: How far are the above conse-
                   quences of sin turned into a blessing by God to correct and
                   to save man? For instance, is it an altogether bad thing that
                   man has to work hard in order to earn a living?
                       A major question would be: Do we get a correct revelation
                   of God when we look into every phase of nature?
                        "Upon all created things is seen the impress of the Deity.
                   Nature testifies of God. The susceptible mind, brought in con-
                   tact with the miracle and mystery of the universe, cannot but
                   recognize the working of infinite power."—Education, p. 99.

                                                                         April 12

         Part 2      How did God relate to a world full of sinners who persisted
        SIN IN    in going their own way?
    THE WORLD        "And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the
                  earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I
                  will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the
                  earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the
                  fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that 1 have made them"
                  (Gen. 6:6, 7).
                     Man's sin results in death to an innocent creation, a creation
                  that was placed under his dominion. No man can sin and not
                  have his sin affect others. All creation is so interrelated that
                  even God is "grieved" at His heart when man persists in sin-
                  ning and bringing destruction to himself and others.
                     A world of sin cannot be a true reflection of God's plans and
                  purposes. Yet what happens to the world because of sin tells
                  us something about God and His character; it tells us that God
                  cannot permit sin and sinners to continue forever. God has
                  made ample provision for man to be saved, but if man refuses
                  to be helped by God, then he must suffer the consequences.
                     How are events in our day comparable to activities in the
                 days before the Flood? How may we expect God to act?
                 Matt. 24:36-39.
                     In Noah's day God destroyed the world by the Flood. He
                 has promised not to do this again. (See Gen. 9:11.) But He will
                 destroy it with fire. (See 2 Peter 3:7.) Furthermore, as Noah was
                 commissioned to warn the antediluvians of coming destruction,
                 so God has a message going to the world today warning of
                 judgment to come.
                     "The inhabitants of the antediluvian world turned from Jeho-
                 vah, refusing to do His holy will. They followed their own
                 unholy imagination and perverted ideas. It was because of their
                 wickedness that they were destroyed; and today the world is
                 following the same way. It presents no flattering signs of millen-
                 nial glory. The transgressors of God's law are filling the earth
                 with wickedness. Their betting, their horse racing, their gam-
                 bling, their dissipation, their lustful practices, their untamable
                  passions, are fast filling the world with violence."—The Desire
                 of Ages, p. 633.
THINK IT THROUGH      How far is it possible to resist the tide of evil? Do you
                  see God's mercy in His delay of execution of judgment?
                      "The rainbow spanning the heavens with its arch of light is
                  a token of 'the everlasting covenant between God and every
                  living creature.' Genesis 9:16. And the rainbow encircling the
                  throne on high is also a token to God's children of His covenant
                  of peace."—Education, p. 115.

          Part 3      Amid the prevailing chaos and catastrophe resulting from
       GOD STILL   the universal Flood, how was the overruling purpose of God
                   declared?
     IN CONTROL
                     "And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of
                  every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
                 offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet savour;
                 and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the
                 ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's
                 heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any
                 more every thing living, as I have done. While the earth
                 remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and
                 summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease" (Gen.
                 8:20-22).
                     The hand that piloted the ark amidst the crushing forces of
                 wind, water, and sweeping debris would not now abandon the
                 earth and man to the whim of that one who was a "murderer
                 from the beginning" (John 8:44).
                     The orderly return of seedtime and harvest, day and night
                 would be seen until this present age shall be no more (Gen.
                 8:22).
                     "Those who have a true knowledge of God will not become
                 so infatuated with the laws of matter or the operations of nature
                 as to overlook, or refuse to acknowledge, the continual working
                 of God in nature. Nature is not God, nor was it ever God. The
                 voice of nature testifies of God, but nature is not God. As His
                 created work, it simply bears a testimony to God's power. Deity
                 is the author of nature. The natural world has, in itself, no
                 power but that which God supplies."—Selected Messages, bk.
                 1, p. 293.
                     "God is constantly employed in upholding and using as His
                 servants the things that He has made. He works through the
                 laws of nature, using them as His instruments. They are not
                 self-acting. Nature in her work testifies of the intelligent pres-
                 ence and active agency of a Being who moves in all things
                 according to His will."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 416.
THINK IT THROUGH     How would you show that even when God permits evil
                 He is still in control of what happens? Does a man always
                 reap what he sows?
                     "The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in
                 a state of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded
                 by ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thou-

         Part 4        Despite the erosion of sin and the catastrophic destruction
                   of the Flood, what did the psalmist declare was the message
   GOD'S GLORY
                   of the "voice" of God in nature?
     DECLARED
                     "The heavens are telling the glory of God;
                         and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
                     Day to day pours forth speech,
                         and night to night declares knowledge.
                     There is no speech, nor are there words;
                         their voice is not heard;
                     yet their voice goes out through all the earth,
                         and their words to the end of the world."
                                                       Ps. 19:1-4, RSV.
                     The sweet shepherd singer of Israel whose mind had been
                   opened to the message of God amid the night hills of Bethlehem
                   was led by the Spirit to record in beauty and in simplicity the
                   way God speaks to man through the work of His fingers. (See
                   Psalm 8.) And this contemplation made him aware of the con-
                   descension of God and the exalted plan of God for men.
                     "Nature testifies that One infinite in power, great in good-
                   ness, mercy, and love, created the earth, and filled it with life
                   and gladness. Even in their blighted state, all things reveal the
                   handiwork of the great Master Artist. Wherever we turn, we may
                   hear the voice of God, and see evidences of His goodness."

                       What is it that helps us appreciate nature and its revela-
                   tion of God?
                      "The poet and the naturalist have many things to say about
                   nature, but it is the Christian who enjoys the beauty of the earth
                   with the highest appreciation, because he recognizes his Fa-
                   ther's handiwork and perceives His love in flower and shrub
                   and tree. No one can fully appreciate the significance of hill
                   and vale, river and sea, who does not look upon them as an
                   expression of God's love to man."—Steps to Christ, p. 87.
THINK IT THROUGH      How does city life take us away from the opportunity of
                   appreciating God's glory as revealed in nature? Of what
                   should the beauties of nature remind us?
                      "As your senses delight in the attractive loveliness of the
                   earth, think of the world that is to come, that shall never know
                   the blight of sin and death; where the face of nature will no
                   more wear the shadow of the curse. Let your imagination pic-
                   ture the home of the saved, and remember that it will be more
                   glorious than your brightest imagination can portray. In the
                   varied gifts of God in nature we see but the faintest gleaming
                   of His glory."—Steps to Christ, pp. 86, 87.

He Speaks Through Nature LESSON 3                                    ❑ Thursday
                                                                        April 15

          Part 5      How has the universe been affected by the presence of sin?
      A SPECIAL
     REVELATION       "We know that the whole creation has been groaning in
                   travail together until now; and not only the creation, but we
        NEEDED
                   ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan in-
                   wardly as we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of
                   our bodies" (Rom. 8:22, 23, RSV).

                       Paul makes it clear that man is not the only one who is in
                   trouble because of sin; the "whole creation" is "groaning" and
                   in pain. Furthermore, just as man is looking forward to a better
                   existence as a result of his redemption, the whole of nature is
                   in some sense aware of deficiencies and is itself looking for-
                   ward to a change.
                       The figure of speech is that of a woman in labor before a
                    child is born. There is the pain and the agony, but also a joyful
                   anticipation of the birth of a child.

                      How only can I interpret the "groanings" of nature?

                       "Today man cannot of himself read aright the teaching of
                   nature. Unless guided by divine wisdom, he exalts nature and
                   the laws of nature above nature's God. This is why mere human
                   ideas in regard to science so often contradict the teaching of
                   God's word. But for those who receive the light of the life of
                   Christ, nature is again illuminated. In the light shining from
                   the cross, we can rightly interpret nature's teaching."—The
                   Ministry of Healing, p. 462.
                      Jesus drew many lessons from nature. His parables were
                   stories of everyday life. But it is only when the Author of nature
                   points out its lessons that we can be certain of our conclusions.
                   A study of nature without the light which the Word of God
                   throws upon it will only lead to false understandings. This ex-
                   plains why there are so many Contradictory philosophies and
                   religions. One can know the truth only through Him who is the
                   Truth. (See John 14:6.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Am I tending to exalt science and human reasoning above
                   their legitimate roles in God's revelation of Himself?

                      "Through man's disobedience a change was wrought in
                   nature itself. Marred by the curse of sin, nature can bear but
                   an imperfect testimony regarding the Creator. It cannot reveal
                   His character in its perfection."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 256.

     HARMONY       to the believing, converted child of God?
     RESTORED         "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, . . . and
                   the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up....

                      "But according to his promise we wait for new heavens
                   and a new earth in which righteousness dwells" (2 Peter
                   3:10, 13, RSV).

                       Glory! Alleluiah! Does not your heart burn within you to con-
                   template that glorious day? All the consequences and all the
                   causes of the consequences are removed, and the original state
                   of God's clear revelation of Himself in nature is fully restored.
                      Man will again be able to read nature as. Adam and Eve did
                   before they sinned. And through the cross of Jesus, His righ-
                   teousness will dwell permanently, and by choice, in every heart.
                   There will be no discordant note to mar the exquisite and in-
                   finite harmonies of heaven and earth. Courage in the Lord,
                   brother, sister, the day of creation's groaning in travail seems
                   long and endless; but when the eternal day comes, this long
                   night will be as the fleeting shadow cast by a wind-driven cloud
                   crossing the face of the sun. (See 2 Peter 3:1-9.)

                      What are the features of the earth made new? Isaiah 65.
                   Of the New Jerusalem? Revelation 21, 22.

                      These visions of harmony in the earth made new cannot but
                   contrast with what we see in the world around us. Therefore
                   the discords and deficiencies that we see today are a means
                   of reminding us that it will not always be so. Our spirits long
                   for change, and we sympathize with Abraham who was never
                   satisfied with what he had in this life but looked for a city that
                   had foundations (Heb. 11:10). We are grateful for the promise
                   of Jesus that He was going to prepare a place for us (John
                   14:3).
                      "The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no
                   more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and
                   gladness beats through the vast creation. From Him who cre-
                   ated all, flow life and light and gladness, throughout the realms
                   of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the greatest
                   world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed
                    beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love.''—The Great

         Part 1       In what role is God first presented to us in the book of
        GOD OF     Genesis?
      CREATION
                      "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth"
                   (Gen. 1:1).

                       In the majestic simplicity of the first words of the written
                   revelation of God, that which distinguished Him from all of
                   nature, from man, was the fact that He was there and that He
                   brought into existence our world, all its environment, and all
                   upon it.
                       A study of the first three chapters of Genesis lays a founda-
                   tion for a knowledge of God. Here are some aspects of the
                   revelation:
                      1. God created by His word. The psalmist was impressed
                   with this aspect of God's power. (See Ps. 33:9.)
                      2. God created in six days and then rested on the seventh.
                   This cycle is the basis of Sabbathkeeping. (See Ex. 20:8-10.)
                      3. All that God created is good, very good. Thus, anything
                   that is evil does not come from God. (See Luke 18:19.)
                      4. Man was created in the image of God. God intended that
                   man should enjoy the grandest of privileges. He is a loving
                   God. (See 1 John 4:8.)
                      5. God communicated with Adam, treating him as a person.
                   God is a personal God. (See Gen. 3:9-11.)
                      6. God had a plan of salvation and sought out man after he
                   had sinned. Thus man had a second chance; he could be re-
                   stored to the image in which he was created. God sees the
                   end from the beginning. (See Rev. 1:8.)
                      7. Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden. God
                   is a just as well as a merciful God. (See Ex. 20:5, 6.)
                      These are but a few aspects of God's revelation of Himself.
                   But they are fundamental to a proper understanding of God.

THINK IT THROUGH     If God is the Creator, Sustainer, and Redeemer of the
                   world, why is it that many have decided to worship other
                   gods? Is it possible that I serve a false god?

                       "Profound theories and speculations may abound, men may
                   try to set science in opposition to revelation, and thus do away
                   with the law of God; but stronger and still stronger will the
                   Holy Spirit bring before them the command: 'Thou shalt worship
                   the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.' Matthew
                   4:10."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 10.

He Speaks by His Acts LESSON 4                                      ❑ Monday
                                                                      April 19

        Part 2        What was the situation that brought about the Flood?
       GOD OF         "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in
    THE FLOOD      the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his
                   heart was only evil continually" (Gen. 6:5).

                       It is possible for us to think of the Flood as an act of an
                   angry God seeking to take revenge upon a race that had not
                   chosen to follow His plan. But if we do so, we misunderstand
                   God. In fact, we misread the Bible account of the Flood and
                   the persons concerned. Here are a few principles that come
                   out of a study of Scripture:
                       1. The antediluvians were determined in following their
                   course of wickedness. Man had not only done much evil, but
                   his thoughts and inclinations were evil continually. He had
                   apparently rejected God completely. In a situation like this
                   there was only one thing to do, destroy sin and the sinner. As
                   a God of moral worth and justice, there was no other course
                   that God could take.
                       2. Yet God was loath to take such a step. He would rather
                   save than condemn. (See John 3:17.) Hence we read that He
                   was grieved at His heart (Gen. 6:6). He wished with all His
                   heart that the situation could be otherwise.
                       3. God was pleased to find at least one person who was
                   righteous. He therefore planned to save him and anyone else
                   who would be saved. God never destroys the righteous with
                   the wicked. Read the experience of Abraham in Genesis
                   18:23-26.
                        4. Noah proved himself a man of faith (Heb. 11:7). He did
                    exactly what God asked him to do, although the building of an
                    ark and the expectation of rain and flood were not reasonable
                    in his day. The very center of salvation is faith and trust in
                    God. God is trustworthy, and we must place implicit confidence
                   in Him at all times.
                        5. God was long-suffering. He stayed judgment on the an-
                    tediluvians until after Noah had built the ark and given them
                    ample opportunity to repent.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is it that makes the world attractive to many people?
                   Is it ignorance of what God is like?

                      "The sins that called for vengeance upon the antediluvian
                   world exist today. The fear of God is banished from the hearts
                   of men, and His law is treated with indifference and contempt.
                   The intense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of
                   the generation now living."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 101.

           Part 3      What was God's attitude toward the Israelites in slavery?
          GOD OF
                        "And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
     THE EXODUS     people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by rea-
                    son of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; and I am
                    come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
                    and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and
                    a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey" (Ex. 3:7, 8).

                        The history of the Exodus as revealed in the Bible is the
                    story of God's concern for His people under oppression in
                    Egypt. God is not pleased when His people suffer hardships.
                    He wants to see them enjoy all the benefits that life can offer.
                    (See Ps. 37:3-6.)
                        God was as much concerned about the Egyptians and their
                    king as He was about His own people. Therefore He proceeded
                    to give all the evidences He could to show that He is the true
                    God, and that the gods they worshiped were no gods. The
                    plagues were not mere nuisances; they were attacks on various
                    objects held in reverence by the Egyptians. (See Ex. 12:12.)
                        The different treatment that the Israelites and the Egyptians
                    received indicates that a man gains or suffers according to the
                    company he keeps. God is no respecter of persons. It is not
                    God who decides a man's destiny; it is the man himself.
                        The Passover experience with the slaying of the lamb and
                    the sprinkling of the blood were all symbolic of God's plan for
                    the salvation of man. All that one had to do was to accept the
                    plan and act accordingly. There is something very simple and
                    utterly reasonable in what God asks a person to do.
                        The miracles connected with the Exodus were all manifesta-
                    tions of the power of God. Who else could do such great
                    things? Who else could be worthy of man's gratitude and wor-
                    ship? What else could God do to bring a knowledge of Himself
                    to the people?
                        With the giving of the Ten Commandments in permanent
                    form, the Exodus leading to Sinai was a beautiful lesson in the
                    divine harmony between the law and the gospel, between grace
                    and obedience.

THINK IT THROUGH       Are my heart and my home covered by the blood of the

                        "By obedience the people [of Israel] were to give evidence
                    of their faith. So all who hope to be saved by the merits of the
                    blood of Christ should realize that they themselves have some-
                    thing to do in securing their salvation."—Patriarchs and Proph-

        Part 4        As an example of God's utter self-abnegation, what step
    GOD OF THE     did He take in fulfillment of prophecy to make Himself one
                   with man?
  INCARNATION
                       "Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which
                   was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a
                   virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and
                   they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted
                   is, God with us" (Matt. 1:22, 23).
                      The incarnation, God becoming flesh, is a mystery that no
                   human mind can fathom. (See 1 Tim. 3:16.) Yet the truth of it
                   cannot be questioned. The events surrounding the incarnation
                   are well known and some of the lessons we can draw from
                   them might be as follows:
                      1. Jesus came to His own, yet His own did not receive Him.
                   (See John 1:11.) To come to His own was the logical and loving
                   thing to do; to be rejected by His own was surely a very dis-
                   appointing experience. Yet Jesus did not give up.
                      2. Jesus was born in very humble circumstances.'He grew
                   up in a town that was not famous for piety. In other words,
                   Jesus did not choose the easy things for Himself. He would
                   gain the victory over Satan under the most adverse conditions.
                      3. The circumstances of His birth lent themselves to scan-
                   dal. He was falsely accused on many occasions. Yet He gave
                   incontrovertible evidence of His divinity. A few believed; many
                   called out, "Crucify him!" Yet He was not discouraged, nor
                   did He turn aside from His goal. What a man! What a God!
THINK IT THROUGH      To what extent does my life reveal God?
                       "It is the work of the Christian in this life to represent Christ
                   to the world, in life and character unfolding the blessed Jesus.
                   If God has given us light, it is that we may reveal it to others.
                   But in comparison with the light we have received, and the
                   opportunities and privileges granted us to reach the hearts of
                   the people, the results of our work thus far have been far too
                   small. God designs that the truth which He has brought to our
                   understanding shall produce more fruit than has yet been
                   revealed. But when our minds are filled with gloom and sad-
                   ness, dwelling upon the darkness and evil around us, how can
                   we represent Christ to the world? How can our testimony have
                   power to win souls? What we need is to know God and the
                   power of His love, as revealed in Christ, by an experimental
                   knowledge....
                       "Through the merits of Christ, through His righteousness,
                   which by faith is imputed unto us, we are to attain to the per-

He Speaks by His Acts LESSON 4                                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                        April 22

           Part 5      What exalted purpose does Jesus have for His church?
          GOD OF        "That through the church the manifold wisdom of God
     THE CHURCH     might now be made known to the principalities and powers
                    in the heavenly places" (Eph. 3:10, RSV).
                        Perhaps the reputation of the Christian church as a whole
                    has never been so low as now. Even children and youth in-
                    creasingly question the reason for the church's existence.
                        But it is actually the purpose of God to continue, through
                    the church, to give to the world the same revelation of Himself
                    which He had given through the incarnate Christ. Thus from
                    Pentecost to the second advent God's greatest interest on
                    earth has moved from a revelation given by His Son to a reve-
                    lation given by the church. (See Rev. 12:4, 13-17.)
                       How does the church fulfill its mission of manifesting to
                    the world the "manifold wisdom of God"?
                        1. The church has evidence that it is God's power within it
                    that causes it to shine. Members seem to be naive; they are
                    not always classified among the wise. Yet the church is blessed.
                    (See Matt. 11:25, 26.)
                        2. The church is where members love one another. (See
                    John 13:35.) This is rather unusual in a worldly society.
                        3. The leaders in the church do not lord it over others, but
                    are happy to serve. (See Matt. 20:26.) In this way they follow
                    the example of their Lord. (See Matt. 20:28.)
                        4. The church members are a holy people, sanctified by the
                    truth that is in them. (See John 17:17; 1 Peter 1:15, 16.)
                        5. The church is always praising God for what God has done
                    for them and is doing in and through them. The members rec-
                    ognize that by themselves they can do nothing. (See 1 Peter
                    2:9.)
                       What other characteristics would you add to the above list
                    to indicate how the church can reveal the true nature of God?
THINK IT THROUGH        If the church is not fulfilling its obligations as it ought,
                    what do you think are the reasons for its failure? What con-
                    tributions are you personally making to help the church?
                        "Just before us is the closing struggle of the great contro-

                    with all deceivableness of unrighteousness,' Satan is to work
                    to misrepresent the character of God, that he may 'seduce, if
                    it were possible, even the elect.' If there was ever a people in
                    need of constantly increasing light from heaven, it is the
                    people that, in this time of peril, God has called to be the

                                                                        April 23

         Part 6       What key phrase in the following text is an assurance that
    GOD OF THE     the kingdom of glory will be a restoration or completion of
                   God's original purpose?
  RESTORATION
                      "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand,
                   Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
                   for you from the foundation of the world" (Matt. 25:34).

                       The revelation of. God which Adam and Eve would have
                   progressively received if they had not sinned will be restored
                   when the kingdom prepared "from the foundation of the world"
                   is finally established.

                     How close will be the restored communication between
                   God and man? Rev. 22:4; 1 John 3:2; Matt. 5:8.

                      The restoration of a face-to-face relationship between man
                   and God reveals a great condescension on the part of God in
                   that He permits those who once rebelled against His govern-
                   ment and His law to be brought back into His very presence.
                   Obviously He could have wiped sinful man out of existence or
                   kept him at a remote distance. This a gracious God has not
                   done.

THINK IT THROUGH      What special honor and privilege is to be bestowed on
                   those who constitute the final and complete demonstration
                   of God's grace on human lives? Rev. 14:1-5.

                      "As the people of God afflict their souls before Him, pleading
                   for purity of heart, the command is given, 'Take away the filthy
                   garments' from them, and the encouraging words are spoken,
                   'Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I
                   will clothe thee with change of raiment.' The spotless robe of
                   Christ's righteousness is placed upon the tried, tempted, yet
                   faithful children of God. The despised remnant are clothed in
                   glorious apparel, nevermore to be defiled by the corruptions of
                   the world. Their names are retained in the Lamb's book of life,
                   enrolled among the faithful of all ages. They have resisted the
                   wiles of the deceiver; they have not been turned from their
                   loyalty by the dragon's roar. Now they are eternally secure
                   from the tempter's devices. Their sins are transferred to the
                   originator of sin. And the remnant are not only pardoned and
                   accepted, but honored. 'A fair miter' is set upon their heads.

                   He did not make use of this factor to draw attention to Him-
 UNPRETENTIOUS     self?
        CHRIST
                      "For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and
                   as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness;
                   and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should
                   desire him" (Isa. 53:2).

                      According to Isaiah the Messiah's appearance was not to be
                   particularly impressive. Jesus did not use any of the means
                   normally used to draw attention to Himself. He did not acquire
                   learning from the schools of His day. He did not wear robes to
                   indicate special piety. But He was a Jew among Jews, in many
                   ways blending in with His society and doing the things that a
                   devout Jew would be expected to do.
                      Yet Jesus stood apart from the people of His day. His under-
                   standing of Scripture, even as a youth, was remarkable. (See
                   Luke 2:46, 47.) When He spoke in public everyone noted the
                   graciousness of His words. (See Luke 4:22.) Children and their
                   mothers were attracted to Him. (See Luke 18:16.) He spent long
                   nights in prayer, traveled incessantly, healed the sick, fed the
                   hungry, spoke comforting words to sinners, and condemned
                   scathingly all hypocrisy.
                      Jesus may not have drawn attention to Himself in outward
                   appearance, but He did draw attention to the truth. Since He
                   was the way, the truth, and the life, it was only in this sense
                   that He stood out among men. Men and women were drawn to
                   Him, not by what He looked like, but by what He was.

                      Why did the Jews not recognize the Messiah in Jesus?
                   John 1:11.

                      "For more than a thousand years the Jewish people had
                   awaited the Saviour's coming. Upon this event they had rested
                   their brightest hopes. In song and prophecy, in temple rite and
                   household prayer, they had enshrined His name. And yet at
                   His coming they knew Him not. The Beloved of heaven was to
                   them 'as a root out of a dry ground;' He had 'no form nor come-
                   liness;' and they saw in Him no beauty that they should desire
                   Him. 'He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.'
                   Isa. 53:2; John 1:11."—The Desire of Ages, p. 27.

        Part 2        What characteristic of Christ is pointed out by Paul as one
          THE      that every Christian should emulate?
CONDESCENDING         "Have this mind among yourselves, which you have in
       CHRIST      Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not
                   count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
                   himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the like-
                   ness of men. And being found in human form he humbled
                   himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a
                   cross" (Phil. 2:5-8, RSV).
                      Human minds may never plumb the depths of the condescen-
                   sion of Christ in becoming the Saviour of men. No human expe-
                   rience begins to be comparable, because no man was first
                   God—as was Jesus the Christ. No other person was ever called
                   upon to endure what the Godhead endured in Christ.
                      It is in utter selflessness that Jesus reveals God. It is this
                   selflessness that comes as a surprise to both men and the devil
                   because both are basically selfish and self-seeking.
                      How did Satan react to the birth of Jesus? Why was the
                   event so great a mystery to him?
                      "At the birth of Jesus, Satan knew that One had come with
                   a divine commission to dispute his dominion. He trembled at
                   the angel's message attesting the authority of the newborn
                   King. Satan well knew the position that Christ had held in
                   heaven as the Beloved of the Father. That the Son of God
                   should come to this earth as a man filled him with amazement
                   and with apprehension. He could not fathom the mystery of
                   this great sacrifice. His selfish soul could not understand such
                   love for the deceived race. The glory and peace of heaven, and
                   the joy of communion with God, were but dimly comprehended
                   by men; but they were well known to Lucifer, the covering
                   cherub. Since he had lost heaven, he was determined to find
                   revenge by causing others to share his fall. This he would do
                   by causing them to undervalue heavenly things, and to set the
                   heart upon things of earth."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 115, 116.
THINK IT THROUGH       Is my life so filled with Christ that those who know me
                   find me a "mystery"? Does Satan so consider me?
                       "The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts
                   through the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He
                   is effecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with all his
                   triumphant boasting, with all his confederacy of evil united
                   against God and the laws of His government, stands viewing
                   them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delusions.

           Part 3      In His infinite wisdom, to whom has God committed the
     THE JUDGING    judgment of man?
          CHRIST       "For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all
                    judgment unto the Son" (John 5:22).
                       "For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ"
                    (Rom. 14:10).
                       How is it that Jesus is qualified to be our judge? Heb.
                    2:10, 14.
                       It was in connection with His claim to do the same work as
                    the Father that Jesus indicated that the work of judgment had
                    been given to Him.
                       Jesus is supremely qualified to be our judge because He was
                    appointed a judge, His perfect life enables Him to apply the
                    law, and His incarnation means that He has taken our place
                    and can understand our infirmities.
                       Since Jesus is the Judge of all, what should our relation
                    be to others? Matt. 7:1.
                       Does this mean that there are no occasions when men may
                    be called upon to judge others? John 7:24; 1 Cor. 6:3.

                       How does Jesus as a judge reveal the Father? John 5:30;
                    2:13-17; Mark 11:15-19.
                       There is something fearsome about a judgment. (See Heb.
                    10:27.) Yet it is the wicked and not the righteous who have
                    reason to be afraid. (See Psalm 1:5.) Both the Father and the
                    Son love the sinner supremely, but They cannot condone sin.
                    When the sinner persists in his sin, he can only look forward
                    to a righteous judge who will give to everyone according to
                    what his deeds merit.
THINK IT THROUGH      In what way is Christ's work in judging men a part of
                    God's supreme revelation of Himself to man?
                       "He [Christ] has given light and life to all, and according to
                    the measure of light given, each is to be judged. And He who
                    has given the light, He who has followed the soul with tenderest
                    entreaty, seeking to win it from sin to holiness, is in one its
                    advocate and judge. From the opening of the great controversy
                    in heaven, Satan has maintained his cause through deception;
                    and Christ has been working to unveil his schemes and to break
                    his power. It is He who has encountered the deceiver, and who
                    through all the ages has been seeking to wrest the captives
                    from his grasp, who will pass judgment upon every soul."—The

        Part 4        When Jesus saw that a man had faith, what else did He
          THE      do besides healing the disease?
    FORGIVING         "And when he saw their faith he said, 'Man, your sins are
       CHRIST      forgiven you' " (Luke 5:20, RSV).
                      There is no way for fallen human beings to grasp the offense
                   which contact with sin and sinners brought to the infinitely
                   pure and holy Son of God. We have already studied into His
                   condescension in becoming man, but have we really thought
                   deeply and appreciatively of His readiness to forgive the sins
                   of men and of women?
                      Note the question in verse 23. Which is easier, to forgive or
                   to heal? Both could be said with equal ease. For the scribes
                   and Pharisees, to really forgive or to heal were equally difficult,
                   for they could do neither. How could it be known that Jesus
                   really could forgive sins? He gave evidence by also healing
                   the poor sufferer whom His accusers not only could not heal,
                   but whom they had "refused . . hope or sympathy," and who
                   they "declared ... was suffering the curse of God for his sins."
                   —The Desire of Ages, p. 268. What was in their power to do
                   they withheld. They viewed the acts of Jesus as blasphemous
                   and devilish because His aims and theirs were opposite.
                      "When God pardons the sinner, remits the punishment he
                   deserves, and treats him as though he had not sinned, He re-
                   ceives him into divine favor, and justifies him through the
                   merits of Christ's righteousness. The sinner can be justified
                   only through faith in the atonement made through God's dear
                   Son, who became a sacrifice for the sins of the guilty world.
                   No one can be justified by any works of his own. He can be
                   delivered from the guilt of sin, from the condemnation of the
                   law, from the penalty of transgression, only by virtue of the
                   suffering, death, and resurrection of Christ. Faith is the only
                   condition upon which justification can be obtained, and faith
                   includes not only belief but trust."—Selected Messages, bk. 1,
                   p. 389.
THINK IT THROUGH      What evaluation do I put on my need of Christ's forgive-
                   ness? Do I need much? or little? How do I compare my need
                   with that of others?
                      "Jesus knows the circumstances of every soul. You may say,
                   I am sinful, very sinful. You may be; but the worse you are, the
                   more you need Jesus. He turns no weeping, contrite one away.
                   He does not tell to any all that He might reveal, but He bids
                   every trembling soul take courage. Freely will He pardon all
                   who come to Him for forgiveness and restoration."—The Desire

         Part 5       What vivid picture is given of Christ in Gethsemane?
           THE        "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and
     SUFFERING     his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down
        CHRIST     upon the ground" (Luke 22:44, RSV).

                      We have spoken of Christ's condescension, of His merciful
                   approach to judgment, of His forgiving love. But there is a
                   supreme moment when Jesus most deeply, most fully, revealed
                   God to man, to all heaven, and to the universe. It was in Geth-
                   semane.
                      We speak and sing of the cross, and we should. But without
                   victory in Gethsemane there could have been no Calvary. It was
                   there "neath the old olive trees" that the cup of suffering and
                   anguish was taken. It was there that Jesus entered upon a
                   new, different, and terrifying experience involving His relation-
                   ship to God as it never had been involved in all eternity.

THINK IT THROUGH      What did my sins really cost the Son of God in Geth-
                   semane?

                       "Christ was now standing in a different attitude from that
                   in which He had ever stood before. His suffering can best be
                   described in the words of the prophet, 'Awake, 0 sword, against
                   My shepherd, and against the man that is My fellow, saith the
                   Lord of hosts.' Zech. 13:7. As the substitute and surety for sin-
                   ful man, Christ was suffering under divine justice. He saw what
                   justice meant. Hitherto He had been as an intercessor for
                   others; now He longed to have an intercessor for Himself.
                       "As Christ felt His unity with the Father broken up, He
                   feared that in His human nature He would be unable to endure
                   the coming conflict with the powers of darkness. In the wilder-
                   ness of temptation the destiny of the human race had been at
                   stake. Christ was then conqueror. Now the tempter had come
                   for the last fearful struggle. For this he had been preparing
                   during the three years of Christ's ministry. Everything was at
                   stake with him. If he failed here, his hope of mastery was lost;
                   the kingdoms of the world would finally become Christ's; he
                   himself would be overthrown and cast out. But if Christ could
                   be overcome, the earth would become Satan's kingdom, and
                   the human race would be forever in his power. With the issues
                   of the conflict before Him, Christ's soul was filled with dread
                   of separation from God. Satan told Him that if He became the

       Part 6         What experience of Jesus led to His sitting on the throne

                   he is to be with Christ in His kingdom?
  CONQUERING
      CHRIST          "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
                   throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my
                   Father in his throne" (Rev. 3:21).

                      When on the cross Jesus cried in clarion tones, "It is fin-
                   ished," He was conqueror. Having defeated the combined
                   efforts of man and devil to break up His unity of will with His
                   Father, He bowed His head and died—a conqueror.

                      What was to be the result of this victory? Heb. 2:14, 15.

                      Jesus Christ was conqueror of sin, death, the devil, and
                   perfectly revealed the desire of God to step down to man.
                      It is possible to concentrate upon the unpretentious, the
                   condescending, the forgiving, and the suffering Christ so that
                   the fact that He is and is to be the judging and conquering
                   Christ can be overlooked and forgotten. In His perfect revela-
                   tion of God, Jesus Christ exhibits all of the characteristics and
                   attributes of God.
                       So it is with God; He is always in control over every situa-
                   tion. His plans and purposes are certain to triumph. The con-
                   quering Christ is the perfect image of the conquering God, and
                   the Christian who truly reflects the image of his Maker is one
                   who triumphs over every difficulty and presents a contrast be-
                   tween his own selflessness with the utter selfishness of the
                   world.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I exhibit the characteristics of the Overcomer in my
                   dealings with others? Am I looking to the future kingdom for
                   the victory which God would give me now?

                        "As through Jesus we enter into rest, heaven begins here.
                   We respond to His invitation, Come, learn of Me, and in thus
                   coming we begin the life eternal. Heaven is a ceaseless ap-
                   proaching to God through Christ. The longer we are in the
                   heaven of bliss, the more and still more of glory will be opened
                   to us; and the more we know of God, the more intense will be
                   our happiness. As we walk with Jesus in this life, we may be
                   filled with His love, satisfied with His presence. All that human
                   nature can bear, we may receive here."—The Desire of Ages,

                                          note that the initiative for the com-
                                          munication was God's. The apostle

                                          by the impulse of man, but men
                                          moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from
                                          God" (2 Peter 1:21, RSV). It is essen-
                                          tial to recognize the origin and flow
                                          of the divine communication for this

         Part 1       What does Peter state to be the source of prophecy?
  MEN "MOVED"         "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:
        BY GOD     but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
                   Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21).
                      We are not sure exactly what happens when men are moved
                   by the Holy Spirit. This is a part of the "mystery of godliness"
                   and parallels the incarnation of Jesus Christ—God manifest in
                   the flesh. Prophets did not take the initiative in writing; neither
                   did they write down their own thoughts. They recorded what
                   the Spirit revealed to them, but they used their own words. Thus
                   the reader could learn what God wanted him to learn.
                      How does Paul describe how he received a vision? Did he
                   consider that this experience was something to boast about?
                   2 Cor. 12:1-4.
                      "The apostle Paul was highly honored of God, being taken
                   in holy vision to the third heaven, where he looked upon scenes
                   whose glories might not be revealed to mortals. Yet all this did
                   not lead him to boastfulness or self-confidence."—Ellen G.
                   White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1107.
                     What is the difference between men moved by God and
                   men who understand and teach the truth?
                      " 'Sister White, do you think we must understand the truth
                   for ourselves? . . . Do you not think that these men who have
                   brought out the truth in the past were inspired of God?'
                      [Answer.] "I dare not say they were not led of God, for
                   Christ leads into all truth; but when it comes to inspiration in
                   the fullest sense of the word, I answer, No.. ..
                      "You should say, 'If God has anything for me, I want it. If
                   God has given evidence from his word to this or that brother
                   that a certain thing is truth, he will give it to me. I can find
                   that evidence if I search the Scriptures with constant prayer,
                   and I can know that I do know what is truth.' You need not
                   preach the truth as the product of another man's mind, you
                   must make it your own."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald,

        Part 2        "And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the
   GOD SPARE       Lord" (Ex. 6:2).
  UNTO MOSES          The Bible does not explain how God speaks. The simple
                   assertion is that God spoke. It is equally clear from the Bible
                   record that Moses spoke to God, "sharing" with Him the ap-
                   peals and complaints of the chosen people, Israel. (See Ex.
                   5:22, 23.)
                      God spoke directly to individuals and people. He gave
                   dreams to Pharaoh. (See Gen. 41:25.) He spoke to Israel at
                   Sinai until the people begged Moses to be the intermediary.
                   (See Ex. 20:19.)
                      When God chooses a man to speak for Him, is the com-
                   munication any less authoritative than the direct approach?
                   Ex. 7:1, 2.
                      We may wonder why God chose to have human spokesmen
                   or penmen for Himself when angel messengers were available
                   or when He could as easily communicate to individuals or
                   groups directly. But God shows no disposition to meet our idle
                   curiosity. That He communicated is recorded, and pertinent
                   portions of what He has communicated are available. But on
                   the how and why of it God does not put Himself on trial before
                   human judges. Unquestionably, His infinite love, mercy, and
                   wisdom are the reason for the choice of this communication
                   pattern.
                       As we shall see in next week's lesson, certain of God's
                   words and deeds were recorded by some of these same men
                   whom He used as His communicators, and those records,
                   found in the Inspired Word—the Bible—are often the only
                   basis we have for knowing what God has done.
                       There are some who want to insist on receiving a direct
                   communication on a matter before they can be convinced of
                   its truth. In this regard they are telling God what to do. If God
                   has already made Himself clear through the prophets and the
                   written Word, there is no need to expect another communica-
                   tion.
THINK IT THROUGH      Is my relationship with God such that He could deign to
                   speak to men through me?
                      "As God called Daniel to witness for Him in Babylon, so He
                   calls us to be His witnesses in the world today. In the smallest
                   as well as the largest affairs of life, He desires us to reveal to
                   men the principles of His kingdom. Many are waiting for some
                   great work to be brought to them, while daily they lose oppor-

         Part 3       What other expression, common to the Old Testament is
   THE WORD OF     indicative of the divine condescension in communicating to
                   men through chosen men?
 THE LORD CAME
                      "In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came
                   the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the
                   son of Iddo the prophet" (Zech. 1:1).

                       There is here no explanation, no rationale, no introduction.
                   We are told in the plainest way that the word of the Lord came
                   to a man. Yet when we read the book of Zechariah we are
                   reading the words of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
                   of Iddo the prophet; and yet, in another and special sense, we
                   are reading the "word of the Lord."
                       Here we are at the heart of the process by which the self-
                   revealing God has chosen to speak to the sinful race. With the
                   limitations of human language fully operative, it is "the word
                   of the Lord" that comes to and through His chosen channels
                   of communication, as given in the Bible.
                       Changes have taken place in attitudes toward the Bible.
                   Many no longer consider the Bible to be the Word of God, but
                   rather consider it to contain the Word of God. To put it in
                   reverse, the Word of God, it is claimed, is not the Bible, but it
                   is in the Bible. It is further claimed that the Word of God is

                   sermon, in the testimony of a Christian layman, in any human
                   experience, wherever the "Spirit of God" is, there is the "word
                   of God."
                       It is important that Christians become aware of these subtle
                   distinctions. Sheltered within our own school system, building
                   on a heritage of the Bible as the only infallible guide of faith
                   and practice, we have a blind side to the actual meanings be-
                   hind the language of modern theology.

        Part 4       What instruction to the prophet Daniel made a portion of
SEAL THE BOOK    his writing a link between the Old and the New Testaments
                 and between the experience of God's people before and after
                 the cross?
                   "But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the
                 book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro,
                 and knowledge shall be increased" (Dan. 12:4).
                     There is a hidden power and a deeper truth in the inspired
                 words of God entrusted to His prophets which gives them an
                 authority beyond their own time and place, significant to peo-
                 ple other than their contemporaries.
                     In this same twelfth chapter of Daniel we hear the prophet
                 pleading with the heavenly messenger to explain to him (Dan-
                 iel) something of the deeper meaning of the messages he had
                 heard and which he was to record. (See verses 8-10, 12, 13.)
                     But Daniel was instructed to rest content with his limited
                 knowledge and insight and to know that in their time his
                 "sealed" words would come into their own in "the time of the
                 end."
                      Why was John the revelator told not to seal the sayings of
                 his prophecy? Rev. 22:10.
                     As the Preacher has said: There is a time and a purpose for
                 everything. (See Eccl. 3:1.) Even the Word of God has passages
                  with a local meaning and also a meaning that goes far beyond
                  the present. For example, see Isaiah 7:14 and Matthew 1:21-23.
                  There is a relevancy about the Word that makes it a living
                  word for every man, though every man will find a different
                  portion of Scripture speaking to his soul. There is also a word
                  that applies to every age, and a word that has particular ap-
                  plication to the end of time. It is characteristic of the Word
                  that it reflects the Divine Author in its beauty, aptness, and
                  power.
THINK IT THROUGH      Am 1 searching as diligently for the meaning of the words
                  whose time has come as did the prophets to whom the words
                 first came? (See 1 Peter 1:10-16.)
                     "Yet while it was not given to the prophets to understand
                 fully the things revealed to them, they earnestly sought to obtain
                 all the light which God had been pleased to make manifest.
                 . . . What a lesson to the people of God in the Christian age,
                 for whose benefit these prophecies were given to His servants!
                 . . . Contrast their [prophets'] holy zeal with the listless un-
                 concern with which the favored ones of later ages treat this
                 gift of Heaven. What a rebuke to the ease-loving, world-loving
                 indifference which is content to declare that the prophecies
                 cannot be understood!"—The Great Controversy, p. 344.

         Part 5      What particular privilege was accorded simple, humble
 EYEWITNESSES      men, in the revelation of God to men?
 OF THE CHRIST
                      "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when
                   we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
                   Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty" (2 Peter
                   1:16).

                      In courts of law witnesses are limited to the statement of
                   facts as known to them and especially to what they themselves
                   have seen, heard or otherwise experienced about an event. In
                   the same way God has given to us the testimony of a handful
                   of men who were privileged to be contemporaries and com-
                   panions of Jesus Christ, whom we have already agreed was
                   the supreme revelation of God to man.
                      From another point of view we can marvel that God even
                   entrusted the revelation through His Son to be conveyed to
                   men through men. Christ's brief stay in this world and His
                   briefer period of public ministry are known to all subsequent
                   generations through the testimony of human witnesses, for
                   Christ wrote no books. These witnesses were not dependent
                   upon their eyesight alone for their qualification for a vital re-
                   sponsibility. They claimed a comparable qualification to that
                   granted to the Old Testament prophets such as Moses, Isaiah,
                   and Daniel.

                     How does Peter express this shared authority of prophets
                   and apostle? 2 Peter 3:1,2.

                      Not only does Peter claim equal authority for the inspired
                   word through apostle and prophet, but he even asserts that
                   the words of the prophets were "more sure" than those of
                   eyewitnesses to an event. And it is in this context that he
                   claims, as the reason for their authority, that holy men were
                   "moved" by the Holy Ghost. (See 2 Peter 1:16-21.)

THINK IT THROUGH      How would you show that the Old Testament is as impor-
                   tant to the Christian as the New Testament? (See Rom. 15:4.)

                      "The word of God includes the Scriptures of the Old Testa-
                   ment as well as of the New. One is not complete without the
                   other. Christ declared that the truths of the Old Testament are
                   as valuable as those of the New. .

        Part 6      What does God promise to those who read, hear, and keep
                 the things written in the Word of God?
      BLESSED
      READERS
                      "Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy,
                   and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written
                   therein; for the time is near" (Rev. 1:3, RSV).

                        A blessing is promised to the one who reads the book of
                   Revelation aloud. In John's day it would be a very small minor-
                   ity of the people who would be able to read. They would de-
                   pend on readers who would read the book aloud to them. This
                   kind of reading would be done in congregational worship. It
                   would be easy for a reader to ignore the book or hide it, espe-
                   cially if he thought that it was difficult to understand or would
                   be unpopular with the hearers. But the book is important as a
                   revelation of Jesus Christ. (See Rev. 1:1.) It is especially im-
                    portant to those who live near the close of the world's history.
                        The book of Revelation contains many figures and symbols
                    and these may be difficult for the hearer to follow. But if the
                   listener will pay earnest attention, he will find guidance and
                    comfort as he follows the history of the church and the strug-
                    gle that goes on between Christ and Satan. He will be encour-
                    aged to know that although the church often seems defeated,
                    it will triumph gloriously. Thus he receives a blessing that Satan
                    would very much like to keep away from him.
                        Finally, he who keeps the sayings of the prophecy in his
                    heart and follows the instruction given is the one who receives
                    the blessing of salvation. The one who perseveres to the end
                    will be saved. (See Matt. 10:22.)

THINK IT THROUGH       Do I neglect certain parts of the Bible because they are
                   difficult to understand? How can 1 overcome this weakness?

                       "When a real love for the Bible is awakened, and the stu-
                   dent begins to realize how vast is the field and how precious
                   its treasure, he will desire to seize upon every opportunity for
                   acquainting himself with God's word. Its study will be re-

                   is one of the best means of cultivating a love for the Scriptures.
                   Let the student keep his Bible always with him. As you have
                   opportunity, read a text and meditate upon it. While walking

                                           that the history they are writing has
                                           inexplicable twists and turns. Since
                                           history tries to make sense of the
                                           past, history that ignores a very real
                                           element in human experience must

                                                The Bible testifies to what God
                                           has done in history. That there is a

                                           He is concerned with man's ultimate
                                           salvation; that in order to pursue His

     FULFILLED       "Then he said unto them, 0 fools, and slow of heart to
                 believe all that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to
                 have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And
                 beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto
                 them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself"
                 (Luke 24:25-27).
                     The apostles taught that the key events of the life, death,
                 and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth were the fulfillment of
                 the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah.
                     What events in the life of Jesus were direct fulfillment of
                 Old Testament prophecies? (See, for example, Matt. 1:22, 23;
                 2:5, 6, 17, 18; 4:13-15.)
                     At what time did Jesus come into the world? Gal. 4:4?
THINK IT THROUGH      What is the significance of knowing that events in the life
                 of Jesus had been foretold by the prophets?
                     It is fascinating to contemplate that He who wrote no books,
                 commanded no armies, held no office, made no political
                 speeches, who was so misunderstood by His own lowly family,
                 by His own disciples, and by His own people, has completely
                 revolutionized the history of this world. His life was, in event
                 and in word, a series of fulfilled prophecies.
                     "The Saviour's coming was foretold in Eden. When Adam

                 should be clearly and definitely understood. He, the author of
                  truth, must separate truth from the chaff of man's utterance,
                  which had made it of no effect. The principles of God's govern-

        Part 2        What marks of deity closely identify Jesus with the Father?
   HISTORICAL
                       "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake
       EVENTS      in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last
                   days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed
                   heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who
                   being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of
                   his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
                   when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
                   right hand of the Majesty on high." (Heb. 1:1-3).

                      Every event in the life of Jesus reflected another ray of light
                   identifying God for man, interpreting God to man.

                      How did Jesus describe His work and mission? Luke 4:18.

                      "He went about doing good and healing all that were op-
                   pressed by Satan. There were whole villages where there was
                   not a moan of sickness in any house, for He had passed through
                   them and healed all their sick. His work gave evidence of His
                   divine anointing. Love, mercy, and compassion were revealed
                   in every act of His life; His heart went out in tender sympathy
                   to the children of men. He took man's nature, that He might
                   reach man's wants."—Steps to Christ, pp. 11, 12.
                      "It was to redeem us that Jesus lived and suffered and died.
                   He became 'a Man of Sorrows,' that we might be made par-
                   takers of everlasting joy. God permitted His beloved Son, full
                   of grace and truth, to come from a world of indescribable glory,
                   to a world marred and blighted with sin, darkened with the
                   shadow of death and the curse."—Steps to Christ, p. 13.

THINK IT THROUGH      Take the Bible out of the world, obliterate it from human
                   history, and how much would sinful man know of God?

                       "This is a time when the question with all propriety may be
                   asked, 'When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the
                   earth?' (Luke 18:8).
                       "Spiritual darkness has covered the earth and gross dark-
                   ness the people. There are in many churches skepticism and
                   infidelity in the interpretation of the Scriptures. Many, very
                   many, are questioning the verity and truth of the Scriptures.
                   Human reasoning and the imaginings of the human heart are
                   undermining the inspiration of the Word of God, and that which
                   should be received as granted, is surrounded with a cloud of
                   mysticism. Nothing stands out in clear and distinct lines, upon
                   rock bottom. This is one of the marked signs of the last days."

        Part 3        What reason does Luke give for writing his Gospel?
     PURPOSES         "Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narra-
 ACCOMPLISHED      tive of the things which have been accomplished among us,
                   just as they were delivered to us by those who from the be-
                   ginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, it
                   seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely
                   for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most
                   excellent Theophilus, that you may know the truth concerning
                   the things of which you have been informed" (Luke 1:1-4,
                   RSV).
                      Luke was not an eyewitness of the events of the life of Jesus,
                   but he felt it was his duty, seeing he had met and spoken to
                   eyewitnesses, to set in order the things that he had learned so
                   that others in general, and Theophilus in particular, should have
                   strong evidence to believe the testimony of the apostles.
                       "It is clear from Luke's experience that Inspiration functions
                   in a manner consistent with the natural operation of the mental
                   faculties and does not set them aside. Here is an inspired
                   writer who was led by the Holy Spirit to give diligent study to
                   the available oral and written source materials on the life
                   of Christ, and then to combine into a connected narrative
                   the information thus gathered."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                   Luke 1:2
                      The purpose of Scripture is to give a continuing testimony
                   to the truths recorded. Through Scripture the life and words of
                   Jesus continue to live and bear their message.
                      In former times what had God ordered the Jews to do
                   with the written law? Deut. 6:6-9.

                       "These words [Deut. 6:8] have a deep meaning. As the word
                   of God is meditated upon and practiced, the whole man will
                   be ennobled. In righteous and merciful dealing, the hands will
                   reveal, as a signet, the principles of God's law. They will be
                   kept clean from bribes, and from all that is corrupt and decep-
                   tive. They will be active in works of love and compassion. The
                   eyes, directed toward a noble purpose, will be clear and true.
                   The expressive countenance, the speaking eye, will testify to
                   the blameless character of him who loves and honors the word
                   of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 612.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can Christians today keep the commandments of
                   God "as frontlets between thine eyes" and written "upon the
                   posts of thy house" in accordance with the instruction of
                   Deuteronomy 6:8, 9? How did Jesus attack all outward show

        Part 4      How extremely careful was John (as no doubt were other
       EVENTS    Bible writers) in recording the things God has said and done?
     ATTESTED        "This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
                wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true"
                (John 21:24).
                     "And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true:
                 and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe"
                 (John 19:35).
                     These words convey a strong yet unegotistic assurance on
                 the part of God's chosen witnesses of the Sent of God that
                 they were testifying truly and truthfully. For some of them, the
                 price paid for bearing this testimony was nothing less than
                 death. And for all of them this ultimate price could be exacted
                 at any moment, from any quarter. Yet fearlessly, selflessly they
                 went about the quiet but effectual work of turning the world
                 upside down with their teachings (Acts 17:6).
                     The thought may be running in some minds that surely the
                 inspiration and authority of the Bible rests on firmer ground
                 than the testimony of human eyewitnesses of the words and
                 works of Jesus. And if that qualification alone were all, there
                 could be a question. But the pervading, directing, teaching,
                  judging work of the Holy Spirit must be seen in it all. Even so,
                  we must still recognize the central place of faith on the part
                 of the one who comes to the Bible and accepts its testified
                 things.
                     The Jews had a high regard for Scripture. (See John 5:39.)
                  Yet Jesus said that they had false understandings because they
                  did not know the Scriptures as they ought. (See Matt. 22:29.)
                     What was the attitude of Jesus to the Scriptures? John
                 10:35.
                     Some modern translations of the expression "scripture can-
                  not be broken" are as follows:
                     "Scripture cannot be set aside." NEB.
                     "Scripture cannot be rejected." Jerusalem.
                     "What the scripture says is true forever." TEV.
                      What did Jesus say was the basis of coming to know
                  whether certain teachings were true or not? John 7:17.
                     "Those who study the word of God with hearts open to the
                  enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, will not remain in darkness
                  as to the meaning of the word.... All who come to Christ for
                  a clearer knowledge of the truth will receive it. He will unfold
                  to them the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, and these
                  mysteries will be understood by the heart that longs to know the
                  truth."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 36.
THINK IT THROUGH      John was very confident that what he believed was true.
                  (See 1 John 1:1-4.) How can we be equally confident?

         Part 5       How does inspiration place the seal of approval upon the
      THE SEAL     testimony of those who heard the Lord when He was here?
      OF TRUTH        "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
                   things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let
                   them slip. For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and
                   every transgression and disobedience received a just recom-
                   pense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great
                   salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,
                   and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also
                   bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and
                   with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according
                   to his own will?" (Heb. 2:1-4).
                       The writer to the Hebrews here summarizes the way the
                   message of salvation has been passed on to men:
                       1. There was the declaration of the Lord Jesus Himself.
                   (Who could doubt such a source?)
                       2. There was the testimony of those who heard the Lord.
                       3. God Himself confirmed the testimony by signs and mira-
                   cles. (What further testimony do we need?)
                       4. The gifts of the Holy Spirit were given the church so that
                   it could testify to the truth of the Scriptures.
                       The act of the believer's faith in the acceptance of the testi-
                   mony of God's witnesses does not have to operate without
                   divine confirmation. God bore witness to the authenticity of
                   His apostolic witnesses. After Jesus ascended to heaven the
                   apostles' witness was marked by signs, wonders, miracles, and
                   spiritual gifts, as the Holy Ghost saw the need.
                       How sadly the human and demon enemies of Christ under-
                   estimated what God would entrust to mere men. Just as the
                   evil powers were about to exult over His departure from this
                   world, His followers began to preach the Word with power.
                       The words of truth with which Christ had silenced opponents
                   were now heard upon the lips of these Galileans. The antici-
                   pated collapse of Christ's mission never came. The days from
                   Passover to Pentecost were days of regrouping, reequipping,
                   and reorganizing—for, with, and by the Holy Spirit.
THINK IT THROUGH     In view of the strong evidence for the authenticity of the
                   why do so many reject it? Is the church to blame?
                       "The church is God's agency for the proclamation of truth,
                   empowered by Him to do a special work; and if she is loyal
                   to Him, obedient to all His commandments, there will dwell
                   within her the excellency of divine grace. If she will be true to
                   her allegiance, if she will honor the Lord God of Israel, there is
                   no power that can stand against her."—The Acts of the Apos-

        Part 6         What does John the revelator say about events that are
  EVENTS STILL     still future?
       FUTURE
                       "And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true:
                   and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew
                   unto his servants the things which must shortly be done. Be-
                   hold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
                   of the prophecy of this book" (Rev. 22:6, 7).


                      Some are afraid of the study of prophecy. They shy away
                   from figures and symbols, and when there are differences of
                   interpretation current among Bible scholars, they wonder
                   whether they can profit from the study of prophecy. But Ellen
                   White says:
                      "The book of Revelation, in connection with the book of
                   Daniel, especially demands study. . . . None should become
                   discouraged in the study of the Revelation because of its ap-
                   parently mystical symbols. 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him
                   ask of God, that giveth to all liberally, and upbraideth not.'
                   James 1:5."—Education, p. 191.

                       What does Isaiah say is one of God's special characteris-
                   tics? Isa. 46:10; 42:9.


                       Only God can look into the future and see what will happen.
                   Only God can reveal the future. Fulfilled prophecy is evidence
                   that God has spoken, that prophecies yet unfulfilled will cer-
                   tainly come to pass.
                       "To John were opened scenes of deep and thrilling interest
                   in the experience of the church. He saw the position, dangers,

          Fart 1       Before the trial of the cross, what help did Jesus promise
     A PROMISED    to His disciples?
          GUIDE      "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
                   Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever" (John 14:16).
                       Sometimes individuals who come into contact with the
                   church and learn new truths protest as follows: "Well, when
                   the Spirit tells me personally that this teaching is true, I will
                   accept it. But now, no matter what you show me in the Bible, I
                   will not believe it."
                       This difference which some Christians see between the
                   authority of the Bible and that of the Holy Spirit is a matter
                   of major importance, especially in these days when the "charis-
                   matic" movement is gaining such prominence.
                       We believe Christ's promise of the Holy Spirit, and we ac-
                    knowledge the record of the work that the Spirit performed for
                   the disciples on the day of Pentecost. That was a revolutionizing
                   experience and shows what can happen to ordinary men and
                   women when they are "baptized with the Holy Ghost" (Acts
                   1:5).
                       But is there anything about the true Pentecostal experience
                   that would support the frequently held feeling that the personal
                   guidance of the Holy Spirit should take precedence over the
                   teachings of the Word of God? Is there any valid difference
                   between the teachings of Jesus and the guidance of the Holy
                   Spirit?
                       "The Spirit was not given—nor can it ever be bestowed—
                   to supersede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that
                   the word of God is the standard by which all teaching and ex-
                   perience must be tested....
                       "Great reproach has been cast upon the work of the Holy
                   Spirit by the errors of a class that, claiming its enlightenment,
                   profess to have no further need of guidance from the word of
                   God. They are governed by impressions which they regard as
                   the voice of God in the soul. But the spirit that controls them
                   is not the Spirit of God."—The Great Controversy, Introduction,
                   p. v11.

THINK IT THROUGH      What was to be the source of those things which the Holy
                   Spirit would bring to the disciples? (See John 16:13, 14.)
                      The Spirit would not only instruct the disciples in the things
                   of Christ which they had not yet understood, but He would
                   bring back to their minds those things which they had under-
                   stood, but had forgotten. (See John 14:26.) So, it may be asked,
                   How can there be any essential conflict between the teachings
                   of Christ and the promptings of the Spirit?

        Part 2        What evidence is there that the Spirit will teach in harmony
WALKING AFTER      with the law of God?
   THE SPIRIT        "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
                   who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom. 8:4).

                       Those who profess to be following the guidance of the Spirit
                   as an authority superior to that of the Bible often make such a
                   claim of authority when faced with previously unrecognized
                   demands of the law of God. Yet the apostle Paul sees no con-
                   flict between the two authorities when he is writing to the
                   Roman church. Those who walk in the way of the Spirit's teach-
                   ing will find their lives brought into growing harmony with the
                   law of God. (See Rom. 8:4-7).
                       "To them that believe, Christ is precious. His Spirit moving
                   upon the mind and heart of the believer is in perfect agree-
                   ment with that which is written in the Word. The Spirit and the
                   Word agree perfectly. Thus the Spirit beareth witness with our
                   spirit that we are born of God."—In Heavenly Places, p. 144.
                       "In searching for Heaven-revealed truths, the Spirit of God
                   is brought into close connection with the sincere searcher of
                   the Scriptures. An understanding of the revealed will of God
                   enlarges the mind, expands, elevates, and endows it with new
                   vigor by bringing its faculties into contact with stupendous
                   truth."—In Heavenly Places, p. 133.

                      How willing is God to give the Holy Spirit to those who
                   ask Him? Luke 11:13.

THINK IT THROUGH      Does my personal relationship with the Holy Spirit
                   strengthen the rule of God's commandments in my life?

                      "The law of ten commandments is not to be looked upon as
                   much from the prohibitory side, as from the mercy side. Its pro-
                   hibitions are the sure guarantee of happiness in obedience. As
                   received in Christ, it works in us the purity of character that
                   will bring joy to us through eternal ages. To the obedient it
                   is a wall of protection. We behold in it the goodness of God,
                   who by revealing to men the immutable principles of righteous-
                   ness, seeks to shield them from the evils that result from trans-
                   gression."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 235.
                      What a tragedy if any of God's people today should repeat
                   the error of some who, in 1888, opposed the teaching of righ-
                   teousness by faith presented by Ellen White and Brethren Wag-
                   goner and Jones. To restore us to harmony with the law is the
                   goal of the Spirit as He seeks to bring us into harmony with

          Part 3       To whom has God given the Holy Spirit?
 THE SPIRIT AND
     OBEDIENCE        "And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also
                   the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey
                   him" (Acts 5:32).

                       The occasion for this bold assertion by Peter was the arrest
                   of himself and his brethren when summoned before the San-
                   hedrin. They had already been released from the common
                   prison by the angel of the Lord and had been instructed to
                   teach in the temple again.
                       The anger of the high priest against them was heightened
                   by their seeming indifference to the authority of his threats of
                   punishment. He demanded that their obedience be to men; but
                   Peter asserted that they must be obedient to a higher authority
                   —that of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whose name and for whose
                   cause they preached. The Holy Ghost was a witness to the
                   truth of what they preached and was given "to them that obey
                   him."
                       Heaven, said Peter, has vindicated our determination to
                   "obey God rather than men" (verse 29). The evidence is in the
                   gift of His Spirit to them that obey Him.

                      What is the contrast between the believer and the world
                   as concerning the Holy Spirit? John 14:17.

                      The Spirit is given only to those who obey God; but obe-
                   dience to God is possible only through the Spirit. Man cannot
                   work at cross purposes to the Spirit and still retain His pres-
                   ence. Thus the world does not receive Him because they are
                   traveling a different road.

THINK IT THROUGH      Could there be any disposition to disobey God that is
                   hindering the gift of His Spirit to me?

                      "Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty
                   agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would come
                   with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is
                   the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by
                   the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made
                   pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of
                   the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power
                   to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil,
                   and to impress His own character upon His church."—The

        Part 4        What is the importance of the Holy Spirit both in the giv-
    THE SPIRIT     ing of prophecy and its interpretation?
    MOVES AND
   INTERPRETS         "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is
                   of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in
                   old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as
                   they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:20, 21).

                      While it is true that Peter is here speaking especially of
                   the prophecies of the Old Testament, there is no indication that
                   his statement would not be applicable to the whole of the Old
                   Testament, and by analogy, to the New. (See 2 Peter 3:15, 16.)
                   Thus, if the Holy Spirit was the source of the inspiration of
                   the Bible writers, that same Spirit could never counsel at any
                   time, including today, in a manner contrary to the teaching of
                   the Bible. To think otherwise would be to suggest that God
                   contradicts Himself, and this is an untenable viewpoint.
                      Thus it is clear that professed followers of Jesus who want
                   to believe that their relationship with the Holy Spirit gives them
                   license to negate the instructions of the Bible have failed to
                   see the inseparable relationship of the Spirit with the Scripture.

                       What does Paul teach is the way that men may know the
                   things of God? 1 Cor. 2:9-12.


THINK IT THROUGH       How safe is my impression that the Spirit of God is lead-
                   ing me if the way seems contrary to the Spirit's instruction
                   in the Bible and in the spirit of prophecy?

                       "'To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not accord-
                   ing to this word, it is because there is no light in them' (lsa.
                   8:20). Even the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is to be
                   tested by the Word of God. The Spirit which inspired the
                   Scriptures, always leads to the Scriptures."—Selected Mes-
                   sages, bk. 1, p. 43.
                       In justice to a balanced view of this issue between the com-
                   parative authorities of the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit, let
                   it be clearly understood that without the Spirit's guidance today
                   the believer is in danger of misinterpreting the Scriptures. Like-
                    wise, without the rule of faith and practice provided by the
                   Scriptures, the so-called impressions of the Holy Spirit (or
                    those believed to be from the Holy Spirit) could be subject to

                   searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should
                   come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the
                   Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testi-
                   fied beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that
                   should follow" (1 Peter 1:10, 11).

                        The essential harmony and unity of the Old Testament era,
                   the gospel era of Jesus Christ, and the era of the Christian
                   church are clearly indicated by the apostle Peter in his first
                   epistle. When those today whose claim to the Spirit's guidance
                   leads them to neglect the requirements of the Word of God,
                   it is often the Old Testament to which they take particular ex-
                   ception. Such an attitude finds no support in the Word which
                   the Spirit inspired.
                        It may come as a shock to some believers to recognize
                   Peter's claim that it was the Spirit of Christ in the Old Testa-
                   ment prophets which gave them their insights into salvation.
                   The indwelling of that Spirit and His revelations to the prophets
                   led them to study earnestly the portrayals granted them. They
                   longed to understand the future more fully, but they were gently
                   advised, as was Daniel (see Dan. 12:8-13), that aspects of their
                   testimony were for a later time—the time of Jesus and the
                   church. And now, says Peter, the same Holy Spirit in us has
                   led us to report to you, the church, the things of the gospel
                   which we have witnessed.

THINK IT THROUGH      For what did David pray for which a Christian today may
                   also pray? Ps. 51:11.

                      Is the Spirit of Christ in me leading me to search the things
                   written by prophets and apostles respecting my salvation and
                   the meaning of fulfilling events?

                      "Having brought conviction of sin, and presented before the
                   mind the standard of righteousness, the Holy Spirit withdraws
                   the affections from the things of this earth and fills the soul
                   with a desire for holiness. 'He will guide you into all truth'
                   (John 16:13), the Saviour declared. If men are willing to be
                   molded, there will be brought about a sanctification of the
                   whole being. The Spirit will take the things of God and stamp
                   them on the soul. By His power the way of life will be made
                   so plain that none need err therein."—The Acts of the Apostles,

         Part 6       What was the experience of John that made him receptive
  IN THE SPIRIT    to a revelation from God?

                     "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind
                   me a great voice, as of a trumpet" (Rev. 1:10).

                       Earlier in these lessons we discussed the instruction which
                   the opening verses of Revelation provide us concerning the
                   process of divine revelation to man, as God, Jesus Christ, the
                   angel, and the "servant John" provide a chain of communica-
                   tion from heaven to the church on earth. Does this chain of
                   communication ignore the work of the Holy Spirit? No! In the
                   above verse the expression "in the Spirit" and the context of
                   the phrase indicate a state or condition in which the revelator
                   was receptive to the communications of the Spirit of God.
                   (Note also the refrain in the seven letters to the churches: "Let
                   him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.")
                       We are thus brought back once more to the essential har-
                   mony between Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the Father, and the "Reve-
                   lation of Jesus Christ." When Jesus was challenged on earth
                   as to His authority, His appeal was often to the Word. (See Matt.
                   12:1-8; Mark 10:1-9.)

THINK IT THROUGH       If there appears to be a conflict between the impressions
                   of the mind and the teachings of the Bible, which should I
                   follow? (See 1 John 4:1-3; 2 Tim. 2:15, 16; 1:13, 14.)

                      It is significant to note Paul's concern that Timothy prove
                   himself a man of "sound doctrine." And this is in harmony
                   with the principle found in Isaiah 8:19, 20, and with the re-
                   peated insistence of the spirit of prophecy, such as this para-
                   graph:
                      "Some who have all their lives been led by feeling have
                   thought that an education or a thorough knowledge of the
                   Scriptures was of no consequence if they only had the Spirit.
                   But God never sends His Spirit to sanction ignorance. Those
                   who have not knowledge, and who are so situated that it is
                   impossible for them to obtain it, the Lord may, and does, pity
                   and bless, and sometimes condescends to make His strength
                   perfect in their weakness. But He makes it the duty of such to
                   study His word. A lack of knowledge in the sciences is no ex-
                   cuse for a neglect of Bible study; for the words of inspiration
                   are so plain that the unlearned may understand them."—Testi-

          Part 1      On what two occasions did Jesus take steps to call the
       CALL AND    church into existence and give her a divine commission?
     COMMISSION       "And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples:
                   and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles"
                   (Luke 6:13).
                      "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
                   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
                   teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com-
                   manded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
                   end of the world. Amen" (Matt. 28:19, 20).
                      It was following a night of earnest prayer for the disciples
                   (Luke 6:12) that Jesus took the step of calling His church into
                   existence. Concerning the calling of those disciples who were
                   to be apostles, the inspired comment is that "the first step was
                   now to be taken in the organization of the church that after
                   Christ's departure was to be His representative on earth."—The
                   Desire of Ages, p. 291.
                      We have noted the condescension of God in using men as
                   His channels of revelation to other men, and it was this divine-
                   human link which gave the apostolic church its commission.
                   While noting the divine-human combination in Christ Himself,
                   God's messenger to the remnant asserts that "divinity needed
                   humanity; for it required both the divine and the human to bring
                   salvation to the world. Divinity needed humanity, that humanity
                   might afford a channel of communication beween God and man.
                   So with the servants and messengers of Christ. Man needs a
                   power outside of and beyond himself, to restore him to the
                   likeness of God, and enable him to do the work of God; but
                   this does not make the human agency unessential. Humanity
                   lays hold upon divine power, Christ dwells in the heart by faith;
                   and through co-operation with the divine, the power of man
                   becomes efficient for good."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 296, 297.
THINK IT THROUGH      How do I know that I am included in the divine commission
                   given to the apostles?
                      "He who called the fishermen of Galilee is still calling men
                   to His service. And He is just as willing to manifest His power
                   through us as through the first disciples."—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 297.
                       The oft-quoted gospel commission (Matt. 28:19, 20) is a re-
                   affirmation of the original purpose for calling the church of
                   apostles into existence; it was that it might be an authoritative
                   witness to the truth of the gospel through the work of the Holy
                   Spirit, a witness in which men and women would be equally
                   involved. Out of that authoritative witness came the New Testa-
                   men record.

        Part 2        What authority did Christ commit to His apostles, and the
       DIVINE      church?
    AUTHORITY          "Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
                   shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on
                   earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto you, That
                   if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that
                   they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which
                   is in heaven" (Matt. 18:18, 19).

                      This bestowal of authority to the Spirit-led church was later
                   repeated after the resurrection of Christ. (See John 20:21-23,
                   and The Desire of Ages, p. 805).

                      What danger is there in rejecting the authority of the
                   church?

                       "Christ here [in John 20:23] gives no liberty for any man
                   to pass judgment upon others. In the Sermon on the Mount He
                   forbade this. It is the prerogative of God. But on the church in
                   its organized capacity He places a responsibility for the individ-
                   ual members. Toward those who fall into sin, the church has
                   a duty, to warn, to instruct, and if possible to restore. ... She
                   [the church] must say about sin what God says about it. She
                   must deal with it as God directs, and her action is ratified in
                   heaven. He who despises the authority of the church despises
                   the authority of Christ Himself."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 805,
                   806.
                       While "the church in its organized capacity" has a solemn
                   work in rebuking sin, wherever found, she also has a message
                   of hope to speak for Christ: "Whose soever sins ye remit, they
                   are remitted." John 20:23. This side of the church's work
                   should ever "be kept uppermost." The Desire of Ages, p. 806.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it that in many quarters the church is not recog-
                   nized as authoritative in matters of doctrine and discipline?
                   Is the church to blame? How do I regard the church and its
                   authority?

                      "The church is God's fortress, His city of refuge, which He
                   holds in a revolted world. Any betrayal of the church is treach-
                   ery to Him who has bought mankind with the blood of His only-
                   begotten Son. . . . God brought these witnesses into covenant
                   relation with Himself, uniting the church on earth with the
                   church in heaven. He has sent forth His angels to minister to
                   His church, and the gates of hell have not been able to prevail
                   against His people."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 11.

         Part 3       How close and continuous is the relationship of Jesus
 CHRIST'S BODY     Christ and His church?
                      "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to
                   be the head over all things to the church, which is his body,
                   the fulness of him that filleth all in all" (Eph. 1:22, 23).

                      It is a tragedy that the enemy has succeeded in leading
                   many to suppose that they can maintain a sweet, personal re-
                   lationship with Christ and yet at the same time despise and
                   ignore His church. This would be comparable to communicating
                   with a person's head in a gracious and positive manner while
                   despising the rest of his body.
THINK IT THROUGH      How much independence of spirit is legitimate in the
                   church?
                      "God has made His church on earth a channel of light, and
                   through it He communicates His purposes and His will. He does
                   not give to one of His servants an experience independent of
                   and contrary to the experience of the church itself. Neither
                   does He give one man a knowledge of His will for the entire
                   church while the church—Christ's body—is left in darkness. In
                   His providence He places His servants in close connection with
                   His church in order that they may have less confidence in
                   themselves and greater confidence in others whom He is lead-
                   ing out to advance His work.
                      "There have ever been in the church those who are con-
                   stantly inclined toward individual independence. They seem
                   unable to realize that independence of spirit is liable to lead
                   the human agent to have too much confidence in himself and
                   to trust in his own judgment rather than to respect the counsel
                   and highly esteem the judgment of his brethren, especially of
                   those in the offices that God has appointed for the leadership
                   of His people. God has invested His church with special au-
                   thority and power which no one can be justified in disregarding
                   and despising, for he who does this despises the voice of God."
                   —The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 163, 164.
                      At the same time there are and have been occasions when
                   persons in high office in the church have abused position and
                   power. Since all leaders are human, the temptation to use power
                   selfishly is ever present, and the church at large has a respon-
                   sibility to note, to counsel, to curb and even remove from power
                   those who abuse it. (See Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 76, 77.)
                      It calls for a close walk with God on the part of every leader,
                   every member, if the oneness which alone can clear the way
                   for ultimate Holy Ghost power in the church is to become a
                   reality.

        Part 4       By what counsel did Christ endeavor to teach His disciples
          THE      humility in their leadership of the church?
 BROTHERHOOD         "But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even
                   Christ; and all ye are brethren" (Matt. 23:8).

                       History teaches us awareness of the ever-present human
                   tendency to abuse a position of leadership and power—in any
                   sphere of life, including the church. The titles, the privileges,
                   the vestments, the exemptions, the adulation, the deference—
                   all these and a host of other attachments to leadership are a
                   potential snare to any human soul.
                       Christ was wholly aware of these snares when He gave the
                   warning against seeking titles, and stressed that all—He was
                   addressing the multitude and His disciples—"all ye are breth-
                   ren."
                       "The church is built upon Christ as its foundation; it is to
                   obey Christ as its head. It is not to depend upon man, or be
                   controlled by man. Many claim that a position of trust in the
                   church gives them authority to dictate what other men shall
                   believe and what they shall do. This claim God does not sanc-
                   tion. The Saviour declares, 'All ye are brethren.' "—The Desire
                   of Ages, p. 414.

                     What did Jesus indicate was the path to true greatness?
                   Matt. 20:25-28.

                       "Not by their wealth, their education, or their position does.
                   God estimate men. He estimates them by their purity of motive
                   and their beauty of character. He looks to see how much of
                   His Spirit they possess, and how much of His likeness their
                   life reveals. To be great in God's kingdom is to be as a little
                   child in humility, in simplicity of faith, and in purity of love."
                   —The Ministry of Healing, pp. 477, 478.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it important for the church to be united in brother-
                   hood? Does unity mean sameness?

                      There is no reason to think that unity demands uniformity
                   or blind conformity. The apostles of the church demonstrated
                   unity in diversity repeatedly. (See Acts 15:37-41; Gal. 2:11-14
                   for examples.) But the rugged individuality was not to be an
                   excuse for rupturing the unity of the church for which Jesus
                   prayed. And it is significant to remember always that the Pen-
                   tecostal power came when Pentecostal unity had been achieved
                   by prayer, confession, restitution, and fellowship. (See Acts
                   1:12-14; 2:1-4.)

          Part 5       What parable did Jesus tell to illustrate the external growth
   THE KINGDOM     of the kingdom of heaven?
 INCOMPARABLE
                       "And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of
                   God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? It is like
                   a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth,
                   is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: but when it is
                   sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs,
                   and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air
                   may lodge under the shadow of it" (Mark 4:30-32).


                      The world is full of groups and organizations, some great,
                   others small, and some in between. But there is none that gives
                   a valid illustration of the "kingdom of God."

THINK IT THROUGH      From the experience of the disciples recorded in Mark
                   10:35-45, what would you say is the difference between the
                   kingdom of heaven and the world in regard to the prereq-
                   uisites for a position of honor?


                       It is for this reason, among others, that the kingdom of God
                   is unique. God's principles are opposite to those of the world.
                   The leaders in the church are to be the humblest servants of
                   all! Unfortunately, not all members of the church are maturing.
                   And appointment to high office in a local church or a confer-
                   ence does not change a person's character.
                       "Let us all remember that we are not dealing with ideal
                   men, but with real men of God's appointment, men precisely
                   like ourselves, men who fall into the same errors that we do,
                   men of like ambitions and infirmities. No man has been made
                   a master, to rule the mind and conscience of a fellow being.
                   Let us be very careful how we deal with God's blood-bought
                   heritage."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 495.
                       Perhaps as the church increases in numbers and in the
                   development of its institutions there may be a greater danger
                   that individuals—workers or laymen—may be tempted to "ex-
                   ercise lordship" over others. Such a tendency must be re-
                   sisted, and quiet but effective conviction be expressed through
                   channels of church communication to discourage any such
                   tendency. Particularly in view of the independent spirit that
                   marks our day, we must work together to remove all "lordship"
                   tendencies from the midst of the church.

  PREPARATION      God's glory, having already entered fully into His kingdom
                   of grace, what will be her condition?
  FOR TRIUMPH
                      "And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are with-
                   out fault before the throne of God" (Rev. 14:5).

                       "Without fault"! No guile in their mouths! Will there be any
                   exercise of lordship on the part of those triumphant 144,000?
                   On the other hand, will there be among them any who has
                   despised the authority of God or His messengers, whoever
                   they may be? It is a solemn thought to contemplate whether
                   anyone with either fault will be "safe to save" in the church-
                   become-the-kingdom. For is there not a tendency for the ex-
                   erciser of "lordship" to indulge in "guile" to achieve his ends
                   and to mask his true intentions?
                       When a confrontation arose in the apostolic church, a coun-
                   cil was called and the Holy Spirit's will was sought most ear-
                   nestly until the church could announce a descision: "For it
                   seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us" (Acts 15:28). Can
                   the church today follow a better pattern?
                       With what impatience all heaven awaits that condition in the
                   church that will free the channels for God's unrestrained com-
                   munication of Himself to the world!

THINK IT THROUGH       Could I be guilty of both a desire to be independent of the
                   authority of the united church and also of exercising a mas-
                   terly spirit in my relationships with those who work near (and
                   perhaps "under") me?
                       "Some have advanced the thought that as we near the close
                   of time, every child of God will act independently of any reli-

 the church is not yet perfected, has
 not yet come to "the unity of the

 use of the "gifts" which Christ gave

         Part 1       What good counsel comes to us from the Old Testament
     PROPHETIC     regarding prophets?
       LINEAGE        "And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into
                   the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat
                   stood and said, Hear me, 0 Judah, and ye inhabitants of
                   Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be estab-
                   lished; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper" (2 Chron.
                   20:20).
                      The above text tells us; (1) that God speaks to His people
                   through prophets; (2) that prosperity comes to all those who
                   believe the messages given and live according to them.
                      The question arises: Does God always, and in every age,
                   provide a prophet that will speak for Him? The answer is that
                   there have been times when God has sent no messengers. The
                   intertestament period is one of those times—the period between
                   the last book of the Old Testament, Malachi, dated about 400
                   BC, and the opening of the New Testament era with the Gos-
                   pels.
                      God in His wisdom knows when it is necessary to send a
                   mouthpiece for Him. The New Testament era was a time when
                   there were many prophets. (See Luke 1:67, 76; 24:19; Acts
                   21:8, 9.)
                      It is reasonable to suppose that at the end of time, when
                   the church is being described as "lukewarm" (Rev. 3:16) and
                   Satan goes about "as a roaring lion" (1 Peter 5:8), a messenger
                   would be needed. This prophet would represent the gift of
                   prophecy promised to the church (Eph. 4:8, 11).

                   end of God's formal self-revelation?

                       Our introduction to this lesson has already suggested that
                   the spiritual gifts or gifts of the Spirit are to be seen in the
                   church until her work on earth and her restoration to the divine
                   likeness are completed.
                       So, in one sense, there can be seen a prophetic lineage,
                   encompassed in the gift of "prophesying" from the days of
                   Moses to the twentieth century. The descriptions of the per-
                   sonal experiences and the physical phenomena associated with
                   the reception of God's revelation to the Biblical prophets and
                   apostles is paralleled closely by the experience of Ellen G.
                   White. We shall notice however, that she herself drew a dis-
                   tinction between her writings and the Scriptures which cannot
                   be overlooked if one would be true to the claims of Ellen
                   White.

        Part 2        Why will the gifts of the Spirit be manifested within and
   PERPETUITY      through the church until the close of human probation?
      OF GIFTS         "For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the min-
                   istry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come
                   in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
                   God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of
                   the fulness of Christ" (Eph. 4:12, 13).

                      So long as the saints are not perfect, and the work of the
                   ministry is not completed, so long as we are divided among
                   ourselves over doctrinal teachings and have not reached the
                   standard of perfection in Christ Jesus, so long will the gifts of
                   the Spirit be necessary, and among them the gift of prophecy.
                       "In harmony with the word of God, His Spirit was to con-
                   tinue its work throughout the period of the gospel dispensation.
                   During the ages while the Scriptures of both the Old and the
                   New Testament were being given, the Holy Spirit did not cease
                   to communicate light to individual minds, apart from the reve-
                   lations to be embodied in the Sacred Canon. The Bible itself
                   relates how, through the Holy Spirit, men received warning,
                   reproof, counsel, and instruction, in matters in no way relating
                   to the giving of the Scriptures. And mention is made of prophets
                   in different ages, of whose utterances nothing is recorded. In
                   like manner, after the close of the canon of Scripture, the Holy
                   Spirit was still to continue its work, to enlighten, warn, and
                   comfort the children of God."—The Great Controversy, Intro-
                   duction, p. vi11.

THINK IT THROUGH       What phase of Christ's church of the ages could be in
                   greater need of inspired guidance than the remnant which
                   finally champions the character and government of God? (See
                   Rev. 12:17.)

                      We should perhaps not be surprised that a particular gift
                   of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:1-11 and 27-30) should be more
                   conspicuously bestowed upon the church at a given time. For
                   example, at the Pentecostal bestowal of the Spirit the gift of
                   tongues was the conspicuous gift—very possibly because the
                   circumstances and need of the infant church at that time were
                   for the power to give the gospel swiftly to an ever-widening
                   circle. (See Acts 1:8.) In the remnant phase of the church's
                   history the gift of prophecy seems dominant. This does not
                   preclude the bestowal of other of the New Testament gifts or
                   possibly some gifts never before manifested. Furthermore, to
                   every servant of the Master some gift is promised.

        Part 3      Who besides apostles are mentioned as being part of the
 PROPHETS LAY    foundation of the church?
  FOUNDATIONS
                    "And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
                 prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone"
                 (Eph. 2:20).


                      The prophet, like the apostle, serves as a mouthpiece for
                  God, and hence his work is important in passing on God's mes-
                  sages. It does not matter when the prophet lives, to whom he
                 is sent, and the particular message he gives. The main thing
                  is that he is inspired to speak for God.
                      Thus there can be no question of degrees of prophetic in-
                  spiration. All are equally inspired, all give messages that the
                  church cannot neglect with impunity.
                      One of the greatest evidences that the spirit of prophecy as
                 manifested through Ellen White is a genuine gift of the Holy
                 Spirit to the remnant church lies in the consistent manner in
                  which the writer herself maintained both the infallibility and
                 the supremacy of the Scriptures.
                      " 'The word of God is sufficient to enlighten the most be-
                 clouded mind and may be understood by those who have any
                 desire to understand it. But notwithstanding all this, some who
                 profess to make the word of God their study are found living
                 in direct opposition to its plainest teachings. Then, to leave
                 men and women without excuse, God gives plain and pointed
                 testimonies, bringing them back to the word that they have
                 neglected to follow.' The word of God abounds in general prin-
                 ciples for the formation of correct habits of living, and the
                 testimonies, general and personal, have been calculated to call
                 their attention more especially to these principles.' "—Testi-
                 monies, vol. 5, pp. 663, 664.
                      The declarations of the spirit of prophecy are clear and
                 unequivocal. Ellen White referred to her writings as a "lesser
                 light" to call attention to the "greater light"—the Bible. Her
                 writings, like any other prophetic writings, are to be tested by
                 the Bible and its teachings. Had the church more thoroughly
                 dug into the mine of Bible truth, these modern writings would
                 not have been necessary. Having them, let us make use of
                 them to learn more of the Bible.

                                                         June 2

        Part 4         Were one to assert that there were no inspired writings (in
 A NEEDED GIFT     the sense of 2 Tim. 3:16, 17) between John the revelator (about
                   AD 100) and Ellen White (1844-1915), one is pressed to explain
                   why the church was left without inspired counsel for over 1700
                   years.
                       In the first place, one might be assuming more than is war-
                   ranted. Significant dreams at least were reported which found
                   fulfillment as divine guidance to individuals or to groups in
                   the church. Being guided into truth (as the Reformers were,
                   following the night of papal apostasy) is also very closely
                   allied to inspiration of the Spirit, though not equivalent to it.
                       But in the second place, it may not be within our present
                   power and knowledge to account for God's givings and with-
                   holdings. One cannot overlook the "silent centuries" of some
                   400 years before Christ came to the earth when there was no
                   recorded inspired guidance for God's people.
                       We do not have the complete picture of the history of the
                   church down through the centuries. There are reasons for this;
                   Satan has caused many records to be destroyed. (Sea The
                   Great Controversy, p. 61.) It is possible that the church pre-
                   cluded the gift of .prophecy on a large scale because of apos-
                   tasy. But in the time of the end God sent a messenger to play
                   a significant role in the growth and development of the rem-
                   nant church.
                       How grateful and how humble we should be! Why are we
                   so favored? What would thousands of other Christians give for
                   such counsel as has been extended to Seventh-day Adventists
                   —so that we are without excuse for knowing what God would
                   make us by the grace of Jesus Christ and the indwelling of the
                   Holy Spirit's presence and power.

THINK IT THROUGH      How am I relating to this up-dating of God's revelation
                   to man? What authority do I give it in my personal life and
                   experience? (See "Selected Messages," bk. 1, pp. 26-29.)

                      "The Lord designs to warn you, to reprove, to counsel,
                   through the testimonies given, and to impress your minds with
                   the importance of the truth of His word. The written testimonies
                   are not to give new light, but to impress vividly upon the heart
                   the truths of inspiration already revealed. Man's duty to God
                   and to his fellow man has been distinctly specified in God's
                   word; yet but few of you are obedient to the light given. Addi-
                   tional truth is not brought out; but God has through the Testi-
                   monies simplified the great truths already given and in His own
                   chosen way brought them before the people to awaken and
                   impress the mind with them, that all may be left without ex-

         Part 5   It is legitimate to ask why the church should need 100,000
       USE AND pages of manuscript writings in the nineteenth and twentieth
                centuries if the Bible itself is to be the "rule of faith and duty."
        MISUSE —The Great Controversy, p. 205.
                       A number of legitimate factors give answer to the question:
                       1. The church facing Satan's final attempt to win the great
                   controversy between righteousness and evil needs every spir-
                   itual reinforcement that a loving God can offer her.
                       2. The growing gap between Bible times and modern times
                   increases the need and value of sound interpretation of the
                   Scripture in the light of the modern context.
                       3. Those believers who are to reflect the image of Jesus
                   perfectly to a hostile and over-populated world are to be given
                   the most detailed insight into God's will ever entrusted to men.
                       But while the spirit of prophecy meets these needs in the
                   church today, certain disconcerting trends among some of its
                   members, in using the writings, warrant a word of caution.
                      1. Avoid using the spirit of prophecy piecemeal, that is,
                   where a person sees only what he wants to see as it applies to
                   him, but he uses other parts as hammers of condemnation over
                   the heads of his brothers and sisters.
                      2. One must not carry the piecemeal tendency to such an
                   extreme that he extracts phrases or sentences from their con-
                   text. Thus he distorts the writer's intention, even to making her
                   say the opposite of what she really says when the context is
                   read.
                      3. One must not have "hobby horses" in the spirit of proph-
                   ecy which he "rides" repeatedly while ignoring "weightier
                   matters" such as the saving relationship to Jesus Christ and
                   obedience to the law of God.
                      4. Instead of using the spirit of prophecy in tandem with
                   the Scriptures, to illuminate them, one must not use it in place
                   of the Word of God. To do so thwarts Heaven's intention in
                   placing the gift in the church today.
                      5. One must not rob the spirit of prophecy of its authority
                   by arguing about different degrees of inspiration when he can-
                   not really explain the process of inspiration as it applies to the
                   Bible. There is a mystery within inspiration that parallels the
                   mystery within the incarnation. The issue is, Are we willing to
                   do God's will? (See John 7:16, 17.)

THINK IT THROUGH      While the Bible is ever to be the norm, and the "greater
                   light," what use am I, as a part of the remnant church, mak-
                   ing of the detailed inspired counsel in the "lesser light"?

         Part 6      What does the "Preacher" say about the importance of
TIME AND PLACE    timing in every phase of life?
                     "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every
                  purpose under the heaven" (Eccl. 3:1).
                       There is a principle here that is applicable to inspired writ-
                   ings, and it is a principle that appeals to reason. To ignore it
                   brings inevitable distortion and misinterpretation and robs the
                   believer of the very help which God designed that he should
                   receive.
                       There are backgrounds to all writings. They were made in a
                   particular time frame, in a particular setting, to meet a par-
                   ticular need (present or even future, in predictive messages),
                   using the language of the times and of the author.
                       As time passes from the days of the writer to the days of
                    the reader, there is increasing need for the reader to go back
                   and consider the "time and place" factors within which and
                    concerning which the writing was done if he is to interpret it
                   safely.
                       Jesus Himself interpreted to the men walking to Emmaus
                    "in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke
                    24:27). So today the necessity of "rightly dividing [handling
                    accurately—NASB)] the word of truth" is clear, whether the
                    Bible or the spirit of prophecy is the object of study (2 Tim.
                    2:15).
                       Many things which Paul wrote, for example, concerning the
                    church must be seen in the light of the "time and place" in
                    which he wrote. Taken at their face meaning, as we would
                    understand the words today without thinking of the background,
                    we could only misunderstand and misapply. So with the spirit
                    of prophecy writings.
                     How does Ellen White express the fact that her writings
                   must be studied in the light of time and circumstance?
                     "Regarding the testimonies, nothing is ignored; nothing is
                   cast aside; but time and place must be considered."—Selected

                   51, 52.) Do you think Paul's prohibition of a woman to teach

         Part 1        What does Hebrews 1:1, 2 state as to the internal unity of
      UNITY OF     the Scriptures?
     SCRIPTURE        "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our
                   fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken
                   to us by a Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things,
                   through whom also he created the world" (Heb. 1:1, 2, RSV).

                       Here the inspired writer of Hebrews asserts the basic unity
                   of the messages of God through the Old Testament prophets
                   and the New Testament testimony by (and concerning) His Son.
                       How does the Bible reveal varying characteristics and yet
                   display an underlying harmony?
                       "Written in different ages, by men who differed widely in
                   rank and occupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments,
                   the books of the Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well
                   as a diversity in the nature of the subjects unfolded. Different
                   forms of expression are employed by different writers; often
                   the same truth is more strikingly presented by one than by
                   another. And as several writers present a subject under varied
                   aspects and relations, there may appear, to the superficial, care-
                   less, or prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or contradiction,
                   where the thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer insight,
                   discerns the underlying harmony."—The Great Controversy, In-
                   troduction, p. vi.
                       Unity is not only a characteristic of the Bible. Jesus prayed
                   that His disciples might be one. (See John 17:21.) Paul wrote
                   to the members of the Corinthian church and said that they
                   should "all speak the same thing" (1 Cor. 1:10). Unity is god-
                   like, just as division is satanic.

THINK IT THROUGH      What do you do when you find what seem to be contradic-
                   tory statements in Scripture?

                      Failure to recognize the unity of the Scriptures has led some
                   scholars to attribute authorship of a book like Isaiah or Acts
                   to several different writers. They then judge the trustworthiness
                   of the several supposed writers and discard the portions they
                   view as untrustworthy.
                      What inspired counsel do we have on this question of
                   judging inspiration?

                      "When men, in their finite judgment, find it necessary to
                   go into an examination of scriptures to define that which is
                   inspired and that which is not, they have stepped before Jesus

                                                                           June 7

        Part 2        What counsel from the veteran apostle Paul to the young
 SOUND WORDS       minister Timothy suggests the value of sound principles of
                   interpretation of the Word?
                      "Follow the pattern of the sound words which you have
                   heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus;
                   guard the truth that has been entrusted to you by the Holy
                   Spirit who dwells within us" (2 Tim. 1:13, 14, RSV).
                      While Paul might have been using the expression "words"
                   here in the sense of teachings or doctrines (a major theme of
                   his letters to Timothy), it remains a fact that words are the
                   basic unit of human thought and communication, and thus any
                   sound pattern of doctrine is dependent upon a sound pattern of
                   words and their interpretation.
                       What evidence is there in Galatians 3:16 to show that Paul
                   is concerned about the exact wording of a passage?
                      What warning in Revelation 22:18, 19 points out the im-
                   portance of inspired words?
                      It is useful to remind ourselves of some basic facts about
                   words (especially Biblical words) so that we may avoid the
                   danger of placing undue emphasis on any one word:
                      1. Most persons studying this lesson are reading the Bible
                   in a translated form rather than in the original languages. So
                   don't make a big case of an English word—it is a translated
                   word and may not be 100 percent true to the original.
                      2. Words change in meaning. This is true of many words in
                   the King James Version which is more than 350 years old. Be
                   sure you understand the original intent of the word. For exam-
                   ple, "prevent" in 1 Thess. 4:15 means "precede," not "hinder."
                       3. Different Bible writers may not have exactly the same
                   meaning for any one word, and they may even use the same
                   word differently in different contexts. We all know that the same
                   word can have different meanings. For example, think of all
                   the meanings you know for the word "table."
                       "The Bible is not given to us in grand superhuman language.
                   Jesus, in order to reach man where he is, took humanity. The
                   Bible must be given in the language of men. Everything that
                   is human is imperfect. Different meanings are expressed by the
                   same word; there is not one word for each distinct idea. The
                   Bible was given for practical purposes."—Selected Messages,

        Part 3        How does the Bible differ materially from all secular
 WORDS OF LIFE     books?
                      "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they
                   are life" (John 6:63).
                       Jesus made no empty claim for His words when He said they
                   were spirit and life. They were not always easy to understand.
                   (See John 6:59, 60.) But they were the only words worth cling-
                   ing to, so that when some people left Jesus (verse 66), the
                   question was asked of the Twelve: "Will ye also go away?"
                   Then Peter, with his usual forthrightness and honesty, said,
                   "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal
                   life" (verse 68).
                       How important are God's words to every Christian? Matt.
                   4:4.
                      Man can live by bread alone if he lives on the level of an
                   animal, but man has been called to a higher way of life; he is
                   called to communion with God. Only as he communes with
                   God can he have that kind of a life that is exhilarating and full,
                   satisfying and eternal.
                      Fortunately for man, God's Word has not only been spoken; it
                   has been written. It is thus available at any time, in any place,
                   and can be used as armor against false understanding of life
                   and a wrong way of living.
                      How did Jesus use the words of.Scripture? Matt. 4:4, 7, 10.
                       "The study of God's word should take the place of the study
                   of those books that have led minds into mysticism and away
                   from the truth. Its living principles, woven into our lives, will be
                   our safeguard in trials and temptations; its divine instruction
                   is the only way to success."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 132.
                       Understanding God's Word involves understanding the whole
                   context of the Word. It is important to note that individual words
                   take on special significance because of the context. God speaks
                   to us in a language that is relevant to our environment. This is
                   why the Old Testament is different from the New, different in
                   language used, different in its background of history. We live
                   today in a new world. Yet the Word of God is always relevant
                   —that is, if we are prepared to study the Word in its particular
                   setting.
THINK IT THROUGH      In what sense are the Old and New Testaments different
                   and yet the same?

He Speaks, I Understand LESSON 11                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        June 9

          Part 4      What do we find Daniel doing as he-tries to understand the
INSPIRED INTER-    revelations made to him?
 PRETATIONS-1         "1 Daniel understood by books the number of the years,
                   whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet,
                   that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
                   Jerusalem" (Dan. 9:2).

                      Daniel often had the interpretations of his dreams and
                   visions given to him at the time they occurred. (See Dan. 7:16;
                   8:15-17.) But he did not always understand fully what he saw.
                   (See. Dan. 8:27; 12:8.) In his search for truth and understanding
                   he read the inspired books available to him, and thus he was
                   able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
                      This principle of comparing scripture with scripture is an
                   important one. The Word of God is a lamp to our feet, and a
                   light to our pathway (Ps. 119:105), so that when we are not sure
                   what one passage of Scripture means we look at another pas-
                   sage of contributory light. The unity of Scripture means that
                   every part of the Bible contributes to a logical understanding
                   of the whole, and we must guard against any interpretation
                   that leads to contradiction in teaching.

                       What does the apostle Peter tell us about singular interpre-
                   tations of Scripture? Why are they not valid? 2 Peter 1:20, 21.

                      The apostle Peter seems to be warning the church not to
                   treat the Scriptures as they might any other piece of writing,
                   whether literary, historical, legal, or scientific. "No prophecy
                   of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation" (RSV). Why
                   not? Because the Bible is not on the same level with any other
                   writing. Why not? Because it was written by men "moved by
                   the Holy Ghost."
                      How did Jesus demonstrate this method of interpreting by
                   drawing from various scriptures to explain an issue? (See
                   Luke 24:27.)

                       The Bible then becomes the "unerring standard" by which
                   the ideas of men are to be tested, rather than that the Scrip-
                   tures should be measured by philosophy, science, human tradi-
                   tion, or the religions of people outside the Bible. See The Min-
                   istry of Healing, p. 462.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it an advantage to have different Bible writers dis-
                   cussing the same subject, for example, the four Gospels? See

         Part 5       What are some of the characteristics of the Word of God?
INSPIRED INTER-

                   of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and inten-
                   tions of the heart" (Heb. 4:12, RSV).

                      "In the Bible we have the unerring counsel of God. Its teach-
                   ings, practically carried out, will fit men for any position of
                   duty. It is the voice of God speaking every day to the soul. How
                   carefully should the young study the word of God and treasure
                   up its sentiments in the heart, that its precepts may be made
                   to govern the whole conduct."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 441.
                      What prophecy indicates that God will communicate in a
                   special sense with young and old in the last days? Joel
                   2:28-32.

                       "In immediate connection with the scenes of the great day
                   of God, the Lord by the prophet Joel has promised a special
                   manifestation of His Spirit (Joel 2:28). This prophecy received
                   a partial fulfillment in the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day
                   of Pentecost; but it will reach its full accomplishment in the
                   manifestation of divine grace which will attend the closing work
                   of the gospel."—The Great Controversy, Introduction, p. ix.
                       "Lead the minds of the youth from truth to truth, up higher
                   and higher, showing them how scripture interprets scripture,
                   one passage being the key to other passages."—Evangelism,
                   p. 581.
                       "The Bible is its own expositor. One passage will prove to
                   be a key that will unlock other passages, and in this way light
                   will be shed upon the hidden meaning of the word."—Funda-

                      Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, how was
                   Peter led to interpret the prophecy of Joel? Acts 2:16-21.

                      How advantaged the Seventh-day Adventist Church is to
                   have a modern inspired interpreter of both the Old and New
                   Testaments! Surely there is every logical reason to give the
                   inspired interpretation top priority in arriving at our understand-
                   ing of the Word today.

THINK IT THROUGH       What sources of information would you consult in the
                   study of a particular passage of Scripture if it was not ex-
                   plained elsewhere in Scripture?

                   pret the Scriptures in the first instance?
   SCRIPTURES

                      "Bear in mind that our Lord's patience with us is our sal-
                   vation, as Paul, our friend and brother, said when he wrote
                   to you with his inspired wisdom. And so he does in all his
                   other letters, wherever he speaks of this subject, though they
                   contain some obscure passages, which the ignorant and un-
                   stable misinterpret to their own ruin, as they do the other
                   scriptures" (2 Peter 3:15, 16, NEB).

                       It is interesting to see how early in the history of the Chris-
                   tian church the interpretation or misinterpretation of the Scrip-
                   tures was a problem. Peter admits that some of the messages
                   written by his colleague, Paul, were not easy to understand.
                   But he goes on to say that the problem may have been more
                   with the interpreters than with the author. These same people,
                   and others like them, had a tendency to misinterpret not only
                   what Paul had written, but "other scriptures" also. They were
                   not strong members of the church in the first place, and per-
                   version of the Scriptures was one symptom of their instability.
                        Ignorance of the Word of God will leave us open to the
                   sophistries of Satan. Instability of character will cause us to
                   flit from one concept to another without rhyme or reason. It
                   is only God's grace that keeps us from error. Jesus prayed,
                   "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth" (John
                   17:17).

                     What was Paul's counsel regarding the Christian and the
                   Word? Col. 3:16, first part.


THINK IT THROUGH       Are sincerity and honesty sufficient safeguards against
                   false interpretations?

                       Can the wresting of the Scriptures by unsound principles
                   of interpretation involve the spirit of prophecy writings also?

                      "There are those who pick out from the Word of God, and
                   also from the Testimonies, detached paragraphs or sentences
                   that may be interpreted to suit their ideas, and they dwell upon
                   these, and build themselves up in their own positions, when

    "Therefore Eli said unto Samuel,
      Go, lie down: and it shall be,
    if he call thee, that thou shalt say,
       Speak, Lord; for thy servant

                                            The Lord had spoken to Eli by His
                                         prophets, warning him of the conse-

                                         his wayward sons. Because he in-
                                         dulged them even in high office,
                                         they had brought shame upon Eli,

                                         spoken. Eli had not responded. He
                                         heard with his ear, but no response

                                         heareth." The child Samuel heard
                                         with his heart and his ear. He re-

           Part 1      When Jesus was here in person, within one of His many
     HEARING AND    confrontations with the religious leaders of His time and peo-
                    ple, what assurance of eternal life did He offer?
       BELIEVING
                       "Verily, verily, 1 say unto you, He that heareth my word,
                    and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and
                    shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death
                    unto life" (John 5:24).

                        Many who heard Jesus' word, both on this occasion and
                    many others, received no benefit from His words. To others,
                    the same words brought the beginning of eternal life—heaven
                    began for them then and there. (See The Desire of Ages, p.
                    331.) The difference? Some heard and believed. Some only
                    heard.
                        The way in which I hear God, the quality of my hearing, will
                    be indicated in my response. The believing that is indicated
                    in the New Testament as the deciding factor in salvation must
                    be more than an intellectual belief, more than an unwilling ac-
                    knowledgment—for the devils believe, but they tremble with
                    fear (James 2:19). It is a belief of implicit trust, of unrestrained
                    acceptance, of a commitment without reservation.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the context of James' observation of the belief of
                    the devils? (See James 2:14-26.) What application does this
                    have to my faith? (Verse 24.)

                        It could be appropriate to contrast the faith of Abraham
                    (the chief exhibit in James 2) with that of Eli (referred to in
                    the introduction to this lesson). Could there be any connection
                    between the quality of the belief of the two fathers and the
                    contrasting obedience of Isaac on the one hand, and of Hophni
                    and Phinehas on the other? Our reverence for the words that
                    God has spoken in His Word, and by the spirit of prophecy (and
                    by His Spirit today in support of both) has such a bearing upon
                    the quality of our response, in belief and obedience.
                        "Faith is trusting God—believing that He loves us and
                    knows best what is for our good. Thus, instead of our own, it
                    leads us to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it ac-
                    cepts His wisdom; in place of our weakness, His strength; in
                    place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves,
                    are already His; faith acknowledges His ownership and accepts
                    its blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, have been pointed out
                    as secrets of life's success. It is faith that puts us in possession
                    of these principles."—Education, p. 253.

                   low me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never
                   perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand"
                   (John 10:27, 28).
                      We have all heard of the man who assured the Lord he
                   would go anywhere in the world that the Lord would lead, as
                   long as it was not— (and he named a certain continent). Was
                   that man a true hearer of Christ's word?
                      How close and intimate and involved is the relationship
                   between the Good Shepherd and His sheep! Jesus parallels that
                   closeness with the closeness between Himself and His Father.

THINK IT THROUGH      Even if I have been disowned and denounced by my own
                   family, have I reason to feel unknown and unwanted in this
                   world? (See John 10:3, 4.)
                      Note that the Eastern shepherd moved out ahead of his few
                   sheep. They followed him. What a contrast to the dog-assisted
                   herdsmen who drive large flocks of sheep ahead of themselves
                   today. The life of the shepherd was governed by the needs of
                   his sheep. He lived their life. Their every need was his to fulfill.
                      Is our response to God's Word so childlike (so sheeplike)
                   that we are prepared to follow His leading no matter how
                   narrow or how steep the path He chooses for us? What con-
                   solation is there in the Word for the lonely, the sorrowing, the
                   sick, the discouraged, whether they be young or old?
                      "It is not the fear of punishment, or the hope of everlasting
                   reward, that leads the disciples of Christ to follow Him. They
                   behold the Saviour's matchless love, revealed throughout His
                   pilgrimage on earth, from the manger of Bethlehem to Calvary's
                   cross, and the sight of Him attracts, it softens and subdues the

         Part 3       What two common human characteristics are described in
       HEARING     the parable of the two sons?
     AND DOING         "But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he
                   came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vine-
                   yard. He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he
                   repented, and went. And he came to the second, and said
                   likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not"
                   (Matt. 21:28-30).
                       These two sons are so human, so much like us—especially
                   the one who said, "I go, sir: and went not."
                       Apparently it is not what we say but what we do that counts.
                   It has been said that the road to hell is paved with good in-
                   tentions. Thank God we can always change our minds and do
                   what is right. But we must not leave it until too late. It may be
                   better late than never, but it is always better never late.
                      What counsel does James give regarding hearing and
                   doing? James 1:22-25.
                      "The most eloquent sermon that can be preached upon the
                   law of Ten Commandments is to do them. . . .
                      "In order to gain a proper knowledge of ourselves, it is nec-
                   essary look into the mirror, and there discovering our own
                   defects, avail ourselves of the blood of Christ, the fountain
                   opened for sin and uncleanness, in which we may wash our
                   robes of character and remove the stains of sin. But many refuse
                   to see their errors and correct them; they do not want a true
                   knowledge of themselves."—Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 58, 59.
THINK IT THROUGH      Would you say that doers of the word are inside the church,
                   and non-doers are outside? In what sense may members also
                   be non-doers?
                       "There are only two classes in the world today, and only
                   two classes will be recognized in the judgment—those who
                   violate God's law and those who obey it."—Christ's Object
                   Lessons, p. 283.
                       "God requires that all of us should be self-sacrificing work-
                   ers. Every part of the truth has a practical application to our
                   daily lives. Blessed are they that hear the word of the Lord
                   and keep it. Hearing is not enough; we must act, we must do.
                   It is in the doing of the commandments that there is great re-
                   ward. Those who give practical demonstrations of their benev-
                   olence by their sympathy and compassionate acts toward the
                   poor, the suffering, and the unfortunate, not only relieve the
                   sufferers, but contribute largely to their own happiness and are
                   in the way of securing health of soul and body."—Testimonies,

He Speaks, I Respond         LESSON 12                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        June 16

         Part 4       A rich young man heard the words of Jesus and watched
  HEARING AND      Him in His ministry. His heart was touched. He had heard, he
                   had believed (in a measure). Now he wanted to follow. He felt
    GIVING ALL     that he had been doing right—but this was not enough.
                      What are among the saddest words in the Bible describing
                   a man's decision?
                     "But when the young man heard that saying, he went
                   away sorrowful: for he had great possessions" (Matt. 19:22).
                      Under the questioning of Jesus, this rich young ruler felt
                   sure that he was doing all that could legitimately be required
                   of him: "All these things have I kept from my youth up: what
                   lack I yet?" (verse 20).
                      It is perhaps commendable that the young man felt some
                   kind of lack which Jesus could fill, and yet he could hardly
                   admit any defect in himself. Jesus put His finger on the plague
                   spot in this man's character in asking him to put what he had
                   heard God say above every other consideration. In the person
                   of the poor, he was asked to make God supreme, to do all that
                   God asked—without reservation.
                      What is the basis of all giving? Matt. 10:8, last part.
                       "The lesson is no less needed in the world today than when
                   it fell from the lips of Jesus. Selfishness and cold formality
                   have well-nigh extinguished the fire of love, and dispelled the
                   graces that should make fragrant the character. Many who
                   profess His name have lost sight of the fact that Christians are
                   to represent Christ. Unless there is practical self-sacrifice for
                   the good of others, in the family circle, in the neighborhood, in
                   the church, and wherever we may be, then whatever our profes-
                   sion, we are not Christians."—The Desire of Ages, p. 504.
THINK IT THROUGH      Why do many people hold on to their wealth? Is wealth a
                   blessing or a curse?

                       "To those who, like the young ruler, are in high positions of
                   trust and have great possessions, it may seem too great a
                   sacrifice to give up all in order to follow Christ. But this is the
                   rule of conduct for all who would become His disciples. Nothing
                   short of obedience can be accepted. Self-surrender is the sub-
                   stance of the teachings of Christ. Often it is presented and
                   enjoined in language that seems authoritative, because there is
                   no other way to save man than to cut away those things which,
                   if entertained, will demoralize the whole being."—The Desire

He Speaks, I Respond LESSON 12                                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                         June 17

         Part 5      Where must Christ's words be if we are to have all our
   HEARING AND     material and spiritual needs supplied?
       ABIDING        "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall
                   ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you" (John 15:7).
                      Perhaps no more simple yet adequate illustration of the
                   quality of hearing which Christ and the Father require of the
                   believing, converted sinner can be found than that in the alle-
                   gory of the vine and its branches. The hearing results in an
                   abiding relationship between the branches, who are the be-
                   lievers, and the True Vine, which is Christ.
                       "Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your
                   very first work. Let your prayer be, 'Take me, 0 Lord, as wholly
                   Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy ser-
                   vice. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.'
                   This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself to God
                   for that day..Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out
                   or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day
                   you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus
                   your life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ."
                   —Steps to Christ, p. 70.

THINK IT THROUGH       What promise is made to those who abide in Christ? How
                   is God glorified in the Christian?

                       Note that the branches are not commanded to bear fruit.
                   They are urged to "abide." The Vine and the Father-Husband-
                   man (John 15:1, 2) will provide the life and care for the fruit-
                   fulness.
                       "This spiritual relation [of abiding in Christ] can be estab-
                   lished only by the exercise of personal faith. This faith must
                   express on our part supreme preference, perfect reliance, en-
                   tire consecration. Our will must be wholly yielded to the divine
                   will, our feelings, desires, interests, and honor identified with
                   the prosperity of Christ's kingdom and the honor of His cause,
                   we constantly receiving grace from Him, and Christ accepting
                   gratitude from us."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 229.
                       "It is through the word that Christ abides in His followers.
                   This is the same vital union that is represented by eating His
                   flesh and drinking His blood. The words of Christ are spirit and
                   life. Receiving them, you receive the life of the Vine. You live
                   'by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.' Matt.
                   4:4. The life of Christ in you produces the same fruits as in
                   Him. Living in Christ, adhering of Christ, supported by Christ,
                   drawing nourishment from Christ, you bear fruit after the simili-
                   tude of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 677.

                                                                          June 18

        Part 6        One of the greatest evidences of having heard and re-
  HEARING AND      sponded to the God who speaks is in the hearer's urge to pass
                   on to others the gracious invitation he has received from
     INVITING      heaven, to participate with the Holy Spirit and the church in
                   the vital work of witnessing:

                      "'Come!' say the Spirit and the bride.

                      "'Come!' let each hearer reply" (Rev. 22:17, NEB).

                      It is impossible to separate the acceptance of salvation from
                   a paralleling sense of mission. The heart and mind that have
                   heard God's loving message are constrained to share the
                   "good news." (See 2 Cor. 5:13, 14.) To put it another way, he
                   who has no sense of constraint or urgency upon him to share
                   the gospel message and experience may need to take stock, to
                   see whether he is still "abiding" in the Vine—whether the words
                   of Christ are abiding in him.
                       If the old adage, "The proof of the pudding is in the eating"
                   is still true, then the manner in which the believer responds to
                   God's speaking is indicative of the manner in which he is
                   hearing. It is not just a casual invitation to others that comes
                   from the one who is truly hearing. He is so intertwined with
                   the work of the Holy Spirit in and through the church that he
                   makes his appeals in the power of the Holy Spirit—he appeals
                   as Christ would appeal in person.
                      What is an essential prerequisite for effective witnessing?
                   Acts 1:8.

                     "The gospel commission is the great missionary charter of
                   Christ's kingdom. The disciples were to work earnestly for
                   souls, giving to all the invitation of mercy. They were not to
                   wait for the people to come to them; they were to go to the
                   people with their message."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 28.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is involved in witnessing besides distributing litera-
                   ture and ringing doorbells?

                      "The Saviour knew that no argument, however logical,
                   would melt hard hearts or break through the crust of worldli-
                   ness and selfishness. He knew that His disciples must receive
                   the heavenly endowment; that the gospel would be effective
                   only as it was proclaimed by hearts made warm and lips made
                   eloquent by a living knowledge of Him who is the way, the
                   truth, and the life."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 31.

                                          is needful to our eternal salvation.
                                             The brief glimpses into Edenic
                                          conditions afforded us by the Bible
                                          and the spirit of prophecy writings
                                          are limited enough at best. To at-
                                          tempt to enlarge upon them could
                                          lead only into speculation and per-

                                          if we do not receive the revelation
                                          of God which has been offered us
                                          here and now, we shall never have
                                           the present dimness removed. To
                                           him who rejects the flickering, sput-

of the original face-to-face revela-

     This is not said to discourage us

          Part 1      At the heart of man's tragic rebellion against God, what
                   sad picture does Genesis give of man's broken relationship
      MAN HIDES
                   with God?
       FROM GOD
                      "The man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God
                   walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze and
                   hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden" (Gen.
                   3:8, NEB).
                      Man running away from God! What more tragic picture could
                   be painted. Man fleeing from his Maker, pathetically trying to
                   hide among the trees from Him who made them both, man and
                   tree. As we have studied the revelation of God, we have re-
                   peatedly looked at the beginning and then at the day of restora-
                   tion. In this week's lesson on seeing God face-to-face we go
                   back to the beginning again, and forward to the end of sin and
                   the restoration of Eden.
                      How are the wicked going to react in the day of God's
                   wrath? Rev. 6:15-17.

                      "The sinner could not be happy in God's presence; he would
                   shrink from the companionship of holy beings. Could he be
                   permitted to enter heaven, it would have no joy for him. The
                   spirit of unselfish love that reigns there—every heart respond-
                   ing to the heart of Infinite Love—would touch no answering
                   chord in his soul. . . . It is no arbitrary decree on the part of
                   God that excludes the wicked from heaven: they are shut out
                   by their own unfitness for its companionship. The glory of
                   God would be to them a consuming fire. They would welcome
                   destruction, that they might be hidden from the face of Him who
                   died to redeem them."—Steps to Christ, pp. 17, 18.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the motivating force behind the desire to see God
                   face-to-face?

                      But there is more to the restoration of the face-to-face rela-
                   tionship than the desire of the redeemed to worship God in
                   person. The apostle Paul draws an illustration from the mirrors
                   used before the modern invention of glass. The ancients used
                   polished metal surfaces for mirrors and at times these would
                   be bent or their surfaces marred. Then the image would be dis-
                   torted, indistinct, blurred. Right now, because of the veil and
                   separation of sin, our understanding of God's self-revelation
                   is only partial, the reflections of Him are as those in an ancient
                   mirror—sometimes even puzzling. But in the face-to-face res-
                   toration, there will be no more distortion. Praise the Lord!

        Part 2       How complete has been the veiling of God the Father from
   NO MAN HAS      man as a consequence of sin?
     SEEN GOD         "No one has ever seen God; but God's only Son, he who
                   is nearest to the Father's heart, he has made him known"
                   (John 1:18, NEB).
                      John is saying that no one has seen God the Father. "Sin-
                   ners cannot see God face-to-face and live. Not even Moses,
                   the great lawgiver of Israel, was permitted to behold Him (Ex.
                   33:20; Deut. 4:12). . . . Christ came to reveal the Father, and,
                   for all practical purposes, those who saw Him saw the Father
                   (John14:7-11)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on John 1:18.
                      "In all these revelations of the divine presence the glory of
                   God was manifested through Christ. Not alone at the Saviour's
                   advent, but through all the ages after the Fall and the promise
                   of redemption, 'God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
                   Himself.' 2 Corinthians 5:19. . . . Since the sin of our first par-
                   ents there has been no direct communication between God and
                   man. The Father has given the world into the hands of Christ,
                   that through His mediatorial work He may redeem man and vin-
                   dicate the authority and holiness of the law of God."—Patri-
                   archs and Prophets, p. 366.
                       "God sent His Son into the world, His divinity clothed with
                   humanity, that man might bear the image of the invisible God.
                   He made known in His words, His character, His power and
                   majesty, the nature and attributes of God. Divinity flashed
                   through humanity in softening subduing light. He was the em-
                    bodiment of the law of God, which is the transcript of His char-
                   acter."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 5, p. 1131.
THINK IT THROUGH       What do we miss, if anything, by seeing the Father through
                   the Son?
                      Perhaps we have not considered as we ought the sadness
                   which man's sin has brought to God. Made "in the image of
                   God" and designed to reflect back to God His own glory, man
                   has placed an anguished interval, a sad delay, in the fulfillment
                   of this divine purpose. We think and talk a great deal of the
                   sufferings of Christ and the constant ministry of the Holy Spirit.
                   Do we ever think of the loneliness of God the Father—loneliness
                   for His children?
                       "The knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is the knowl-
                   edge that all who are saved must have. It is the knowledge that
                   works transformation of character. This knowledge, received,
                   will re-create the soul in the image of God. It will impart to the

         Part 3      Was Philip aware of the veil between man and the Father?
   SHOW US THE     What response did he receive to his request?
       FATHER
                      "Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it
                   sufficeth' us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time
                   with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that
                   hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then,
                   Shew us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father,
                   and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I
                   speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he
                   doeth the works" (John 14:8-10).

                      The reply of Jesus to Philip suggests that Philip should not
                   have needed to make the request to see the Father. Why did
                   Philip make the response he did to Jesus' statement of verse 7?
                   Was it mere curiosity? Did it reveal a misunderstanding of the
                   mission of Jesus? Apparently Philip was thinking, as so many
                   others do, that there was a difference of some kind between
                   the Father and the Son. Philip and the other disciples had seen
                   Jesus; now they thought it would be enlightening to see the
                   Father. They had failed to recognize, in spite of years of close
                   association, that in seeing Jesus they were seeing God in
                   action.
                      It is Satan who has succeeded in blinding so many people
                   about God the Father. "The enemy of good blinded the minds
                   of men, so that they looked upon God with fear; they thought
                   of Him as severe and unforgiving. Satan led men to conceive
                   of God as a being whose chief attribute is stern justice,—one
                   who is a severe judge, a harsh, exacting creditor. He pictured
                   the Creator as a being who is watching with jealous eye to
                   discern the errors and mistakes of men, that He may visit judg-
                   ments upon them. It was to remove this dark shadow, by reveal-
                   ing to the world the infinite love of God, that Jesus came to live
                   among men."—Steps to Christ, pp. 10, 11.

THINK IT THROUGH      When in heaven we see God face-to-face, what attributes
                   of His do we expect to see that we cannot see now through
                   Christ?

                      In reality, the entire ministry of Jesus, as the "sent of God"
                   was a continual face-to-face revelation of God to men, only
                   His glory being laid aside, that man might endure the revelation.
                   In character and purpose men had seen God the Father in His
                   Son.

         Part 4       From the Old Testament poem on the experiences of Job,
       I SHALL     what ringing assurance comes to us of the face-to-face con-
                   frontation with God at the end of the age?
       SEE GOD
                      "For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall
                   stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my
                   skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see
                   God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold,
                   and not another" (Job 19:25-27).

                      Job gives us one of the most positive assurances of the
                   resurrection to be found in Scripture. He also declares in posi-
                   tive terms that God is his redeemer (verse 25). In spite of some
                   difficulties in the Hebrew text, so that English versions vary
                   somewhat, the hope of the resurrection is clearly declared, and
                   in the fulfillment of that hope Job expects to "see God."
                       "One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths re-
                   vealed in the Bible is that of Christ's second coming to com-
                   plete the great work of redemption. To God's pilgrim people,
                   so long left to sojourn in 'the region and shadow of death,' a
                   precious, joy-inspiring hope is given in the promise of His
                   appearing, who is 'the resurrection and the life,' to 'bring home
                   again His banished.' The doctrine of the second advent is the
                   very keynote of the Sacred Scriptures."—The Great Contro-
                   versy, p. 299.

THINK IT THROUGH       What experience must the Christian pass through in order
                   to appreciate the hope of the resurrection?

                      "The Cross Lifts.—We are to lift the cross, and follow the
                   steps of Christ. Those who lift the cross will find that as they
                   do this, the cross lifts them, giving them fortitude and courage,
                   and pointing them to the Lamb of God, who taketh away the
                   sin of the world....
                      "Up From the Lowlands.—The cross lifts you up from the
                   lowlands of earth, and brings you into sweetest communion
                   with God. Through bearing the cross your experience may be
                   such that you can say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," and
                   because He lives, I shall live also.' What an assurance is this!"

                   1095.
                      As the glitter of this world's attractions yield to the tarnishing
                   of "last day" conditions, the redeemed need more frequently
                   and more earnestly to remind themselves of the awaited reality
                   of the bodily resurrection and of the reunion of man and his
                   God. The most effective of the senses will be prominently in-
                   volved; with our eyes we shall see God.

          Part 5     The Lord has given some descriptions of heaven and the
    THEY SHALL     new earth that sound realistic and appealing, even to men of
                   means. But surely as the daily walk and talk with God grows
   SEE HIS FACE    and deepens, does not the supreme objective of the redeemed
                   become the coveted opportunity to see God?
                     The triumphal assurance of the last chapter of the Bible is:

                      "And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in
                   their foreheads" (Rev. 22:4).

                       The expression suggests closeness of contact, a highly per-
                   sonal and intimate relationship. And that is what is planned
                   for the redeemed.
                       Some may now think of a list of questions they would wish
                   to present to the Lord at their earliest face-to-face meeting. For
                   those who perhaps have walked most closely with the Lord
                   here, however, just to see His face, just to be in His presence
                   will be the supreme joy—the source of perfect contentment.
                   They can think of nothing better, nothing more desirable.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why will it be my supreme joy and interest to see God
                   face-to-face?

                      "Then much will be revealed in explanation of matters upon
                   which God now keeps silence because we have not gathered
                   up and appreciated that which has been made known of the
                   eternal mysteries. . . . We shall see order in that which has
                   seemed unexplainable; wisdom in everything withheld; good-
                   ness and gracious mercy in everything imparted. . . . Contro-

                      "All the perplexities of life's experience will then be made
                   plain. Where to us have appeared only confusion and disap-
                   pointment, broken purposes and thwarted plans, will be seen
                   a grand, overruling, victorious purpose, a divine harmony.
                      "There all who have wrought with unselfish spirit will behold
                   the fruit of their labors. The outworking of every right principle

                   now are, in character and holy service, is the sure foreshadow-
                   ing of what we shall be."—Education, p. 307.

        Part 6            The ills we see,
                     The mysteries of sorrow deep and long.
  "COME, LORD
                     The dark enigmas of permitted wrong,
      JESUS!"             Have all one key;
                     This strange, sad world is but our Father's school;
                     All chance and change His love shall overrule.
                          What though today
                     Thou canst not trace at all the hidden reason
                     For His strange dealings through the trial season?
                          Trust and obey;
                     In after life and light all shall be plain and clear.

                      What prayer of John's may also be ours as we contrast
                   what we have in this world with what we can have in the
                   earth made new?
                      "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20, NEB).
                      This was John the Beloved's response to the promise of the
                   loving Lord, "Surely I am coming soon" (RSV).
                      God is there. He is not silent. He is the God who speaks. He
                   has spoken in all His mighty works of the creation and sustain-
                   ing of the universe. He has spoken through prophets and apos-
                   tles. He spoke supremely in His Son who leaned so com-
                   pletely upon the Spirit and the Father. He speaks to us by His
                   Spirit through the Word and the spirit of prophecy.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways can I listen, hear, interpret, and respond
                   so that my constant heartfelt plea shall be: Come, Lord Jesus?

                        When the day dawns—that other long, long day,
                            When night beyond our ken has passed,
                            When home and rest are reached at last—
                     I think, perchance, that we shall say,
                      The toil but makes more sweet the rest.
                            And sorrow was not spent in vain,
                            If patient strength be learned through pain;
                      And we shall see His way was best.

                     Then hush! oh, hush! for the Father,
                           Whose ways are true and just,
                     Knoweth and careth and loveth,
                           And waits for thy perfect trust;
                      The cup He is slowly filling, shall soon be filled to the brim,
                      And infinite compensations forever be found in Him.
