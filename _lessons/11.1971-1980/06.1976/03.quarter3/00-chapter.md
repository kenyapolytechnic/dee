Dear Sabbath School Members,

These lines penned in 1975 may be even more significant when you read
them in mid-1976 for everything taking place in the world today empha-
sizes the urgency of our mission. Open doors are gently swinging, and
who knows where or when they may shut, and another area will be closed
to the preaching of the gospel of Jesus' love.

The three projects in the Far Eastern Division to benefit from the Thir-
teenth Sabbath Offering overflow this quarter have been selected because
they are urgent needs in areas of great growth potential.

1. Relocation of East Visayan Academy. This academy in the Central
   Philippine Union serves a large constituency, but is totally
   incapable of meeting the expanding needs of the heavily populated
   area and must be relocated. A new site has been chosen, and re-
   location of the school will solve some critical problems and pro-
   vide more adequate facilities for the youth.

2. Jungle Airstrips. Travel by light plane cuts days and weeks down
   to minutes and hours and vastly enlarges the range of mission ac-
   tivity. The five planes now in operation rely heavily on jungle
   airstrips. New strips and improvement of the old ones are very
   urgently needed.

3. Entering New Territories. From among many, three have been chosen:
   The primitive tribes of the Central Celebes, including the tree
   dwellers who are just now awakening to the appeal of the gospel
   and calling for help; the tribal people of northeastern Mindanao,
   who through a series of events have learned of Seventh-day
   Adventists and want to know more; and the island of Lombok in
   Indonesia. Years ago our message penetrated the island, but did
   not take root. Now we must try again.

Thank you, friends, for your loyal support and sacrificial giving in the
past and thank you, too, for your love which prompts you to give to a
cause which will soon triumph because of your devotion to it.

Your brother in Christ,



W. T. Clark, Secretary
Far Eastern Division

                  NURTURING FAITH IN JESUS
                           Studies in the Book of Hebrews
                       •              Introduction
   The book of Hebrews clearly sets forth the claim of Christianity as the perfect and
final form of religious belief. Christianity is superior because it is embodied in Jesus
Christ. He was superior to Moses, the prophets, and even the angels. The history and
worship of the Old Testament find their meaning and fulfillment in Him. One of the
book's distinctive teachings is that Christ is now our great High Priest. While other
New Testament writers picture Christ as exalted at God's right hand, and even refer to
His intercessory work (Rom. 8:34), nowhere else is Christ's work as a high priest in the
heavenly sanctuary portrayed.
   The book of Hebrews is usually called an epistle, but it lacks the features with which
ancient letters began. It does, however, end like a letter with its personal notes, •
greetings, and benediction.
   In Hebrews 13:22, RSV, the book is called "my word of exhortation." Among the
Jews "word of exhortation" seems to have been a synagogue term for the homily that
followed the reading of "the law and the prophets." So the book of Hebrews would
then be a written sermon; and, since it was sent to a specific group of believers, it is
understandable that it should close on a personal note. The emphasis in the book on
speaking and hearing (see 2:1, 5; 5:11; 6:9; 11:32) suggests that it was designed to be
read aloud to a Christian congregation assembled for worship.
   The original readers of the epistle were Hebrews. (See Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 623.)
The internal evidence of the document indicates that a particular group of Jewish
Christians is being addressed. In "former days" they had endured abuse, affliction,
and the plundering of their property for their faith. (See Heb. 10:32-34.) It is clear that
the writer had previously visited their community (13:19) and hoped to revisit them
soon (13:23).
   Who was the author? The epistle does not give his name, but Paul has been
traditionally regarded as the author. However, from early Christian times until the
present there has been strong opposition to attributing the epistle to Paul. The
literary differences between Hebrews and the books known to be written by Paul
support this opposition. However, these differences could have resulted from
Timothy, or another of Paul's colaborers doing the actual writing at Paul's direction
or by writing down his sermon. Ellen G. White, in alluding to passages from Hebrews,
repeatedly attributes them to Paul. For example, see The Great Controversy, pp. 411,
415, 420.
   These believers were in grave danger of giving up their Christian faith and reverting
 to the Jewish beliefs. Evidently they did not yet fully understand the nature of true
Christianity, but they had experienced ostracism from their former friends and rel-
atives, and severe persecution. In spite of this it was difficult for them to make a
 complete break with their Jewish past. What they needed was to see clearly the
incomparable superiority of Christianity as the climax and fulfillment of the Old
Testament.
   The book of Hebrews also has a vital message for the Christian today. It particularly
 challenges us to consider Christ's intercessory work in our behalf. It provides access
 to the throne of the universe. There are unlimited resources of grace and power
 available through our High Priest at God's right hand. The importance of this in-
 tercession is highlighted by the following paragraph:
   "God's appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit. The throne of
 grace is itself the highest attraction because occupied by One who permits us to call
 Him Father. But God did not deem the principle of salvation complete while invested
 only with His own love. By His appointment He had placed at His altar an Advocate
 clothed with our nature. As our Intercessor, His office work is to introduce us to God
 as His sons and daughters."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 363.

                                                                           June 27
            Part 1   What contrasts are drawn in the epistle to the Hebrews at
         OVER THE the very outset between God's past revelations and His rev-
         PROPHETS elation through Christ?

                      "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in
                    time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last
                    days spoken unto us by his Son" (Heb. 1:1, 2).

                        Christianity is a revealed religion. It teaches that there is a
                    God, and that He has communicated with mankind. God, in His
                    grace, has not left sinful man to his fate. Rather He has taken the
                    initiative in making His will and His redemptive plans known to
                    sinful human beings. God has spoken. The epistle to the
                    Hebrews begins with this profound truth.
                        The mouthpiece through whom God spoke in ancient times
                    was the prophet (Amos 3:7), to whom the word of the Lord
                    came. (See 1 Sam. 3:7; 2 Sam. 7:4; 1 Kings 17:1, 2, 8; Jer. 1:4, 11,
                    etc.) There have been prophets in the world from the earliest
                    times since the Fall. (See Luke 1:70; Acts 3:21.) God spoke "by
                    [literally, in] the prophets" "at sundry times and in divers
                    manners," literally, "in many portions and in different ways."
                    "In many portions" suggests the progressive nature of reve-
                    lation. It was given in progressive stages to such persons as
                    Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Samuel, and other prophets. It
                    came in fragmentary and incomplete forms. Furthermore the
                    disclosure came in a variety of ways. But whatever method was
                    employed, it is important to remember that it was God who
                    spoke. God still speaks through His ancient prophets by their
                    written messages in the Bible. "Every chapter and every verse of
                    the Bible is a communication from God to men."—Pafriarchs
                    and Prophets, p. 504.

                      What complete and final revelation has been given in
                    Christian times? Heb. 1:2, first part. (Compare Matt. 11:27;
                    John 1:18.)

                        The phrase "in these last days" means "at the last of these
                    days." The writers of the New Testament adopted this Old
                    Testament phrase and applied it to the age of Messianic ful-
                    fillment which began with the coming of Jesus Christ to
                    Bethlehem. It is the age of the Messiah. (Compare Heb. 9:26,
                    RSV.) In this age, the writer says, God has spoken to us by His
                    Son, His latest word of revelation.

                      "Whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also
                    he made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory"
                    (Heb. 1:2, 3).

                       1."Appointed heir of all things." This refers to the promise to
                    the Lord's anointed in Psalm 2:8 that He would inherit the
                    nations and the uttermost parts of the earth. The words of verse
                    7 in Psalm 2 are applied to Christ in Hebrews 1:5. All that Adam
                    once possessed and lost Christ won back through His
                    atonement. When His work was completed it could well be said:
                    "He had won the kingdom. He had wrested it from Satan and
                    had become heir of all things."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 29.
                    The inheritance encompasses also "the world to come" (Heb.
                    2:5).
                       2. "By whom also he made the worlds." Compare Col. 1:16;
                    John 1:3. The work of creation was carried out by Jesus Christ.
                    The Greek for "worlds" means primarily "ages," but here as in
                    Hebrews 11:3 it denotes the whole universe of space and time.
                    Ellen G. White concludes: "If Christ made all things, He existed
                    before all things. . . . Christ was God essentially, and in the
                    highest sense. He was with God from all eternity, God over all,
                    blessed for evermore."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 247.
                       3."The brightness of his glory." "Brightness" is used in the
                    active sense of radiance or outshining. The term "glory"
                    suggests the visible force of God's self-manifestation. But when
                    Moses requested, "I beseech thee, shew me thy glory," God
                    responded by proclaiming the glorious attributes of His
                    character. (See Ex. 33:18, 19.) This suggests that God's "glory"
                    also includes His character. It was this aspect of God that Jesus
                    radiated while on earth. "The glory of the attributes of God is
                    expressed in His [Christ's] character."—Christ's Object
                    Lessons, p. 115. But since Christ's exaltation at God's right
                    hand, the visible manifestation of the Son's glory is not hidden,
                    just as prior to the incarnation.

 THINK IT THROUGH     "No intangible principle, no impersonal essence or mere
                    abstraction, can satisfy the needs and longings of human be-
                    ings in this life of struggle with sin and sorrow and pain. It is not
                    enough to believe in law and force, in things that have no pity,
                    and never hear the cry for help. We need to know of an almighty
                    arm that will hold us up, of an infinite Friend that pities us. We
                    need to clasp a hand that is warm, to trust in a heart full of
                    tenderness."—Education, p. 133.

                         1. "The express image of his person." Christ as the RSV
                      renders it, "bears the very stamp of his [God's] nature." "He
                      [Christ] represented God not as an essence that pervaded
                      nature, but as a God who has a personality. Christ was the
                      express image of His Father's person; and He came to our world
                      to restore in man God's moral image, in order that man, . . .
                      might through obedience to God's commandments become

                      his power" means His powerful word. "He upholds the universe
                      not like Atlas supporting a dead weight on his shoulders, but as

                      atoning death on the cross. (See Heb. 9:22.) By virtue of this
                      death He has forgiven the sins of all who accept Him by faith.
                         4. Installation at God's right hand. Following His ascension,
                      Christ was inaugurated as Priest-King at God's right hand.
                      "Majesty" is a name for God. (See Eph. 1:20-23; 1 Peter 3:22.)
                         "When Christ passed within the heavenly gates, He was
                      enthroned amidst the adoration of the angels. As soon as this
                      ceremony was completed the Holy Spirit descended upon the

The Superiority of Christ       LESSON 1                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    June 30

         Part 4   "Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
       OVER THE inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they" (Heb.
       ANGELS—I 1:4).



                     The Son was originally superior to the angels, but at the
                   incarnation He "for a little while was made lower than the
                   angels" (Heb. 2:9, RSV). Now that He is exalted at God's right
                   hand, He has become much superior to the angels. Seven
                   passages are now quoted to show a number of ways in which
                   this is the case. The first, in Hebrews 1:5, deals with Christ as
                   God's Son.
                     "God has spoken words concerning Christ that are not to be
                   applied to the angels."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 7, p. 922. Although angels collectively may be
                   called "sons of God" (Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7), no individual angel is
                   ever singled out and given the status of God's Soh.
                     The first quotation in Hebrews 1:5 is taken from Psalm 2:7.
                   The question readily comes to mind, What justification is there
                   for applying the words of the second psalm to Jesus Christ?
                   While the psalm doubtless had a historical application to
                   Solomon or to another king descended from David, the
                   greatness of its language can hardly have its meaning
                   exhausted in any Jewish monarch. This song of the Lord's
                   anointed has been widely recognized, even by the Jews, as
                   referring to the Messiah. It is quoted with reference to a sup-
                   posed Messiah in falsely named "Psalms of Solomon," indi-
                   cating that some Jews regarded it as Messianic as early as the
                   middle of the first century, BC. The angel Gabriel, in announc-
                   ing to Mary that she was to be the mother of the Messiah, alludes
                   to this text. (See Luke 1:32.) At the baptism of our Lord a voice
                   from heaven exclaimed in similar language, "Thou art my
                   beloved Son" (Mark 1:11). The two great apostles, Peter and
                   Paul, applied this psalm to the Messiah. (See Acts 4:25, 27;
                   13:33.) Finally, words from the psalm are used of Jesus in the
                   book of Revelation. (See Rev. 12:5; 19:15.)
                       The second quotation in Hebrews 1:5 is taken from Second
                   Samuel 7:14. Later writers of the Old Testament recognized that
                   the promise there given did not find its complete fulfillment in
                   Solomon. Hence they looked forward to a greater son of David
                   to come in whom the promise would find its complete ful-
                   fillment. (See Isa. 9:7; 11:1; Jer. 33:17, 20, 21.) Note Peter's
                    interpretation of Psalm 16:8-11 in Acts 2:29-33.

             Part 5     What command regarding Christ is now given?
          OVER THE
         ANGELS—II      "And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the
                      world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him"
                      (Heb. 1:6).

                          A further contrast between Christ and the angels is now
                      drawn. Angels are not proper objects of worship (Rev. 19:10;
                      22:9), but Christ is, and the angels are here commanded to
                      worship Him. The word "again" is not a reference to the second
                      advent, as some have thought, but simply introduces another
                      quotation dealing with Christ's preeminence. "He is called 'the
                      firstborn' because He exists before all creation and because all
                      creation is His heritage."—F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the
                      Hebrews. The New International Commentary on the New
                      Testament, p. 15. (See also Ps. 89:27.)
                          The last part of Hebrews 1:6, "And let all the angels of God
                      worship him," is quoted from Deuteronomy 32:43 in the
                      Septuagint. There it reads: "Rejoice, ye heavens, with him, and
                      let all the angels of God worship him; rejoice ye Gentiles, with
                      his people, and let all the sons of God strengthen themselves in
                      him."
                         •The clause, "and let all the angels of God worship him," is not
                      in Deuteronomy 32:43 of the Hebrew Bible, and thus not in our
                      Bibles that have been translated from Hebrew. The Septuagint
                      is the Greek translation of the Old Testament generally used by
                      the New Testament writers. The Old Testament quotations in
                      the book of Hebrews are from the Septuagint.
                          The time when this command to worship Christ was ap-
                      propriately given was following His ascension and the ac-
                      ceptance of His atonement for man.
                          Ellen G. White observes that the angels were "eager to
                      celebrate His triumph and to glorify their King.
                          "But He waves them back. Not yet; He cannot now receive the
                      coronet of glory and the royal robe."—The Desire of Ages, p.
                      834.
                          Not until Jesus is fully assured that His sacrifice has been
                      accepted and the justice of God regarding repentant sinners is
                      satisfied can He accept such honors. But then "the Father's
                      arms encircle His Son, and the word is given, 'Let all the angels
                      of God worship Him.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 834.
                          "The heavenly host prostrate themselves before Him, and
                      raise their song of triumph and joy. Glory encircles the King of
                      heaven, and was beheld by all the heavenly intelligences. No
                      words can describe the scene which took place as the Son of
                      God was publicly reinstated in the place of honor and glory
                      which He voluntarily left when He became a man."—Ellen G.

         Part 6     "And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
       OVER THE and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son he saith, Thy
      ANGELS—Ill throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness
                 is the sceptre of thy kingdom" (Heb. 1:7, 8).


                     The Greek translation of Psalm 104:4 is quoted in Hebrews
                   1:7, 8 to show the place of the angels in God's government of the
                   universe.
                     Ellen G. White wrote: "Angels are God's ministers, radiant
                   with the light ever flowing from His presence and speeding on
                   rapid wing to execute His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 34.
                     The exalted nature of Christ is shown by contrast, using a
                   quotation from the Greek translation of Psalm 45:6, 7. The
                   apostle emphasizes that Christ is God, but the angels are
                   servants. The "sceptre" indicates the legitimacy of His gov-
                   ernment. Since it is a "sceptre of righteousness," His reign is
                   just or righteous. (See Isa. 11:5.) The Messianic King adheres to
                   a holy standard of divine righteousness, not merely as a policy,
                   but as a matter of personal devotion. In recognition of this
                   dedication, the Father has anointed Him with the "oil of
                   gladness," above His fellows (Heb. 1:9).

                     What truths regarding Christ does the quotation from Psalm
                   102:25-27 in Hebrews 1:10-12 bring out?


                     Inasmuch as Christ was the agent through whom the universe
                   was created, the words of Psalm 102:25-27 are appropriately
                   addressed to Him, who, in the Septuagint text quoted, is given
                   the title "Lord." The creative power and permanence of God the
                   Father belong also to the Son. The Son, unlike the natural
                   world, will not grow old or perish, but abide eternally.

                     What words addressed to Christ are not appropriate for
                   angels? Heb. 1:13, 14.


                      The highest of the angels, Gabriel, stands in the presence of
                   God (Luke 1:19), ready to do His bidding. No angel was ever
                   invited to sit at God's right hand. But Christ occupies this
                   position of honor and authority. To place under one's feet
                   means to subjugate. (See Joshua 10:24; 2 Sam. 22:39; 1 Kings
                   5:3; Ps. 47:3.) It is a sign of the power of the one who overcomes
                   all His foes. God is destined to be Ruler over all. Angels, on the
                   other hand, have the function of service—service even to men
                   who accept the salvation Jesus offers.

                       "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
                     things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let
                     them slip. For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and
                     every transgression and disobedience received a just rec-
                     ompence of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so
                     great salvation?" (Heb. 2:1-3).

                        Hebrews 2:1-4 is the first of five exhortations based on the
                     particular truths presented. This one is a warning against in-
                     difference about the message of Christ. "Therefore," that is,
                     because God has given His perfect revelation to men in the
                     person of His Son, take heed that you do not drift away from it.
                        "The word spoken by angels" refers to the Mosaic law. The
                     Old Testament does not state that the angels participated in the
                     giving of the law, although their presence at Sinai is suggested
                     in Deuteronomy 33:2. In the Greek Old Testament the last line of
                     this verse reads, "at his right hand were angels with him." (See
                     also Ps. 68:17. Compare Patriarchs and Prophets, top of page
                     364.) In the New Testament the angels are pictured as taking an
                     active role in the giving of the law. (See Acts 7:53; Gal. 3:19.)
                        The author argues from the lesser to the greater: from the
                     previous revelation given by angels to the last one given
                     through Christ. The revelation given in pre-Christian times by
                     angels deserved and received reverent attention from God's
                     devout people and to disregard it brought punishment, for
                     example, Numbers 15:30, 31. (See Joshua 1:8; Ps. 1:2; 119:4-6.)
                     How much more certain is the doom of those who play fast and
                     loose with the gospel of Christ!

                       In what ways is the greatness of this salvation shown? Heb.
                     2:3, 4.

                       In the epistle this greatness is emphasized first by its origin. It
                     was brought to earth by the Son of God Himself. Second, this
                     gospel message was transmitted in a trustworthy manner by the
                     chosen witnesses who saw and heard our Lord. Third, God
                     Himself endorsed its proclamation with miracles. Finally, God
                     gave the Holy Spirit to living men and distributed spiritual gifts
                     to hasten its proclamation.

                     but a confused idea of what religion means, the most con-

                                                                               July 5

         DESTINY come, whereof we speak" (Heb. 2:5).
         OF MAN
                   In the translation of the Greek Old Testament, Deuteronomy
                 32:8 reads: "When the Most High divided the nations, when he
                 separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the nations
                 according to the number of the angels of God."
                   Please note again that the Greek Old Testament, the Sep-
                 tuagint, was the Bible being used by the writer of Hebrews.
                   The verse suggests that the Lord has delegated some kind of
                 authority over the nations to various angels. The prophet Daniel
                 was given some insight into the work of angels in dealing with
                 the governmental officials of the nations. (See Dan. 10:20, 21.)
                   Although various angels may have some functions in guiding
                 the nations of this present world, Hebrews 2:5 plainly asserts
                 that the world to come has not been subjected to them. Rater,
                 the sovereignty of that world belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ.

                      At the time of his creation, what charge was man given in
                    relation to the world and lower forms of life? Heb. 2:6-8.
                    (Compare Ps. 8:4-6; Gen. 1:26-28.)

                       At this point the author of Hebrews incorporates another
                    quotation from the Greek Old Testament, this time from Psalm
                    8:4-6. The phrase, "a little lower" in verse 7 has been translated
                    in the Revised Standard Version, "a little while lower." This is a
                    valid rendering of the Greek, both in Psalms and Hebrews, but
                    not of the original Hebrew in the Psalms, which reads "a little
                    lower." The passage is applied in the book of Hebrews not so
                    much to the first Adam, but to the last Adam, Jesus Christ.
                    Hence, "a little while lower" is particularly appropriate. The first
                    Adam failed and lost the original dominion. The last Adam came
                    as a human being to regain the rulership. He came as the head
                    and representative man, as the true ideal of what could have
                    been and should be.
                       "Adam was crowned king in Eden. To him was given domin-
                    ion over every living thing that God had created. The Lord
                    blessed Adam and Eve with intelligence such as He had not
                    given to any other creature. He made Adam the rightful
                    sovereign over all the works of His hands. Man, made in the
                    divine image, could contemplate and appreciate the glorious
                    works of God in nature."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                    Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1082.

 THINK IT THROUGH     "The Son of the infinite God clothed His divinity with hu-
                    manity, and submitted to the death of the cross, that He might
                    become a steppingstone by which humanity might meet with
                    divinity."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 291.

            Part 3   "Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in
        IDEALTHE
        JESUS, MAN that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is
                   not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under
                   him. But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the
                   angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and
                   honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for
                   every man" (Heb. 2:8, 9).


                       This language is very inclusive. Man was destined to have full
                     sovereignty: "He left nothing that is not put under him." In spite
                     of tremendous technological achievements, man does not now
                     exercise any such universal dominion. Man, for example, is
                     subject to moral depravity, disease, and, ultimately, death. Sin
                     has robbed him of the promised dominion. "Now, we see not yet
                     all things put under him."
                        "But we see Jesus." Appropriately the human name is used,
                     for the emphasis here is on His humanity. That which God
                     promised has been fulfilled in Jesus, and that which we see in
                     Jesus will be fulfilled in man. Jesus is the last Adam, the rep-
                     resentative man. What He is and has done constitutes the
                     pledge and assurance of humanity's glorious future. He was
                     made for a little while lower than the angels to accomplish
                     through His redemption what God has purposed for human life.
                        Because of His sufferings and death, Jesus has been en-
                     throned, "crowned with glory and honour." As a preparation for
                     this crowning He tasted death for every man. This was done "by
                     the grace of God." To taste of death, like the parallel, to see
                     death, means not merely to die but to experience what death
                     really is. It indicates an experiential knowledge of the awful
                     meaning and consequences of death. This Jesus realized for
                     every man.


 THINK IT THROUGH       "Through Christ had been communicated every ray of divine
                     light that had ever reached our fallen world. It was He who had
                     spoken through everyone that throughout the ages had de-
                     clared God's word to man. Of Him all the excellences manifest
                     in the earth's greatest and noblest souls were reflections. . . .
                     The mental and spiritual power manifest in all these men, . . .
                     were but gleams from the shining of His glory. In Him was found
                     the perfect ideal.
                        "To reveal this ideal as the only true standard for attainment;

                     would become—for this, Christ came to the world."—

The Pioneer of Our Salvation            LESSON 2                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         July 7
          Part 4   What did God regard as fitting in perfecting the Son as our
     THE SON AND Saviour?
       THE SONS
                   "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom
                 are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
                 captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings" (Heb.
                 2:10).

                       "For whom are all things, and by whom are all things," as the
                    context clearly indicates, is God the Father. The Father re-
                    garded it as fitting for the Son, the Pioneer in redemption, to
                    become a perfect Saviour through suffering. He must blaze the
                    trail His people are to follow by becoming one of them in nature.
                    He must also endure the penalty for sin in their behalf.
                       His union with them, the epistle goes on to show (verses
                    11-13), makes them His brothers. "He that sanctifieth" is the
                    Son of God; "they who are sanctified" are the believers, now
                    sons of God. In this epistle "to sanctify someone" means to
                    atone for his sins, to purge him by freeing him from his guilt.
                    This is done by means of the atoning sacrifice and priestly
                    ministry of Christ. (See Heb. 9:13, 14; 10:10; 13:12.) Through
                    Christ they become adopted sons of God. They are not sons by
                    nature but by grace. They are sons now (1 John 3:2), but He is
                    the Son (spelled with a capital "S"—see John 20:31).
                       Nevertheless He and they "are all of one" origin (Heb. 2:11),
                    literally, "are all out of one," that is, have one Father. Thus He is
                    not ashamed to acknowledge them as His brothers. As evidence
                    of this, three Old Testament passages are cited (verses 12, 13).
                       The most significant one is taken from Psalm 22. In His hour of
                    abandonment on the cross Jesus cried out the opening words
                    of this psalm. (See Matt. 27:46; Mark 15:34.) The Gospel writers
                    saw other parts of Psalm 22 fulfilled in the crucifixion, and used
                    language borrowed from it to portray that awful event. (See
                     Matt. 27:39, 43; Luke 23:35; John 19:23, 24, 28.) But if the first
                    part of the psalm can appropriately be put in the mouth of
                    Christ, why cannot the second part, where thanksgiving for

            Part 5     What purposes for the incarnation of Christ does the epistle
 THE INCARNATION     now suggest?
        OF CHRIST
                       "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
                     blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
                     through death he might destroy him that had the power of
                     death, that is, the devil" (Heb. 2:14).

                        If Christ's identification with human beings was to be real, He
                     had to become a genuine flesh-and-blood man. "It was not a
                     make-believe humanity that Christ took upon Himself. He took
                     human nature and lived human nature."—Ellen G. White
                     Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1124.
                        "When Jesus took human nature, and became in fashion as a
                     man, He possessed all the human organism.... He had bodily
                     wants to be supplied, bodily weariness to be relieved."—Ellen
                     G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1130.
                        "Christ took upon Him the infirmities of degenerate human-
                     ity. Only thus could He rescue man from the lowest depths of his
                     degradation."—The Desire of Ages, p. 117.
                        One of the purposes of the incarnation was His death, and by
                     that very act He "decided the destiny of the rebel chief, and
                     made forever sure the plan of salvation. In death He gained the
                     victory over its power; in rising again, He opened the gates of
                     the grave to all His followers."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 701,
                     702.

                       Who are the objects of Christ's redemptive work? Verse 16.

                       The English Revised Version gives a literal translation of this
                     verse: "For verily not of angels doth he take hold, but he taketh
                     hold of the seed of Abraham." Christ died for man, not angels.
                     When the fallen angels were cast out of heaven, there was
                     nothing more Christ could do for them.
                       "There were no new and more wonderful exhibitions of God's
                     exalted power that could ever impress them as deeply as those
                     they had already experienced. If they could rebel in the very
                     presence of the weight of glory inexpressible, they could not be
                     placed in any more favorable condition to be proved. There was
                     no reserve force of power, nor were there any greater heights
                     and depths of infinite glory to overpower their jealous doubts
                     and rebellious murmuring. Their guilt and their punishment
                     must be in proportion to their exalted privileges in the heavenly
                     courts."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Feb. 24, 1874.
                       Jesus, however, could reach out and rescue human beings.
                     "The seed of Abraham" include all believers, for it is men of faith
                     who are the true children of Abraham.

                                                                             July 9
            Part 6    What change in Christ's status was necessary for this
 OUR SYMPATHETIC     mission to succeed?
      HIGH PRIEST
                       "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
                     his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
                     priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
                     the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered
                     being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted"
                     (Heb. 2:17, 18).

                        Our Lord voluntarily gave Himself to undertake the work of
                     man's redemption. If He were to succeed, He must become a
                     true man in every respect, apart from sinning.
                        "Christ bore the sins and infirmities of the race as they existed
                     when He came to the earth to help man. In behalf of the race,
                     with the weaknesses of fallen man upon Him, He was to stand
                     the temptations of Satan upon all points wherewith man would
                     be assailed."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                     mentary, vol. 5, p. 1081.
                        He was God. He had to be made man. This qualified Him to be
                     man's High Priest. Thus the author introduces one of the central
                     themes of Hebrews—the high-priestly office of our Lord.
                     Hebrews is the only book in the New Testament that speaks of
                     Jesus as either a priest or a high priest. A priest was the people's
                     representative before God; a prophet was God's spokesman to
                     the people. In order for Jesus to serve as a true representative of
                     man, He needed to become human and to suffer with and for
                     him. He who undertakes to help sinful man must have a sym-
                     pathy for him born of experiencing his kind of life. His sufferings
                     would enable Him to sympathize fully with man and thus be
                     merciful in His attitude toward him.
                         We can have confidence in approaching God through Jesus
                     because He was severely tempted and yet is the sinless One.
                      God has accepted Him as the holy Substitute to stand in the
                      place of the repentant sinner.
                         "Although Jesus Christ has passed into the heavens, there is
                      still a living chain binding His believing ones to His own heart of
                      infinite love. The most lowly and weak are bound by a chain of
                      sympathy closely to His heart. He never forgets that He is our
                      representative, that He bears our nature."—Testimonies to
                     Ministers, p. 19.
                         In giving Himself for us He was strongly tempted to use His
                      divine power to save Himself (see The Desire of Ages, p. 700). "It
                      was a part of His mission to bear, in His humanity, all the taunts
                      and abuse that men could heap upon Him."—The Desire of
                      Ages, p. 703. He felt the full force of temptation. Therefore He is
                      especially qualified to help tempted human beings.

        SUPERIORITY sion, Christ Jesus; who was faithful to him that appointed him,
        OVER MOSES as also Moses was faithful in all his house" (Heb. 3:1, 2).

                        Because Jesus took human nature, experienced temptation,
                     and consequently can help us when we are tempted, Christians
                     are admonished to fix their attention upon Him as their High
                     Priest. They already believed in Jesus as their High Priest.
                     Perhaps from baptism they were committed to a belief in this
                     doctrine, but a full understanding and appreciation of its import
                     was lacking. Hence, now they are urged to direct their whole
                     mind to its significance.
                        It is noteworthy that the epistle uses the human name Jesus.
                     This emphasizes the humanness of the Saviour. He is not only a
                     high priest, but also an apostle. This is the only passage in the
                     New Testament in which Jesus is called the "Apostle" (one
                     sent). The Gospel of John, however, repeatedly emphasizes the
                     truth that Jesus was the One sent by the Father. He came into
                     the world as the Father's envoy to man. Now, as a high priest, He
                     is man's envoy to the Father.
                        In both functions, as an apostle and as a high priest, Jesus has
                     proved faithful to the Father who appointed Him. His faithful-
                     ness is compared to that of Moses. (See Num. 12:7.) Moses was
                     an apostle of God to ancient Israel as well as their most effective
                     intercessor with God. Moses was the most significant figure in
                     the history of the Jews. He was the mediator of the divine word, a
                     humble and patient servant of God, but our Lord is much
                     greater.

                      In what ways is the position of Jesus superior to that of
                     Moses? Heb. 3:3-6.

                       The Greek word translated "house" can also mean
                     "household" or "family," which seems to be the meaning here.
                     Moses was faithful as a servant in God's family, but Christ is
                     faithful as the Son and appointed Heir over all the Father's
                     property. He was in fact, the Founder and Builder of the Old
                     Testament community as the family of God. How much more the
                     New Testament community which consisted of the faithful
                     believers.

 THINK IT THROUGH       "The approval of the Master is not given because of the
                     greatness of the work performed, but because of fidelity in all
                     that has been done. It is not the resultswe attain, but the motives
                     from which we act, that weigh with God. He prizes goodness
                     and faithfulness above all else."—Gospel Workers, p. 267.

 ISRAEL'S FAILURE
                       "As the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
                     harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of

                       The words attributed to the Holy Spirit are taken from the

                     the wilderness did not. Moses was faithful, but the people
                     proved to be faithless. Jesus was faithful, but will the new Israel
                     avoid the mistakes of the past?
                        Ancient Israel heard God's voice at Sinai, and through Moses
                     God spoke to them throughout their wilderness wanderings,
                     but they failed to hearken. Now Jesus as the Apostle and High
                     Priest of God, too, has spoken. Will the new Israel harden their
                     hearts?
                        "As in the provocation" in Hebrews 3:8 corresponds to "as at
                     Meribah" in Psalm 95:8, RSV. "Meribah" means "contention"
                     or "strife" and was a name given to one of the places where the
                     children of Israel, in need of water, murmured against God. (See
                     Ex. 17:1-7; Num. 20:2-13.) Similarly, "in the day of temptation"
                     in Hebrews 3:8 corresponds to "on the day at Massah" in Psalm
                     95:8, RSV. These are not the only instances where their lack of
                     faith and rebellious spirit manifested itself. Rather, God ac-
                     cused them of putting Him to the test and not hearkening to His
                     voice "ten times" (Num. 14:22).

                      Because of their faithlessness, murmuring, and obstinacy,
                     what oath did God take against them? Heb. 3:10, 11.

 THINK IT THROUGH      "God did not design that His people, Israel, should wander
                     forty years in the wilderness. He promised to lead them directly
                     to the land of Canaan, and establish them there a holy, healthy,
                     happy people. . . .
                        "For forty years did unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion shut
                     out ancient Israel from the land of Canaan. The same sins have
                     delayed the entrance of modern Israel into the heavenly Ca-
                     naan. In neither case were the promises of God at fault. It is the
                     unbelief, the worldliness, unconsecration, and strife among the
                     Lord's professed people that have kept us in this world of sin
                     and sorrow so many years."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, pp. 68,

                                                                               July 13
             Part 3   In view of these sad experiences of Israel, what warning
      A WARNING TO and exhortation are given to the church?
        THE CHURCH
                      "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil
                    heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort
                    one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be
                    hardened through the deceitfulness of sin" (Heb. 3:12, 13).

                       The rebellious Israelites "would not obey" Moses (Acts 7:39).
                     As the result, "the Lord, having saved the people out of the land
                     of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not" (Jude 5).
                     The loss in rejecting the One greater than Moses is not an
                     earthly Canaan, but the greater blessings of the heavenly
                     Canaan. It was basically a lack of faith and trust resulting in
                     disloyalty and disobedience that proved the doom of the Is-
                     raelites in the wilderness. A similar unbelief and distrust can
                     lead Christians today to become apostates.
                       Hence the appeal, "Take heed." One of the best ways to avoid
                     falling away is for Christians constantly and persistently to
                     exhort and encourage one another. Often in helping others an
                     individual helps himself. It is especially important for all to be on
                     the alert because of the deceptive and enticing character of sin.
                     In a fellowship of watchfulness its specious and beguiling
                     character can be more easily detected than in isolation. And
                     encouragement to resist the encroachments of evil is fostered
                     by group fellowship. "In view of all that God has wrought for us,
                     our faith should be strong, active, and enduring."—Patriarchs
                     and Prophets, p. 294.

                        Upon what condition does true partnership with Christ
                      depend? Heb. 3:14, 15.

                         In verses 16 through 18, a series of questions is raised to bring
                      home the lessons to be drawn from Israel's tragic failure. Who
                      were these rebels in the wilderness? They were the very people
                      who had seen God's power manifested through Moses in great
                      redeeming acts. It is not enough to make a good beginning.
                      There remains the awful possibility of backsliding. The root
                      trouble was unbelief and distrust of God (verse 19). They would
                      not take God at His word.

 THINK IT THROUGH       "The Lord manifests His grace and His power over and over
                     again, and this should teach us that it is always profitable under
                     all circumstances to cherish faith, to talk faith, to act faith. We
                     are not to have our hearts and hands weakened by allowing the
                     suggestions of suspicious minds to plant in our hearts the seeds
                     of doubt and distrust."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

The Peril of Disobedience         LESSON 3                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       July 14
          Part 4   What promise remains for Christians, and what should they
     VALIDITY OF fear?
    THE PROMISE
                     "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of enter-
                   ing into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. For
                   unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
                   the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
                   faith in them that heard it. For we which have believed do enter
                   into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall
                   enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the
                   foundation of the world" (Heb. 4:1-3).

                      The failure of the ancient Hebrews to enter into God's rest has
                   not invalidated the promise. That promise remains; it is still
                   open and valid for those who will appropriate it by faith. But
                   there is real danger that Christians may follow Israel's example
                   of unbelief and thus fail of entering God's rest. The epistle
                   attributes Israel's failure primarily to their lack of faith in ap-
                   propriating what God had promised. Faith is the spiritual hand
                   that reaches up to grasp God's never-failing promises. God's
                   rest is open to the one who will appropriate it by faith.
                      What is God's rest which this passage promises? The term
                   "rest" in the Old Testament is used in several ways. God
                   promised Moses as the leader of Israel, "My presence shall go
                   with thee, and I will give thee rest" (Ex. 33:14). This meant that
                   God would bring them to the Promised Land of Canaan. They
                   would no longer be a nomadic people without a homeland. (See
                   Deut. 3:20; 12:9,10.) "Rest" also meant relief from the attacks of
                   enemies in the land. (See Deut. 25:19; Joshua 21:44, 45; 23:1.)
                   The first generation of wandering Israelites did not experience
                   this rest. Their bodies were strewn in the wilderness. (See Heb.
                   3:17.) But under Joshua the second generation did enter the
                   promised Canaan.
                      It seems evident, however, that God had far more in mind for
                   Israel than merely an earthly Canaan. Our epistle holds out the
                   hope of "a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is
                   not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for
                   them a city" (Heb. 11:16). Abraham "looked for a city which hath
                   foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (verse 10). So, as
                   Christians today, we are wandering pilgrims seeking a heavenly
                   rest. "We are homeward bound. He who loved us so much as to
                   die for us hath builded for us a city. The New Jerusalem is our
                    place of rest."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 287. But as we shall see,
                    the promise of entering God's rest is not merely for the future. It
                    is also for the present. "We which have believed do enter into
                    rest" (Heb. 4:3).

The Peril of Disobedience            LESSON 3                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                         July 15
            Part 5   "Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter
     THE REST THAT therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in
          REMAINS  because of unbelief: again, he limiteth a certain day.... There
                   remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is
                   entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works,
                   as God did from his" (Heb. 4:6-10).

                        The name "Jesus" in Hebrews 4:8, KJV, is the Greek word for
                     Joshua.
                        Although Joshua led the second generation of Israelites into
                     the Land of Canaan, they did not enter into God's rest (verse 8).
                     This is shown by the fact that Psalm 95, written many years after
                     the conquest of the Promised Land, speaks of the rest as un-
                     attained. This rest, verse 10 indicates, is something God's
                     people can enter now. One of the outstanding features of New
                     Testament teaching is that in Jesus Christ many of the blessings
                     which belong to the age to come are already available to the
                     Christian. He may even now taste "the heavenly gift," "the good
                     word of God, and the powers of the world to come" (Heb. 6:4, 5).
                     Hence God's rest both is and is to be. It is, and yet remains, a
                     promise for the future.
                        That rest is analogous to God's rest after Creation. (See Heb.
                     4:4; Gen. 2:2.) To enter God's rest means to enjoy the re-
                     freshment He Himself experienced when He looked with
                     satisfaction upon the completed creation. (See Ex. 31:17.)
                        Jewish rabbis have noted that in the Genesis account of each
                     of the first six days of Creation Week the statement is made that
                     there was evening and there was morning—each day had a
                     beginning and an end. But curiously, no such mention is made
                     of the seventh day. From this fact it was argued that the day of
                     God's rest had no ending. The rest of God has not ended. It is
                     everlasting and eternal rest.
                        The rest into which we are invited to enter "is the rest of
                     grace."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                     vol. 7, p. 928. It is the "true rest of faith."—Thoughts From the

                        "We enter into God's 'rest' when we 'consider' Jesus (ch 3:1)
                     and listen to His voice (chs 3:7, 15; 4:7), when we exercise faith
                     in Him (ch 4:2, 3), when we cease from our own efforts to earn
                     salvation (v. 10), when we 'hold fast our profession' (v. 14), and

                                                                            July 16

  EXHORTATION TO fall after the same example of unbelief. For the word of God is
      DILIGENCE quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword,
                piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of
                the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
                intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not
                manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto
                the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (Heb. 4:11-13).

                       The basic meaning of the word translated "labour" is "to
                    make haste" hence, "to bend every effort." No halfheartedness
                    will do. Much of our unrest of spirit is due to our divided loyal-
                    ties. We are trying to serve more than one master. To avoid the
                    pitfall of unbelieving disobedience we need to completely
                    surrender. "The surrender of all our powers to God greatly
                    simplifies the problem of life. It weakens and cuts short a
                    thousand struggles with the passions of the natural heart"—
                    Messages to Young People, p. 30.
                       "Entire surrender of your ways, which seem so very wise, and
                    taking Christ's ways, is the secret of perfect rest in His love."
                    —My Life Today, p. 176.

                      What characteristics does the word of God have? Verses
                    12, 13.

                      The "word of God" includes whatever God has said. Hebrews
                    begins with the assertion that God has spoken, anciently
                    through the prophets, but now in the person of His Son. (See
                    Heb. 1:1, 2.) The "word of God" in the present context is the
                    message about God's rest which the Holy Spirit speaks through
                    the psalmist. (See Heb. 3:7.) But whatever God has said, no
                    matter how or when, is alive. It speaks to us today in words of
                    power. God's word is not only active but efficacious, particu-
                    larly in the lives of believers. (See 1 Thess. 2:13; Isa. 55:11.)
                      That word transforms the inward man and reveals motives.
                      "The truth is the truth. It is not to be wrapped up in beautiful
                    adornings, that the outside appearance may be admired. The
                    teacher is to make the truth clear and forcible to the under-
                    standing and to the conscience. The word is a two-edged
                    sword, that cuts both ways. It does not tread as with soft,
                    slippered feet."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                    Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1147.

                   boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
                   find grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:14-16).

                         The original readers of this epistle were in danger of letting go
                      their faith and falling away from Christianity. A consciousness
                      of having a High Priest who has ascended to the very presence
                      of God should bring to them staying power. Note that this High
                      Priest is called "Jesus the Son of God." The use of the human
                      name "Jesus" suggests His nearness to them, whereas "Son of
                      God" suggests the power of His deity. The two are combined in
                      Him. Because the Hebrew believers have such a sympathetic
                      and powerful representative with God they are admonished to
                      hold fast their confession—their faith. The Greek for "hold fast"
                      is a strong word suggesting the idea of clinging tenaciously to
                      something.

                        Why may Christians be confident that their High Priest
                      sympathetically understands them? Verse 15.

                         "Christ alone had experience in all the sorrows and temp-
                      tations that befall human beings. Never another of woman born
                      was so fiercely beset by temptation; never another bore so
                      heavy a burden of the world's sin and pain. Never was there
                      another whose sympathies were so broad or so tender. A sharer
                      in all the experiences of humanity, He could feel not only for, but

                         As a human being, Jesus suffered the full force of every kind
                      of temptation to which men are subject, but He never sinned.
                         "There was not a trace of imperfection in His life or character.

                        Where and how are we to come for mercy and grace? Verse 16.

                         Because of past sins and present weakness we need mercy
                      and grace. William Tyndale translated "mercy seat" as "seat of
                      grace." The throne of grace is the throne where Christ reigns as
                      our Priest-King. To it we may continually go with confidence.
                      "We are to come in faith, believing that we shall obtain the very

                                                                             July 19
         Part 2    "For every high priest taken from among men is ordained
      WHAT IS A for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts
    HIGH PRIEST? and sacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on the
                 ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he
                 himself also is compassed with infirmity."

                     "And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
                   called of God, as was Aaron" (Heb. 5:1, 2, 4).

                      A priest is "a person duly authorized to minister in sacred
                   things as a mediator between man and God, and to offer sac-
                   rifices for the sins of men."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 875.
                      In order to represent human beings in that which pertains to
                   God he must himself be human. As such he must be able to
                   "deal gently" (RSV) with sinners. The original word means to
                   hold one's emotions in restraint. He must not be either too
                   severe or too tolerant. While opposing sin, He must have
                   sympathy for the sinner. "The thought of his own weakness and
                   sin makes him [a human high priest] moderate in his (justifiable)
                   displeasure and anger at the sins of the people."—Gerhard
                   Kittel, ed., Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (Grand
                   Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1967), vol. 5, p. 938. Used by
                   permission.
                       "The ignorant" could mean the wayward through ignorance.
                   In any case, it is worthy of note that in Israel's sacrificial system
                   no sin offering could be brought for presumptuous sins. Sac-
                   rifices were, however, prescribed for sins committed "unwit-
                   tingly" (RSV), or "through ignorance." (See Lev. 4:2, 13; Num.
                   15:22-30; Deut. 17:12.) Sins done unwittingly probably included
                   those done ignorantly, and those done in a moment of impulse.
                   Sins of presumption were open-eyed, deliberate violations of
                   God's law. For these no sin offering was prescribed.

                     Because the ordinary high priest was "beset with weak-
                   ness" (RSV), what was it necessary for him to do? Heb. 5:3.

                     It is at this point that Jesus as our High Priest differs from
                   other priests, for He never sinned. Here one may raise the
                   question, Can one who has never sinned sympathize with a
                   sinner? On the contrary, it is only the person who has withstood
                   temptation who really knows the power of the temptation. The
                   one who yields has not experienced its utmost force.

                        How is the high-priestly office obtained? Verse 4.

                     "Christ was appointed to the office of Mediator from the
                   creation of God, set up from everlasting to be our substitute and
                   surety."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 250.

            Part 3     How did Jesus become our High Priest?
 HIS APPOINTMENT
   AS HIGH PRIEST
                       "So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high
                     priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I
                     begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a
                     priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec" (Heb. 5:5, 6).

                        After briefly showing the qualifications for the office of high
                     priest, our epistle shows how Jesus met them. He begins with
                     the last qualification mentioned—divine appointment. Our Lord
                     did not assume the honor of the high-priestly office on His own
                     initiative. His whole life was an enunciation of the principle He
                     uttered: "If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my
                     Father that honoureth me" (John 8:54).
                        Jesus was appointed as a high priest by Him who said to Him,
                     "Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee." These words are
                     from Psalm 2:7. "To day" in the quotation probably refers to the
                     time when Jesus, after the ascension, was exalted and invested
                     with His royal dignity as the Son of God. It was then that God
                     announced that Jesus was "both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36).
                     In addition, the epistle asserts, He was made a high priest.
                        The second quotation is taken from Psalm 110:4, a psalm
                     which the New Testament uniformly applies to Jesus as the
                     Messiah. Jesus Himself used the opening words of the psalm
                     when He asked the Jews: "How say the scribes that Christ is the
                     son of David? . . . David therefore himself call-
                     eth him Lord; and where is he then his son?" (Mark 12:35-37).
                     The same God who acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah also
                     acclaimed Him as High Priest.
                        Jesus is declared to be "a priest for ever after the order of
                     Melchisedec." Melchizedek is introduced in Genesis 14:18 as
                     "king of Salem" (probably Jerusalem) and "priest of the most
                     high God." The nature of his priesthood, therefore, differed
                     widely from that of Aaron. He was a priest-king. Jesus in like
                     manner is Priest-King.
                        The epistle develops further this likeness to Melchizedek in
                     chapter 7. Our Lord's priesthood, it will be shown, is not de-
                     pendent on any fleshly descent, or limited by conditions of time.
                     Christ is a priest forever because He has no successor, or any
                     need for a successor.

 THINK IT THROUGH      "God gave Him His appointment to the priesthood. He was to
                     be an example to all the human family. He qualified Himself to
                     be, not only the representative of the race, but their Advocate,
                     so that every soul if he will may say, I have a Friend at court."—

Jesus, Our Great High Priest          LESSON 4                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      July 21
          Part 4   How is Jesus' total identity with human beings vividly
   HIS SYMPATHY shown?
    FOR HUMANS
                   "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up
                 prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto
                 him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in
                 that he feared" (Heb. 5:7).

                      The second qualification Jesus has as a priest is His ability to
                   sympathize with human weaknesses because He has ex-
                   perienced our temptations, our sorrows, and our woes. He
                   voluntarily made Himself just as dependent upon God the
                   Father as we are. Hence prayer was a necessity for Him.
                      "Our Saviour identified Himself with our needs and weak-
                   ness, in that He became a suppliant, a petitioner, seeking from
                   His Father fresh supplies of strength, that He might come forth
                   braced for duty and trial. He is our example in all things. He is a
                   brother in our infirmities, 'in all points tempted like as we are;'
                   but as the sinless one His nature recoiled from evil; He endured
                   struggles and torture of soul in a world of sin. His humanity
                   made prayer a necessity, and a privilege."—Steps to Christ, pp.
                   93, 94.
                      Our epistle shows how intensely Jesus shared our human lot.
                   "In the days of his flesh" means during the period of His earthly
                   life. There must have been many times when our Lord struggled
                   with great intensity in prayer. But the language here used with
                   its vividness, pathos, and solemnity applies especially to
                   Gethsemane. The loud cries and tears speak eloquently of His
                   desperate need at that crucial hour.

                     For what did Jesus pray in Gethsemane? Mark 14:32-36.

                      "The cup which he prayed should be removed from him, that
                   looked so bitter to his soul, was the cup of separation from God
                   in consequence of the sin of the world. He who was perfectly
                   innocent and unblamable, became as one guilty before God, in
                   order that the guilty might be pardoned and stand as innocent
                   before God."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Nov. 19,
                   1895.
                      Our Lord prayed "unto him that was able to save him from
                   death, and was heard." How can it be said that He was heard
                   when the cup was not removed from Him and He was not
                   delivered from death? The text does not say that Jesus prayed to
                   Him who would deliver Him from death, but who was able to
                   deliver Him from death. Our Lord prayed, "0 my Father, if it be
                   possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will,
                   but as thou wilt" (Matt. 26:39). Jesus thereby pledged Himself to
                   accept the Father's decision.

     HUMAN DISCI-    learn it?
PLINE OF OUR LORD
                       "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the
                     things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became
                     the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
                     called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec"
                     (Heb. 5:8-10).

                       Jesus was the eternal Son of God in a unique sense. As such
                     "He was independent and above all law."—Testimonies, vol. 4,
                     p. 120, and therefore owed obedience to no one. He voluntarily
                     assumed the nature of humanity and learned by experience
                     what obedience means.
                        "In order to elevate fallen man, Christ must reach him where
                     he was. He took human nature, and bore the infirmities and
                     degeneracy of the race."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 268.
                       This brought suffering to Him. "While He was free from the
                     taint of sin, the refined sensibilities of His holy nature rendered
                     contact with evil unspeakably painful to Him."—Ellen G. White
                     Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 927.
                        More than this, as a human being, He "became obedient unto
                     death, even the death of the cross" (Phil. 2:8). "His soul was
                     made an offering for sin."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                     Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 924.

                       Through a life of obedience and suffering, what did Jesus
                     become? to whom? Heb. 5:9.

                       Through a life of self-denial, temptation, and sacrifice He
                     became a perfect Saviour, the source or cause of eternal sal-
                     vation.

                       What was Christ now designated? by whom? Heb. 5:10.

                       The word translated "called" "expresses the formal and
                     solemn ascription of the title to Him to whom it belongs (ad-

                       The ignorance of those who crucified Christ "did not remove
                     their guilt; for it was their privilege to know and accept Jesus as
                     their Saviour. Some of them would yet see their sin, and repent,
                     and be converted. Some by their impenitence would make it an
                     impossibility for the prayer of Christ to be answered for them.
                     Yet, just the same, God's purpose was reaching its fulfillment.
                     Jesus was earning the right to become the advocate of men in
                     the Father's presence."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 744, 745.

                                                                               July 23

                        (Heb. 5:11, 12).

                          The author finds it difficult to unfold the truth of Christ's high
                        priesthood after the order of Melchizedek in part because it is a
                        hard subject, but primarily because of the dull and sluggish
                        spiritual understanding of his readers. Unfortunately they have

                        considerable time, they are capable of comprehending only the
                        elementary principles of God's word. "A little babe is wonderful,
                        but a sixty-year-old babe is not."—M. L. Andreasen,The Book of
                        Hebrews (Washington, DC: Review and Herald, 1948), p. 206.

                          What food is appropriate for babes? for the mature? Heb.
                        5:13, 14. Compare 1 Cor. 3:1, 2.

                          By "milk" we are to understand the very ABCs of divine
                        revelation suitable for new converts. (See 1 Peter 2:2.) These are
                        important, but there is much more to learn, referred to in the
                        Revised Standard Version as "solid food." Solid food is for
                        those who have their faculties trained by practice to distinguish
                        good from evil. This suggests that the ability to discriminate is
                        developed by careful study, meditation, and practice.
                          "Were Jesus with us today, He would say to us as He did to His

                        clouded, deficient comprehension made it impossible. They
                        could not be benefited with great, glorious, solemn truths. The
                        want of spiritual growth closes the door to the rich rays of light
                        that shine from Christ. We shall never reach a period when there

                    do, if God permit" (Heb. 6:1-3).

                         This is a challenge to leave behind elementary religious in-
                     struction and move on to a more advanced stage of spiritual
                     understanding. But what are "the principles of the doctrine of
                     Christ" (literally, "the word of the beginning of Christ")? They
                     are the basic, elementary Christian doctrines which constitute
                     the "alphabet" of becoming a Christian. The readers of the
                     epistle are urged to leave these elementary teachings, not in the
                     sense of forsaking them or denying their validity, but in the
                     same sense in which a carpenter leaves the foundation of a new
                     house and proceeds to build the rest of the structure. The
                     message here is, Let us move on toward full growth.
                         The first foundational doctrine mentioned is "repentance
                     from dead works." This evidently means, as the New Interna-
                     tional Version puts it, "repentance from acts that lead to death."
                     It is from such works that the conscience needs to be purified.
                     (See Heb. 9:14.) Jews as well as Christians insisted on re-
                     pentance from evil works. (Compare Mark 1:14, 15; Acts 3:19.)
                     But along with repentance there is need for faith—"Repentance
                     toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts
                     20:21).
                        Then follows "the doctrine of baptisms." The author does not
                     use baptisma, the usual word for baptism, but baptismoi, the
                     plural. See SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 433 for a discus-
                     sion of the significance of this usage.
                         See The Acts of the Apostles, page 162, for the practice of the
                     laying on of hands among Jews and early Christians. Among
                     Christians the laying on of hands accompanied the healing of
                     the sick, ordination, and prayer for the reception of the Spirit.

                       What other two important doctrines are then named? Heb.
                     6:2. (See Acts 1:22; 4:2; 17:18; 24:15.)

 THINK IT THROUGH      "If we would study the Bible diligently and prayerfully every

      THE PERIL    again to repentance?
     OF RELAPSE

                     "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened,
                   and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partak-
                   ers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God,
                   and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to
                   renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to
                   themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open
                   shame" (Heb. 6:4-6).


                      Willful apostasy by Christians who have had such high
                   privileges is a very serious matter. While God may be willing to
                   receive such, are they capable of once again manifesting saving
                   faith?
                      Enlightenment comes when the God who created light in the
                   beginning shines "in our hearts, to give the light of the
                   knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2
                   Cor. 4:6). Enlightenment apparently takes place at the begin-
                   ning of Christian life. In the Syriac New Testament, Murdock's
                   translation, Hebrews 6:4 reads, "who have once descended to
                   baptism."
                      Unfortunately, some in the early church interpreted the
                   passage as meaning there could be no repentance for any sin
                   committed after baptism and therefore postponed the cere-
                   mony until near the end of life. But the passage speaks of
                   deliberate apostasy, not a stumbling after baptism.
                      "And have tasted of the heavenly gift" reminds us of Psalm
                   34:8: "0 taste and see that the Lord is good." The heavenly gift
                   is the gift of salvation including the forgiveness of sins in Jesus
                   Christ. "Tasted" describes vividly the personal experience of
                   salvation. Furthermore, those mentioned have received the gift
                    of the Holy Spirit, heard the good news of the gospel, and
                   experienced the power of the future age already operative now.

                    By willfully apostatizing after having had such privileges,
                   what do they do? Verse 6.


                     The margin of the RV reads, "the while they crucify to
                   themselves the Son of God afresh, and put• him to an open
                   shame." The clause suggests an active, continuous hostility to
                   Christ. Our author is viewing the matter from the viewpoint of
                   the Christian teacher. The teacher cannot bring complete
                   apostates to a new beginning leading to conversion, but we
                   must not limit what God can do. (See Matt. 19:26.)

      FROM NATURE    dressed, receiveth blessing from God: but that which beareth
                     thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose
                     end is to be burned" (Heb. 6:7, 8).


                        Men till the land for the purpose of making it produce crops
                     that will be useful for man and beast. The tiller of the land,
                     however, is dependent upon the sun and rain which only God
                     can supply. In Egypt, where practically no rain fell, the Israelites
                     watered their crops by irrigation. Canaan, Moses promised,
                     would be different. It "is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh
                     water of the rain of heaven: a land which the Lord thy God
                     careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from
                     the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year" (Deut.
                     11:11, 12). Such a land forms a fitting symbol of Christians. In
                     the analogy drawn here the frequent and abundant rains
                     represent the free and repeated bestowal of such spiritual
                     blessings as were described in verses 4 through 6. A piece of
                     cultivated land that has absorbed repeated rains is expected to
                     produce a crop—a crop suitable for the owners of the field or
                     those on whose account the crop is planted. Productivity of
                     useful crops is the measure of a field's value. So the Master of
                     the Christian has a right to expect a suitable crop as the result of
                     the abundant spiritual blessings bestowed. The field that
                     produces some suitable crops is blessed with the capacity to
                     produce an even greater harvest.
                        On the other hand, if the land does not produce any suitable
                     crops, but produces only weeds and thorns, the mark of the
                     curse (Gen. 3:17, 18), then doom looms over it. So it is with
                     Christians who produce useless and noxious fruits. There are
                     three steps in the doom of the land. First, it is recognized as
                     "rejected." The original word means "not standing the test,"
                     hence reprobate, that is worthless. Second, it is near to being
                     cursed, exposed to the peril of abandonment to perpetual
                     barrenness. And the final end for it is burning. What else can be
                     done with a field covered with thorns and thistles?
                        The same lesson was taught by Isaiah's song of the vineyard
                     (Isa. 5:1-7) and our Lord's parable of the barren fig tree (Luke
                     13:6-9).

 THINK IT THROUGH      "Are you, 0 careless heart, a fruitless tree in the Lord's
                     vineyard? Shall the words of doom erelong be spoken of you?
                     How long have you received His gifts? How long has He
                     watched and waited for a return of love?"—Christ's Object

                                                                        July 28
        Part 4   What strong confidence does the apostle have in his
  WORDS OF HOPE readers? What eager desire does he have for them?

                      "But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and
                    things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak....
                    And we desire that every one of you do shew the same dil-
                    igence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: that ye be
                    not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and
                    patience inherit the promises" (Heb. 6:9-12).

                      Following the severe warning against apostasy, the apostle
                    turns to encouragement. This is the only time in Hebrews that he
                    refers to his readers as "beloved," or "dear friends," indicating
                    a close attachment to them. The construction of the sentence
                    including the verb translated "we are persuaded" "implies that
                    the writer had felt misgivings and had overcome them."—B. F.
                    Westcott, The Epistle to the Hebrews, p. 154. He is fully confi-
                    dent that in their case apostasy is not to be expected.

                      What was there about his readers that encouraged the
                    apostle in this confidence? Verse 10.

                       Near the close of His earthly life, our Lord declared, "By this
                    shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
                    another" (John 13:35). Acts of kindness done even to the low-
                    liest are acts done to Christ Himself. (See Matt. 25:40). The
                    original readers of Hebrews had not only served God's people in
                    the past, but were still doing so. In this the apostle saw hope, for
                    by doing this they were showing love to God. What was needed
                    now was a complete throwing off of all spiritual indolence and
                    inertia and pressing on persistently to complete the final hope.
                    "Hope" in the New Testament always bears "reference to the
                    return of the Lord Jesus at the end of the age."—Alan
                    Richardson, ed., A Theological Word Book of the Bible (Lon-
                    don: SCM Press, Ltd., 1957), p. 109. (Compare 1 Peter 1:13.)
                    Note that the apostle longs that "every one" of his readers have
                    this full confidence. By doing so they would become "followers
                    of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises"
                    (Heb. 6:12). Perhaps the greatest example of such confidence is
                    Abraham, whose experience is then cited.

 THINK IT THROUGH     "Christians who are constantly growing in earnestness, in
                    zeal, in fervor, in love—such Christians never backslide. . . .
                    They are ready to engage in the most stirring enterprises, and
                    they have no room for slothfulness; they cannot find a place for
                    stagnation."—My Life Today, p. 103.

             Part 5     "For when God made promise to Abraham, because he
      CERTAINTY OF    could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, saying, Surely
     GOD'S PROMISE    blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
                      And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
                      promise" (Heb. 6:13-15).

                        Why do human beings follow the practice of taking oaths?
                      Verse 16.

                        A formal oath is a solemn appeal to God as a witness that a
                      statement is true or a promise binding. Taking oaths is both
                      ancient and universal as a means of impressing on a person the
                      sacred obligation of telling the truth or keeping a promise.

                        Why does God condescend to put Himself under oath?
                      Verse 17.

                         "Adapting His dealings with man to human understanding
                      and to customs of the day, the Lord bound Himself by an oath to
                      fulfill His promises."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 780. He did this
                      to make very clear the unchanging nature of His purpose.
                         God made a number of promises to Abraham. The first came
                      when he was called to leave the society of Ur in Mesopotamia to
                      become a nomad. (See Gen. 12:1-3.) On arrival in Canaan, he
                      was promised that land as an inheritance (verse 7).
                         "There was given to Abraham the promise, especially dear to
                      the people of that age, of a numerous posterity and of national
                      greatness.... And to this was added the assurance, precious
                      above every other to the inheritor of faith, that of his line the
                      Redeemer of the world should come."—Patriarchs and
                      Prophets, p. 125. (For further promises see Genesis 15; 17; 22.)
                        But the promise reinforced by an oath was given Abraham
                      after the test of his faith on Mount Moriah. (See Gen. 22:16.)
                         "God had called Abraham to be the father of the faithful, and
                      his life was to stand as an example of faith to succeeding
                      generations. But his faith had not been perfect. . . . That he
                      might reach the highest standard, God subjected him to
                      another test, the closest which man was ever called to endure.
                      In a vision of the night he was directed to repair to the land of
                      Moriah, and there offer up his son as a burnt offering upon a
                      mountain that should be shown him."—Patriarchs and
                      Prophets, p. 147.

 THINK IT THROUGH        "In every command and in every promise of the word of God is
                      the power, the very life of God, by which the command may be
                      fulfilled and the promise realized. He who by faith receives the
                      word is receiving the very life and character of God."—Christ's

An Anchor Against Apostasy           LESSON 5                          ❑ Friday
                                                                          July 30
         Part 6   "Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the
  THE ANCHOR OF heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it
       THE SOUL by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was
                impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation,
                who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before
                us" (Heb. 6:17, 18).

                     "Heirs," plural, indicates that God guaranteed His promise by
                  taking an oath not only for the sake of Abraham, but also for all
                  of Abraham's spiritual heirs. (See Gal. 3:29.) God's promises
                  have not failed and cannot fail, for His very integrity as a God of
                  truth is involved. Nevertheless, to confirm the certainty of His
                  promise further, God has taken a solemn oath. Thus we can
                  cling not only to His promise but also to His oath—"two un-
                  changeable things, in which it is impossible that God should
                  prove false" (RSV).
                     "Fled for refuge" reminds us of the appointed cities of refuge
                  of ancient times (Ex. 21:13, 14; Num. 35:12, 25; Deut. 4:41, 42), a
                  type of Jesus Christ, who by the shedding of His blood has
                  provided a sure retreat for the sinner. (See Patriarchs and
                  Prophets, p. 516.) It also reminds us of the right of asylum which
                  men tried to find by fleeing to the sanctuary and laying hold of
                  the horns of the altar. (See 1 Kings 1:50; 2:28-35; compare Ex.
                  21:14.) So Christians are to flee to God and lay hold of the
                  assurance of His covenant promises.

                    To what is the Christian's hope likened, and where does it
                  enter? Heb. 6:19, 20.

                    The•anchor of hope in Christ, which is sure and steadfast, will
                  keep believers from making a shipwreck of their lives. The only
                  hope of the Christian is to be securely anchored in Christ and
                  His righteousness. Christ has entered the heavenly sanctuary
                  and, as their High Priest, ministers to them forgiveness for the
                  past and grace and power for the present.
                    Whether "within the veil," ("behind the curtain," RSV) means
                  within the sanctuary as a whole, without specifying which
                  apartment, or in the most holy place, opinions differ, for the
                  sanctuary had two veils. Even if the second is correct, it need
                  not mean that Christ began His work in the second apartment
                  upon His ascension, but could rather mean that He entered
                  there to dedicate it along with the rest of the sanctuary when He
                  assumed His high-priestly office. Compare the anointing of the
                  earthly sanctuary in Exodus 40. (See also Dan. 9:24.)

           Part 1      What do the Scriptures reveal regarding Melchizedek?
 MELCHIZEDEK THE
     PRIEST-KING       "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
                     God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
                     kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
                     part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness,
                     and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
                     without father, without mother, without descent, having
                     neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto
                     the Son of God; abideth a priest continually" (Heb. 7:1-3).

                        Compare Genesis 14:18-20.
                        Melchizedek is used to illustrate the superiority of Christ's
                     priesthood over that of the Levites. Historically, he was king of
                     Salem (Jerusalem) and priest of God Most High, a bestower of
                     blessing on Abraham, a monotheist, and a receiver of tithes. His
                     identity is otherwise unknown. Prophetically, he was the pattern
                     of the Messianic Priest-King (Ps. 110:4). The book of Hebrews
                     builds on this history and prophecy to exalt Jesus Christ as our
                     great High Priest.
                        Melchizedek is a type of Christ in several ways:
                       1.Office. He was a priest-king as is Christ.
                        2. Character. Although we know practically nothing regard-
                     ing the personal character of Melchizedek, our author sees
                     meaning in his name and titles. Melchizedek means "my king is
                     righteousness," or "king of righteousness." God has made
                     Christ, says Paul, "our righteousness" (1 Cor. 1:30, RSV).
                     Melchizedek was also king of Salem, a variant form of shalom,
                     meaning "peace." The Messiah is the "prince of peace" of Old
                     Testament prophecy (Ise.. 9:6, 7), and in the New Testament
                     Christ our peace (Eph. 2:14).
                        3. Nature of his person. Here the author of Hebrews argues
                     from silence. "To him the silences of Scripture were as much
                     due to divine inspiration as were its statements."—F. F. Bruce,
                     The Epistle to the Hebrews, The New International Commentary
                     on the New Testament, p. 137. The fact that the Scripture has no
                     record of the beginning or close of his life makes him a fitting
                     type of Christ who has no beginning or end of days.
                        4. No genealogy. Melchizedek is devoid of any genealogy.
                     The most essential qualification for a man to serve as a Levitical
                     priest was a genealogy which could be traced back in an un-
                     broken line to Aaron. Lacking this, men could be excluded from
                     the priesthood. (See Ezra 2:61-63; Neh. 7:63-65.) But the Bible
                     says nothing about either his parents or children.

 THINK IT THROUGH        "The peace of Christ, the peace of Christ—money cannot buy
                     it, brilliant talent cannot command it, intellect cannot secure it;

Superiority of Christ's Priesthood          LESSON 6                 ❑ Monday
                                                                        August 2
           Part 2     To whom did Abraham pay tithes and what did he receive in
   THE GREATNESS    return? What does this imply regarding his status?
  OF MELCHIZEDEK
                       "See how great he is! Abraham the patriarch gave him a
                    tithe of the spoils. And those descendants of Levi who receive
                    the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take
                    tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though
                    these also are descended from Abraham. But this man who
                    has not their genealogy received tithes from Abraham and
                    blessed him who had the promises. It is beyond dispute that
                    the inferior is blessed by the superior" (Heb. 7:4-7, RSV).

                      Why is the author concerned about the greatness of Mel-
                    chizedek? Because he sees in that ancient priest-king a type of
                    Christ; and Christ must be recognized as far superior to any
                    priest descended from Aaron. Hence he argues here that
                    Melchizedek is superior to Abraham. Abraham was one of the
                    noblest and most heroic figures of Old Testament times. He was
                    not only an impressive figure personally, but was one of the
                    most important Old Testament characters in the development
                    of redemptive history. He became known as the friend of God.
                    (See Isa. 41:8; 2 Chron. 20:7; James 2:23.) He was chosen to be
                    "the father of the people who for centuries were to be the
                    guardians and preservers of the truth of God to the world, the
                    people through whom all the nations of the earth should be
                    blessed in the advent of the promised Messiah."—Prophets and
                    Kings, p. 15. As the father of the Jewish people, he was the most
                    highly regarded of all the ancients. Yet Abraham paid tithes to
                    Melchizedek and was blessed by him, thus showing Mel-
                    chizedek's superiority over Abraham.

                      What commandment about tithing did the Levites have?
                    From whom did they take tithes? Heb. 7:5.

                      The story of Abraham and Melchizedek shows that tithing did
                    not originate with the Hebrews. It was, however, made an in-
                    tegral part of the Mosaic law. (See Lev. 27:30-32.) The tithe was
                    to be given to the Levites for their service in the sanctuary and
                    religious teaching. They were given no allotment in the Land of
                    Canaan and were to devote their whole time to their sacred
                    work. The Levites as mortal men received tithes from their
                    fellow Jews. By contrast Melchizedek, a non-Jew and type of
                    our eternal High Priest, accepted tithes from the founder of the
                    Jewish nation and "blessed him who had the promises." On the
                    assumption that an ancestor represents all his descendants
                    "one might even say" (RSV) that the Levites paid tithes to
                    Melchizedek in the person of their progenitor.

          Part 3   Why was there a need for a change in the order of the
 IMPERFECTION OF priesthood?
    THE AARONIC
     PRIESTHOOD
                    "If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood,
                 (for under it the people received the law,) what further need
                 was there that another priest should rise after the order of
                 Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For
                 the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
                 change also of the law" (Heb. 7:11, 12).


                       The very fact that Psalm 110 predicted the coming of a priest
                     "after the order of Melchisedec" is evidence that the Aaronic
                     priesthood was temporary. That priesthood was to be replaced
                     because it failed to bring men to perfection. There was no
                     inherent virtue in the sacrifices or priestly ministry of the
                     tabernacle. These had meaning and efficacy only as they
                     symbolized Christ and directed men's faith to Him and His
                     atoning death and ministry.


                      But if the priesthood was to be changed, what other change
                     was necessary? Heb. 7:12-14.


                        "The law provided that only the Levites could serve at the
                     tabernacle, and that only the sons of Aaron could be
                     priests."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Heb. 7:12. But neither
                     Melchizedek nor our Lord belonged to the Aaronic line of
                     priests. Melchizedek was not even a Jew, and Jesus traced His
                     human ancestry through the royal tribe of Judah, not the
                     priestly tribe of Levi. (See Matt. 1:1.) Therefore if the new priest
                     is to be after a different order, there must be also a change of the
                     regulations regarding priesthood.

 THINK IT THROUGH       "Our Saviour, in His life and death, fulfilled all the prophecies
                     pointing to Himself, and was the substance of all the types and
                     shadows signified. He kept the moral law, and exalted it by
                     answering its claims as man's representative. Those of Israel
                     who turned to the Lord, and accepted Christ as the reality
                     shadowed forth by the typical sacrifices, discerned the end of
                     that which was to be abolished. The obscurity covering the
                     Jewish system as a veil, was to them as the veil which covered
                     the glory upon the face of Moses. The glory upon the face of
                     Moses was the reflection of that light which Christ came into the
                     world to bring for the benefit of man."—Selected Messages, bk.

 Superiority of Christ's Priesthood            LESSON 6             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       August 4
           Part 4   "And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of
    SUPERIORITY OF Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, who is made, not
THE NEW PRIESTHOOD after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of
                  an endless life" (Heb. 7:15, 16).


                         What is it that becomes more evident or clear? Apparently the
                      need for a change in the law regarding priesthood as stated in
                      verse 12. The Greek word for "another" indicates that the need
                      is not for just another person as priest, but for a priest of a
                      different kind, one "in the likeness of Melchizedek" (RSV). The
                      basis on which this new priest serves is "not after the law of a
                      carnal commandment," that is, a regulation having to do with
                      fleshly descent from Levitical ancestors. Rather he serves on
                      the basis of the power of an indestructible, and therefore
                      endless, life. Note the contrasts here drawn: "law," an outward
                      restraint, on the one hand; "power" an inward force, on the
                      other; "carnal" with "endless"; "commandment" with "life."
                         In verse 17 the author cites again Psalm 110:4, "Thou art a
                      priest for ever." "For ever" means continuance and perma-
                      nence. As applied to Jesus we must think primarily of the risen
                      Christ. "Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth
                      no more; death hath no more dominion over him" (Rom. 6:9).


                        What is set aside? Why? What is introduced? Heb. 7:18,19.


                         The ceremonial system consisted of symbols of great gospel
                      truths. Religious symbols point to realities beyond themselves.
                      If the realities are neglected, the symbols are meaningless.
                      "Since the whole ritual economy was symbolical of Christ, it
                      had no value apart from Him."—The Desire of Ages, p. 165.
                         "The ceremonial law was to answer a particular purpose in
                      Christ's plan for the salvation of the race. The typical system of
                      sacrifices and offerings was established that through these
                      services sinners might discern the great offering, Christ."—
                      Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp.
                      1094, 1095.
                         The failure to see Christ in these rituals made them empty and
                      useless. "When the Jews sealed their rejection of Christ by
                      delivering Him to death, they rejected all that gave significance
                      to the temple and its services. Its sacredness had departed. It
                      was doomed to destruction. From that day sacrificial offerings
                      and the service connected with them were meaningless."—The
                      Desire of Ages, p. 165. But in Christ Christians have "a better
                      hope," through which "we draw nigh unto God" (Heb. 7:19).

                        Inasmuch as the office of high priest was hereditary, the

                     Lord was appointed as a high priest by an oath. Again the author
                     quotes from Psalm 110:4: "The Lord has sworn, and will not
                     repent, Thou art a priest for ever."
                        God is the God of truth (Ps. 31:5) and can be relied on to be
                     faithful to His word. But to emphasize His truthfulness and
                     reliability to human beings God has at times condescended to
                     confirm His statements with an oath. "He swore to Abraham
                     (Genesis 26:3), to Isaac (Psalm 105:9; Jeremiah 11:5), and to
                     David (Psalm 132:11; Acts 2:30)."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 203.
                     Note also the frequent use in Ezekiel of the formula, "As I live,
                     saith the Lord God" (Eze. 5:11; 14:16, 18, 20; 16:48, etc.).
                        "When God swears, He makes His own person the pledge of
                     the truth of His Word."—Gerhard Kittel, ed., Theological Dic-
                     tionary of the New Testament, vol. 4, p. 629. He cannot, then, go
                     back on His promises.

                       Of what, then, does this make Jesus the surety?

                        The Greek word for "surety" means a "guarantor," one who
                     accepts legal obligations in a bond. Jesus is made the guarantor
                     of a better covenant. This is the first occurrence of the word
                     translated "covenant" (RSV) in the epistle of Hebrews. More will
                     be said about it later, particularly in chapters 8 and 9. It is a
                     "better covenant" than the one God made with Israel at Sinai, in
                     that it is based on Christ's eternal promise to die for the sinner
                     and grant him forgiveness.

 THINK IT THROUGH      "In partaking with His disciples of the bread and wine, Christ
                     pledged Himself to them as their Redeemer. He committed to
                     them the new covenant, by which all who receive Him become
                     children of God, and joint heirs with Christ. By this covenant
                     every blessing that heaven could bestow for this life and the life
                     to come was theirs. This covenant deed was to be ratified with
                     the blood of Christ. And the administration of the Sacrament
                     was to keep before the disciples the infinite sacrifice made for
                     each of them individually as a part of the great whole of fallen
                     humanity."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 656-659.

 Superiority of Christ's Priesthood               LESSON 6                    ❑ Friday
                                                                              August 6
               Part 6     What final contrast is drawn between the Aaronic priests
    PERMANENCE OF       and Christ?
CHRIST'S PRIESTHOOD
                          "They truly were many priests, because they were not
                        suffered to continue by reason of death: but this man, be-
                        cause he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
                        Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
                        come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make in-
                        tercession for them" (Heb. 7:23-25).

                          The author contrasts "the many" with the one. Because these
                        high priests were subject to death, there was a succession of
                        replacements, with the people questioning, What will the new
                        priest be like? This One will be understanding and sympathetic,
                        and, because He is "alive for evermore," unchanging (Rev.
                        1:18). "He holds his priesthood permanently, because he
                        continues for ever" (RSV).

                         Because this is so, what is Christ able to do? For what does
                        He live? Heb. 7:25.

                           This permanency means that the way of access to God is
                        always open. The phrase "for all time" in the RSV was un-
                        derstood in this sense by the ancient Vulgate, Syriac, and Cop-
                        tic versions. Other ancient and modern interpreters understand
                        it as meaning "completely," "fully" or "wholly," as in the KJV,
                        "to the uttermost."
                           "Commentators are divided as to which meaning applies
                        here. Both are true, for Christ saves both completely and for all
                        time."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Heb. 7:25.
                           "He ever liveth to make intercession." But we shall see as we
                        examine Hebrews 9:24 that His intercessory work consists not
                        so much in verbal petitions, as suggested by "intercession,"
                        but in mighty and significant acts.
                           "All who come to Christ today are to remember that His merit
                        is the incense that mingles with the prayers of those who repent
                        of their sins and receive pardon and mercy and grace. Our need
                        of Christ's intercession is constant."—Ellen G. White Com-

                        Satan, and will stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince
                        Immanuel will be kept by Christ's intercessions. Christ, as our
                         Mediator, ... ever keeps us in view, for it is as necessary that He
                        should keep us by His intercessions as that He should redeem
                        us with His blood. If He lets go His hold of us for one moment,
                        Satan stands ready to destroy. Those purchased by His blood,

Heavenly Sanctum)




  "But now hath he obtained a more
excellent ministry, by how much also
he is the mediator of a better:
covenant, which was established upon
better promises" (Heb. 8:6).
   One of the key ideas of the book et
Hebrews is that Jesus and His work are
"better" or "more excellent" than a
stated object. Christ is as much
superior to the angels as His name "is
more excellent than theirs" (1:4, RSV).
Through our Lord's priestly ministry,
He has introduced "a better hope .
through which we draw near to God"
(7:19, RSV). Jesus is "the surety of a
better covenant" (7:22, RSV). His
ministry as a priest "is as much more
excellent than the old as the covenant
he mediates is better" (11:6, RSV). The
new covenant is better because it is
based on "better promises" (8:6).
Christ's priestly work is carried in a
 `greater and more perfect tabernaci e'
(9:11). The heavenly things are
purified "with better sacrifices (9:23).

              Part 1     What important characteristics does our High Priest have?
          THE IDEAL
        HIGH PRIEST
                         "For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
                       undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
                       heavens; who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer
                       up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's:
                       for this he did once, when he offered up himself" (Heb.
                       7:26, 27).

                          The epistle has set forth Christ, the Melchizedek priest, as
                       superior to the Aaronic priests. Now it deals specifically with
                       Christ as our High Priest. It was fitting for Christians (us),
                       because of their needs, to have the kind of high priest previously
                       described; particularly one who has power to save for all time,
                       and one who is eternal in being. Three personal characteristics
                       of our Lord are then named. The Greek word used in verse 26 for
                       "holy" "denotes His oneness with God."—The Expositor's
                       Greek Testament, vol. 4, p. 318. In the Greek translation of the
                       Old Testament it often represents the Hebrew word translated
                       "loving kindness." "Harmless" indicates His innocency; He has
                       never done any evil. And though He shared the lot of human
                       beings on earth and associated with sinners, He was "unde-
                       filed." His life was never stained by sin. In this respect He is
                       marked off from human beings, which is suggested by the
                       phrase, "separate from sinners." Finally, He has been "made
                       higher than the heavens," that is, raised to a sphere of celestial
                       purity and glory and a position of universal power.

                         What does our High Priest not need? What sacrifice did He
                       offer? How often? Verse 27.

                         Although there is no record of a prescribed daily offering that
                       high priests offered for their own sins, the Levitical law did
                       prescribe sin offerings to be offered by "the anointed priest who
                       sins" (Lev. 4:3, RSV). On the Day of Atonement only the high
                       priest could officiate, and on that day he specifically offered a
                       sin offering to make atonement "for himself, and for his house"
                       (Lev. 16:6, 11). But Christ had no sin, and hence needed no
                       atonement for Himself, but for the people He made atonement
                       "once, when he offered up himself." Thus He "took the form of a
                       servant, and offered the sacrifice, himself the priest, himself the
                       victim."—Ellen G. White, The Southern Watchman, Aug. 6,

                         What contrast is drawn between men appointed priests by
                       the law and the Son made a priest by the word of an oath? Heb.

Heavenly Sanctuary and New Covenant                  LESSON 7         ❑ Monday
                                                                       August 9

          Part 2      "Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum:
   OUR PRIEST IN    We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
   THE HEAVENLY     throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the
     SANCTUARY      sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched,
                    and not man" (Heb. 8:1, 2).

                       The author now gives the gist of what he has in mind. We as
                    Christians not only have a high priest, but "such an high priest,"
                    a high priest with the character portrayed in chapter 7, par-
                    ticularly verses 26 and 27. He is not only a priest but a priest
                    "who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty [God]
                    in the heavens." He is the Priest-King to whom "angels and
                    authorities and powers" have been made subject (1 Peter 3:22).

                      What is the scene of Christ's priesthood? Heb. 8:2.

                      "Sanctuary" here is literally, "holy places." Various expla-
                    nations for the use of the plural have been suggested. (See SDA
                    Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 444.) That sanctuary is the "true
                    tent" or "real tabernacle" in heaven.
                      "Here is revealed the sanctuary of the new covenant. The
                    sanctuary of the first covenant was pitched by man, built by
                    Moses; this is pitched by the Lord, not by man. In that sanctuary
                    the earthly priests performed their service; in this, Christ, our
                    great High Priest, ministers at God's right hand. One sanctuary
                    was on earth, the other is in heaven."—The Great Controversy,
                    p. 413.

                      What else did Christ's ministry as a priest necessitate?
                    Verses 3, 4.

                       As Hebrews 5:1 states, "every high priest ... is ordained ...
                    that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins." Therefore Christ
                    must also have something to offer. What He offers is not
                    mentioned here, but in Hebrews 9:14 it is plainly declared to be
                    His own blood. But He could not minister His blood until it was
                    shed. Thus we have a clue regarding the time when His priestly
                    service in heaven began. As further evidence that Jesus' minis-
                    try is in heaven, the epistle shows that Christ could not have
                    been a priest on earth according to the law.

 THINK IT THROUGH     "The heart belongs to Jesus. He has paid an infinite price for
                    the soul; and He intercedes before the Father as our Mediator,
                    pleading not as a petitioner, but as conqueror who would claim
                    that which is His own. He is able to save to the uttermost, for He
                    ever lives to make intercession for us."—Messages to Young

Heavenly Sanctuary and New Covenant                    LESSON 7 ❑ Tuesday
                                                                 August 10
            Part 3   Of what was the earthly sanctuary example and shadow?
      A SHADOW OF
     THE HEAVENLY    "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly
        SANCTUARY things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about
                   to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all
                   things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount"
                   (Heb. 8:5).

                       Hebrews contains several figures to show the relation be-
                     tween the Mosaic tabernacle and the heavenly sanctuary. Here
                     the author refers to it as an example and a shadow.
                        "The matchless splendor of the earthly tabernacle reflected
                     to human vision the glories of that heavenly temple where Christ
                     our forerunner ministers for us before the throne of God. The
                     abiding place of the King of kings, where thousand thousands
                     minister unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand
                     before Him (Daniel 7:10); that temple, filled with the glory of the
                     eternal throne, where seraphim, its shining guardians, veil their
                     faces in adoration, could find, in the most magnificent structure
                     ever reared by human hands, but a faint reflection of its vastness
                     and glory. Yet important truths concerning the heavenly
                     sanctuary and the great work there carried forward for man's
                     redemption were taught by the earthly sanctuary and its
                     service."—The Great Controversy, p. 414.

                       In addition to verbal instruction, how was Moses informed
                     about the construction of the ancient tabernacle? Heb. 8:5.
                     (Compare Ex. 25:8, 9, 40; Num. 8:4.)

                        The word translated "pattern" in Exodus 25:9 means literally
                      "construction," which suggests that Moses was shown a scale
                     model of the structure he was to build and given verbal ex-
                     planations concerning it. Following this came the injunction:
                     "See that you make them after the pattern for them, which is
                      being shown you on the mountain" (Ex. 25:40, RSV).
                        "The tabernacle was made according to the commandment
                     of God. The Lord raised up men and qualified them with more
                     than natural abilities to perform the most ingenious work.
                     Neither Moses nor those workmen were left to plan the form and
                     workmanship of the building. God Himself devised the plan and
                     gave it to Moses, with particular directions as to its size and
                     form and the materials to be used, and specified every article of
                     furniture which was to be in it. He presented before Moses a
                     miniature model of the heavenly sanctuary and commanded
                     him to make all things according to the pattern showed him in
                     the mount. Moses wrote all the directions in a book and read
                     them to the most influential people."—The Story of Redemp-

Heavenly Sanctuary and New Covenant                LESSON 7 ❑ Wednesday
                                                               August 11
          Part 4      What has Christ obtained and what has He mediated?
  MEDIATOR OF A
BETTER COVENANT       "But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by
                    how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which
                    was established upon better promises" (Heb. 8:6).

                       "Ministry" is here a term for priestly service. The place where
                    our Lord's priestly service is performed is the heavenly
                    sanctuary of which the tabernacle built by Moses was only a
                    type and shadow (verses 1 and 2). Christ's priestly service "of
                    the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord
                    pitched" (verse 2), surpasses that of the Aaronic priests as a
                    substance surpasses a shadow, or a reality a type. It is "a more
                    excellent ministry" because it is effective. Furthermore its
                    excellency is shown by the new covenant under which its ser-
                    vice is performed.
                       Christ is the "mediator" of this "better covenant." He thus
                    transcends and replaces Moses who was the mediator of the old
                    covenant. "Mediates," literally, "is a mediator." A mediator is
                    one who stands in the middle between two parties and brings
                    them together. He is one whom both parties can trust as, for
                    example, an umpire or an arbitrator. But the term also came to
                    have the additional meaning of one who is a guarantor of the
                    carrying out of an agreement. It is evident that this further
                    meaning is included when Jesus is called the Mediator of the
                    new covenant. In chapter 7:22 Jesus is called "the surety of a
                    better testament." Our Lord mediates the new covenant and
                    guarantees the salvation it brings, for it includes His vicarious
                    death.

                      In what respect is the covenant that Christ mediates better
                    than the old? Heb. 8:6.

                      Of the "old covenant" Ellen G. White wrote: "God brought
                    them to Sinai; He manifested His glory; He gave them His law,
                    with the promise of great blessings on condition of
                    obedience."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 371.
                      But the " 'new covenant' was established on 'better
                    promises'—the promise of forgiveness of sins and of the grace
                    of God to renew the heart and bring it into harmony with the
                    principles of God's law."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 372.

 THINK IT THROUGH     "Christ has pledged Himself to be our substitute and surety,
                    and He neglects no one. He who could not see human beings
                    exposed to eternal ruin without pouring out His soul unto death
                    in their behalf, will look with pity and compassion upon every
                    soul who realizes that he cannot save himself."—Christ's Ob-

              Part 5     In what respect was the first covenant faulty?
       THE FAULT OF
THE FIRST COVENANT
                          "For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
                       place have been sought for the second. For finding fault with
                       them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I
                       will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the
                       house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made
                       with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to
                       lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not
                       in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord" (Heb.
                       8:7-9).


                          There was nothing inherently wrong with the first covenant or
                        with the promises God made to those who would keep it. God
                       always requires obedience. As for the people's promise, we
                        have been told: "This is the pledge that God's people are to
                        make in these last days."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                       Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1103.
                          "True victory is gained only when the repentant sinner
                       pledges himself ... to honor God in every word, every business
                       transaction, every act of his life."—Ellen G. White, Youth's
                       Instructor, Jan. 17, 1911.
                          What, then, was the fault of the first covenant? The fault was
                       not with the promises, but with the promisers—the people. They
                       failed to recognize their own inability to keep the pledges they
                       were making.
                          "Living in the midst of idolatry and corruption, they had no
                       true conception of the holiness of God, of the exceeding sin-
                       fulness of their own hearts, their utter inability, in themselves, to
                       render obedience to God's law, and their need of a Saviour. All
                       this they must be taught. . . .
                          "The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts,
                       and that without Christ it was impossible for them to keep God's
                       law; and they readily entered into covenant with God. Feeling
                       that they were able to establish their own righteousness, they
                       declared, 'All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obe-
                       dient.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 371, 372.
                         Even before they left Sinai, they erected the golden calf while
                       awaiting the return of Moses with the tables of the Decalogue.
                       The epistle quotes from Jeremiah 31:31, 32 in showing the need
                       for a better covenant.

                                                                         August 13
            Part 6     What promises does God make under the new covenant?
      PROMISES OF
THE NEW COVENANT
                       "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
                     Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into
                     their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them
                     a God, and they shall be to me a people. . . . For I will be
                     merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their
                     iniquities will I remember no more" (Heb. 8:10-12).


                        The new covenant embodies three promises of God: 1. "I will
                     put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts." This
                     means more than committing them to memory. Memorization
                     does not necessarily include conformity of life to what is
                     memorized. In the Bible the heart is the center of the whole
                     inner being of man—the feelings, understanding, thought,
                     reflection, will, and the religious and moral life. 10.have God's
                     laws written on the heart denotes a change in this inner center
                     of being. Ezekiel described it as the gift of a new heart of flesh
                     and a new spirit, "that they may walk in my statutes, and keep
                     mine ordinances, and do them" (Eze. 11:20). God says, "I will
                     put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes,
                     and ye shall keep my judgments" (Eze. 36:27).
                        2. A direct, personal knowledge of God. "And I will be to them
                     a God, and they shall be to me a people.... All shall know me,
                     from the least to the greatest" (Heb. 8:10, 11). This means that
                     there will be a direct access to God, without the need of human
                     mediators such as the Aaronic priests.
                        3. God promises to forgive and forget their sins. It is thus a
                     covenant of grace promising pardon, full and free.

                       What does the very fact that God speaks of a new covenant
                     imply concerning the old? Heb. 8:13.


THINK IT THROUGH       "All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work
                     with Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with
                     our thoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into
                     conformity to His will, that when obeying Him we shall be but
                     carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined and sanctified,
                     will find its highest delight in doing His service. When we know
                     God as it is our privilege to know Him, our life will be a life of
                     continual obedience. Through an appreciation of the character
                     of Christ, through communion with God, sin will become hate-
                     ful to us."—The Desire of Ages, p. 668.

              Part 1     What does Hebrews say that the first covenant had?
     TABERNACLE AND
          FURNITURE      "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of di-
                       vine service, and a worldly sanctuary. For there was a
                       tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and
                       the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary"
                       (Heb. 9:1, 2).

                          To assert that even the first covenant had regulations for
                       worship and a sanctuary is to imply that the second or new
                       covenant likewise has them. The ancient tabernacle is here
                       designated as an earthly as opposed to a heavenly sanctuary. It
                       partook of the nature of the world, which in itself implies its
                       transitory nature. It consisted of two parts: the first called the
                       holy place, and the second the holy of holies. Inasmuch as the
                       first apartment was used every day in the year, while the second
                       was used only on the Day of Atonement, they are practically
                       regarded as separate institutions.
                          Two articles of furniture are mentioned as located in the first
                       apartment. On the south was the golden lampstand, or
                       menorah, which "consisted of an upright shaft, from each side
                       of which three branches extended upward, in pairs .. , to the
                       same level."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Ex. 25:31. On the
                       north side stood the table with "the bread of the Presence"
                       (Heb. 9:2, RSV).

                        What articles of furniture belonged to the holy of holies?
                       Describe the second article and its contents. Heb. 9:3-5.

                          The apartment behind the second veil was called "the Holy of
                       Holies" (RSV) because God was regarded as enthroned there
                       on or above the cherubim. (See 1 Sam. 4:4; 2 Sam. 6:2; 2 Kings
                       19:15; Ps. 80: 1; 99:1.) Above the mercy seat, between the two
                       cherubims, God revealed Himself to Moses (Ex. 25:22; Num.
                       7:89). The ark primarily contained the tables of the covenant on
                       which the Ten Commandments were written. (See Ex. 25:16;
                       32:15, 16; 34:28, 29: Deut. 9:9, 10; 10:1-5.)
                          It is to be noted that Hebrews associates the altar of incense
                       with the holy of holies. Actually it was located in the first
                       apartment before the veil (Ex. 30:6; 40:5). But because of its
                       close association with the second apartment in the tabernacle
                       ritual, it is mentioned with it: "The Altar of incense bore the
                       same relation to the Holy of Holies as the Altar of burnt offering
                       to the Holy place. It furnished in some sense the means of
                       approach to it."—B. J. Westcott, The Epistle to the Hebrews, p.
                       247. (Compare 1 Kings 6:22.)

Christ's High-priestly Service          LESSON 8                       ❑ Monday
                                                                         August 16
           Part 2     What sharp contrast is drawn between the access of the
     SERVICES OF    priests to the two apartments respectively?
  THE SANCTUARY

                      "Now when' these things were thus ordained, the priests
                    went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the
                    service of God. But into the second went the high priest alone
                    once every year, not without blood, which he offered for
                    himself, and for the errors of the people" (Heb. 9:6, 7).


                       "The ministration of the sanctuary consisted of two divisions,
                    a daily and a yearly service. The daily service was performed at
                    the altar of burnt offering in the court of the tabernacle and in
                    the holy place; while the yearly service was in the most
                    holy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 352.
                       The daily service was performed every day throughout the
                    year continually. (See Heb. 10:11.) It consisted of the "con-
                    tinual" (Ex. 29:38-42; Num. 28:3-8); the perpetual offering of
                    incense on the golden altar morning and evening (Ex. 30:7-9);
                    the offering of shewbread or "bread of the Presence" on the
                    table before the Lord "alway" (Ex. 25:30); and the continually
                    burning olive oil lamps (Ex. 27:20, 21; 30:7, 8; Lev. 24:2-4). On
                    Sabbaths, new moons, and special feasts there were additional
                    offerings. Besides these regular offerings there were special
                    burnt, cereal, peace, and sin offerings for individuals, the last of
                    which was the most important.
                       Sharply to be distinguished from this continual daily service
                    was the special ritual on the Day of Atonement, centering in the
                    holy of holies. Only the high priest could enter this sacred place,
                    and he only once a year, on the tenth day of the seventh month,
                    and even he only by means of atoning blood. With that blood he
                    made atonement for his own sins as well as for the errors of the
                    people.


                      What estimate of the efficacy of this ritual system does the
                    epistle now give? Heb. 9:8-10.


                      Access to the heavenly sanctuary was not available while the
                    earthly sanctuary had validity. As long as that was the case, the
                    service in the heavenly sanctuary could not begin. The efficacy
                    of the earthly sanctuary however was very restricted. It was
                    "symbolic for the present age" (RSV) and could not purify the
                    conscience of the worshiper. Its services were not only in-
                    adequate but temporary.

              Part 3     What contrasts are drawn between the heavenly sanctuary
      A HIGH PRIEST    with its offering and the earthly sanctuary with its offerings?
     OF GOOD THINGS
                         "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to
                       come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made
                       with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the
                       blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in
                       once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption
                       for us" (Heb. 9:11, 12).

                          "But Christ being come an high priest" evidently indicates
                       the time when He was inaugurated High Priest of the heavenly
                       sanctuary. He ministers "the good things that have come"
                       (RSV).
                          These gospel blessings have come in and through Christ in
                       whom "the shadows have given way to the perfect and abiding
                       reality."—F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Hebrews. The New
                       International Commentary on the New Testament, p. 199.
                          Instead of using a man-made tabernacle for His service,
                       Christ employed a "greater and more perfect tabernacle."
                          "That sanctuary, in which Jesus ministers in our behalf, is the
                       great original, of which the sanctuary built by Moses was a copy.
                          "The heavenly temple, the abiding place of the King of kings...
                       —no earthly structure could represent its vastness and its
                       glory."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 357.
                          The superiority of Christ's priestly ministry rests not only in its
                       once-for-all nature but also in the superior offering He
                       presents—His own blood.

                         In contrast to that which was accomplished by the blood of
                       goats and bulls, what efficacy does the blood of Jesus have?
                       Verses 13, 14.

                         On the Day of Atonement the blood of goats and bulls was
                       carried into the most holy place by the high priest. (See Lev.
                       16:5-9, 11-16.) These animal sacrifices had a typical signifi-
                       cance and removed external ceremonial pollution; but Christ's
                       unblemished sacrificial death atones for all sin, and hence can
                       bring inward and spiritual cleansing.

 THINK IT THROUGH        "Christ's priestly intercession is now going on in the
                       sanctuary above in our behalf. But how few have a real un-
                       derstanding that our great High Priest presents before the
                       Father His own blood, claiming for the sinner who receives Him
                       as his personal Saviour all the graces which His covenant
                       embraces as the reward of His sacrifice."—Ellen G. White

Christ's High-priestly Service         LESSON 8                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    August 18
         Part 4   "Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that
 INAUGURATOR OF those who are called may receive the promised eternal in-
 A NEW COVENANT heritance, since a death has occurred which redeems them
                from the transgressions under the first covenant" (Heb. 9:15,
                RSV).

                      "Therefore," that is, because Christ's sacrificial death
                    removed sin and leads to serving God, Jesus is the inaugurator
                    and guarantor of a new covenant. He provides the very elements
                    promised by the covenant. Jesus indicated that this new cov-
                    enant was to be based on His death, for at the Last Supper He
                    said concerning the wine, "this is my blood of the covenant,
                    which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt.
                    26:28, RSV).

                      When only does a will or testament become effective? Heb.
                    9:16, 17.

                      The Greek word for "covenant" can also be used for a will,
                    and in Hebrews 9:16,17 a play is made on the double meaning of
                    the term. A will, as distinguished from a covenant, does not take
                    effect until the death of the one who made it. In this respect the
                    new covenant is like a will, for its provisions are based on the
                    death of Christ. On no other basis could grace and forgiveness
                    be extended to the guilty.

                      How was the first covenant inaugurated? Heb. 9:18-20; Ex.
                    24:3-8.

                      A covenant is based on promises. God promised to make
                    Israel His special people, "a kingdom of priests, and an holy
                    nation" (Ex. 19:6). In response to God's proposed covenant
                    Israel promised to be loyal and obedient to God (Ex. 19:7, 8;
                    24:3, 7). Hebrews gives the detail not mentioned in Exodus that
                    the blood was sprinkled on the book and on the people along
                    with the statement, "This is the blood of the covenant which
                    God commanded you" (Heb. 9:20, RSV). The vessels of the
                    earthly sanctuary were also dedicated with blood (verse 21). The
                    general principle is then laid down: "Without the shedding of
                    blood there is no forgiveness of sins" (verse 22, RSV).

 THINK IT THROUGH     "The atonement of Christ sealed forever the everlasting
                    covenant of grace. It was the fulfilling of every condition upon
                    which God suspended the free communication of grace to the
                    human family. Every barrier was then broken down which in-
                    tercepted the freest exercise of grace, mercy, peace, and love to
                    the most guilty of Adam's race."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                                                                        August 19
              Part 5     How does the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary differ
       CLEANSING OF    from that of the earthly?
     THE SANCTUARY
                         "If, then, these sacrifices cleanse the copies of heavenly
                       things, those heavenly things themselves require better
                       sacrifices to cleanse them" (Heb. 9:23, NEB).

                          "The patterns of things in the heavens," that is, the earthly
                       sanctuary and its furnishings, were purified with the blood of
                       goats and bulls, but "the heavenly things themselves" with the
                       sacrifice of Christ.
                          "As anciently the sins of the people were by faith placed upon
                       the sin offering and through its blood transferred, in figure, to
                       the earthly sanctuary, so in the new covenant the sins of the
                       repentant are by faith placed upon Christ and transferred, in
                       fact, to the heavenly sanctuary. And as the typical cleansing of

                         Where has Christ entered, and what is He doing there?
                       Verse 24.

                          Christ has entered the heavenly sanctuary "now to appear in
                       the presence of God for us." "Now" emphasized the truth, not
                       only that He was there in the days when Hebrews was written,
                       but is continuously there in the presence of the Father. Christ
                       appears there as the believers' representative. His acceptance
                       is their acceptance. In Christ they become the objects of God's
                       regard. Both the sacrifice of Jesus and His entrance into the
                       most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary are once-for-all acts.
                       "Now in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin
                       by the sacrifice of himself" (verse 26). Jesus thus occupies the
                       dual position of offering and priest.

 THINK IT THROUGH        "Jesus stands in the holy of holies, now to appear in the
                       presence of God for us. There He ceases not to present His
                       people moment by moment, complete in Himself. But because
                       we are thus represented before the Father, we are not to imag-
                       ine that we are to presume upon His mercy, and become
                       careless, indifferent, and self-indulgent. Christ is not the
                       minister of sin. We are complete in Him, accepted in the Be-
                       loved, only as we abide in Him by faith."—Ellen G. White

      HIGH PRIEST
                       "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
                     the judgment; so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
                     many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the
                     second time without sin unto salvation" (Heb. 9:27, 28).

                         Unlike the round of sacrificial services of the earthly
                     sanctuary which were repeated year after year, Jesus' single
                     sacrifice is effective for all time. To further emphasize this
                     repeatedly stated truth (Heb. 7:27; 9:12, 26) an analogy is drawn.
                     It is the lot of every man to die because sin that brought death is
                     the lot of all men (Rom. 5:12). But this side of the judgment
                     man's death is a once-for-all thing, not repeated or followed by a
                     return to earth. But after death they must still face the judgment.
                     "So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and .
                     shall . . . appear the second time."
                         This appearance is the last of three manifestations of Christ in
                     Hebrews 9:23 through 28, all of which are vital in man's re-
                     demption:
                         1. He has appeared "once in the end of the world . . . to put
                     away sin by the sacrifice of himself" (verse 26).
                         2. Christ has entered "into heaven itself, now to appear in the
                     presence of God for us" (verse 24).
                         3. "Christ . . . shall . . . appear the second time" (verse 28).
                         After finishing His work as our High Priest, He will be man-
                     ifested again "not to deal with sin but to save those who are
                     eagerly waiting for him" (RSV).
                         "In the typical service the high priest, having made the
                     atonement for Israel, came forth and blessed the congregation.
                     So Christ, at the close of His work as mediator, will appear... to

                      glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."

                    purged should have had no more conscience of sins" (Heb.
                    10:1, 2).


                         This text gives a concise summary of the argument presented
                      in chapters 7 through 9. "The law" is the Levitical law of sac-
                      rifices and priesthood. This sacrificial and priestly system was
                      in and of itself ineffective in solving the sin problem. It was not
                      an exact replica, but only a pale shadow, or better, a
                      foreshadowing of the reality—the atoning sacrifice and priestly
                      ministry of Jesus Christ.
                         The ineffectiveness of the Levitical system is shown by its
                      constant repetition. It had to be done again and again, year in
                      and year out. That this had to be done "continually" shows that
                      it could not cure the disease of sin. "Continually" or "contin-
                      ual" are used frequently in connection with the ritual service of
                      the earthly tabernacle. There was in them no ultimate remedy
                      for sin. Had there been, their constant repetition would have
                      ceased, for men would have been cured of their sinful ways.
                      They would have been once for all cleansed and cured.


                       Of what were the sacrifices a reminder? What could they not
                     do? Heb. 10:3, 4.


                        The value of the Levitical system was in its foreshadowing of
                     the good things to "come"—the salvation itself in the person
                     and work of Christ. "Justice demands that sin be not merely
                     pardoned, but the death penalty must be executed. God, in the
                     gift of His only-begotten Son, met both these requirements. By
                     dying in man's stead, Christ exhausted the penalty and provided
                     a pardon."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

                        "The forgiveness of sins is not the sole result of the death of
                     Jesus. He made the infinite sacrifice, not only that sin might be
                     removed, but that human nature might be restored, re-

      SACRIFICE
                   "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sac-
                rifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou
                prepared me: in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou
                hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of
                the book it is written of me,)to do thy will, 0 God" (Heb. 10:5-7).

                      "Wherefore," that is, because of the ineffectiveness of the
                   Levitical sacrifices, when our Lord was incarnated in human
                   flesh, He is represented as having uttered the words of Psalm
                   40:6-8. The four terms used, sacrifices, offerings, burnt of-
                   ferings, and sin offerings suggest the whole sacrificial system.
                   Although God instituted this system, these sacrifices were not
                   for God's pleasure, but for the spiritual instruction of man.
                      "The sacrificial offerings were ordained by God to be to man a
                   perpetual reminder and a penitential acknowledgment of his sin
                   and a confession of his faith in the promised Redeemer. They
                   were intended to impress upon the fallen race the solemn truth
                   that it was sin that caused death."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   p. 68.
                      "The sacrificial offerings were in themselves of no value in the
                   sight of God. They were designed to express on the part of the
                   offerer penitence for sin and faith in Christ and to pledge future
                   obedience to the law of God. But without penitence, faith, and
                   an obedient heart, the offerings were worthless."—Patriarchs
                   and Prophets, p. 634.
                      Instead of following the Hebrew of Psalm 40:6 which reads,
                   "mine ears hast thou opened," the epistle quotes the reading of
                   the Septuagint, "but a body hast thou prepared for me." An
                   "open ear" (compare Isa. 50:4, 5) suggests wholehearted
                   obedience. The ultimate meaning of the Septuagint text is not
                   much different, for in this human body He came to carry out
                   God's will. It is this that made Christ's sacrifice effectual, for He
                   carried His obedience to God's will so far as to die even on a
                   cross. (See Phil. 2:8.)

                      What did Christ abolish? establish? By what have we been
                    sanctified? Heb. 10:9, 10.

                       "Entire conformity to the will of our Father which is in heaven
                    is alone sanctification, and the will of God is expressed in His
                    holy law. The keeping of all the commandments of God is
                    sanctification. Proving yourselves obedient children to God's
                    word is sanctification."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald,

                     offerings were ineffective in actually taking away sins, Christ's
                     single offering has perpetual validity in perfecting "for ever
                     them that are sanctified," or, "are being sanctified." At God's
                     right hand Christ waits "till his enemies be made his footstool."
                     This quotes in part Psalm 110:1, which contains "a reference to
                     an Oriental custom according to which the victor placed his foot
                     on the neck of enemies as a sign of their submission."—SDA
                     Bible Commentary, on Heb. 1:13. While Christ waits, He actively
                     carries on His priestly function.

                       With what is the "perfection" of which the epistle speaks
                     bound up? Heb. 10:15-17. (See RSV.)

                        The old covenant and its sacrificial system could not provide
                     the "perfection" that is needed. Once again the epistle reverts
                     to the prophecy of a new covenant, which contains two essen-
                     tial provisions: (1) an implanting of God's law in human hearts,
                     that is, moral and spiritual renewal and (2) a full and final pa, ion
                     of sins. Note that these inspired words from Jeremiah 31:33 are
                     quoted as the witness of the Holy Spirit to the truthfulness of the
                     conclusions previously drawn.

                      When a complete cancellation of sin has taken place, what
                     would naturally cease? Heb. 10:18.

                       By the Day of Atonement in Israel's sacrificial system there
                     was "a remembrance again made of sins every year" (verse 3).
                     But with the complete atonement provided by the sacrifice of
                     Christ and His priestly work the believer will never be reminded
                     of his sins again. Hence the acceptance of the one perfect
                     sacrifice would make further offerings superfluous.

 THINK IT THROUGH      "Our sanctification is the work of the Father, the Son, and the
                     Holy Spirit. It is the fulfillment of the covenant that God has
                     made with those who bind themselves up with Him, to stand
                     with Him, His Son, and His Spirit in holy fellowship."—Ellen G.

The Foreshadowing and the Reality                LESSON 9          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      August 25
           Part 4      "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
CONFIDENT ACCESS    holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which
  THROUGH CHRIST    he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his
                    flesh; and having an high priest over the house of God; let us
                    draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith" (Heb.
                    10:19-22).

                      Verse 19 marks the transition from doctrine to application
                    and exhortation in the epistle. Because of what Christ has done,
                    the readers are urged to accept the privileges and respon-
                    sibilities involved. "By the blood of Jesus," that is, by His aton-
                    ing death, they may have not only permission, but confidence to
                    enter the very presence of God freely. This was symbolized by
                    the rending of the temple veil at the crucifixion.

                      What three admonitions are then given in verses 22-25?

                       1. Because we have a representative with the Father, clothed
                    in human nature, yet holy and undefiled, "let us'draw near"
                    (verse 22) to avail ourselves of the opportunities and blessings
                    so graciously provided. We are to come "with a true heart," that
                    is, with sincerity and wholeheartedness, and "in full assurance
                    of faith," based on a personal appropriation of the atoning and
                    mediatorial work of Jesus, and with "our hearts sprinkled from
                    an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
                       2. The second ad monition is to continue holding fast the
                    (public) confession of our hope in God's promises and salvation
                    without wavering. In the trying days ahead the act of confessing
                    will strengthen our hold on hope. "God is behind the promises
                    He makes. He is ever mindful of His covenant, and His truth
                    end ureth to all generations."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                    Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 943.
                       3. Finally, we are to note carefully the spiritual welfare of one
                    another and "consider one another to provoke unto love and to
                    good works." "Christian faith and witness will flourish the more
                    vigorously in an atmosphere of Christian fellowship."—F. F.
                    Bruce, The Epistle to the Hebrews. The New International
                    Commentary on the New Testament, p. 253. Hence the need for
                    Christian gatherings which are all the more important as the day
                    (of Christ's coming) draws near (Heb. 10:25).

 THINK IT THROUGH     "The Lord has determined that every soul who obeys his word
                    shall have his joy, his peace, his continual keeping power. Such
                    men and women are brought near him always, not only when
                    they kneel before him in prayer, but when they take up the duties
                    of life."—Ellen G. White, Southern Watchman, Feb. 23, 1904, p.

                                                                        August 26
          Part 5   "For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
DANGER OF WILLFUL knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for
        SINNING  sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
                 indignation, which shall devour the adversaries" (Heb. 10:26,
                 27).

                        The present tense of the Greek text means "if we choose to go
                     on sinning" (Goodspeed). A willful persistence in sin for an
                     enlightened Christian is fatal. To know the way of salvation, but
                     to reject it, is to close the door to all hope of eternal life.
                        "There will be no excuse for those who choose to go in error
                     when they might understand what is truth. In His sufferings and
                     death Jesus has made atonement for all sins of ignorance, but
                     there is no provision made for willful blindness."—Ellen G.
                     White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1145.
                        To bring home to readers the seriousness of spurning Christ
                     and His salvation, the epistle urges the readers to consider the
                     severity with which willful sinners were punished under the
                     leadership of Moses. As examples, study the case of the
                     blasphemer (Lev. 24:10-16) and the case of the deliberate
                     Sabbath breaker (Num. 15:32-36). (See Patriarchs and
                     Prophets, p. 409.)
                        "A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy
                     at the testimony of two or three witnesses" (Heb. 10:28, RSV).
                     (See also Deut. 13:8; 17:2-6; 19:13, 15.) The author then appeals
                     to the sense of justice of his readers: "How much worse
                     punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has
                     spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the cove-
                     nant by which he was sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of
                     grace?" (Heb. 10:29, RSV).
                        "To spurn the Son of God, to trample Him underfoot (as the
                     word literally means), 'denotes contempt of the most flagrant
                     kind'; to treat the covenant-blood of Christ, by which alone His
                     people are sanctified, cleansed and brought to God, as no
                     better than the most common death, is to repudiate decisively
                     both His sacrifice and all the blessings which flow from it; to
                     outrage the Spirit of grace is, in the words of Jesus, to be 'guilty
                     of an eternal sin' (Mark 3:29)."—F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the
                     Hebrews. The New International Commentary on the New
                     Testament, pp. 259, 260.

                       To drive home this warning, what quotations from the Song
                     of Moses in Deuteronomy 32 are given? Heb.10:30. (See Deut.
                     32:35, 36.)

                       This should give us a sense of the awesome holiness of God
                     and warn us against regarding Him or His cause with
                     carelessness or contempt.

The Foreshadowing and the Reality                LESSON 9                  ❑ Friday
                                                                           August 27

   PERSEVERANCE after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the
                promise. For yet a little while, and he that shall come will
                come, and will not tarry" (Heb. 10:35-37).

                    To what victorious experiences of former days does
                  "therefore" refer? Verses 32-34.

                      The epistle now turns to encouragement and assurance. The
                  readers are urged to remember how they triumphed in former
                  days of affliction and trial. They had stood firm in the face of
                  public exposure to insult and persecutions. (See Luke 6:22, 23.)
                  They had also voluntarily suffered the unpopularity of being
                  linked with their partners who were imprisoned and persecuted
                  as disreputable criminals.
                      "Prisoners who had no means of their own were liable to
                  starve unless their friends brought them food and whatever
                  other form of help they required; throughout the whole age of
                  imperial persecution of the Church the visiting of their friends
                  who were in prison was a regular, though dangerous, duty of
                  Christian charity."—F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Hebrews, The
                  New International Commentary on the New Testament, p. 270.
                      They had also joyfully endured under economic pressure
                  when their property was confiscated. They were able to do this
                  because they were sure that there awaited them in the future a
                  better possession which no one could take from them.
                      With all these victories in their past, should they now throw
                  away their confidence as a worthless thing? Continue to hold it
                  fast, for it will bring a great reward when God fulfills His
                  promises.
                      This exhortation is supported by the assurance: "For yet a
                  little while [literally, 'for yet a little, how very, how very], and the
                  coming one shall come, and shall not tarry" (RSV). This passage
                  is a quotation from the Greek translation of Habakkuk 2:3. This
                  assurance of the nearness of the advent should encourage
                  them to hold on to their confidence. Meanwhile they are, like
                  Habakkuk, to live by faith and not give up.

                    With what group does the author of the epistle identify
                  himself? Heb. 10:39.

                    The Christian life begins with a wholehearted trust in God's
                  assurances of love and grace to a sinner. If one is to lay hold of
                  eternal life, he must continue to cling to God's promises. The
                  author expresses his confidence that his readers will do just
                  that, and in that determination he joins them.

                        The term "faith" has more than one meaning in the New
                     Testament, and it is doubtful that the author intends to give a
                     general comprehensive definition of it. Rather he presents two
                     aspects of faith as illustrated in the lives of the examples given
                     in Hebrews 11. Faith makes real two realms that are important to
                     the Christian: (1) the realm of the future kingdom of God, and (2)
                     the invisible realm above where God now rules. Faith is a
                     confident assurance in the reality of the future life and all that
                     the hereafter means. The man of faith realizes that the present
                     age with its evils and sufferings is but temporal. He is fully
                     persuaded that there is an eternity of righteousness, peace, and
                     joy beyond. He has an inner conviction that this life is only the
                     beginning of a greater, more abundant life hereafter.
                        "Faith is the substance of things hoped for." But faith is also a
                     conviction about a present unseen realm of spiritual realities.
                     Because of such faith, a Christian does not look "at the things
                     which are seen ... : for the things which are seen are temporal,
                     but the things which are not seen are eternal" (2 Cor. 4:18).
                     Hence, the Christian walks "by faith, not by sight" (2 Cor. 5:7).
                     He not only looks to the future, but he has a confident trust in the
                     unseen reality of God's present help.
                        Since the term translated "substance" is found in ancient
                     sources as a name for documents bearing on the ownership of
                     property, Moulton and Milligan have suggested the following
                     translation of the first clause: "Faith is the title-deed of things
                     hoped for."—The Vocabulary of the Greek Testament (London:
                     Hodder and Stoughton, Ltd., 1952), p. 660. This bold rendering
                     challenges one to contemplate the real meaning of faith. "As
                     surely as the oak is in the acorn, so surely is the gift of God in His
                     promise. If we receive the promise, we have the gift."—

                     Healing, p. 414. Belief in creation rests upon an acceptance of
                     the revelation that "all things, material or spiritual, stood up
                     before the Lord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His

The Faith of the Patriarchs        LESSON 10                         ❑ Monday
                                                                      August 30
         Part 2   "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice
      THE FAITH than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righ-
      OF THREE teous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet
   ANTEDILUVIANS speaketh" (Heb. 11:4).

                     As the most prominent representatives of the man of old, who
                   by their faith received divine approval, the author selects from
                   the earliest period Abel, Enoch, and Noah. The story of Abel and
                   Cain (Gen. 4:3-15) illustrates the fact that an acceptable wor-
                   shiper must approach God in faith, which includes a loving and
                   obedient heart. While "Cain cherished feelings of rebellion and
                   murmured against God," Abel came with "a spirit of loyalty"
                   and of total dependence upon God for pardon.—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 71. "He saw himself a sinner, and he saw sin and its
                   penalty, death, standing between his soul and communion with
                   God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 72. By his sacrifice he
                   acknowledged the claims of the law and expressed his faith in a
                   coming atonement. His offering was therefore accepted, and he
                   received approval as righteous in God's sight.

                     What unique experience did Enoch have? What testimony
                   regarding him preceded this glorious event? Heb. 11:5.

                      The brief record of Enoch's life in Genesis 5:21-24, climaxes
                   with the statement: "Enoch walked with God: and he was not;
                   for God took him." The RSV of Hebrews 11:5 declares, "By faith
                   Enoch was taken up," that is, "translated" (KJV). This means
                   that his body was transformed and he was removed frorti the
                   earthly to the heavenly realm without experiencing death. This
                   was possible because he walked so closely with God that he
                   came to reflect the divine image. This could only be done by
                   faith. Enoch's godly walk represents the preparation we should
                   make today for translation. Just as he was removed from the
                   earth before its destruction by the Deluge, so the righteous
                   living at the advent will be taken up from the earth before its
                   destruction by fire. (See Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 88, 89.)

                    What example of taking God at His word is found in Noah?
                   What results followed from acting on that faith? Heb. 11:7.

                     God announced to Noah that the world was to be destroyed
                   by a deluge. Though no such catastrophe had ever happened
                   before, Noah took Him at His word and demonstrated his faith
                   by warning men and by building an ark. "He gave the world an
                   example of believing just what God says. All that He possessed,
                   he invested in the ark.... Every blow struck upon the ark was a
                   witness to the people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 95.

             Part 3   "By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
          THE FAITH which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and
        OF ABRAHAM he went out, not knowing whither he went" (Heb. 11:8).

                         Compare Genesis 12:1-3.
                         "Abraham's unquestioning obedience is one of the most
                      striking evidences of faith to be found in all the Bible.... Relying
                      upon the divine promise, without the least outward assurance
                      of its fulfillment, he abandoned home and kindred and native
                      land, and went forth, he knew not whither, to follow where God
                      should lead."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 126.
                        Abraham's hometown of Ur was one of the great centers of
                      culture and civilization of his time. To abandon all this and
                      separate from his loved ones and become a homeless nomad
                      must have seemed like madness to those he loved. Only be-
                      cause of his great faith in God's word was he able to do this.

                       How was Abraham's faith further shown when he arrived in
                     the Promised Land? Verse 9.

                       God commanded Abraham to go "unto a land that I will shew
                     thee" (Gen. 12:1). This was the Land of Canaan which was
                     promised to him and his descendants (Gen. 12:7; 13:14-17;
                     15:18; 17:8). Although the patriarch sojourned in this land, the
                     only part of it he ever owned was the field and cave of
                     Machpelah which he bought as a family burial place. Yet he
                     never grew impatient or gave up his confidence in God's
                     promises. This was because the commonwealth on which he
                     had set his hope was not an earthly, temporal one. "He looked
                     for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is
                     God" (Heb. 11:10).

                       In spite of the advanced age of both Abraham and Sarah
                     when Isaac was born, how numerous are his descendants
                     declared to be? Heb. 11:11, 12.

                       At the birth of Isaac, Sarah and Abraham were far beyond the
                     normal age of parenthood. Regarding Abraham, Romans 4:20,
                     21, RSV, declares: "No distrust made him waver concerning the
                     promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory
                     to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had
                     promised."

 THINK IT THROUGH      "Faith is trusting in God,—believing that He loves us, and
                     knows what is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it
                     leads us to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts
                     His wisdom; in place of our weakness, His strength; in place of
                     our sinfulness, His righteousness."—Gospel Workers, p. 259.

The Faith of the Patriarchs         LESSON 10                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    September 1
         Part 4    Though the patriarchs did not themselves receive what God
    HOMELAND OF had promised, what attitude did they take toward God's
    THE FAITHFUL promises?

                      "These all died in faith, not having received the promises,
                    but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them,
                    and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers
                    and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things de-
                    clare plainly that they seek a country" (Heb. 11:13, 14).

                      Abraham (Gen. 13:14-17), Isaac (Gen. 26:2-4), and Jacob
                    (Gen. 28:13-15) were all promised the Land of Canaan. Yet none
                    of these men of faith ever received the Promised Land. They
                    were sojourners all their lives, moving around like nomads.
                    They lived in faith. Even in the hour of death they continued to
                    look forward to the fulfillment of God's promises. They had
                    staked everything on these promises and were sure of them.
                      Was their heart really set on an earthly Canaan? The epistle
                    says No. What they were actually seeking was something better
                    than the Canaan of their day could offer. And while they were
                    sojourning in Canaan, they never thought of Mesopotamia, the
                    country from which they came, as their true home. Otherwise
                    they could have gone back there. (See Heb. 11:15.) When
                    Abraham's servant was sent to find a wife for Isaac, he
                    suggested the possibility that the young woman he chose might
                    not be willing to live in Canaan. "Must I then take your son back
                    to the land from which you came?" Abraham's answer was
                    immediate and firm: "See to it that you do not take my son back
                    there" (Gen. 24:5, 6, RSV).

                     Where was the true fatherland they were seeking? Why was
                    God not ashamed to be called their God? Heb. 11:16.

                      On earth the patriarchs were but "strangers and pilgrims"
                    (1 Peter 2:11). Their real citizenship was in heaven. (See Phil.
                    3:20, RSV). These men, though they had their faults, were will-
                    ing to stake everything on God's word. Their lives of faith
                    honored God in the world, and God honored them by calling
                    Himself "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
                    Jacob" (Ex. 3:6). What greater honor could be bestowed on
                    sinful human beings?

 THINK IT THROUGH     "Faith in God's love and overruling providence lightens the
                    burdens of anxiety and care. It fills the heart with joy and
                    contentment in the highest or the lowliest lot. Religion tends
                    directly to promote health, to lengthen life, and to heighten our
                    enjoyment of all its blessings. It opens to the soul a never-failing
                    fountain of happiness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 600.

         Part 5    "By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and
  THE TESTING OF he that had received the promises offered up his only begot-
 ABRAHAM'S FAITH ten son ... : accounting that God was able to raise him up,
                even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a
                figure" (Heb. 11:17-19).

                        No more severe test could ever come to a man than the one
                     given Abraham as described in Genesis 22. We may well wonder
                     why God should bring such torture of soul to the patriarch in
                     order to test him. Certainly the purpose of it was not to obtain
                     information regarding his ability to endure, for God can read the
                     heart, and He knew what Abraham would do. Why then the test?
                     Abraham's faith needed to be perfected that it might serve as
                     the great example to all succeeding generations. His inspiring
                     example of undeviating obedience and trust teaches the great
                     lesson of confidence in God and His requirements, no matter
                     how close and cutting they may be.
                        But there is a deeper reason. God desired to impress upon
                     Abraham and the whole universe the reality of the gospel.
                     Through this terrible experience something of the greatness of
                     the sacrifice of God in giving His only Son to redeem sinners
                     was revealed. As Abraham in his trust and obedience did not
                     withhold his son, his only son (Gen. 22:12, 16), so God "did not
                     spare his own Son but gave him up for us all" (Rom. 8:32, RSV).

                       What made the binding of Isaac on the altar so difficult?
                     How did Abraham expect God to solve the problem? Heb.
                     11:18, 19.

                        Isaac was not only Abraham's son, but he was the son through
                     whom the promises made were to be realized. He was therefore
                     irreplaceable. Abraham trusted in God's ability to find a way out
                     of this dilemma. He believed in God's ability to raise Isaac from
                     the dead. This faith he revealed to the two young servants who
                     were not to witness the scene: "Abide ye here with the ass; and I
                     and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you"
                     (Gen. 22:5). Abraham and Isaac would both return! He con-
                     sidered "that God was able" if need be to resurrect him to life.
                     Figuratively speaking he did receive Isaac back from death. "So
                     far as Abraham was concerned, his son Isaac was dead. And
                     when God halted the test and restored Isaac to his father, it was
                     even as if Isaac had indeed returned from death."—SDA Bible
                     Commentary, on Heb. 11:19.
                        In all of this Isaac was a figure of the Son of God. But when
                     Jesus went from Gethsemane to Golgotha, there was no voice
                     to cry, "It is enough." "He who did not spare his own Son but
                     gave him up for us all, will he not also give us all things with
                     him?" (Rom. 8:32, RSV).

                   primary blessing to Jacob as recorded in Genesis 27, he made
                   no attempt to revoke it. Although he was disturbed and dis-
                   appointed, "the conviction flashed upon him that it was God's
                   providence which had defeated his purpose and brought about
                   the very thing he had determined to prevent."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 181.
                      Coupled with a remembrance of the prophecy given Jacob's
                   mother concerning him at the time of his birth, there came a
                   recognition that Jacob was better fitted to accomplish God's
                   purpose than Esau. Furthermore, Isaac had felt inspired when
                   he altered the prophetic blessing; hence he felt unable to retract
                   it. The next morning he further confirmed the blessing (Gen.
                   28:1-4).
                      Thus his faith was revealed. Furthermore, for one who had no
                   inheritance of land in Canaan to predict that Jacob should have
                   great prosperity and rule over his brother, and other nations as
                   well, called for trust in God's promises.

                     What led Jacob to give the primary blessing to Joseph's
                   younger son, Ephraim, rather than to the older, Manasseh?
                   Heb. 11:21; Gen. 48:8-22.

                      "These youths were connected, through their mother, with
                   the highest order of the Egyptian priesthood; and the position
                   of their father opened to them the avenues to wealth and dis-
                   tinction. .. . It was Joseph's desire, however, that they should
                   unite with their own people, ... among the despised shepherd
                   tribes."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 234.

                     How did Joseph show his faith in God's promise of bringing
                   Israel to Canaan? Heb. 11:22; Gen. 50:24, 25.

                     Joseph's last act was an expression of faith in God's promise
                   to Jacob. (See Gen. 46:4.) "Honored as he had been in the land
                   of the Pharaohs, Egypt was to him but the place of his exile; his
                   last act was to signify that his lot was cast with Israel.... And
                   through the centuries of toil which followed, that coffin, a
                   reminder of the dying words of Joseph, testified to Israel that
                   they were only sojourners in Egypt, and bade them keep their
                   hopes fixed upon the Land of Promise, for the time of deliver-

                     unto the recompence of the reward" (Heb. 11:24-26).

                        After referring to the faith of the patriarchs—Abraham, Isaac,
                      Jacob, Joseph—the epistle turns to Moses and the Exodus. Five
                      acts of faith are presented from this period.

                        What did their faith lead the parents of Moses to do? Heb.
                      11:23; Acts 7:17-22; Ex. 2:1-10.

                        Amram and Jochebed were godly parents who believed that
                      the time of Israel's deliverance from Egyptian slavery was near.
                      When they saw their "goodly child," they believed that God had
                      a future for him and determined to spare his life. They therefore
                      defied the edict of Pharaoh and kept the baby in their home for
                      three months. Then they exposed him in a way which they
                      believed would result in his rescue. Their faith was rewarded,
                      and Moses became a man of destiny, due largely to the godly
                      home in which he spent the first twelve years of his life.

                        What momentous decision did Moses make when he was of
                      age? Heb. 11:24-26.

                        "In the schools of Egypt, Moses received the highest civil and
                      military training. Of great personal attractions, noble in form
                      and stature, of cultivated mind and princely bearing, and
                      renowned as a military leader, he became the nation's pride....
                      Egypt at this time being still the most powerful and most highly
                      civilized of nations, Moses, as its prospective sovereign, was
                      heir to the highest honors this world could bestow. But his was a
                      nobler choice. For the honor of God and the deliverance of His
                      downtrodden people, Moses sacrificed the honors of
                      Egypt."—Education, p. 62.
                        He renounced his right to the throne of Egypt because.he
                      regarded suffering reproach for God's cause as a greater
                      privilege than all the wealth and power of being a Pharaoh. "He
                      counted it so because it was so. . . .
                        "Instead of linking himself with the greatness of Egypt, he
                      chose to bind up his life with God's purpose. Instead of giving
                      laws to Egypt, he by divine direction enacted laws for the world.

                         "The greatness of Egypt is in the dust. Its power and civiliza-
                      tion have passed away. But the work of Moses can never

                                                                       September 6

    MOSES' FAITH he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that
                 destroyed the firstborn should touch them" (Heb. 11:27, 28).

                      Was the departure of Moses from Egypt here referred to as the
                   Exodus, or Moses' flight to Midian? Commentators differ. The
                   natural order of events would favor the latter. However, that
                   flight is difficult to harmonize with the phrase, "not fearing the
                   wrath of the king."
                      F. F. Bruce explains: "Our author, who follows the biblical
                   record so closely, certainly does not intend to contradict it, but
                   rather to interpret it.... He was afraid, admittedly, but that was
                   not why he left Egypt; his leaving Egypt was an act of faith."—

                   on the New Testament, pp. 321, 322.

                     What was the secret of Moses' faith and perseverance?
                   Verse 27.

                      The strength and stay of Moses' life was his sense of the
                   personal presence of God.
                      "To Moses faith was no guesswork; it was a reality. He be-
                   lieved that God ruled his life in particular; and in all its details he
                   acknowledged Him."—Education, p. 63.
                      "The faith of Moses led him to look at the things which are
                   unseen, which are eternal."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 345.

                    What feast was an expression of the faith of Moses and the
                   Hebrews? Verse 28.

                     The author of the epistle does not dwell on the call of Moses to
                   deliver Israel, or on the controversy he had with Pharaoh in-
                   volving the plagues. But he speaks of the night when Israel's
                   faith found expression in the sprinkling of blood on the
                   doorposts which turned aside the angel of death. The promise
                   was, "The Lord will pass through to slay the Egyptians; and
                   when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts,
                   the Lord will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer
                   to enter your houses to slay you" (Ex. 12:23, RSV). God Himself
                   stood guard to keep the destroyer from entering homes where
                   faith was manifested in obedience. God, through Moses, in-
                   stituted the Passover as a perpetual memorial of that night of
                   deliverance. "In commemoration of this great deliverance a
                   feast was to be observed yearly by the people of Israel in all
                   future generations."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 274.

             Part 3     "By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land:
         THE FAITH    which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. By faith
         OF ISRAEL    the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed
                      about seven days" (Heb. 11:29, 30).

                         The miraculous crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) reveals
                      not only the faith of Moses, but the faith he was able to inspire in
                      the people. They were at first terrified by the sight of the Egyp-
                      tian military forces behind them and the seemingly impassable
                      sea before them, and gave vent to murmuring. But Moses
                      calmed and reassured them with the words: "Fear ye not, stand
                      still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you
                      to day: for the Egyptians whom you have seen to day, ye shall
                      see them no more for ever again. The Lord shall fight for you,
                      and ye shall hold your peace" (Ex. 14:13, 14). By accepting this
                      promise at face value they saw "their path opened through the
                      waters and their enemies overwhelmed in the moment of ex-
                      pected triumph. Jehovah alone had brought them deliverance,
                      and to Him their hearts were turned in gratitude and faith."—
                      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 288.

                        In what way was the city of Jericho captured 40 years later?
                      Heb. 11:30; Joshua 6:1-21.

                         Joshua, the new leader of Israel, took the promise of God at
                      His word: "See, I have given into thine hand Jericho" (Joshua
                      6:2). He showed his faith by following to the letter the in-
                      structions God gave for its capture. Though the people had not
                      heard the promise of the city's fall directly from the "captain of
                      the Lord's host" as had Joshua, they nevertheless grasped it by
                      faith and followed Joshua's orders explicitly. They did this, even
                      though it appeared to be a strange method of capturing a
                      fortified city.
                         "The very plan of continuing this ceremony through so long a
                      time prior to the final overthrow of the walls afforded opportu-
                      nity for the development of faith among the Israelites. It was to
                      be impressed upon their minds that their strength was not in the
                      wisdom of man, nor in his might, but only in the God of their

                        Rahab's faith in the God of Israel is revealed by her statement
                      to the spies: "The Lord your God, he is God in heaven above,
                      and in earth beneath" (Joshua 2:11). It was this faith which led
                      her to hide the spies and later to save her household by tying the
                      scarlet cord in the window of her home.

                                                                  September 8

   A GREAT CLOUD of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of
    OF WITNESSES David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: who through
                 faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained
                 promises, stopped the mouths of lions" (Heb. 11:32, 33).

                      The six men mentioned span the interval between the death of
                   Joshua and the early monarchy.
                      Gideon was Israel's champion against the bedouin horde of
                   Midianites, Amalekites, and "the people of the East" (RSV) who
                   harassed the land of Palestine for seven years (Judges 6
                   through 8). By divine direction he first declared war on idolatry
                   within Israel by tearing down his own father's altar of Baal. After
                   "the Spirit of the Lord came upon" him, he was ready to deal
                   with the invaders. (See Judges 6:34.) With only 300 men
                   equipped with torches, earthen jars, and trumpets, he routed
                   those bedouin hosts and broke their power.
                      Barak, under the guidance of the prophetess Deborah,
                   commanded 10,000 young men against a confederate Canaan-
                   ite force with 900 chariots of iron under the generalship of
                   Sisera and won an almost incredible victory (Judges 4 and 5).
                      Jephthah led a battle against the Ammonites and delivered
                   Israel.
                      Samson waged a single-handed war with the Philistines and
                   repeatedly triumphed (Judges 13 through 16).
                      David, the second king of Israel, although displaying many
                   faults, lived by faith in God's providence and care.
                      Samuel, priest, judge, and prophet, provided inspiring
                   leadership under God during the transition period of the later
                   judges and the early monarchy.

                     What achievements are to be credited to men and women of
                   faith? Heb. 11:33, 34.

                     Each of these affirmations calls to mind an episode in Israel's
                   history involving a hero of faith. Kingdoms were conquered
                   from the time the Israelites in the wilderness overthrew Sihon
                   and Og (Num. 21:21-25), through the conquest of Canaan under
                   Joshua, to the time of David. (See 2 Sam. 8:1-13.) The latter, the
                   Scripture declares, "administered justice and equity to all his
                   people" (2 Sam. 8:15, RSV). He, like Abraham, "received
                   promises," particularly the promise of a coming Messiah (2
                   Sam. 7:11-17; Acts 13:23). "Stopped the mouths of lions"
                   particularly recalls Daniel in the lions' den (Dan. 6:22).
                   "Quenched the violence of fire" could refer to the three Hebrew
                   worthies in the fiery furnace. "Escaped the edge of the sword"
                   suggests the flight of David from Saul, or the rescue of Elijah (1
                   Kings 19) and Elisha (2 Kings 6 and 7).

     OF THE FAITHFUL obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel
                    mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and im-
                    prisonment" (Heb. 11:35, 36).

                        Through the prophet Elijah's prayer of faith the son of the
                     poor widow of Zarephath was restored to life (1 Kings 17:17-24).
                     Similarly the son of the wealthy woman of Shunem was raised
                     by Elisha (2 Kings 4:18-37). But faith in God did not bring to
                     God's servants a guarantee of immunity from trials. Rather it
                     enabled them to endure suffering and torture for the truth's
                     sake. The Greek verb rendered "torture" in verse 35 means to be
                     beaten to death after being stretched on the rack. There were
                     noble martyrs in the Old Testament period• and those who
                     suffered for their faith. The sons raised to life by Elijah and
                     Elisha were merely called forth to a temporal life, but the mar-
                     tyrs who gave their lives rather than surrender their faith looked
                     forward to "a better resurrection," the life of the age to come.

                        What persecution did heroes of faith endure? Heb. 11:36-38.

                        The prophets stand out among those who suffered perse-
                     cution. Verse 35 could well be illustrated by the experience of
                     Jeremiah who was beaten (Jer. 20:2; 37:15), imprisoned (Jer.   ,
                     37:15), and cast into a dungeon (Jer. 38:6), and who exclaimed,
                     "I have become a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks
                     me" (Jer. 20:7, RSV). More than one prophet was stoned,
                     among them the priest-prophet Zechariah (2 Chron. 24:20, 21;
                     Luke 11:51), and Jeremiah, according to tradition, by the Jews
                     in Egypt. Isaiah, says tradition, was placed in a hollow log and
                     sawed in two during the reign of Manasseh. Not all "escaped the
                     edge of the sword," for many were slain by the sword of Jezebel
                     (1 Kings 19:10). Uriah in the days of Jeremiah was extradited
                     from Egypt byJehoiakim "who slew him with the sword and cast
                     his dead body into the burial place of the common people" (Jer.
                     26:23, RSV). Apparently Elijah and Elisha were among those
                     who "wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being
                     destitute, afflicted, tormented." God's great heroes "were
                     treated as though not deserving to live in this world, whereas
                     really the world was not worthy of their presence."—Charles R.
                     Erdman, The Epistle to the Hebrews (Phila.: The Westminster
                     Press, 1934), p. 121.
                        The lesson to the Hebrews is clear: When God's people suffer
                     persecution, they are in good company. "In all ages God's
                     appointed witnesses have exposed themselves to reproach and
                     persecution for the truth's sake."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.

                                                                      September 10

SUPREME EXAMPLE     the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with
                    patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the
                    author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set
                    before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set
                    down at the right hand of the throne of God" (Heb. 12:1, 2).

                      The author now draws his conclusion from the experiences of
                    past heroes. They have not yet received the promised inheri-
                    tance (Heb. 11:39, 40). "In His infinite wisdom He [God] or-
                    dained that the faithful of all ages should enter upon the eternal
                    inheritance together."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Heb. 11:40.
                       The witnesses who surround us are the faithful of the past—
                    "those who have breasted the evils and difficulties in their way,
                    and who in the name of the Lord have braced themselves
                    successfully against the opposing forces of evil."—Ellen G.
                    White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 934. They
                    are "witnesses" not in the sense of spectators, but as those who
                    have testified of the power of faith and of God's trustworthiness.
                       The example of an athletic race indicates the kind of effort
                    and discipline the Christian life demands. All such superfluous
                    weights and shackles as evil habits and sinful practices must be
                    cast aside if the Christian runner is to win in the race of life.

                      Upon whom must the eye of the runner be fixed? Heb. 12:2.

                       Jesus is set forth "as the one who has blazed the trail of faith
                    and as the one who Himself ran the race of faith to its triumphant
                    finish."—F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Hebrews. The New
                    International Commentary on the New Testament, p. 351.
                       He is not only the pioneer of our faith, but the one in whom
                    faith reached its perfection. Jesus' whole life was one of un-
                     questioning trust and obedience to the Father's will. He carried
                    that obedience to the point of dying on the cross (Phil. 2:8).
                    Crucifixion was the most terrible, the most degrading form of
                    execution known to the Romans. It was reserved for the worst
                    criminals and revolting slaves. Cicero said of it, "Let the very
                    mention of the cross be far removed not only from a Roman
                     citizen's body, but from his mind, his eyes, his ears." But our
                    Lord ignored its shame. He conquered and is now "seated at the
                     right hand of the throne of God" (RSV).

 THINK IT THROUGH     "It is the work of faith to rest in God in the darkest hour, to feel,
                    however sorely tried and tempest-tossed, that our Father is at
                    the helm. The eye of faith alone can look beyond the things of
                    time to estimate aright the worth of the eternal riches."—The

                        With the insight of a faithful shepherd the author seeks to
                     prepare his flock for possible future persecution and mar-
                     tyrdom. They had already been exposed to affliction (Heb.
                     10:32, 33). Were they tempted to lose heart and wonder whether
                     they were not having more than their share of suffering? Then
                     let them consider what their Lord had endured to bring them
                     such a great salvation. How could the noblest and best the
                     world has ever seen suffer such dreadful hostility from the very
                     men He came to save?
                        "He who came to redeem the lost world was opposed by the

                     exercise of the evil passions of our nature, He aroused the

                     epistle is addressed not yet been called upon to make? Heb.
                     12:4.

                       Christ's life of sorrow and suffering had ended in the shame-
                     ful death of the cross. Many of the heroes of faith mentioned in
                     chapter 11 had been martyred. But the Hebrews had thus far
                     been spared martyrdom.

 THINK IT THROUGH       "Reproach and persecution have separated many f rdm
                     earthly friends, but never from the love of Christ. Never is the
                     tempest-tried soul more dearly loved by His Saviour than when
                     he is suffering reproach for the truth's sake.. . . When for the
                     truth's sake the believer stands at the bar of earthly tribunals,
                     Christ stands by his side. When he is confined within prison
                     walls, Christ manifests Himself to him and cheers his heart with '
                     His love. When he suffers death for Christ's sake, the Saviour
                     says to him, They may kill the body, but they cannot hurt the
                     soul."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 85.

                                                                    September 13
            Part 2     "Ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto
     SUFFERING AS    you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening
 DIVINE DISCIPLINE   of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom
                     the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
                     whom he receiveth" (Heb. 12:5, 6).

                       Another reason is now added for enduring persecution and
                     suffering for the truth's sake. The faith and courage of the saints
                     of the past amid trials and tribulations had previously been set
                     forth as one reason for bearing up. A second is the fact that their
                     sufferings were small in comparison with those Jesus Christ
                     endured. But now they are invited to consider their tribulations
                     as a fatherly discipline used by God for the development of
                     character. As evidence of this point of view the words of Prov-
                     erbs 3:11, 12 are quoted. The term "chastening" denotes the
                     upbringing of a growing child to maturity and includes in-
                     struction, direction, encouragement, and discipline when
                     necessary.

                       Of what should the believers regard the discipline of suf-
                     fering as a sure sign? Heb. 12:7, 8. (Compare Deut. 8:5.)

                        They should take courage as they consider that their tribu-
                     lations for the truth's sake are a guarantee of sonship to God,
                     and consequently are an evidence of God's grace and for-
                     giveness. They are a sign that the individual Christian is the
                     Father's child, loved by Him and received by Him as a son. On
                     the other hand, one who is not disciplined may well regard this
                     as an indication of the illegitimacy of his claim to sonship. Let
                     him then receive discipline with gratitude as a seal of his status
                     as a true son.

                       What attitude in general do children have to the discipline of
                     their fathers? How imperative is it that we accept God's dis-
                     cipline? Heb. 12:9-11.

                       If we respected erring earthly fathers who imposed discipline
                     upon us, how much more should we gratefully receive the
                     discipline of One who is the perfection of wisdom and love. In
                     contrast to the fathers of our flesh, God is the Father of our
                     spirits. He is our spiritual Father who "disciplines us for our
                     good, that we may share his holiness" (verse 10, RSV).
                       Discipline, particularly when it requires chastisement, is
                     never pleasant, and is never given for its own sake, "but in the
                     end it yields for those who have been trained by it the peaceful
                     harvest of an honest life" (verse 11, NEB).

                                                                    September 14

           Part 3   "Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the
     PEACE WITHOUT feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest that
       COMPROMISE which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be
                  healed" (Heb. 12:12, 13).

                        "Wherefore," that is, because of the disciplinary benefits that
                     can come from enduring adversity, the readers are admonished
                     to brace themselves for renewed conflict by casting aside
                     faintheartedness and fear. The Greek has simply "the drooping
                     hands" and "the feeble knees." While the definite article could
                     indicate possession—"your"—the writer probably means not
                     only their own, but those of others who may be disheartened.
                        "Make straight paths for your feet" could also be rendered
                     "make straight with your feet." The reference would then be to
                     actual walking, not to the preparation of a path in which to walk.
                     Christians are thus urged to pursue a consistent, straightfor-
                     ward path to the goal.

                       What two objectives are they then admonished earnestly to
                     pursue? Heb. 12:14. (Compare Ps. 34:14; 1 Peter 3:11.)

                       The whole community and every Christian in it must be on
                     guard against the inroads of any element of impurity (Heb.
                     12:15, 16). Compare Deut. 29:18, RSV: "Beware lest there be
                     among you a man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns
                     away this day from the Lord our God ... ; lest there be among
                     you a root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit."

                       Of what kind of person is Esau held forth as an example not
                     to be followed? Heb. 12:16, 17.

                        Esau was irreligious. He was profane in the sense that he
                     lacked a sense of spiritual values. He lived only for the present
                     and had no concern for the future. " 'For one morsel of meat,'
                     for a momentary gratification of appetite that had never been
                     restrained, Esau sold his inheritance; but when he saw his folly,
                     it was too late to recover the blessing. 'He found no place of
                     repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.' Hebrews
                     12:16, 17. Esau was not shut out from the privilege of seeking
                     God's favor by repentance; but he could find no means of
                     recovering the birthright. His grief did not spring from convic-
                     tion of sin; he did not desire to be reconciled to God. He sor-
                     rowed because of the results of his sin, but not for the sin
                     itself.. ..
                        "He represents those who lightly value the redemption
                     purchased for them by Christ, and are ready to sacrifice their
                     heirship to heaven for the perishable things of earth."—

                                                                September 15
         Part 4   "For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched,
    THE TERRORS and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness,
       AT SINAI and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of
                words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word
                should not be spoken to them any more" (Heb. 12:18, 19).

                      These words are reminiscent of the descriptions of the ter-
                   rifying manifestation of God at Sinai given in Exodus 19:11-13,
                   16,18, 19; 20:18-20; Deuteronomy 4:11; 5:22. Note also in Psalm
                   68:8 the natural phenomena that accompanied God's presence.
                      Seven elements in this awe-inspiring description set forth the
                   majesty, the unapproachability, and the terror of God: (1) "That
                   might be touched" refers to Mount Sinai. "And ye came near
                   and stood under the mountain" (Deut. 4:11). (2) "Burned with
                   fire," represents the unapproachable sanctity and overpower-
                   ing glory of the Lord. (3) Blackness and (4) darkness add to the
                   mystery of the divine presence, as does (5) the tempest. Then
                   came the audible manifestations: (6) the trumpet blast, and (7)
                   the voice: God speaking out of the midst of the fire.
                      "Never since man was created had there been witnessed such
                   a manifestation of divine power as when the law was proclaimed
                   from Sinai. 'The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the
                   presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of
                   God, the God of Israel.' Psalm 68:8. Amid the most terrific
                   convulsions of nature the voice of God, like a trumpet, was
                   heard from the cloud. The mountain was shaken from base to
                   summit, and the hosts of Israel, pale and trembling with terror,
                   lay upon their faces upon the earth."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   p. 340.

                      How did these terrifying manifestations affect the Israel-
                   ites? Moses? Heb. 12:20, 21. (Compare Ex. 19:12, 13; Deut.
                   9:19.)

                     "God purposed to make the occasion of speaking His law a
                   scene of awful grandeur, in keeping with its exalted character.
                   The people were to be impressed that everything connected
                   with the service of God must be regarded with the greatest
                   reverence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 303.
                      "The people of Israel were overwhelmed with terror. The
                   awful power of God's utterances seemed more than their
                   trembling hearts could bear. For as God's rule of right was
                   presented before them, they realized as never before the of-
                   fensive character of sin, and their own guilt in the sight of the
                   holy God. They shrank away from the mountain in fear and awe.
                   The multitude cried out to Moses, 'Speak thou with us, and we
                   will hear: but let not God speak with us,- lest we die.' "—

            Part 5    "But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the
      GLORIES OF THE living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
      HEAVENLY ZION company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the
                   firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of
                   all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect" (Heb. 12:22,
                   23).

                        In contrast to ancient Israel who came to Mount Sinai with its
                      terrors, Christians have come to Mount Zion with its glories.
                      Zion was originally the name of the Jebusite stronghold located
                      on the southeastern hill of Jerusalem. The name was later
                      extended to include the temple area, and finally the whole city,
                      and perhaps even all of Palestine. It also came to designate the
                      ideal society, and is used symbolically in the New Testament for
                      heaven. In Hebrews Mount Zion is associated with "the city of
                     the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem." Christians have not yet
                      come to this heavenly Zion literally, but in a spiritual sense they
                     have access to it, and by faith enjoy the privileges of citizenship
                     in it. "As the earthly Zion was the meeting point for the tribes of
                     the old Israel, so the heavenly Zion is the meeting point for the
                     new Israel."—F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Hebrews. The New
                     International Commentary on the New Testament, p. 373.
                        Among those who are pictured as gathered there are in-
                     numerable angels in festal gatherings. They are there not only
                     to serve (see The Great Controversy, p. 512), but to rejoice over
                     the redemption of human souls (Luke 15:10). Christians also
                     have fellowship with the "church of the firstborn, which are
                     written in heaven." Most probably this is a designation for the
                     whole community of the redeemed. They are not yet in heaven in
                     person (Heb. 11:39, 40), but they are inscribed there as citizens
                     of the heavenly commonwealth, with all the privileges this
                     involves. They are called "firstborn" because of their close
                     connection with Him who is indeed the first firstborn and who is
                     not ashamed to call them brethren, with whom they are joint
                     heirs. (See Rom. 8:17, 29; Heb. 1:6; Col. 1:15, 18.)

                       What is Jesus again called? What is said of the sprinkling of
                     His blood? Heb. 12:24.

                       The blood of Abel spoke of the guilt of sin and cried for
                     vengeance (Gen. 4:10). The atoning blood of Jesus cries for
                     mercy, pardon, and reconciliation. It achieves not merely
                     forgiveness, but cleansing.
                       "He died that we might be forgiven,
                       He died to make us good,
                       That we might go at last to heaven,
                       Saved by His precious blood."

           Part 6   "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they
   WARNING AGAINST escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more
SPURNING THE GOSPEL shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh
                  from heaven" (Heb. 12:25).

                        Although Israel heard God's voice amid the fearful physical
                     manifestations of Sinai, they thereafter repeatedly failed to obey
                     the commandments given them. (See Heb. 3:7-11.) As the result
                     of this disobedience their bodies were strewn in the wilderness
                     (Heb. 3:17, 18), and only two non-Levites ever entered the Land
                     of Canaan. How much more serious it would be to fail to heed
                     the message of the gospel proclaimed from His unseen throne
                     in the heavenly Zion.

                       What effect did God's voice at Sinai have? How severe will be
                     the future shaking, and what does it indicate? Heb. 12:26, 27.


                        At the coming day of God, the present world order will be
                     brought to an end amid terrible cosmic convulsions. (Compare
                     Isa. 2:19, 21; 13:9-13; Joel 3:16.) The sky will roll up like a split
                     scroll, "and every mountain and island" will be "moved out of
                     their place" (Rev. 6:14). God declares, "I will shake the heavens,
                     and the earth shall remove out of her place" (Isa. 13:13).
                       The phrase "yet once more" indicates "for the last time." The
                     shaking here described is a final unrepeatable event resulting in
                     the separation and removal of the sinful and temporal from that
                     which is worthy to abide forever. The world will thereby be
                     transformed as the eternal home of holy human beings. The
                     kingdom of God belongs to the unshakable order, and in that
                     kingdom Christian believers have a share.

                       Since Christians have a share in eternal things, what proper
                     responses should be expected? Heb. 12:28.

                       "We are daily recipients of the bounties of heaven and should
                     have loving gratitude springing up in our hearts to God. . . .
                     Thoughts and meditations upon the goodness of God to us
                     would close the avenues of the soul to Satan's suggestions."—
                     Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 222.
                       "Nothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains to the worship
                     of God, should be treated with carelessness and
                     indifference."—Messages to Young People, p. 266.
                       Reverential awe before the majesty and holiness of God is not
                     incompatible with love and trust. God is near, but He must not
                     become familiar. He is still the high and lofty One who inhabits
                     eternity, and whose name is holy. "Our God is a consuming fire"
                     (verse 29).

                    also in the body" (Heb. 13:1-3).

                        The closing chapter of Hebrews begins with a series of
                      admonitions which show an awareness of the ethical impli-
                      cations of Christian doctrines. Verses 1 through 3 contain
                      exhortations to brotherly love, hospitality, and helpfulness to
                      those in need. One of the social hallmarks of early Christians
                      was their love for one another as Jesus declared it would be
                      (John 13:35). Like the epistles to the Romans (12:10) and
                      Thessalonians (1 Thess. 4:9, 10), this epistle urges that solici-
                      tous care and consideration for the welfare of other Christians
                      be continued.

                        By practicing hospitality, whom have some unconsciously
                      entertained? Heb. 13:2.

                         Hospitality is especially to be shown to Christian brethren
                      (Rom. 12:13; 16:1, 2; 1 Peter 4:9). Ancient inns were notoriously
                      filthy and infested with prostitutes and bandits. Hence the
                      practice of hospitality was urgent. Among Old Testament
                      characters who unconsciously entertained angels one thinks of
                      Abraham (Gen. 18:1-8); Lot (Gen. 19:1-3); Gideon (Judges
                      6:11-20); and Manoah (Judges 13:1-4, 9-21).
                         Christians are also admonished to have a sympathetic care
                      for their brethren who are in prison or who suffer ill treatment.
                      These were often dependent upon friends for the bare neces-
                      sities of life.

                       How is marriage to be treated? How will God deal with those
                      who violate its vows? Heb. 13:4.

                         In the original, the verbs in the first two clauses are not
                      expressed, but are left for the reader to supply. It is possible to
                      read them as simple statements or as imperatives. Most likely
                      they are admonitions— "Let marriage be held in honor ... , let
                      the marriage bed be undefiled"—to safeguard the sanctity of
                      marriage. Such counsel is much needed today.
                         The final Christian virtue mentioned in this section is con-
                      tentment (verse 5). Life is to be kept free from coveteousness—
                      selfishness. (See Counsels on Stewardship, p. 223.) The ad-
                      monition is enforced by the promises of Joshua 1:5: "I will not
                      fail thee, nor forsake thee." (Compare Deut. 31:6, 8. See also Ps.
                      118:6.) These are indeed precious promises which should help
                      us to be content with what we have.

  AND THE LEADER sidering the end of their conversation. Jesus Christ the same
                yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (Heb. 13:7, 8).


                      This is the first of three references to Christian leaders in this
                   chapter. In verses 17 and 24 the reference is to leaders of the
                   time of the writing of the epistle; but this one evidently speaks of
                   previous leaders who have died. It was through the instru-
                   mentality of these spiritual leaders that the original readers of
                   this epistle received the good news of the gospel. There are
                   allusions to them in chapter 2, verse 3, and chapter 4, verse 2.
                   The readers are admonished to consider the outcome of the
                   lives of these godly men and to imitate their faith. "The whole
                   course of their lives, from start to finish, now lies before their
                   disciples and followers for review and imitation."—F. F. Bruce,
                   The Epistle to the Hebrews. The New International Commentary
                   on the New Testament, p. 395.
                      These past leaders are no longer available for counsel and
                   guidance. They have laid down their lives and exist now only in
                   memory. By contrast there is a greater leader who is always
                   available, and who is the supreme example of faithfulness and
                   constancy. "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and
                   for ever." He is the great High Priest over the household of faith.
                      The unswerving loyalty and steadfastness of their leader,
                   Jesus Christ, should keep them from being led astray by "divers
                   and strange doctrines" at variance with the basic gospel
                   message. The teaching referred to is difficult to identify, but it
                   concerned rules and practices about food "which have not
                   benefited their adherents" (Heb. 13:9, RSV). These could not be
                   the Jewish laws concerning clean and unclean foods. The laws
                   on food could hardly be described as diverse and strange, for
                   they were consistent and well known. These "strange doc-
                   trines" may possibly belong to some ascetic sect who expected
                   their abstinence from certain foods to contribute to their
                   spirituality. (Compare Col. 2:16, 21; 1 Tim. 4:3.) Or, the apostle
                   could be opposing the mystery cult belief that by devouring
                   special foods they were actually partaking of their god, and so
                   achieving immortality.
                      Today we may well think of food faddists who go to extremes
                   in advocating unusual diets. While the Christian should glorify
                   God in his body by his eating, he should remember that diet is a
                   matter of healthful living, and not a method of earning merit
                    with God. (See Rom. 14:17; 1 Cor. 8:8.) The spiritual life is
                    ultimately established by faith, which results in works to the
                    glory of God.

"OUTSIDE THE CAMP"     brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for
                       sin are burned outside the camp. So Jesus also suffered
                       outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his
                       own blood" (Heb. 13:10-12, RSV).

                         Christians have an altar referring to the sacrifice of Christ.
                       The "tent," or, "tabernacle" (KJV), refers to the earthly
                       tabernacle. Therefore "those who serve the tent" means the
                       priests of the earthly tabernacle. Christians have a sacrifice
                       from which these priests have no right to partake. But the
                       benefits of Christ's once-for-all sacrifice for sin (Heb. 10:10) are
                       available to those who accept them.
                         Christ's sacrifice was a sin offering, and even in the earthly
                       sanctuary the bodies of the bull and goat offered as a sin offer-
                       ing on the Day of Atonement were not eaten. Rather, after their
                       blood had been carried into the sanctuary to make atonement,
                       their bodies were burned outside the camp. (See Lev. 16:27.)

                         What parallel may be seen in the death of Jesus? Heb.
                       13:12.

                         In ancient times those who were accursed under the law were
                       taken outside the camp to be executed. (See Lev. 24:14, 23;
                       Num. 15:35.) Similarly, "Christ, our substitute, was to suffer
                       without the boundaries of Jerusalem. He died outside the gate,
                       where felons and murderers were executed."—The Desire of
                       Ages, p. 741. (See John 19:20.) "Christ hath redeemed us from
                       the curse of the law, being made a curse for us" (Gal. 3:13).

                         What are His followers therefore urged to do? Heb. 13:13.

                           The authorities of Jerusalem officially rejected our Lord, and
                       executed Him outside the city. The epistle urges its readers to
                       join their Lord "outside the camp, bearing the stigma that he
                       bore" (NEB). This exhortation suggests that they are to make a
                       complete break with the old Jewish order of worship and life.
                       They must give their total loyalty to Jesus Christ, even though
                       this will bring them reproach and abuse. Judaism and its sac-
                       rificial system must now be forsaken, for "the old securities to
                       which their hearts clung were themselves insecure; the old

                          Old Jerusalem is doomed to be shaken along with every other
                       earthly institution, but Christians can look forward to the eternal

          Part 4   "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
     ACCEPTABLE continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
       CHRISTIAN name. But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with
      SACRIFICES such sacrifices God is well pleased" (Heb. 13:15, 16).

                       The animal sacrifices and human priesthood of the Old
                    Testament pointed forward to, and found their fulfillment in,
                    Jesus Christ. He is the one true and adequate sacrifice offered
                    once for all for the sins of the world. He is also the one true
                    priest. Hence we as Christians have no animal sacrifices and no
                    place for any priesthood except that of Jesus. The only sac-
                    rifices acceptable to God are spiritual ones offered through
                    Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:5). Two such sacrifices are mentioned.
                       The first is a sacrifice of praise to God offered by "lips giving
                    thanks to his name." The psalmist admonished, "Offer to God a
                    sacrifice of thanksgiving" (Ps. 50:14, RSV), or, "make
                    thanksgiving your sacrifice to God" (footnote). "He who brings
                    thanksgiving as his sacrifice honors me" (verse 23, RSV). The
                    offering of such a sacrifice is a continual obligation. God not
                    only created us, but He redeemed us by giving His Son as a sin
                    offering in our behalf and appointing Him as our personal
                    representative in heaven. Surely this calls for gratitude and
                    praise. But even this can be acceptable to God only as it is
                    presented through Jesus Christ.
                       To the sacrifice of praise to God there is to be added the
                    sacrifices of benevolence and generosity. These are sacrifices
                    of deeds, not of words. They are offered to fellow human beings,
                    not to God. However, Jesus reckons kind deeds done to the
                    least of His followers as done to Him (Matt. 25:40).

                      To whom are Christians admonished to submit? In what
                    spirit is their work to be done? Heb. 13:17.

                      Verse 7 urged that former leaders, now deceased, should be
                    remembered. Verse 17 admonishes obedience and submission
                    to present leaders. These leaders carry a weighty responsibility.
                    They are like wakeful shepherds who must one day render an
                    account for the manner in which they have discharged their
                    responsibility to the Great Shepherd (verse 20). Nevertheless,
                    these leaders must not regard their care of the sheep as a
                    thankless task or painful burden. Rather, love for the sheep
                    must make it a work of joy.

 THINK IT THROUGH      "The heart of the true minister is filled with an intense longing
                    to save souls. Time and strength are spent, toilsome effort is not
                    shunned ; for others must hearthe truths that brought to his own
                    soul such gladness and peace and joy."—The Acts of the
                    Apostles, p. 371.

Final Injunctions     LESSON 13                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                   September 23
          Part 5   "Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead
      PRAYER AND our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the
       DOXOLOGY blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every
                 good work to do his will, working in you that which is
                 welipleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be
                 glory for ever and ever. Amen" (Heb. 13:20, 21).

                     What request in his behalf does the author make? Why?
                   Verses 18, 19.

                      "Us" in verse 18 is probably to be taken as a literary plural
                   meaning "me." Note as evidence the transition to the singular in
                   verse 19. Requests for prayer are common in the epistles. (See 2
                   Thess. 3:1; Rom. 15:30; Col. 4:3.) It seems probable that the
                   protestation of innocence on the author's part and his ex-
                   pression of a determination always to conduct himself properly
                   is indicative of some suspicions on the part of some people
                   regarding him. He needs the prayers of people who know and
                   love him. He hopes to be restored soon to them.
                      There follows one of the finest benedictions in all the epistles.
                  It closes with a doxology. It is rich in spiritual meaning and
                  deserves careful study. God is spoken of first as "the God of
                  peace." (See Rom. 15:33; 16:20; 2 Cor. 13:11; Phil. 4:9; 1 Thess.
                  5:23.) "Peace" in the Bible means more than the mere absence
                  of strife. The Greek word for "peace" has taken on much of the
                  connotation of the Hebrew word shalom denoting "whole-
                  ness," "completeness," and total "well-being." But Christian
                  peace also includes the final salvation of the whole man, a
                  salvation that comes through Jesus Christ. The God who is the
                  ultimate source of this peace resurrected Jesus Christ from the
                  dead. This is the only specific reference to Jesus' resurrection in
                  the epistle of Hebrews. He was brought up from the dead
                  "through the blood of the everlasting covenant," that is, by
                  virtue of the acceptance of His sacrifice by God as the basis of
                  the new covenant. Our Lord is then designated "that great
                  shepherd of the sheep," the only place in the epistle where such
                  a title is given Him. It seems to be derived from the Greek
                  translation of Isaiah 63:11: "Where is he that brought them up
                  out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock?"
                     What is God to do for the believers? He is to furnish them with
                  everything they need to carry out His will. How are they to carry
                  out His will? By having this God working within them (compare
                  Phil. 2:13), through Jesus Christ. Man works, but his work must
                  be the result of the activity of the Lord Jesus within him. The
                  prayer closes with the ascription of praise: "to whom be glory
                  for ever and ever."

Final Injunctions      LESSON 13                                       ❑ Friday
                                                                   September 24

           Part 6      "And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhorta-
  PERSONAL NOTES    tion: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. Know ye
                    that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come
                    shortly, I will see you. Salute all them that have the rule over
                    you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. Grace be with
                    you all. Amen" (Heb. 13:22-25).

                      In conclusion the author of the Hebrews now attaches a few
                    personal notes. The first is an appeal to the Christian commu-
                    nity addressed to listen patiently to the reading of the message.
                    "Word of exhortation" correctly and aptly describes the con-
                    tents and main purpose of the book. It is in the nature of a homily
                    written with a practical purpose in mind. The author is not
                    entirely certain that it will be favorably received, but he appeals
                    for a willing listening. It is after all, he writes, not a lengthy
                    homily when one considers the importance of the themes dealt
                    with. In terms of length it ranks ninth in the books of the New
                    Testament. Listed in order of length, the New Testament
                    docu ments that are longer are Acts, Luke, Matthew, John, Mark,
                    Revelation, Romans, and First Corinthians. Hebrews can be
                    read aloud within one hour.

                      What news is communicated concerning Timothy? What
                    hope does the author express? Verse 23.

                      Unfortunately we know nothing further about Timothy's
                    apparent imprisonment or release. The author assumes that the
                    requested prayer of verse 19 will be granted, and that he and
                    Timothy may visit the readers together.

                     Who are the recipients of the document to greet? From
                    whom does the author send greetings? Verses 24, 25.

                       In the apostolic age the Christian believers met in homes—
                    house-churches—for worship. The charge to convey the au-
                    thor's greetings to all the leaders and all the saints may perhaps
                    mean the leaders and members of other house-churches than
                    their own. "Those who come from Italy" (RSV) may refer to
                    Italians who are with the author outside of Italy who wish to be
                    remembered to the recipients of the homily. But this is un-
                    certain, for the Greek could mean, "they of Italy" as it appears in
                    the King James Version.
                       The final benediction is identical with that given at the end of
                    Titus (3:15): "Grace be with you all." It calls down upon them all
                    the abundant and sufficient favor of God, which is the basis of
                    their salvation. "The only power that can create or perpetuate
                    true peace is the grace of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 305.
