#### The Path of Faith

## 1978 Quater 2
APRIL-JUNE/1978
No, but it would go a long way in that direction. Put it together with
this quarter's Sabbath School lessons and you'll have the basis for
righteousness by faith.
It is no secret among our friends, or among our critics either, that the
subject of righteous-
ness by faith is at pres-
ent enjoying a deep
and fervent considera-
tion in the ranks of
thoughtful Christians
everywhere.
The greatest aids to
the explanation of
such terms as justifica-
tion and sanctification
are found in a close
study of the simple ob-
ject lessons used by
our Lord, and this is
where Gordon Hyde
has contributed his
best thoughts through
the pages of this book.
It is when the profound
is placed in a simple
setting that the un-
learned and the
scholar both stand in
amazement.
This very readable and
interesting treatise is designed to introduce every reader to an expe-
riential knowledge of the grace of Christ.

        Dear Fellow Sabbath School Members around the World:

        The Trans-Africa Division wishes to thank all the members of the world
        Sabbath School for their generous support of the Thirteenth Sabbath
        Special Project Offering, taken on March 27, 1976. As a result we have
        upgraded the physical plant and expanded the academic program of our
        secondary school at Inyazura, Rhodesia. This is one of our feeder schools
        for Solusi College. The offering also made it possible to plan definitely
        for the erection of new church buildings in the capital cities of the
        developing homelands in the Southern Union. This tangible evidence of
        your concern fdr, and interest in these specific projects has brought
        great rejoicing to the hearts of both laity and workers.

        Now we are eagerly anticipating your support in the Thirteenth Sabbath
        Special Project Offering which has been designated for our Division and
        which will be received on June 24 of this quarter. Judging from your
        past loyalty and generous gifts we feel confident that this will be
        another major boost, giving impetus to the Lord's work in this part of
        Africa. We plan to use the funds to construct an evangelistic center
        in Kinshasa, the capital of the French-speaking country of Zaire. This
        is the second largest French-speaking city in the world, and one of the
        largest cities in Africa. Yet, despite the fact our work has been estab-
        lished for 50 years in Zaire, we have only one small congregation in
        Kinshasa, meeting in a church building which is poorly located in a
        market area. To build this evangelistic complex will be costly, for
        both land and building materials are excessively high. Nevertheless,
        it is imperative that we meet this challenge if the millions of inhab-
        itants of this metropolis are to be reached with the message of the
        great Advent. It is our hope to establish this building as near to the
        heart of the city as possible.                         •

         We are also planning to develop a field headquarters in connection with
         this complex as well as a dental and medical clinic. However, this
         will depend upon the size of the offering received on June 24. We shall
         be indebted to you for your prayers and support in helping us achieve
         this objective.

         With Christian greetings from Trans-Africa, I remain,

                                                    Your brother in Christ,

                         THE PATH OF FAITH
                                        Introduction

   To hear some presentations of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to gain the impression that
only a special group—a handpicked few—have, or can have what is required to become
righteous, and thus to be fitted for heaven.
   Some fear to attend meetings or read publications that deal with righteousness by faith
because they are sure beforehand that it is beyond all but those with a built-in capacity to
reach heaven and gain eternal life.
   It is the object of this series of Sabbath School lessons to clear away any basis for such
fears or hesitations. Dear Sabbath School member, heaven is for you! And you too can
understand the way to get there! In fact, "As through Jesus we enter into rest, heaven
begins here.... Heaven is a ceaseless approaching to God through Christ.... All that
human nature can bear, we may receive here. But what is this compared with the
hereafter?"—The Desire of Ages, pp. 331, 332.
   We want to study together this quarter some of the first major steps which we must take
on the path of faith in Jesus. We shall look at our need of Jesus, the way His love draws us
to Him, how we come to be sorry for our sins, and what we can do with them. We shall try to
understand better how simple faith is, and how to use it in surrender of ourselves to His
control. We shall reassure ourselves of His willingness to forgive us and to make us new
creations in Himself. We shall feel the depth of the peace He offers and the joy of giving
ourselves fully to Him. We shall marvel anew at the almost unbelievable promises He
makes, sense the joy of bearing His fruit in our lives as we accept Him and become
righteous by faith.
   We have decided to concentrate our study on the writings'of the apostle John—his
Gospel, his Epistles, and the Revelation. But we draw occasionally on other inspired
witnesses to fill out some of the picture. We gratefully draw on the special counsel to this
remnant people by the spirit of prophecy.
   It is possible that many will feel that some important principle or emphasis has been
overlooked in this series of lessons. And that should not be cause for surprise. We will
readily recognize that there are other steps on the path of faith besides those covered this
quarter. Although we deal with fruit bearing in the Christian life, there is more to be said
about the full process of growing up into Christ, about conquering doubt, about the
Christian's work and witness, about the life of prayer and the evidences which confirm our
conversion. Much more can be said about the ties between these steps to Christ and His
work in the heavenly sanctuary and the closing of that work. Righteousness by faith as a
 special emphasis in our history is a most profitable study. But, again, let us remember
that we do not have to resolve the issues raised during our history before we can
 personally enter into the peaceful and joyous experience of righteousness by faith. The
first and essential steps are covered in the lessons we are about to study together this
 quarter.
    Oh that we each might believe Him and thus know His presence before this quarter
 closes! Let us study, pray, and witness with and for each other.



                                                                                           7
LESSON 1 March 26 to April 1


   "In him was life; and the life was the     greatest reality alone, and so often
light of men" (John 1:4).                     without hope.
                                                 How much we need Him who has
    It has so often been said that the        life in Himself—He who is able and
greatest certainty in life is death. And it   willing to give that divine life to meil,m.
is equally true that death plays no
favorites. The man who plants seed,           DAILY HIGHLIGHTS
the woman who drives a city bus,              1. Healer
people bordering on the edge of                  (John 5:6)
starvation, and those who are                 2. "A Spring of Water"
overfed—all of these alike face the              (John 4:14)
inevitable grave.                             3. "The Light of the World"
    In this respect the believer in Jesus        (John 8:12)
Christ is not different from the              4. "The Bread of Life"
unbeliever. It is only when we talk of           (John 6:35)
life beyond death—eternal life, life          5. "The Good Shepherd"
without end—that there is a difference           (John 10:11)
between the one who believes, and             6. "The Way"
the one who believes not.                        (John 14:6)
    In spite of every effort of medical
science there appears to be no way to
stretch generally useful and happy
human life much beyond fourscore
years. Occasionally reports claim
life-spans of 130 or even 150 years. At
least some age-claims come from
places where there is no reliable or
official record of birth dates. So when
a person dies it becomes not a little
difficult to decide how long he has
lived! Though we may accept these
reports at face value, still even the
sesquicentenarian will soon die.
    But more than all of this, most
people live in heavy darkness. Not
physical perhaps, but mental, moral
and social darkness—not to mention
darkness of the spirit, of the soul.
Some keep "happy" by a full life of
busyness, others by perpetual
self-indul&ence. But there comes a day
or reckoning, a day of facing life's

                                                                              March 26
             Part 1      What do you think was the purpose of Jesus' question?
            HEALER
                        "When Jesus saw him and knew that he had been lying
                      there a long time, he said to him, 'Do you want to be healed?' "
                      (John 5:6, RSV).

                        Can we by imagination put ourselves in the place of this
                      sufferer by the sheep pool in Jerusalem? Think of being help-
                      less for some 38 years from a crippling disease. Then think of
                      having your hopes raised periodically by the expectation
                      created from a long-standing tradition that the one who could
                      show the greatest selfishness by making himself first to enter
                      the pool at a certain season by a certain sign would be healed.
                      Can you imagine the jealousy and enmity that would develop
                      among these poor sufferers by the pool as each was forced to
                      regard every other person there as his potential enemy, virtually
                      his destroyer? Some would have helpers to assist them in gain-
                      ing an advantage over those having no help. Some would edge
                      their way to the pool periodically, to the very brink, so that they
                      might be the happy first person to jump or fall or roll into the
                      water.
                        To one such a sufferer, who had borne 38 years of misery and
                      undoubted self-condemnation, Jesus said with sympathy and
                      concern, "Do you want to be healed?"

THINK IT THROUGH       How does this healing of the cripple illustrate our need of
                      Christ?

                        Do you find yourself contending with the selfish, scrambling
                      crowd? Do you find others stronger than yourself taking advan-
                      tage of your weakness? Do you feel alone and friendless, shut
                      out from God's mercy? Have you been striving repeatedly to
                      meet a lifelong objective, only to be disappointed again and
                      again until your strength and hope are about to give out?
                        How we need today to hear that voice of tenderness and see
                      that countenance of compassion offering to us the help which
                      Christ alone can bring!

                        Do you want to be healed?

                        "He bids you arise in health and peace. Do not wait to feel that
                      you are made whole. Believe His word, and it will be fulfilled. Put
                      your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting
                      upon His word you will receive strength. Whatever may be the
                      evil practice, the master passion which through long in-
                      dulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs to
                      deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is 'dead in trespasses.'
                      Eph. 2:1. He will set free the captive that is held by weakness and
                      misfortune and the chains of sin."—The Desire of Ages, p. 203.

                    thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a
                    spring of water welling up to eternal life" (John 4:14, RSV).
                    (See John 7:37-39.)

                       Some who study this lesson today will know from cruel ex-
                    perience what it means to be really thirsty. And those who know
                    this by experience have a gratitude for a supply of water which is
                    unknown to those who have always turned on the faucet and
                    received all the water they could use.
                       The Bible land in which Jesus grew up and ministered was
                    one that treasured its supplies of water. Large pools were cut
                    from the rock to provide storage for water when it came in the
                    rainy seasons so that there would be a supply during the rain-
                    less summer. Wells were also dug to assure a water supply.
                       An adequate water supply was essential for establishment of
                    a village or town. He who had an unfailing well on his property
                    was wealthy indeed. More often than not the well was shared by
                    all in the community and even by strangers and travelers.
                       Think, then, of the Samaritan woman, coming alone and in
                    the heat of the day to draw water at Sychar. Generally the
                    women of a village came to the well at the same time, morning
                    and evening. They enjoyed it as a social occasion, a time of
                    chatter and laughter. Did she come alone because her sinful life
                    made her an outcast?
                       How easily Jesus knocked at the door of her heart by talking
                    to her about water—His physical need and her spiritual one.

THINK IT THROUGH      Are there hidden veins of sin in your life which have drained
                    off and dried up the wells of salvation?

                       "He who tastes of the love of Christ will continually long for
                    more; but he seeks for nothing else. The riches, honors, and
                    pleasures of the world do not attract him. The constant cry of his
                    heart is, More of Thee. And He who reveals to the soul its
                    necessity is waiting to satisfy its hunger and thirst. Every human
                    resource and dependence will fail. The cisterns will be emptied,
                    the pools become dry; but our Redeemer is an inexhaustible
                    fountain. We may drink, and drink again, and ever find a fresh
                    supply. He in whom Christ dwells has within himself the foun-
                    tain of blessing,—'a well of water springing up into everlasting
                    life.' From this source he may draw strength and grace suffi-
                    cient for all his needs."—The Desire of Ages, p. 187.
                       Do you need a spring of water welling up to eternal life within
                    your soul? Then you need Him.

                                                                             March 28
             Part 3     How did Jesus symbolize Himself at the Feast of Taberna-
     "THE LIGHT OF    cles? Why is this symbol appropriate?
       THE WORLD"
                        "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
                      the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but
                      shall have the light of life" (John 8:12).

                         We have seen Jesus portrayed as the Healer of disease, physi-
                      cal and spiritual. We have seen Him as the Source of springs of
                      living water welling up unto eternal life. Now we see Him por-
                      trayed as the Light of the world.
                         Our modern electrically illuminated world is not too well able
                      to appreciate the preciousness of light. Some can recall the
                      days when oil lamps and candles were the main means of
                      dispelling the darkness. But when Jesus announced Himself as
                      the Light of the world, it was on the occasion of the Feast of
                      Tabernacles, when two great lamps cast their glow over the city
                      of Jerusalem and the temple courts. This was to be a reminder of
                      the pillar of light that guided Israel in the desert, and it also was
                      regarded as pointing to the coming of the Messiah.

                       Were the feast lamps adequate to represent the Light of the
                      world?

                        "As the radiant lamps of the temple lighted up all about them,
                      so Christ, the source of spiritual light, illumines the darkness of
                      the world. Yet the symbol was imperfect. That great light which
                      His own hand had set in the heavens was a truer representation
                      of the glory of His mission."—The Desire of Ages, p. 463.
                        Light is vital to sustaining life. Even the faint light of the
                      winter's sun makes a difference to the growth of plants and
                      grasses. Light is the only answer to darkness, and it is appro-
                      priate that the apostle Peter, recalling the symbol which Christ
                      had used of Himself, assured, us, "We have also a more sure
                      word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as
                      unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and
                      the day star arise in your hearts" (2 Peter 1:19).

THINK IT THROUGH       In what areas of life has the light of heaven not shone into
                      my heart and upon the road before me?

                        Christ "was the spiritual light that in symbol and type and
                      prophecy had shone upon Israel. But not to the Jewish nation
                      alone was the light given. As the sunbeams penetrate to the .
                      remotest corners of the earth, so does the light of the Sun of
                      Righteousness shine upon every soul."—The Desire of Ages, p.

We Need Him         LESSON 1                                       ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      March 29
           Part 4     "And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
     "THE BREAD     cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me
        OF LIFE"    shall never thirst" (John 6:35).

                       In what way do you understand Jesus to be the "bread of
                    life"?

                        In addition to water and light there is the necessity for
                    nourishment of the body. Without food a person will starve and
                    die.
                        But here again Jesus is not only the giver of the bread that
                    sustains physical life; but, as our text clearly indicates, He is
                    speaking of a soul hunger which He alone can satisfy.
                      - The Jewish people reminded Christ that in the wilderness
                    Moses had given them bread from heaven, the manna (verses
                    31-33). Correcting their memory of who was the true giver—
                    God, not Moses—Jesus took the symbol of bread from heaven
                    to illustrate His own coming dawn from heaven to give spiritual
                    life. The manna in the wilderness had sustained only physical
                    life.
                        The sustenance of thousands of people in their travels
                    through an unproductive desert was clearly a miracle of God's
                    grace and power. It is just as miraculous to obtain eternal life. It
                    is not the result of man's searching after God, but the result of
                    man's partaking of heavenly bread—Jesus who came from God
                    to man.
                        Just as Jesus had offered the woman at the well a spring of
                    water that would be to her eternal life, He now offers Himself as
                    the bread which alone can sustain eternal life.

THINK IT THROUGH      How would you compare the bread of life which Jesus offers
                    with the tree of life that was available to Adam and Eve in the
                    garden?

                       When Adam and Eve were cut off from access to the tree of
                    life, God made known the provision of the "seed of the woman,"
                    who would come to intervene in the battle between man and
                    Satan. This was a wonderful manifestation of God's love, as well
                    as a clear indication of the human need for Christ. The tree of
                    life could have sustained the lives of Adam and Eve forever.
                    After sin only belief in Jesus brought eternal life. Will it not be
                    through Him that we shall regain access to the tree of life? And
                    with the sin question forever settled, this mortal shall put on
                    immortality. How beautifully complete and perfect is God's plan
                    to meet our desperate need!

                                                                         March 30

        "THE GOOD     for the sheep" (John 10:11).
        SHEPHERD"
                        In what ways is Jesus like a "good shepherd"?

                        While water and bread were vital to the simple life of the
                      dwellers in Bible lands in Christ's day, another common sight in
                      the land, which Christ took to represent Himself and our need of
                      Him, was that of a shepherd leading his flock. We perhaps see
                      Him best illustrated in the shepherd who owned the sheep he
                      cared for. Not in a wealthy man who owned sheep and hired
                      others to care for his flocks. Nor in the one hired shepherd. The
                      owner-shepherd's very life was the life of his sheep.
                        The true shepherd endured storm and pestilence, hunger and
                      drought and thirst with his sheep. He found for them streams of
                      clear water and green pastures where they could feed and rest.
                      He wandered about the land according to the need of his sheep.
                      He knew each of them by name, and each responded to his
                      voice. By night he was their protector from thieves and from
                      wild beasts. When they were near a sheepfold where he could
                      place them for the night, he was himself the living door to the
                      fold. It was difficult for any enemy to enter the fold without the
                      shepherd's knowledge. The good shepherd risked his life for
                      the sheep. All of this was in contrast to the hireling.
                        We recall the experiences of the young shepherd David, car-
                      ing for his father's flocks, and how he had to meet a lion and a
                      bear to preserve his entrusted treasure.
                        In the Bible sheep are regarded as helpless, defenseless, and
                      stupid. (See SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 995.) It is not without
                      reason that they have been known for centuries as "silly" sheep.
                      They manifest nothing like the intelligence or understanding of
                      a horse or a dog. Christ chose the sheep to represent us, and the
                      good shepherd to represent Himself. We, the "silly" sheep, have
                      perhaps not been sufficiently aware of our need of the Good
                      Shepherd.

THINK IT THROUGH       Does the sheep know when it is lost? Can the sheep find its
                      way home when lost?

                         "Jesus knows us individually, and is touched with the feeling
                      of our infirmities. He knows us all by name. He knows the very
                      house in which we live, the name of each occupant. He has at
                      times given directions to His servants to go to a certain street in
                      a certain city, to such a house, to find one of His sheep.
                         "Every soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only
                      one for whom the Saviour died."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 479,

We Need Him        LESSON 1                                              ❑ Friday
                                                                         March 31
          Part 6     "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:
     "THE WAY"     no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).

                       It is interesting to note that by the time Saul of Tarsus became
                   burdened to persecute members of the church of Jesus Christ,
                   they had become known as those who were "of this way" (Acts
                   9:2). Could • it be that the believers's acceptance of Christ's
                   declaration of Himself as the way led to this synonym for Chris-
                   tianity?
                       We have so many scriptural references to the "way," whether
                   it is "the way of salvation" (Acts 16:17) or "the way of the Lord"
                   (Acts 18:25), or simply "way" (Acts 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22).
                       We yearn to be restored to harmony with God. Christ is the
                   way. We yearn for victory over the plague spots of character, the
                   weaknesses that beset us, whether inherited or cultivated.
                   Christ is the way. We feel lost and bewildered so that we wander
                   in every direction hoping to find the way. Christ is the way. Are
                   we consumed with the search for truth? Christ is not only the
                   way, he is also the truth.

                     How are life and truth related in Jesus?

                     He who finds Christ, or rather, he who is willing to be found by
                   Christ finds not only the way but also the truth. Are we exhaust-
                   ing our resources in the search for the prolonging of life? As we
                   come to Christ we find "the way, the truth, and the life." How
                   more perfectly could Christ represent to us our need and His
                   complete ability to supply all our human needs?

THINK IT THROUGH     What way have I been following today? Have I been walking
                   in the sparks of my own kindling? Have I felt perfectly
                   adequate and capable of making my own way?

                      "By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity,
                   He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave
                   us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us
                   power to obey.... So when He [Christ] came 'in the likeness of
                   man,' He declared Himself the I AM. The Child of Bethlehem, the
                   meek and lowly Saviour, is God 'manifest in the flesh.' 1 Tim.
                   3:16. And to us He says, 'I AM the Good Shepherd.' I AM the
                   living Bread.' I AM the Way, the Truth, and the Life.' All power is
                   given unto Me in heaven and in earth.' John 10:11; 6:51; 14:6;
                   Matt. 28:18. I AM the assurance of every promise. I AM; be not
                   afraid. 'God with us' is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the
                   assurance of our power to obey the law of heaven."—The Desire
                   of Ages, pp. 24, 25.

                                                                             April 2
             Part 1  "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that
             LIGHT cometh into the world" (John 1:9).
           FOR ALL
                     What are some ways Jesus "lighteth every man"?

                       There is in these words a rather clear indication that every
                     man that comes into the world receives some degree of light
                     from Jesus Christ, "the true Light." As we saw in last week's
                     lesson, Jesus declares Himself to be the light of the world.
                       The setting for these words was the contrast drawn between
                     John the Baptist and Jesus Christ by the apostle John in this first
                     chapter of his Gospel. John the Baptist was a witness; he came
                     to bear witness to Him who was the light. The Scripture is clear
                     that John himself was not the light; but, as John was engaged in
                     his ministry, He who was indeed the true light was coming to the
                     forefront. As The New English Bible gives it, "The real light
                     which enlightens every man was even then coming into the
                     world."
                       This understanding of John 1:9 harmonizes with the key text
                     of the week to the effect that all men will be drawn to Christ
                     through the sacrifice which He made on Calvary's cross. (See
                     John 12:32.)
                        Such a concept of God as one whose love is given impartially
                     to all men, granting to each the opportunity to be enlightened
                     concerning the love of God in Christ Jesus, agrees with what we
                     would expect of a God of love.

THINK IT THROUGH       What examples can you think of which illustrate the fact that
                     "the true Light" had universal appeal even while He was here
                     as a man among men? (See John 12:20-23 and Luke 7:1-10.)
                     Note the inspired comment on the latter:

                        "To Jesus this [the faith of the centurion] was an earnest of
                     the work which the gospel was to accomplish among the Gen-
                     tiles. With joy He looked forward to the gathering of souls from
                     all nations to His kingdom. With deep sadness He pictured to
                     the Jews the result of their rejection of His grace: 'I say unto you,
                     That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down
                     with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
                     But the children of the kingdom shall be cast -out into outer
                     darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' Alas,
                     how many are still preparing for the same fatal disappointment!
                     While souls in heathen darkness accept His grace, how many
                     there are in Christian lands upon whom the light shines only to
                     be disregarded."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 317, 318.

                                                                           April 3
          Part 2 —The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
       "LAMB OF Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
          GOD" world." (John 1:29).

                     The Saviour who draws all men unto Himself through His
                   cross and who is the light to lighten every man in the world is
                   also declared byJohn the Baptist to be "the Lamb of God, which
                   taketh away the sin of the world." There is no favoritism here, no
                   exclusiveness, no partiality. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the
                   cross of Calvary was sufficient to cover, to cleanse, and to
                   remove the sins of the world. And what a wealth of significance
                   is called up by that very expression "the Lamb of God"!

                     What connection do you see between Jesus and the Old
                   Testament system of sacrifices?

                     The whole sacrificial system from the time of the cherubim-
                   guarded entrance to the Garden of Eden down to the very days
                   of Jesus Christ Himself could be summed up in the expression
                   "the Lamb of God."

                     How much did Abraham understand of the expression, "the
                   Lamb of God"? (See Gen. 22:1-18; Heb. 11:17-19.)

                     Abraham had been permitted to spare the life of his son Isaac,
                   and the ram caught in the thicket out on the mountaintop
                   provided the substitute for Isaac. So that place was named
                   thereafter "The Lord will provide" (RSV). But who would substi-
                   tute for the Son of God? Who would spare the heavenly Father
                   the agony of separation from His Son as He became the Sin
                   Bearer, the Lamb of God, the sacrifice and substitute for the
                   sins of the whole world? There would be no substitute for Him.
                   Wonder 0 heavens and be astonished 0 earth! Is it any mystery
                   that Jesus had the power to draw men unto Himself?

THINK IT THROUGH     To what extent have I accepted Jesus as "the Lamb of God"
                   for me?

                     "There are not many ways to heaven. Each one may not
                   choose his own way. Christ says, 'I am the way: . . . no man
                   cometh unto the Father, but by Me.' Since the first gospel
                   sermon was preached, when in Eden it was declared that the
                   seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, Christ had
                   been uplifted as the way, the truth, and the life. He was the way
                   when Adam lived, when Abel presented to God the blood of the
                   slain lamb, representing the blood of the Redeemer. Christ was
                   the way by which patriarchs and prophets were saved. He is the
                   way by which alone we can have access to God."—The Desire of

 "COME AND SEE"    answered him, 'Before Philip called you, when you were under
                   the fig tree, I saw you' " (John 1:48, RSV).

                     It had been when John the Baptist pointed out "the Lamb of
                   God" that the first men who became Christ's apostles left John
                   the Baptist to follow Jesus. They were Andrew, the brother of
                   Peter, and John the evangelist. "Moved by an irresistible im-
                   pUlse, they followed Jesus,—anxious to speak with Him, yet
                   awed and silent, lost in the overwhelming significance of the
                   thought, 'Is this the Messiah?' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 138.

                   first disciples? Verses 40-45.

                      But no sooner had Andrew and John come to know Jesus
                   even a little than there was born in their hearts a desire to call
                   others. So Andrew went in search of his brother Simon.
                      And now we find Jesus calling Philip and saying to him,
                   "Follow Me." Philip obeyed this summons and himself became
                   an extension of the voice and call of Jesus Christ. Philip went in
                   search of his friend, Nathanael. Since his own knowledge of
                   Jesus was still limited, he was having a little difficulty in per-
                   suading Nathanael that he had indeed found the Messiah. But
                   finally he simply said, "Come and see." When Nathanael came,
                   Jesus gave such evidence of knowing him and his longing for
                   the Messiah that Nathanael declared in growing faith, "Rabbi,
                   thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel" (verse 49).

THINK IT THROUGH     Does my life so reflect the likeness of Jesus today that it
                   says to those who do not know Christ, Come and see? (Com-
                   pare Rev. 22:17; 2 Cor. 3:2.)

                      "The teaching of Christ was the expression of an inwrought
                   conviction and experience, and those who learn of Him become
                   teachers after the divine order. The word of God, spoken by one
                   who is himself sanctified through it, has a life-giving power that
                   makes it attractive to the hearers, and convicts them that it is a
                   living reality. When one has received the truth in the love of it, he
                   will make this manifest in the persuasion of his manner and the
                   tones of his voice. He makes known that which he himself has
                   heard, seen, and handled of the word of life, that others may
                   have fellowship with him through the knowledge of Christ. His
                   testimony, from lips touched with a live coal from off the altar, is
                   truth to the receptive heart, and works sanctification upon the
                   character."—The Desire of Ages, p. 142.

                                                                      April 5
          Part 4   "The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it,
      "BORN OF but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is
     THE SPIRIT" with every one who is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8, RSV).

                      Did you ever think in childhood that you might stop the wind
                   from blowing? As impossible a dream as that of the foolish king
                   who thought that he could hold back the waves of the ocean.
                   Whether it be the gentle refreshing summer breeze that breaks
                   up the heat of the day or the awesome hurricane, tornado, or
                   monsoon, there is nothing that man can do to control the will of
                   the wind.
                      The love of God is like the wind in that He who draWs us to
                   Himself draws universally. Man can build no barriers that can
                   keep out the first approach of God through the Holy Spirit. This
                   is not to suggest for a moment that the Lord forces His love
                   upon any; but there is a light which lights every man that comes
                   into the world. God's love is universal, Jesus shed His blood for
                   the sins of the whole world. God sees and knows equally every
                   individual, no matter where he is found in the world, and no man
                   can stay God's love except by his persistent rejection of it.

                      Must I be able to explain the love of God in order to receive
                   it?

                     "It is impossible for finite minds to comprehend the work of
                   redemption. Its mystery exceeds human knowledge; yet he who
                   passes from death to life realizes that it is a divine reality. The
                   beginning of redemption we may know here through a personal
                   experience. Its results reach through the eternal ages."—The
                   Desire of Ages, p. 173.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why should I or should I not be troubled because I cannot
                   tell the exact time and place and circumstance under which I
                   gave my heart in response to the movings of God's Spirit?

                      "A person may not be able to tell the exact time or place, or to
                    trace all the circumstances in the jirocess of conversion; but
                    this does not prove him to be unconverted. By an agency as
                   'unseen as the wind, Christ is constantly working upon the heart.
                    Little by little, perhaps unconsciously to the receiver, impres-
                    sions are made that tend to draw the soul to Christ. These may
                    be received through meditating upon Him, through reading the
                    Scriptures, or through hearing the word from the living
                    preacher. Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with more direct ap-

                                                                              April 6
              Part 5      Why is any person attracted to Jesus as Saviour?
         "GIVEN . . .
     OF MY FATHER"        "And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can
                        come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father"
                        (John 6:65).

                           The experience of coming to Jesus Christ is completely real. It
                        is as real as the fact that God the Father reigns on the throne of
                        the universe and that all things are sustained by His might. It is
                        not by accident, not by good fortune, but entirely by the power
                        of the Spirit that any individual comes to Christ and finds eternal
                        life in Him.

                          How completely is the heavenly Father willing that all
                        should find eternal life in His Son? John 6:39, 40.

                          Did association with Christ while He was on earth have a
                        saving power greater than He can provide now?

                           We may think that if we had lived on earth when Jesus was
                        here we would have been with John, Andrew, Nathanael, Philip,
                        Mary Magdalene, and the woman at the well in giving our hearts
                        to Him; that we would have been among the first to support Him
                        and to let Him know of our love. We may sometimes think that
                        anyone who saw and heard Jesus in person would have been
                        compelled to receive Him. But think of Judas Iscariot, who had
                        the closest association with Jesus, who was treated as the rest
                        of the disciples were treated for some three years, but who
                        never committed himself to Jesus. By his own choice Judas
                        deprived the heavenly Father of the privilege of bringing him
                        into a saving relationship with the Son, Jesus Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH          What does it really mean to believe on the Son of God?

                           "There is a great work to be done for your own soul's salva-
                        tion, and to qualify you to win others from unbelief to a life
                        sustained by faith in Christ Jesus. 'Verily, verily, I say unto you,
                        He that believeth on me [with a casual faith?—No, with an
                        abiding faith that works by love and purifies the soul] hath
                        everlasting life. I am that bread of life.... I am the living bread
                        which came down from heaven. . . . But there are some of you
                        that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they
                        were that believed not, and who should betray Him. And he said,
                        Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me,
                        except it were given unto him of my Father.' (John 6:47, 48, 51,

                                                                            April 7
          Part 6     "I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you" (John
    NO ORPHANS     14:18, RSV).
          HERE
                     In the original language of the New Testament, Jesus was
                   saying, "I will not leave you as orphans, I will come to you"
                   (NASB). How more beautifully could He have expressed it! He
                   was about to return to heaven following His unexpected death
                   on the cross—unexpected to His dearest disciples. Their utter
                   desolation begins to be seen on the night of the betrayal and
                   continues for some of them through most of the day of His
                   resurrection. Absolutely orphaned!
                     But no. The very event which made them such desolate or-
                   phans from their beloved Master was the means by which He
                   would ensure their being with Him for all eternity. And in the
                   interim, throughout the remainder of their lives, He would be
                   with them by His Holy Spirit.

                     Is Christ's love, offered to those original followers, offered
                   equally to us? Have you been drawn so close to Jesus Christ
                   that even in the deepest depths of your loneliness, you know
                   He has not left you an orphan? (See John 16:33.)

                     "The life of Christ's disciples is to be like His, a series of
                   uninterrupted victories, not seen to be such here, but recog-
                   nized as such in the great hereafter.
                     "Those who labor for the good of others are working in union
                   with the heavenly angels. They have their constant companion-
                   ship, their unceasing ministry. Angels of light and power are
                   ever near to protect, to comfort, to heal, to instruct, to inspire.
                   The highest education, the truest culture, and the most exalted
                   service possible to human beings in this world are theirs."—
                   Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 307, 308.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it some people resist the pleadings of God for their
                   salvation?

                     "The only way in which we can gain a more perfect apprehen-
                   sion of truth is by keeping the heart tender and subdued by the
                   Spirit of Christ. The soul must be cleansed from vanity and
                   pride, and vacated of all that has held it in possession, and
                   Christ must be enthroned within. Human science is too limited
                   to comprehend the atonement. The plan of redemption is so
                   far-reaching that philosophy cannot explain it. It will ever re-
                   main a mystery that the most profound reasoning cannot
                   fathom. The science of salvation cannot be explained; but it can
                   be known by experience. Only he who sees his own sinfulness
                   can discern the preciousness of the Saviour."—The Desire of

          Part 1   "Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you
     WHY REPENT? to repentance?" (Rom. 2:4, RSV).

                     We may at first think that we see a contradiction in the calls for
                   men to repent (as in the preaching of John the Baptist and of
                   Peter at Pentecost) and the suggestion that it does not lie within
                   man's unaided power to bring himself to repentance.

                     What did Peter say is the source of repentance? Acts 5:31.

                      Is God asking or commanding us to repent and yet withhold-
                   ing the means by which alone we can be brought to repent-
                   ance? Does He require us to have something for our salvation
                   which can only be obtained as a gift from Him, and then with-
                   hold the gift? No. As our text indicates, God's kindness is meant
                   to lead us to repentance.
                     If we will open our eyes to see God's kindness, His love, His
                   long-suffering, His tender mercies toward us, these will lead us
                   to repentance. Do you not recall from your childhood occasions
                   when discipline tended to harden your will against the will of
                   parent or teacher, but when that same parent or teacher made
                   some personal sacrifice in order to meet some particular need
                   or wish of yours, you were all broken up inside? When you knew
                   that your mother or father was going without something for
                   herself or himself in order to give you something that you
                   needed or thought you wanted, could you withstand that love?
                   Could you persist in having your own way?

THINK IT THROUGH     What has Jesus done for me that would lead me to be
                   genuinely sorry for my sins and willfulness?

                      " 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
                   world.' John 1:29. The light shining from the cross reveals the
                   love of God. His love is drawing us to Himself. If we do not resist
                   this drawing, we shall be led to the foot of the cross in repent-
                   ance for the sins that have crucified the Saviour."—The Desire
                   of Ages, pp. 175, 176.

                     What is the relationship between repentance and forgive-
                   ness?

                     "It is true that repentance does precede the forgiveness of
                   sins; for it is only the broken and contrite heart that will feel the
                   need of a Saviour." But "the Bible does not teach that the sinner
                   must repent before he can heed the invitation of Christ, 'Come
                   unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden and I will give you
                   rest.' Matthew 11:28. It is the virtue that goes forth from Christ,
                   that leads to genuine repentance."—Steps to Christ, p. 26.

           Part 2   "He said to him the third time, 'Simon, son of John, do you
        REPENTANT love me?' Peter was grieved because he said to him the third
           PETER time, 'Do you love me?' And he said to him, 'Lord, you know
                  everything; you know that I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed
                  my sheep' " (John 21:17, RSV).

                       Why do you think Jesus asked Peter three times for assur-
                     ance of his love for Him?

                        Our text is drawn from conversation of Jesus with Peter after
                     the resurrection. Three times Jesus asked Peter if he loved Him.
                     If Peter was sincere, wasn't once enough?
                        Peter had three times denied his Lord, not many days before
                     this—he who had boasted that though everybody else should
                     forsake the Saviour, he would never leave Him. And Peter had
                     been something of a leader among the disciples. Yet in the hour
                     of trial he had failed so miserably—almost as miserably as
                     Judas. For as Judas betrayed the lovelessness of his own heart
                     by selling his Saviour for 30 pieces of silver, Peter showed the
                     weakness of his love for his Lord by denying that he knew Him,
                     and accompanying his denial with the kind of low-down cursing
                     that he may have picked up among the fishermen of Galilee.
                        Now if Peter is to be restored to the confidence of his brethren
                     and is to resume leadership, it must be evident to all that the
                     proud braggart has become humble and teachable. Notice that
                     Peter does not now boast. When pressed regarding his sincerity
                     he merely casts himself upon Christ's knowledge of the hearts
                     of all men: "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love
                     you" (Verse 17).

THINK IT THROUGH       What broke the heart of proud Peter and led him to genuine
                     repentance, genuine change of mind?

                       "While the degrading oaths were fresh upon Peter's lips, and
                     the shrill crowing of the cock was still ringing in his ears, the
                     Saviour turned from the frowning judges [in the court of
                     Caiaphas], and looked full upon His poor disciple. At the same
                     time Peter's eyes were drawn to his Master. In that gentle
                     countenance he read deep pity and sorrow, but there was no
                     anger there.
                       "The sight of that pale, suffering face, those quivering lips,
                     that look of compassion and forgiveness, pierced his heart like
                     an arrow. . . .
                       "A tide of memories rushed over him. . . . Unable longer to
                     endure the scene, he rushed, heartbroken, from the hall."—The

           JUDAS
                     In so many ways it was night for Judas. Judas's action would
                  bring night to the disciples and even to the Lord Himself.
                     The same kind of sympathy and love and yearning tenderness
                  which broke the independent heart of Peter was resisted by the
                  hardened, self-deceived heart of Judas. By comparison with
                  Judas, Peter was crude and uneducated, but he was utterly
                  whatever he was. Judas was a deceiver. He apparently deceived
                  all the disciples and even thought he had deceived the Lord.
                  Thereby he revealed how sadly he was himself deceived.
                     Judas had already arranged to betray his Lord for the price of
                  a slave-30 pieces of silver—before the Lord stooped to take the
                  place of a slave and bathed the feet of Judas in the upper room.
                  And although, as on several previous occasions, an inner urge
                  swept over him to confess all and bare his heart before the
                  Redeemer, he repeatedly accepted the tempter's rationale for
                  his actions. He even convinced himself that the betrayal was a
                  kindness to the Lord because it would force the reticent Saviour
                  into revealing Himself before His enemies as the undeniable
                  Messiah—if Messiah He really was.

                     heeded. Then the case of Judas was decided, and the feet that
                     Jesus had washed went forth to the betrayer's work."—The

                       Do not the words of Scripture imply repentance by Judas: "I
                     have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood" (Matt.
                     27:4)?

                        "The Saviour did not reproach His betrayer. He knew that
                     Judas did not repent; his confession was forced from his guilty
                     soul by an awful sense of condemnation and a looking for of
                     judgment, but he felt no deep, heartbreaking grief that he had
                     betrayed the spotless Son of God, and denied the Holy One of
                     Israel. . .

We Are Sorry       LESSON 3                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     April 12
         Part 4      "Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and re-
     REPENT OR     pent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee
       PERISH!     quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, ex-
                   cept thou repent" (Rev. 2:5).

                     In the letters from Jesus to the seven churches there are five
                   calls to repentance. Failure to heed the call of the Lord would be
                   followed by dire consequences. And these are messages of love
                   from Jesus to His professed followers. This fact is particularly
                   indicated in the message to Laodicea, "As many as I love, I
                   rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent" (Rev.
                   3:19).

                     Were these appeals to the churches general calls for re-
                   pentance, or were they associated with specific needs, prob-
                   lems, or sins of the respective churches? (See Rev. 2:4, 5,
                   14-16, 20, 21; 3:2, 3, 15-19.)

                       It is important to recognize that the Lord was pointing out
                    specific sins in each church. The call to repentance was closely
                    associated with words of specific reproof, specific appeal, de-
                    signed to have specific results in the church. So we may imply
                    that individual repentance must relate to particular sins and
                    weaknesses. Let each pray the prayer of the psalmist, "Search
                    me, 0 God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
                   'and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
                    everlasting" (Ps. 139:23, 24).
                       "Although as sinners we are under the condemnation of the
                    law, yet Christ by His obedience rendered to the law, claims for
                    the repentant soul the merit of His own righteousness. In order
                    to obtain the righteousness of Christ, it is necessary for the
                    sinner to know what that repentance is which works a radical
                    change of mind and spirit and action. The work of transforma-
                    tion must begin in the heart, and manifest its power through
                    every faculty of the being; but man is not capable of originating
                    such a repentance as this, and can experience it alone through
                    Christ, who ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and gave
                    gifts unto men."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 393.

THINK IT THROUGH     How serious is the loss of our first love for Christ and His
                   church?

                     "The losing of the first love is specified as a moral fall. The
                   loss of this love is represented as something that will affect the
                   entire religious life. Of those who have lost this love, God says
                   that unless they repent, He will come to them, and remove their
                   candlestick out of its place."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

            Part 5     "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance"
      OH, SINNER     (Luke 5:32).
            MAN!
                       He who responds to the call of Christ's love will be led to
                     repent. All of us who feel our own sinfulness and helplessness
                     may be assured that Jesus did not come to call the righteous
                     ones. Rather, He came to call and to save sinners—those who,
                     when confronted with the love of God as seen in Calvary's cross,
                     would cry out, God be merciful to me a sinner!

                      Is there any one sinner beyond the reach of the love of God?
                     Matt. 12:31, 32.

                       The Scripture teaches that God will forgive the sins we con-
                     fess. (See 1 John 1:9.) Any unconfessed sin is unpardonable so
                     long as it remains unconfessed. It is the Holy Spirit who convicts
                     us of our need for confession. To refuse the Spirit's conviction
                     places the sinner where he cannot confess so that his sin might
                     be forgiven.
                       "The sinner may resist this love, may refuse to be drawn to
                     Christ; but if he does not resist he will be drawn to Jesus; a
                     knowledge of the plan of salvation will lead him to the foot of the
                     cross in repentance for his sins, which have caused the suffer-
                     ings of God's dear Son."—Steps to Christ, p. 27.

THINK IT THROUGH       What shall I do if I have in my heart a longing for something
                     better than this world can give?

                        I can do a number of things: (1) I can ask God to give me
                     repentance, to reveal Christ in His infinite love and His perfect
                     purity. (2) I can come to Christ just as I am. (3) I can refuse to
                     excuse myself by comparing myself with others and their de-
                     fects. (4) I can refuse to delay the work of forsaking my sins and
                     seeking purity of heart through Jesus. (5) I can refuse to con-
                     sider any sin as too trivial to call for genuine repentance. (6) I
                     can remember that one wrong trait of character cherished can
                     neutralize the power of the gospel. (7) I can invite Christ to
                     search my heart and to reveal its wicked ways. (8) I can be in
                     dead earnest as I would be if I believed my life was at stake. (9) I
                     can study God's Word prayerfully. (10) I can refuse to give up to
                     despair. All God's promises and His warnings are manifesta-
                     tions of His love.

                                                                         April 14
           Part 6     What does Peter teach about God's desire for everyone?
     ALL SHOULD
         REPENT       "The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count
                    slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any
                    should perish, but that all should reach repentance" (2 Peter
                    3:9, RSV).

                      What a tragedy that many earnest Christians have thought
                    that some are predestined to be saved and some predestined to
                    be lost! These inspired words, so clear and forthright, declare
                    that God does not wish that any should perish but thata// should
                    reach or come to repentance.
                      This text confirms what we have learned earlier—that God is
                    drawing all men to Himself, that there is a light which lights
                    every man that comes into the world, that Jesus has paid the
                    price for the salvation of the whole world and not for a selected
                    few.
                       How is it then, that in comparison with the billions of the
                    world's population, so few even profess the name of Christ and
                    still fewer actively call upon His name?
                       Think of the grief which must come to the heart of God, not
                    only because of sin, but because of our often persistent refusal
                    to respond to the only means of bringing them eternal deliver-
                    ance from sins and their consequences.

THINK IT THROUGH      What was the setting in which Peter gave us this assur-
                    ance of God's wish that all should come to repentance? (See
                    2 Peter 3:3-8).

                       Peter gave this assurance after his warning to those who think
                    that everything that is happening in the world has always hap-
                    pened, that everything is going along in the same old way and
                    always will. But Peter reminds these scoffers of the Flood which
                    came and disrupted a world which had come to believe that
                    things would never change.
                       Looking at the passage of the centuries from the time of the
                    Flood, he reminds that with the Lord time is not a problem, that a
                    thousand years are only as a day to Him. What counts is the
                    promises of God which may look slow of fulfillment as men
                    count slowness. But what men fail to recognize is that it is the
                    forbearance of God that leads Him to delay His coming. But
                    don't let that delay deceive you, Peter reasons, because the day
                    of the Lord will come, and when it does come, it will be for many
                    like a thief unexpected, catching them unprepared and unpro-
                    tected. Then things will happen which men have decided would
                    never happen. It is because the Lord wants all to be led to
                    repentance, says Peter, that time goes on as long as it does.

                                                                            April 16
             Part 1   What were key results of the preaching of John the Baptist
        CONFESSION in the wilderness and of his message, "Repent ye"?
       AND BAPTISM
                      "Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
                    region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jor-
                    dan, confessing their sins" (Matt. 3:5, 6).

                        In the ministry of John the Baptist repentance and confession
                     went hand in hand. He called to the people of Israel to recognize
                     that the kingdom of heaven was about to come upon them and
                     that in order to be ready for it they must repent. The people who
                     heard him confessed their sins and accepted baptism at his
                     hand, signifying the washing away of their sins.
                        It is significant that even the Roman soldiers who came out to
                     hear John were instructed to modify their life-style so as to
                     cease sinning against their fellowmen. Confession of sin was to
                     accompany forsaking of sin.
                        There is a marked danger today that, in bringing new converts
                     to Jesus Christ and to church fellowship, we fail to give them
                     time to recognize their responsibility in repentance, confession,
                     and restitution. A number of years ago there was a baptismal
                     candidate who heard God speaking to him through the preach-
                     ing of the judgment hour message, and when he heard of con-
                     fession and restitution, he sought out the minister in alarm. He
                     began to tell the things of which he had been guilty in his youth,
                     and even since becoming a married man and a father. He had
                     been something of a terror to the secluded rural community
                     where he had lived. He had borrowed without intention of re-
                     turning, and he had borrowed and had simply forgotten to
                     return. Now the thought of confession and restitution filled his
                     heart with fear.
                       But the Spirit of the Lord brought conviction, and this
                     brother, with tracts in his pocket rather than a gun on his hip, set
                     out among his neighbors to confess and restore. They were
                     amazed that he came to see them; still more amazed at what he
                     had to tell them. They gladly forgave him and some grabbed out
                     of his pocket the Christian magazines he had brought. "If these
                     did you that much good," said one, "maybe they can help me."

THINK IT THROUGH       What neglected work of confession and restitution do I
                     have?

                       "The conditions of obtaining mercy of God are simple and
                     just and reasonable. The Lord does not require us to do some
                     grievous thing in order that we may have the forgiveness of sin.
                     We need not make long and wearisome pilgrimages, or perform
                     painful penances, to commend our souls to the God of heaven
                     or to expiate our transgression; but he that confesseth and
                     forsaketh his sin shall have mercy."—Steps to Christ, p. 37.

We Wronged Him          LESSON 4                                       ❑    Monday
                                                                            April 17
           Part 2     Even after years of apostleship, how did Paul see himself in
        CHIEF OF    the sight of God?
        SINNERS
                     "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
                    Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I
                    am chief" (1 Tim. 1:15).

                      Was it inappropriate for a great apostle such as Paul to admit
                    to a young beginning preacher like Timothy that he regarded
                    himself the chief of sinners? Was there danger that Timothy
                    would despise the apostle for so classifying himself? He might
                    assume that Paul was using a figure of speech, that he was not
                    genuine in so describing himself—chief of sinners.

                      Why did Paul see himself so much a sinner?

                      One has only to look briefly at the acts of the apostles as Luke
                    portrayed them to see that, to the very end of his ministry, the
                    great apostle Paul never forgot that he persecuted the saints of
                    Jesus Christ—His ,church. It seemed ever to weigh upon his
                    soul. Not that he w as-unforgiven! But when writing to Timothy
                    about it, he related it to the mercy he had received from. God. He
                    had no salvation in himself; it came to him from Jesus Christ.
                    (See verse 16.) The apostle had evidently taught his converts a
                    similar measure of earnestness in rejecting the past and accept-
                    ing God's mercy.

                      With what intensity did the Corinthian believers engage in
                    afflicting their ,souls for sin? 2 Cor. 7:10, 11.

                       This scripture (2 Cor. 7:10, 11) rings with earnestness. Here is
                    true confession of sin.
                       "Christ looks at the spirit, and when He sees us carrying our
                    burden with faith, His perfect holiness atones for our shortcom-
                    ings. When we do our best, He becomes our righteousness. It
                    takes every ray of light that God sends to us to make us the light
                    of the world."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 368.

THINK IT THROUGH     What hidden chapters in my life have never been included in
                    my experience of repentance. and confession?

                       "Those who have not humbled their souls before God , in
                    acknowledging their guilt, have not yet fulfilled the first condi-
                    tion of acceptance. If we have not experienced that repentance
                    which is not to be repented of, and have not with true humilia-
                    tion of soul and brokenness of spirit confessed our sins, abhor-
                    ring our iniquity, we have never truly sought for the forgiveness
                    of sin; and if we have never sought, we have never found the
                    peace of God."—Steps to Christ, pp. 37, 38.

                                                                              April 18
            Part 3     Is it ever appropriate for one person to confess the sins of
     "MY SIN AND     another person?
       THE SIN OF
      MY PEOPLE"       "While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and
                     the sin of my people. Israel, and presenting my supplication
                     before the Lord my God for the holy hill of my God; while I was
                     speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the
                     vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the
                     evening sacrifice" (Dan. 9:20, 21, RSV).

                       Here we have the prophet Daniel, in exile with many of his
                     people, seeking a very special relationship with the Lord
                     whereby to know and understand the Lord's purposes in deal-
                     ing with Judah. Some of the things which had been revealed to
                     Daniel placed him in great perplexity, since he could not see
                     how what he had been shown could fit into what the Lord had
                     earlier predicted for Judah. The prophet therefore gives himself
                     to a special time of afflicting his soul for his own sin and the sin
                     of his people Israel, which has placed them in captivity. He
                     places himself in the role of an intercessor between God's
                     people and God Himself. In this respect he is acting as a true
                     servant of the Lord.

                       What does the prophet Joel say the leaders of God's people
                     are to do? Joel 2:17.

THINK IT THROUGH       How could the church today practice the example of Daniel
                     and the teaching of Joel noted in this lesson?

                        "We are now living in the great day of atonement. In the
                     typical service, while the high priest was making the atonement
                     for Israel, all were required to afflict their souls by repentance of
                     sin and humiliation before the Lord, lest they be cut off from
                     among the people. In like manner, all who would have their
                     names retained in the book of life should now, in the few remain-
                     ing days of their probation, afflict their souls before God by
                     sorrow for sin and true repentance. There must be deep, faithful
                     searching of heart. The light, frivolous spirit indulged by so
                     many professed Christians must be put away. There is earnest
                     warfare before all who would subdue the evil tendencies that
                     strive for the mastery. The work of preparation is an individual
                     work. We are not saved in groups. The purity and devotion of
                     one will not offset the want of these qualities in another."—The
                     Great Controversy, pp. 489, 490. (Emphasis supplied.)
                       This does not mean that we cannot meet together in prayer
                     and confession of our failures as a people. Neither can such
                     group activity substitute for the individual repentance of the
                     individual soul.

          Part 4     To whom beside God is confession to be made?
     CONFESS TO
    ONE ANOTHER      "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for
                   another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer
                   of a righteous man availeth much" (James 5:16).

                     "Confess.Textual evidence favors ... beginning v.16 with the
                   word "therefore." The prime requirement for sincere faith in
                   prayer is a clear conscience. Wrong deeds secretly done are to
                   be confessed also to those who have suffered injury. A guilty
                   conscience erects a barrier to unreserved reliance upon God
                   and will defeat prayer."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 541.

                     What is the connection between confession of sin and for-
                   giveness? James 5:16.

                      In commenting upon this text Ellen White interprets it as
                   follows: "Confess your sins to God, who only can forgive them,
                   and your faults to one another. If you have given offense to your
                   friend or neighbor, you are to acknowledge your wrong, and it is
                   his duty freely to forgive you. Then you are to seek forgiveness
                   of God, because the brother you have wounded is the property
                   of God, and in injuring him you sinned against his Creator and
                   Redeemer. The case is brought before the only true Mediator,
                   our great High Priest, who ... is able to cleanse from every stain
                   of iniquity. Hebrews 4:15."—Steps to Christ, p. 37.
                      "We are to surrender our hearts to God, that He may renew
                   and sanctify us, and fit us for His heavenly court. We are not to
                   wait for some special time, but today we are to give ourselves to
                   Him, refusing to be the servants of sin. Do you imagine you can
                   leave off sin a little at a time? Oh, leave the accursed thing at
                   once! Hate the things that Christ hates, love the things that
                   Christ loves. Has He not by His death and suffering made provi-
                   sion for your cleansing from sin?"—Selected Messages, bk. 1,
                   p. 327.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the substance of confession? Will a gift suffice?

                     "True confession is always of a specific character, and ac-
                   knowledges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to
                   be brought before God only; they may be wrongs that should be
                   confessed to individuals who have suffered injury through
                   them; or they may be of a public character, and should then be
                   as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite and
                   to the point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are
                   guilty."—Steps to Christ, p. 38.

          Part 5    What clear example does the Old Testament present of a
        SPECIFIC specific acknowledgment of sin by the people of God?
     CONFESSION
                   "And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
                 unto the Lord thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto
                 all our sins this evil, to ask us a king" (1 Sam. 12:19).

                      God's people Israel, desiring to be like the nations roun
                   about them, demanded of the Lord a king. They had been led for
                   many years by judges called by God, the last of whom w a s
                   Samuel the prophet. They were not satisfied and desired to
                   a king over them. They had been duly warned of the sad c
                   quences that would follow, but their desire to be like the na'.
                   round about them overwhelmed their loyalty to God and t(
                   chosen servants. So the Lord permitted judgments to fall u,
                   Israel, and they seemed quickly to become aware of the rear
                   for these judgments. It is noteworthy that in their confessio.
                   their wrongdoing they were explicit regarding the particular sin

THINK IT THROUGH     Can I expect the Lord to grant a blanket forgiveness for a
                   generalized confession of sinfulness or selfishness?

                     "In the days of Samuel the Israelites wandered from God
                   They were suffering the consequences of sin; for they had lost
                   their faith in God, lost their discernment of His power and
                   wisdom to rule the nation, lost their confidence in His ability to
                   defend and vindicate His cause. They turned from the great
                   Ruler of the universe and desired to be governed as were the
                   nations around them. Before they found peace they made this
                   definite confession: 'We have added unto all our sins this evil, to
                   ask us a king.' 1 Samuel 12:19. The very sin of which they were
                   convicted had to be confessed. Their ingratitude oppressed
                   their souls and severed them from God."—Steps to Christ, pp.
                   38, 39.

                     What parallel is seen in the experience of the apostle Paul in
                   his attitude toward his sin?Acts 26:9-11.

                      "Paul did not seek to shield himself; he paints his sin in its
                   darkest hue, not attempting to lessen his guilt. He says: 'Many of
                   the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from
                   the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my
                   voice against them. And I punished them oft in every
                   synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being ex-
                   ceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto

We Wronged Him        LESSON 4                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                            April 21
          Part 6   No matter how great the evil done, what blessed assurance
      "FAITHFUL is given to all who truly confess and forsake their sins?
      AND JUST"
                   "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
                 our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John
                 1:9).

                     There probably is no more precious promise in all Sacred
                   Scripture than this unequivocal, unlimited assurance of for-
                   giveness and cleansing if we confess.
                     This overwhelming promise of God's mercy is surrounded by
                   warnings against our suggesting that we have no sins. The path
                   of hiding sins is a path that leads to destruction. Those who
                   follow such a course are deceiving themselves and show that
                   they do not have the truth in them; they are attempting to make
                   God untrue to Himself, and they thus show that His Word is not
                   in them. The glorious promise of separation from sin is for
                   whoever is willing to "confess" his sins.
                     It is interesting to notice the intent of the word "confess" in
                   this text—"to speak the same thing." We may see here a link
                   with the comment at the beginning of our lesson that confes-
                   sion is not always of sin, but may be a confession of faith in
                   Christ or a confessing of His name. Either way the confession
                   implies a speaking.

                     What attitude lends itself to genuine confession of sin? Ps.
                   34:18.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why does the spirit of self-justification not fit in with the
                   spirit of true confession?

                      "The spirit of self-justification originated in the father of lies
                   and has been exhibited by all the sons and daughters of Adam.
                   Confessions of this order are not inspired by the divine Spirit
                   and will not be acceptable to God. True repentance will lead a
                   man to bear his guilt himself and acknowledge it without decep-
                   tion or hypocrisy. Like the poor publican, not lifting up so much
                   as his eyes unto heaven, he will cry, 'God be merciful to me a
                   sinner,' and those who do acknowledge their guilt will be jus-
                   tified, for Jesus will plead His blood in behalf of the repentant
                   soul."—Steps to Christ, pp. 40, 41.
                       No human therapy can bathe the soul with the healing power
                   that comes from the assurance of acceptance with God on the
                   part of him who truly is penitent and brings his sins humbly and
                   with a broken heart to the cross of Calvary. Quickness to ac-
                   knowledge one's own faults and sins and slowness to accuse
                   another, are the results of the Spirit's work on the human heart.

             Part 1     What made the faith of the Jewish nobleman so outstanding
         "THE MAN     as to receive a place in the inspired record of the Gospels?
         BELIEVED"
                        "Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the
                      man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and
                      he went his way" (John 4:50).

                         In many repspects the Jewish nobleman had characteristics
                      which most of us can acknowledge that we share. He was
                      influenced by status, prestige, outward appearance, material
                      influence, possessions, and authority.
                         The nobleman's son was at the point of death, and the
                      urgency of the situation led this man of authority to undertake
                      the search for Jesus. He would entrust this responsibility to n
                      one else. Finding Jesus, he was greatly disappointed by what
                      saw—none of the human trappings of influence, authority,
                      power. Doubt jabbed at his heart, but in his desperation
                      made known his request to the Saviour, making the answer
                      his need the evidence upon which he would or would not b
                      lieve on Christ as the Messiah. It was then that the words of our
                      key text for the week were spoken by the Lord: '`Except ye see,
                      signs and wonders, ye will not believe" (John 4:48).
                         Suddenly the Jewish nobleman was confronted with the fact
                      that his own unbelief and his entirely selfish motives could cost
                      the life of his son. Realizing now that he was in the presence of
                      Him who read his innermost thoughts, he cast himself upon the
                      Saviour's mercy: "Sir, come down ere my child die." The re-
                      sponse of the Saviour came immediately, "Go thy way, thy son
                      liveth." Though he has no tangible evidence, no telecommuni-
                      cation from his home, the nobleman is satisfied that his son is
                      well. So much so that he does not even rush home. He now
                      trusts the Saviour implicitly.

THINK IT THROUGH        When have I exercised as trusting a faith as that of the
                      Jewish nobleman?

                        "The Saviour longs to give us a greater blessing than we ask;
                      and He delays the answer to our request that He may show us
                      the evil of our own hearts, and our deep need of His grace. He
                      desires us to renounce the selfishness that leads us to seek Him

                      ourselves wholly to His love."—The Desire of Ages, p. 200.

                                                                          April 24

                     "The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into
                  the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man, which told me
                  all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" (John 4:28, 29).

                         "Left her waterpot. She was on the point of leaving, her
                     waterpot filled (DA 183), when the disciples returned from the
                     village with food for Jesus. She was eager to reach the village
                     and tell others of her great discovery, and did not care to be
                     slowed by the heavy waterpot. She had experienced desire,
                     conviction, and decision . . . , and the next logical step was
                     action-she went to tell others of her great discovery. This tes-
                     tified to the reality of her decision. The waiting waterpot was

                         Doubtless a number of factors led the woman of Samaria to
                     put her trust in Jesus as the Messiah. It is evident that He won
                     her attention, aroused her interest, awakened her desire, and
                     led her to perceive who it was that spoke to her. He, a Jew, had
                     taken the unthinkable initiative to speak to a Samaritan woman.
                     But having led her to request of Him that living water springing
                     up into everlasting life, she suddenly had the veil of anonymity
                     swept away from her soul and became exposed to the blazing
                     light of the Saviour's purity.
                         While she attempted to parry the, exposure by theological
                     argument and racial prejudice, it occurred to her sin-darkened
                     mind that this Man acted as she would expect the Messiah to
                     act. When she gave tentative expression to such a possibility,
                     she received the glorious revelation, "I that speak unto thee am
                     he" (verse 26).

THINK IT THROUGH       Could it be that the path of having our sins exposed between
                     ourselves and the Lord would be the path of genuine faith?
                     How can this happen?

                       "As the woman talked with Jesus, she was impressed with His
                     words.... As the past of her life had been spread out before her,
                     she had been made sensible of her great want.... Nothing that
                     had hitherto come in contact with her had so awakened her to a
                     higher need. Jesus had convinced her that He read the secrets
                     of her life; yet she felt that He was her friend, pitying and loving
                     her. While the very purity of His presence condemned her sin,
                     He had spoken no word of denunciation, but had told her of His
                     grace, that could renew the soul."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 189,

                                                                       April 25
         Part 3   What prejudice discouraged many from believing on Jesus
      MAN FROM Christ?
       GALILEE?
                  "Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ
                come out of Galilee?" (John 7:41).

                      It perhaps should not surprise us if today national and racial
                   and social prejudices throw up barriers between men. Such
                   barriers are undoubtedly as old as sin itself.
                      A long-standing prejudice existed in Jerusalem against the
                   more open, liberty-loving, uninhibited people of Galilee. Jewish
                   tradition had determined that since Christ was of the seed of
                   David and Bethlehem was David's town, then Christ must come
                   out of Bethlehem and not out of Galilee. While He was to be born
                   in Bethlehem, when He should make His debut no one would
                   know from whence He had come. This idea is reflected in the
                   words, "Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when
                   Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is" (John 7:27).
                     So the enemy of God and man contrives to place stumbling
                   blocks in the path of faith. And human pride accepts these
                   devious prejudices rather than the simple, straightforward
                   statements of the Word of God.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is there any assurance whereby one can know what indeed
                   is the truth of God?

                      "The preaching and teaching of His word is one of the means
                   that God has ordained for diffusing light; but we must bring
                   every man's teaching to the test of Scripture. Whoever will
                   prayerfully study the Bible, desiring to know the truth, that he
                   may obey it, will receive divine enlightenment. He will under-
                   stand the Scriptures. 'If any man willeth to do His will, he shall
                   know of the teaching.' John 7:17, R.V."—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 459.
                      There is a sobering thought in the realization that the Jews of
                   Christ's day were the chosen people of God, yet in large mea-
                   sure they failed to recognize the identity of the true Messiah
                   when He came to them. Thus it behooves every one of us to ask
                   earnestly, Am I absorbing the prejudices of others? Am I permit-
                   ting others to determine what I shall believe? Am I permitting
                   others to dictate to me what is truth? Am I permitting others to
                   share with me their pride and their prejudice while the Saviour
                   stands waiting at the heart's door, knocking, waiting, and
                   knocking. If we keep Him outside the heart's door, can He bring
                   repentance and confession to us as means of receiving His
                   forgiveness and cleansing from sin?

We Trust Him       LESSON 5                                       ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      April 26
          Part 4     What is Christ's origin and position?
      MAN FROM
         ABOVE       "He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
                   earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh
                   from heaven is above all" (John 3:31).

                     These noble words spoken by the forerunner of Christ, John
                   the Baptist, are a measure of the faith of John in Christ's divine
                   origin. It was a measure also of John's complete self-
                   abnegation—his willingness to direct attention and honor to
                   another. The multitudes had flocked out to the wilderness to
                   hear him; now John directed them to One whose sandal he felt
                   unworthy to loose.

                     What characteristics of John the Baptist enabled him to
                   recognize Christ as the Messiah? (See John 3:25-30.)

                       "Looking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the
                   height of self-abnegation. He sought not to attract men to him-
                   self, but to lift their thoughts higher and still higher, until they
                   should rest upon the Lamb of God. He himself had been only a
                   voice, a cry in the wilderness. Now with joy he accepted silence
                   and obscurity, that the eyes of all might be turned to the Light of
                   I ife."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 333.
                       "We can receive of heaven's light only as we are willing to be
                   emptied of self. We cannot discern the character of God, or
                   accept Christ by faith, unless we consent to the bringing into
                   captivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. To all who
                   do this the Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ 'dwell-
                   eth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and in Him ye are
                   made full.' Col. 2:9, 10, R.V."—The Desire of Ages, p. 181.

THINK IT THROUGH     What lessons can I learn from the attitudes of John the
                   Baptist?

                     "John had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to
                   humanity, but the touch of divine love had transformed him. He
                   dwelt in an atmosphere uncontaminated with selfishness and
                   ambition, and far above the miasma of jealousy. He manifested
                   no sympathy with the dissatisfaction of his disciples, but
                   showed how clearly he understood his relation to the Messiah,
                   and how gladly he welcomed the One for whom he had pre-
                   pared the way."—The Desire of Ages, p. 179.
                     The penitent believer's trust in Jesus thrives on humility and
                   self-abnegation—the spirit of Him who said, "lam among you as
                   he that serveth" (Luke 22:27).

We Trust Him     LESSON 5                                            ❑ Thursday
                                                                        April 27
          Part 5   What is the essential basis upon which all faith in Jesus
       YOU MAY Christ depends?
        BELIEVE
                   "And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
                 disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are
                 written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
                 of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
                 name" (John 20:30, 31).

                    We may wish to assert it again and again in our studies this
                 quarter. Our faith in Jesus Christ is anchored in the inspired
                 Word of God, and most specifically in the records of the Gospels
                 which tell us who He was, what He was, and how and why He
                 was our Redeemer.
                    Some critics accuse Christians of bibliolatry, as opposed to
                 idolatry. They say that, while we renounce idol worship in all
                 forms, we actually worship the Bible, that we idolize this book,
                 that we give it a reverence and a deference and a confidence
                 which no book merits. On the other hand, about 300 years ago
                 rationalistic scholars, in the period known as the enlighten-
                 ment, determined that the Bible was only a piece of literature
                 like any other book and should be tested and evaluated and
                 criticized on the same basis as any other ancient book. But
                 neither viewpoint is that of the apostle John. He wrote to provide
                 a basis for our faith in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God. Those
                 who approach the study of John's Gospel and the other inspired
                 books with this expectation find food for their soul and the
                 ground for their faith. Tasting and seeing, they find that the Lord
                 indeed is good, and that He fulfills all His promises.

                   What parallel is there between Christ's miracles of physical
                 healing and His work of healing sin-sick souls?

                    In the healing of the man sick with palsy, Jesus plainly stated,
                 "That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
                 forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up
                 thy bed, and go unto thine house" (Matt. 9:6).
                    "From the simple Bible account of how Jesus healed the sick,
                 we may learn something about how to believe in Him for the
                 forgiveness of sins."—Steps to Christ, p. 50.
                    It is our privilege similarly to receive spiritual cleansing. If we
                 will believe Christ's promise, confess our sins, give ourselves to
                 God, place our will on His side, then God can do for us what He
                 has promised. He will forgive and He will cleanse.
                    "Do not wait to feel that you are made whole, but say, 'I believe
                 it; it is so, not because I feel it, but because God has
                 promised.' "—Steps to Christ, p. 51.

We Trust Him       LESSON 5                                               ❑ Friday
                                                                           April 28
         Part 6   When I pray for cleansing, grace, and power, how may I be
      WHEN YOU assured that I have received them?
         PRAY
                  "What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that
                ye receive them, and ye shall have them" (Mark 11:24).

                      Some turn away from taking this precious promise at its face
                   value because they say all God's promises are conditioned by
                   His will. In other words, if I should happen to not pray according
                   to God's will, then I cannot claim His promises, I cannot believe
                   in them implicitly or make them my own. This type of precaution
                   may be very much in order when we are praying for blessings on
                   the value of which we are not entirely clear—such things as
                   health, wealth, and long life. But the things of which we are
                   speaking in this lesson and throughout the lessons of this quar-
                   ter are unquestionably in harmony with His will.
                      "It is the will of God to cleanse us from sin, to make us His
                   children, and to enable us to live a holy life. So we may ask for
                   these blessings, and believe that we receive them, and thank
                   God that we have received them. It is our privilege to go to Jesus
                   and be cleansed, and to stand before the law without shame or
                   remorse. 'There is therefore now no condemnation to them
                   which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after
                   the Spirit.' Romans 8:1."—Steps to Christ, p. 51.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why am I so prone to forget what once I knew and believed
                   regarding the promises of God?

                      It is human nature to forget. It is interesting to see from a Bible
                   concordance how often the word "remember" appears, and the
                   word "forget."
                      We need a continuing growth in grace that parallels our first
                   experience in Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul counsels "As ye
                   have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
                   him" (Col. 2:6).
                      "Now that you have given yourself to Jesus, do not draw back,
                   do not take yourself away from Him, but day by day say, 'I am
                   Christ's; I have given myself to Him;' and ask Him to give you His
                   Spirit and keep you by His grace. As it is by giving yourself to
                   God, and believing Him, that you become His child, so you are to
                   live in Him. . . .
                      "Some seem to feel that they must be on probation, and must
                   prove to the. Lord that they'are reformed, before they can claim
                   His blessing. But they may claim the blessing of God even now.
                   They must have His grace, the Spirit of Christ, to help their
                   infirmities, or they cannot resist evil. Jesus loves to have us
                   come to Him just as we are,. sinful, helpless, dependent."—

           Part 1     Does a sinner control his own life?
       SERVANTS
          OF SIN     "Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
                    Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin" (John 8:34).

                      The setting in which Jesus spoke these words was a conver-
                    sation with some Jews who had come to believe on Him. He
                    indicated that if they would continue in His word, then they
                    would be His disciples and they would come to know the truth
                    and the truth would make them free. This tended to rouse their
                    national and racial feelings. They insisted that, as the descend-
                    ants of Abraham, they were never in bondage to anybody. How
                    could He say to them, You will be made free? Jesus' answer was
                    our text for today. It implied that, regardless of ancestry or
                    family tree, if a man sins, he is the slave, the servant of sin, and is
                    not free.

                      How can a man who is in slavery to sin become free?
                    Verse 36.


                      Perhaps the freest man in all the New Testament, other than
                    Christ, was the man who repeatedly presented himself as the
                    bond-servant or slave of Jesus Christ—the apostle Paul. It was
                    he who understood so clearly the nature of freedom and bond-
                    age.

THINK IT THROUGH      Whose servant or slave am I?

                       "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
                    obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto
                    death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
                       "For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
                    righteousness."
                       "But now being made free from sin, and become servants to
                    God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
                    life" (Rom. 6:16, 20, 22).
                       "If we indulge anger, lust, covetousness, hatred, selfishness,
                    or any other sin, we become servants of sin. 'No man can serve
                    two masters.' If we serve sin, we cannot serve Christ. The Chris-
                    tian will feel the promptings of sin, for the flesh lusteth against
                    the Spirit; but the Spirit striveth against the flesh, keeping up a
                    constant warfare. Here is where Christ's help is needed. Human
                    weakness becomes united to divine strength, and faith
                    exclaims, 'Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory
                    through our Lord Jesus Christ!' "—Messages to Young People,

We Yield to Him        LESSON 6                                         ❑ Monday
                                                                               May 1
           Part 2 . How vital an issue is it whether or not we believe on the Lord
       "YE SHALL Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the world?
            DIE"
                      "I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if
                    ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins" (John
                    8:24).

                       It would be difficult to find any time or place in human history
                    when Christ was more forthright, more specific, and more ob-
                    jective with men than on this occasion. As we have said before,
                    this matter of believing that Christ was who He claimed to be,
                    was and is a matter of life and death. This is a reiteration of the
                    truth spoken earlier in John 3:16-18, to the effect that whoever
                    believes not is already condemned. This results from not believ-
                    ing on Him who alone can deliver from the sentence which
                    Heaven pronounces against sin and sinners.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the only effective means of deliverance from
                     bondage and from the death which is the wages of sin?

                       "In the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No exter-
                    nal force is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of God,
                    man is left free to choose whom he will serve. In the change that
                    takes place when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is the
                    highest sense of freedom. The expulsion of sin is the act of the
                    soul itself. True, we have no power to free ourselves from Sa-
                    tan's control; but when we desire to be set free from sin, and in
                    our great need cry out for a power out of and above ourselves,
                    the powers of the soul are imbued with the divine energy of the
                    Holy Spirit, and they obey the dictates of the will in fulfilling the
                    will of God.
                       "The only condition upon which the freedom of man is possi-
                    ble is that of becoming one with Christ. 'The truth shall make
                    you free;' and Christ is the truth. Sin can triumph only by en-
                    feebling the mind, and destroying the liberty of the soul. Subjec-
                    tion to God is restoration to one's self,—to the true glory and
                    dignity of man. The divine law, to which we are brought into
                    subjection, is 'the law of liberty.' James 2:12."—The Desire of
                    Ages, p. 466.
                       It is difficult for students in many parts of the world today to
                    imagine what it meant to be an open follower of Jesus Christ
                    when He was here. Those who have been disowned, consigned
                    to a mental home, or divorced because they have accepted
                    Christ can have some idea. Yet Jesus placed a terrible dilemma
                    before men when He plainly stated that rejection of Him was the
                    same as choosing to die in one's sins. It may not be long before
                    belief is going to involve deep commitment everywhere.

                                                                                May 2
              Part 3     What connection is there between a man's willingness to
         "HE SHALL     obey God and his capacity for knowing truth?
            KNOW"
                        "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
                       whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself" (John 7:17).

                          This text is very much in the center of our subject and concern
                       because understanding of truth comes to those willing to sub-
                       mit to Him who is the truth. Jesus actually indicated that those
                       who were willing to do His will and His 'Father's will would know
                       whether His teaching was of God or merely from a man. This
                       clearly suggests that there would be a harmony between the
                       individual soul and Heaven, and that there would be an en-
                       lightening of the mind and the development of a blessed assur-
                       ance as to what is truth.
                          "In order to do the will of God, we must search His word, that
                       we may know His doctrine, and put to the task all our entrusted
                       ability. We must be diligent in prayer, and fervent in simple,
                       wholehearted service to God. Those who are engaged as
                       teachers in the Sabbath school should hunger and thirst for
                       divine truth, that they may impart this Spirit to those under their
                       care, and lead their pupils to seek for truth as for hidden
                       treasure."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 73.

THINK IT THROUGH         How can I distinguish between those who speak for God and
                       those who speak from their own human wisdom only?
                          "Man's advantages for obtaining a knowledge of the truth,
                       however great these may be, will prove of no benefit to him
                       unless the heart is open to receive the truth, and there is a
                       conscientious surrender of every habit and practice that is op-
                       posed to its principles. To those who thus yield themselves to
                       God, having an honest desire to know and to do His will, the
                       truth is revealed as the power of God for their salvation. These
                       will be able to distinguish between him who speaks for God, and
                       him who speaks merely from himself."—The Desire of Ages, pp.
                       455, 456.
                          It would seem self evident that there would be a very close
                       relationship between knowing that Christ was speaking from
                       God and for God and believing in Him. It would seem illogical
                       and unnatural to make a commitment of one's self to a person in
                       whom he did not believe, in whom he could not have confi-
                       dence, in whose word he could not trust. It seems therefore that
                       there is indeed a very close correlation between this text in John
                       7:17 and the primary concern of this lesson—namely, that we
                       submit to, commit to, wish to remain steadfast to, and have
                       confidence in, Him who we believe speaks for God. And this
                       belief, indeed this knowledge, this assurance, will come "if any
                       man will do his will."

We Yield to Him       LESSON 6                                      111 Wednesday
                                                                           May 3
           Part 4      We have already seen that there are different qualities to
       "THEY DID    "believing." We have been reminded that the devils believe and
   NOT CONFESS"     tremble. In the text before us today we have a most interesting
                    situation in which men believe in Christ at the same time that
                    they are unwilling to "confess Him."

                      What kind of belief is it that will not permit the believer to
                    confess what is believed?

                      "Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed
                    on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
                    him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they
                    loved the praise of men more than the praise of God" (John
                    12:42, 43).

                      Here is a clear contextual evidence that the word "belief" can
                    have various shades of meaning. Perhaps we would not be
                    ready to put these "chief rulers" in the same category with the
                    devils who believe and tremble, but can we put them in the
                    category of true believers? Did they really believe that, Jesus.
                    Christ was who He claimed to be? What price were these men
                    willing to pay for their belief that He was the true Messiah? What
                    degree of commitment of themselves were they ready to make
                    to Him? How far would they let Him redirect their lives, trans-
                    form their entire life-style, reshape their interests and priorities?
                    These are pertinent questions, not merely for the men of whom
                    we have just read, but they are pertinent questions for us today.
                      What quality of faith or belief in Christ do we have? It is not
                    without reason that we hear that the measure of a man's faith is
                    the price he is willing to pay to be true to his faith, or, conversely,
                    the price at which he will sell out his faith.

THINK IT THROUGH      Could I possibly have an intellectual belief in Christ which
                    would not support a willingness to submit and commit all of my
                    wayslo His direction and will? What will be the results of a
                    correct faith in Jesus?

                      "To save themselves from reproach and shame, they [the
                    chief rulers] denied Christ, and rejected the offer of eternal life.
                    And how many through all the centuries since have been doing
                    the same thing! To them all the Saviour's warning words apply:
                    'He that loveth his life shall lose it.' He that rejecteth Me,' said
                    Jesus, 'and receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth him:
                    the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last
                    day.' John 12:48."—The Desire of Ages, p. 626.

                                                                         May 4
          Part 5      The entire ninth chapter of John's Gospel is taken up with the
 "HE WORSHIPPED    inspired account of the healing of the man born blind. It would
           HIM"    be well to read the account again in order to sense the signifi-
                   cance of the text upon which we shall concentrate today.
                      You will recall that Jesus restored sight to this man on the
                   Sabbath day, and this gave the Pharisees the occasion to chal-
                   lenge the authenticity of the miracle and the claims of Christ as
                   to who He was. In the process, they tried to draw the parents of
                   the man born blind into the contest in the hopes of countering
                   and even denying the miracle of healing which had taken place.
                     In a remarkable way the healed man outshone his parents,
                   whose fears silenced any convictions they might have had re-
                   garding the fact of the miracle or who performed it. The man
                   himself courageously and effectively met the reasoning of his
                   accusers and confronted them with some Spirit-directed argu-
                   ments which they could not adequately answer. At least they
                   would not. In stubborn unbelief the Pharisees and rulers cast
                   this man out of the synagogue.

                     How did Christ provide the healed man an opportunity to
                   reveal the quality of his faith?

                     "Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had
                   found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of
                   God? He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might
                   believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen
                   him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I
                   believe. And he worshipped him" (John 9:35-38).

                     Here is a man whose faith involved commitment and a sub-
                   mission of his own will.to the will of God, even if it cost him his
                   place in the synagogue. (Remember that being cast out of the
                   synagogue was equivalent to excommunication with dread
                   consequences for the individual and his family.)
                     "Already, at great cost to himself, he had acknowledged Him
                   as a delegate of divine power; now a higher revelation was
                   granted him."—The Desire of Ages, p. 474.
                     When Christ revealed Himself to the blind man as the One
                   Sent by God, the man whose natural sight had been restored
                   had also the eyes of his understanding open and he received
                   Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH     What price have I paid for my belief in Christ?

                      In his full recognition of the identity of Jesus Christ, the
                   healed blind man worshiped Him. There may very well be an
                   illustration here of the close correlation between worship, faith,
                   commitment, submission, and obedience.

We Yield to Him      LESSON 6                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                          May 5
          Part 6   What contrast does the Gospel of John provide between the
         "MANY convincing power of miracles and the convincing power of
        BELIEVED fulfilled prophecy?
        ON HIM"
                   "And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no mira-
                 cle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. And
                 many believed on him there" (John 10:41, 42).
                      These words are the witness borne to John the Baptist after
                   his death by those who had heard what he had to say about
                   Jesus. They noted that while John did no miracle unlike Elijah or
                   Moses before him, all that he said about Christ had proved true,
                   with the result that many at this time and place believed on
                   Christ.
                      In this time of interest in charismatics, when so many are
                   pointing to apparent miracles as proof of truth, it is well to
                   remember this testimony concerning John the Baptist. If our
                   faith in Jesus Christ is dependent upon miracles, we may find
                   miracles coming from strange sources that will lead us to be-
                   lieve that which is contrary to the Inspired Word of God. It
                   should not be the miracles that lead to the acceptance of the
                   Word, but the acceptance of the Word should bethe test of what
                   is and what is not truly a miracle.

THINK IT THROUGH     Upon what is my confidence in the Lord based? Is it some-
                   thing which could be readily counterfeited? (Read 2 Peter
                   1:19.)
                     We recall the setting for this statement of the apostle Peter.
                   He has been describing the experience shared with Christ on
                   the mount of transfiguration when he saw a miniature of the
                   coming kingdom of glory. There was no question in Peter's
                   mind as to the reality of his experience, the voice which he
                   heard, the light which shone round about them, the illumination
                   of the Saviour. But certain as Peter was of this reality—a
                   miraculous experience indeed—he pointed to the prophetic
                   word as something more sure, more certain, more reliable, even
                   than the phenomenal experience on the transfiguration moun-
                   taintop.
                     This is perhaps one of the most significant commentaries
                   upon the quality of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. In the days
                   when spiritism under many guises will perform undoubted
                   miracles, in what shall we put our trust? Whose testimony shall
                   we receive? To avoid deception we need the qualities of faith
                   about which we have been studying in this week's lesson—
                   submission, commitment, willingness to do God's will, willing-
                   ness to make our commitment known, and a leaning upon the
                   Word of inspiration as opposed to the performance of miracles.
                   With such a faith, many others will come to receive our tes-
                   timony.

                                                                           May 7
              Part 1   What truth about forgiveness is taught by the ceremonial
          "WITHOUT law?
          SHEDDING
         OF BLOOD"     "And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
                     without shedding of blood is no remission" (Heb. 9:22).

                        There is a principle recalled by every sacrifice from the very
                     gates of the Garden of Eden until the moment when Christ
                     became the Lamb of God slain for the sins of the world. That
                     principle is that forgiveness of sins requires death. We add "of
                     sins" because that is the entire function of the sacrificial sys-
                     tem. Forgiveness and remission are virtually identical in the
                     original. The antitype of the sacrifices is the ground or basis for
                     our forgiveness..Jesus Christ on Calvary's cross shed His blood
                     in the act of becoming our. Sin Bearer.

                       Where was the decision for our redemption sealed? Luke
                     22:41, 42.

                        "Christ [in Gethsemane] was now standing in a different at-
                     titude from that in which He had ever stood before. His suffering
                     can best be described in the words of the prophet, 'Awake, 0
                     sword, against My shepherd, and against the man that is My
                     fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.' Zech. 13:7. As the substitute and
                     surety for sinful man, Christ was suffering under divine justice.
                     He saw what justice meant. Hitherto He had been as an interces-
                     sor for others; now He longed to have an intercessor for
                     Himself."—The Desire of Ages, p. 686.
                        This is the struggle that brought the blood sweat and broke
                     the heart of the Saviour. This was the price paid for our forgive-
                     ness. How can we question His love or His willingness to forgive
                     when He paid such a price to make it possible?

THINK IT THROUGH        Have I accepted Gethsemane and Calvary as mine?

                        "Jesus loves to have us come to Him just as we are, sinful,
                     helpless, dependent. We may come with all our weakness, our
                     folly, our sinfulness, and fall at His feet in penitence. It is His
                     glory to encircle us in the arms of His love and to bind up our
                     wounds, to cleanse us from all impurity.         •
                        "Here is where thousands fail; they do not believe that Jesus
                     pardons them personally, individually. They do not take God at
                     His word. It is the privilege of all who comply with the conditions
                     to know for themselves that pardon is freely extended for every
                     sin. Put away the suspicion that God's promises are not meant
                     for you. They are for every repentant transgressor. Strength and

                                                                         May 8
         ' Part 2  ' Since Christ has shed His blood for the forgiveness of our
         "AS WE sins, is there anything we need to do about it?
       FORGIVE"
                     "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (Matt.
                  6:12).

                      From childhood most of us have prayed the Lord's Prayer,
                   including this particular petition. Have we really thought about
                   its significance? If God truly forgives us only to the degree that
                   we forgive others their trespasses against us, how is it with us?
                   As we come to offer our gifts of penitence and prayer, asking
                   forgiveness, do we need to go and be reconciled to a brother
                   somewhere before we can come and offer our gifts?
                      After He had given what we speak of as the Lord's Prayer,
                   Jesus went on to repeat, "For if ye forgive men their trespasses,
                   your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not
                   men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your tres-
                   passes" (verses 14, 15).
                      It may lead us to wonder whether Jesus felt that this was the
                   most difficult part of the Lord's Prayer for us to enter into—the
                   conditions on which forgiveness would be granted to us.
THINK IT THROUGH     What other conditions are there to receiving God's forgive-
                   ness of our sins, apart from a willingness to forgive others?
                   (See 1 Tim. 5:24, 25; Rev. 20:12, 13.)

                     "Some men's sins are open beforehand, confessed in peni-
                   tence, and forsaken, and they go beforehand to judgment. Par-
                   don is written over against the names of theie men. But other
                   men's sins follow after, and they are not put away by repentance
                   and confession, and these sins will stand registered against
                   them in the books of heaven."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 916.

                     Is there a limit to the frequency with which forgiveness
                   should be granted? Matt. 18:21, 22. (See Luke 17:3, 4.)

                      "He who harbors within himself the idea that at some future
                   time he will not forgive, is far from extending true forgiveness
                   even though he may go through the form of forgiving. If the
                   spirit of forgiveness actuates the heart, a person will be as ready
                   to forgive a repentant soul the eighth time as thefirst time, or the
                   491st time as the eighth. True forgiveness is not limited by
                   numbers; furthermore, it is not the act that counts, but the spirit
                   that prompts the act. 'Nothing can justify an unforgiving spirit'
                   (COL 251)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 449.

We Are Forgiven Through Him                LESSON 7                      ❑ Tuesday
                                                                             May 9
             Part 3    What vivid example does the New Testament offer us of
       "POWER . . . Christ's clear recognition of His own right to forgive sins?
        TO FORGIVE
             SINS"     "But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on
                     earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,)
                     Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house" (Matt. 9:6).

                         The Desire of Ages gives us a number of significant points on
                      this healing of the paralytic. (1) His disease was the result of a
                      life of sin. (2) Remorse had embittered his sufferings. (3) He had
                      been renounced by Pharisees and doctors. (4) He had fallen into
                      utter despair until he heard of the works of Jesus. (5) The reports
                      of the healings of others as sinful as himself encouraged his
                      faith. (6) He feared the purity of the Christ-physician. (7) He
                      yearned for relief from the burden of sin even more than for
                      physical restoration. (8) His condition was critical and there was
                      no time to lose. (9) It was the paralytic's own suggestion that
                      they enter Peter's crowded house through the flat roof. (10)
                      Christ had convicted the conscience of the paralytic while he
                      was yet at home. (11) Christ had watched the man's faith grow
                      as he conquered each obstacle to come to the Lord.
                         This background explains Christ's immediate word, "Son, be
                      of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee" (Matt. 9:2). Note that
                      the paralytic makes no further request. Christ reads the hearts
                      of the Pharisees present as He challenges which would be
                      greater, to forgive sins or to cause the man to walk. Without
                      awaiting their decision, He gives the command to the paralytic
                      after a clear indication that He will now demonstrate "that the
                      Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins."
                         To the paralytic He says, "Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto
                      thine house." The Gospels record the glorious results.

THINK IT THROUGH        Can you turn away from such a Saviour?

                        "Oh, wondrous love of Christ, stooping to heal the guilty and
                      the afflicted! Divinity sorrowing over and soothing the ills of
                      suffering humanity! Oh, marvelous power thus displayed to the
                      children of men! Who can doubt the message of salvation? Who

                      Desire of Ages, p. 269.

                        How did the healing of the paralytic demonstrate Christ's
                      right and power to forgive sins?

                        "He who at the creation 'spake, and it was,' who 'com-
                     manded, and it stood fast,' (Ps. 33:9), had spoken life to the soul
                     dead in trespasses and sins. The healing of the body was an

We Are Forgiven Through Him              LESSON 7                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        May 10
          Part 4     What is the basis for a man's peace with God?
    "PEACE WITH
          GOD"       "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
                   through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5:1).

                      We may question in our minds what connection justification
                   may have with forgiveness. We may agree that being justified by
                   faith produces peace with God but may claim that we do not see
                   the relationship to forgiveness, which is the topic for this week's
                   lesson. But if we will look back into the closing verses of Ro-
                   mans 4, we will see the very close relationship. Speaking of
                   Abraham's faith and how it was counted to him for righteous-
                   ness, the apostle continues, "Now it was not written for his sake
                   alone, that it was imputed to him: but for us also, to whom it
                   shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our
                   Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and
                   was raised again for our justification" (Rom. 4:23-25).
                      Clearly it is for our sins or offenses that Christ was delivered to
                   the death of the cross, as we studied earlier in this week's
                   lesson, and it was the acceptance by the Father of Christ's
                   perfect sacrifice for our offenses that entitled Jesus to exercise
                   His own power in rising from the dead so that He might count to
                   us His righteousness and impart to us His life-giving power. And
                   it is the life, death, and resurrection of our Lord that affords us
                   peace with God through our justification. We have peace with
                   God because we are counted righteous in Jesus Christ and,
                   being counted righteous, we are treated by the Father as if we
                   had never sinned. (See Steps to Christ, "The Test of Disciple-
                   ship," p. 62.)

THINK IT THROUGH     How closely are pardon and justification identified one with
                   the other?

                      "Pardon and justification are one and the same thing.
                   Through faith, the believer passes from the position of a rebel, a
                   child of sin and Satan, to the position of a loyal subject of Christ
                   Jesus, not because of an inherent goodness, but because Christ
                   receives him as His child by adoption. The sinner receives the

                   saying: 'This is My child. I reprieve him from the condemnation
                   of death, giving him My life insurance policy—eternal life—
                   because I have taken his place and have suffered for his sins. He

                                                                          May 11

       "NEITHER DO Him, how does Christ reveal the character of God?

                    and sin no more" (John 8:11).

                       We may hardly need to sketch the experience which gave rise
                     to these words. Let us, however, just remind ourselves of a
                     woman supposedly taken in the act of adultery and being
                     brought before Christ for His judgment. In the process, Christ is
                     reminded of what Moses said should happen to such a woman;
                     therefore He is seemingly placed in the dilemma either of agree-
                     ing with Moses and seeing this woman stoned or of openly
                     rebelling against the teachings of the Old Testament. There was
                     the additional problem that if He declared the woman worthy of
                     death, he could be accused to the Romans as one who was
                     assuming their prerogatives.
                       We remember what Jesus did in writing in the dust the sins of
                     the accusers of the woman, those who themselves had led the
                     woman into sin. They see their own guilty secrets traced in the
                     dust, and they slink away one by one.
                       Finally left with the woman, her accusers gone, Christ asked
                     her, "Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man
                     condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto
                     her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John
                     8:10, 11). This is God speaking to a pathetic and pitiful sinner.
                       "Jesus knows the circumstances of every soul. The greater
                     the sinner's guilt, the more he needs the Saviour. His heart of
                     divine love and sympathy is drawn out most of all for the one
                     who is the most hopelessly entangled in the snares of the
                     enemy. With His own blood He has signed the emancipation

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the attitude of God toward the guilty secrets of our
                     own hearts?

                       "Men hate the sinner, while they love the sin. Christ hates the
                     sin, but loves the sinner. This will be the spirit of all who follow

We Are Forgiven Through Him              LESSON 7                          ❑ Friday
                                                                            May 12
           Part 6  In the plan and character of God, what is the relationship
        THE KISS between righteousness and peace?
        OF PEACE
                   "Steadfast love and faithfulness will meet;
                     righteousness and peace will kiss each other"
                                               Psalm 85:10, RSV.


                     In the character, government, and plan of salvation of our
                   Lord, righteousness and peace are in perfect harmony. To put
                   the matter less poetically than does the psalmist: There is no
                   conflict between law and grace, between obedience and love,
                   between repentance and faith.
                     The peace which passeth all understanding comes because
                   God has made provision for Christ's righteousness to stand in
                   place of our sinfulness, and indeed, in place of our righteous-
                   ness.

THINK IT THROUGH    Why does Christ say to forgiven sinners, Go and sin no
                   more?

                      The plan of salvation is not a device for excusing sin that we
                   may continue therein. The plan of salvation is God's plan for
                   destroying sin, ultimately forever.
                      "The law requires righteousness,—a righteous life, a perfect
                   character; and this man has not to give. He cannot meet the
                   claims of God's holy law. But Christ, coming tothe earth as man,
                   lived a holy life, and developed a perfect character. These He
                   offers as a free gift to all who will receive them. His life stands for
                   the life of men. Thus they have remission of sins that are past,
                   through the forbearance of God. More than this Christ embues
                   men with the attributes of God. He builds up the human charac-
                   ter after the similitude of the divine character, a goodly fabric of
                   spiritual strength and beauty. Thus the very righteousness of
                   the law is fulfilled in the believer in Christ. God can 'be just, and
                   the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.' Rom. 3:26."—The
                   Desire of Ages, p. 762.

                     What has been Satan's plan from the beginning?

                        "God's love has been expressed in His justice no less than in
                     His mercy. Justice is the foundation of His throne, and the fruit
                     of His love. It had been Satan's purpose to divorce mercy from
                   - truth and justice. He sought to prove that the righteousness of

                     God's law is an enemy to peace. But Christ shows that in God's
                     plan they are indissolubly joined together; the one cannot exist
                     without the other. 'Mercy and truth are met together; righteous-
                     ness and peace have kissed each other.' Ps. 85:10."—The De-

          Part 1  Just how essential is it to salvation that a person be born
       "EXCEPT" again?

                     "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
                   thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
                   of God" (John 3:3).
                     Nicodemus was not accustomed to having his needs pointed
                   out by anyone. But there was reason for him to be shocked out
                   of his complacency and self-righteousness by this bold and
                   deeply personal assertion: You, Nicodemus, you must be born
                   again.

                     What symbol did the Lord use in Old Testament times to
                   communicate the idea of a person's changing from a life of sin
                   to one of righteousness? Eze. 36:25, 26.
                     Note that it is the work of God to give a heart of flesh; and that
                   the direction of the new birth is from above. It is in no way an
                   improving of or modifying of the old life to make it better. It is to
                   be "born over again" (NEB).

THINK IT THROUGH     What does it really mean to be born again?
                      "Satan leads people to think that because they have felt a
                   rapture of feeling, they are converted. But their experience does
                   not change. Their actions are the same as before. Their lives
                   show no good fruit. They pray often and long, and are con-
                   stantly referring to the feelings they had at such and such a time.
                   But they do not live the new life. They are deceived. Their
                   experience goes no deeper than feeling. They build upon the
                   sand, and when adverse winds come, their house is swept
                   away."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 4, p. 1164.
                      Perhaps someone is objecting that we have switched from the
                   topic of the new birth to that of conversion. It is not a switch in
                   topics, because the inspired counsel uses "new birth" and
                   "conversion" to refer to the same experience.
                      "The youth especially stumble over the phrase, 'a new heart.'
                   They do not know what it means. They look for a special change
                   to take place in their feelings. This they term conversion. Over
                   this error thousands have stumbled to ruin, not understanding
                   the expression, 'Ye must be born again.' . . .
                      "When Jesus speaks of the new heart, he means the mind, the
                   life, the whole being. To have a change of heart is to withdraw
                   the affections from the world, and fasten them upon Christ. To
                   have a new heart is to have a new mind, new purposes, new
                   motives. What is the sign of a new heart?—a changed life. There

        SPIRIT"
                  "Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
                man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
                kingdom of God" (John 3:5).

                     "Nicodemus knew that Christ here referred to water baptism
                   and the renewing of the heart by the Spirit of God. He was
                   convinced that he was in the presence of the One whom John
                   the Baptist had foretold."—The Desire of Ages, p. 172.
                     Nicodemus was acquainted with the preaching of John the
                   Baptist on the subjects of repentance and baptism. He had
                   heard the prediction of One who should come to baptize with
                   the Holy Spirit. He had felt that there was a great spiritual need
                   among his own people, but he had not yet come to see that he, a
                   leader in Israel, could have any such spiritual need.
                     "Nicodemus anticipated admission into the kingdom of God
                   as a natural-born, devout Jew, but Jesus declared that anything
                   less than a complete transformation of the life by the power of
                   the Holy Spirit was inadequate.. .
                     "To be 'born of water and of the Spirit' is equivalent to being
                   'born again,' that is, 'from above.' ... Those who are born from
                   above have God as their Father and resemble Him in character
                   (see 1 John 3:1-3; cf. John 8:39, 44). Henceforth, they aspire, by
                   the grace of Christ, to live above sin (Rom. 6:12-16) and do not
                   yield their wills to commit sin (1 John 3:9; 5:18)."—SDA Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 5, p. 928.

THINK IT THROUGH      Could I be hiding behind a doctrinal debate my inner convic-
                   tion of my own soul's great need of Christ? (See 2 Peter 1:3,4.)

                      "The old nature, born of blood and the will of the flesh, cannot
                   inherit the kingdom of God. The old ways, the hereditary tend-
                   encies, the former habits, must be given up; for grace is not in-
                   herited. The new birth consists in having new motives, new tastes
                   new tendencies. Those who are begotten unto a new life by the
                   Holy Spirit, have become partakers of the divine nature, and in

                        "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the
                     sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither
                     it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8).

                       Even with our modern, sophisticated methods of meteorolog-
                     ical investigation, we cannot control the wind. We cannot see
                     the wind, but we can see the effects of its work. And in Christ's
                     day, even more than in our own, the point of origin and the point
                     of destination of the wind were beyond human comprehension,
                     let alone control. "So is every one that is born of the Spirit."
                     When the wind blows, there is evidence of its action. We may not
                     be able to see it, measure it, or control it. The evidence is there.
                     The trees bend, the dust flies, the giant windmill turns, creating
                     power. The calm lake is whipped into a frothy fury. There are
                     results. There are changes. These are perceptible. "So is every
                     one that is born of the Spirit." So the little song is true, "Things
                     are different now, something's happened to me since I gave my
                     heart to Jesus."

THINK IT THROUGH      How does the figure of the wind illustrate the work of the
                     Holy Spirit?

                         "The wind is heard among the branches of the trees, rustling
                     the leaves and flowers; yet it is invisible, and no man knows
                     whence it comes or whither it goes. So with the work of the Holy
                     Spirit upon the heart. It can no more be explained than can the
                     movements of the wind....
                         "While the wind itself is invisible, it produces effects that are
                     seen and felt. So the work of the Spirit upon the soul will reveal
                     itself in every act of him who has felt its saving power. When the
                     Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms the life.
                     ... The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders itself
                     to God. Then that power which no human eye can see creates a
                     new being in the image of God.
                        "It is impossible for finite minds to comprehend the work of
                     redemption. Its mystery exceeds human knowledge; yet He who
                     passes from death to life realizes that it is a divine reality. The
                     beginning of redemption we may know here through a personal
                     experience. Its results reach through the eternal ages."—The

We Are Born Again        LESSON 8                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       May 17
          Part 4   After giving Nicodemus some gentle reproof for his ignor-
       LOOK AND ance of basic truths, what more familiar illustration did Christ
           LIVE use to help Nicodemus to understand the plan of salvation?

                      "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
                   so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth
                   in him should not perish, but have eternal life" (John 3:14,15).

                     Nicodemus had been drawn by what he had seen and heard of
                   Christ before he obtained this personal interview with Him.
                   Jesus pierced through his defensiveness and had been very
                   forthright and deeply personal with him. But Nicodemus sensed
                   such love in the Saviour that he took no offense. Christ had even
                   pointed out how little he knew of the things that really mattered
                   for one who held such a position of leadership in Israel.
                     There was a growing longing in the heart of Nicodemus for
                   the experience which Christ was presenting as a new birth. The
                   Lord gave him an illustration that he would readily grasp.
                      "Here was ground with which Nicodemus was familiar. The
                   symbol of the uplifted serpent made plain to him the Saviour's
                   mission. When the people of Israel were dying from the sting of
                   the fiery serpents, God directed Moses to make a serpent of
                   brass, and place it on high in the midst of the congregation.
                   Then the word was sounded throughout the encampment that
                   all who would look upon the serpent should live. The people
                   well knew that in itself the serpent had no power to help them. It
                   was a symbol of Christ. . . . Whether for the healing of their
                   wounds or the pardon of their sins, they could do nothing for
                   themselves but show their faith in the Gift of God. They were to
                   look and live."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 174, 175.

THINK IT THROUGH     Are pride, independence, or demand for scientific or histor-
                   ical justification of Christ's claim depriving me of the look that
                   gives life?

                      "Not through controversy and discussion is the soul en-
                   lightened. We must look and live."—The Desire of Ages, p. 175.
                      As stressed in the introduction to this lesson, not all experi-
                   ences are alike, because not all individuals are alike. But all true
                   conversions have this in common: They result from our faith in
                   what Christ has done for us, and not from one shred of confi-
                   dence in anything that we have done or can do for ourselves. It
                   was unscientific to expect the brass serpent to heal the people.
                   There was no historical precedent for believing in such a thing.
                   But God had made the provision, and God had made the prom-
                    ise; and the only requirement of the dying victims in Israel was
                   that they look and live.

       BELIEVING choice of wrong or rejection of right leads to eternal loss?
             AND
     DELIVERANCE      "He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
                   believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
                   believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this
                   is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men
                   loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
                   evil" (John 3:18, 19).

                     It is a solemn thought that we are in the land of the enemy, that
                   we come into the world with inherited propensities to evil. But.
                   God has given us hope through the death of Jesus for our
                   redemption. Condemnation in .the day of judgment will arise
                   from an unwillingness to accept the means which God has
                   provided. The lost thus show the same type of independenth
                   and determination to go their own way and have their own will
                   as brought sin into the world in the very beginning. Just as those
                   who refused .tolook upon the brass serpent died, so those who
                   refuse to look in faith to Christ will perish.
                      "While the sinner cannot save himself, he still has something
                   to do to secure salvation. 'Him that cometh to Me,' says Christ, 'I
                   will in no wise cast out.' John 6:37. But we must come to Him;
                   and when we repent of our sins, we must believe that He accepts
                   and pardons us. Faith is the gift of God, but the power to
                   exercise it is ours. Faith is the hand by which the soul takes hold
                   upon the divine offers of grace and mercy."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 431.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the origin of my faith, my believing, that brings me
                    deliverance from the sting of the serpent?

                      Inadvertently, it is possible that many are making faith their
                    savior, or the name of Jesus their savior. And some quote Acts
                    4:12 in support of their position: "There is none other name
                    under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
                   -But does that mean that our salvation has been obtained by a
                   name? Has our salvation been obtained by our faith?
                      "Through faith we receive the grace of God; but faith is not
                    our Saviour. It earns nothing. It is the hand by which we lay hold
                    upon Christ, and appropriate His merits, the remedy for sin."—

                   "In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus-stood and
                 cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and
                 drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out
                 of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake he
                 of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for
                 the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not
                 yet glorified.)" (John 7:37-39).

                      It is important to remember -that in His conversation. with
                   Nicodemus Jesus indicated that the new•birth is the work of the
                   Holy Spirit. While Christ has purchased the means of redemp-
                   tion, the application in the individual heart and life of that
                   redemption and redeeming grace is brought by the Holy Spirit.
                   (See John 3:8.)

                     What is the way that old things pass away and all things
                   become new, when a man becomes anew creature in Christ?

                      "Like the wind, which is invisible, yet the effects of which are
                    plainly seen and felt, is the Spirit of God in its work upon the
                    human heart. That regenerating power, which no human eye
                    can see, begets a new life in the soul; it creates a new being in
                    the image of God."—Steps to Christ, p. 57.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do I have to go in search of the Holy Spirit to receive the
                    presence and power of Jesus Christ? Have I received the Holy
                    Spirit? How can I know?

                      Note the words of our text of the day particularly: "But this
                    spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
                    receive." The Holy Spirit is•engaged in drawing us to Christ in
                    the first place. When.we respond in faith and acceptance, when
                    we trust Christ and surrender to Him, the Holy Spirit comes to
                    bring the presence and power of Christ into the heart. Then, as it
                    were, "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water." The
                    power of the Spirit for overcoming sin, and the power of the

                                                                           May 21
           Part 1     Just before He went to the cross, what marvelous assur-
     "MY PEACE"     ance did Christ share with His band of disciples?

                      "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
                    world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
                    neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27).

                       These were among the many precious words which Jesus
                    spoke to His disciples in the last few hours before He went to
                    Gethsemane and the cruel mockery of trials leading to Calvary.
                    It was the time when He promised that He would not leave them
                    orphans, that He would send the Comforter to them, the
                    Paraclete—the One who would be alongside them in the place
                    of Jesus. And with all that He knew was just hours away from
                    Him and them, He could offer them peace—not just the world's
                    peace, but His peace. What is wrong with the world's peace? It is
                    so uncertain, so unpredictable. But Jesus Christ offers peace
                    like a river to my soul—not a shallow, bubbling brook, but a
                    deep-flowing crystal-pure river of the water of life.
                       We know what kind of peace Christ offered to His disciples
                    because He exhibited that peace in His own person. In the midst
                    of the caviling scribes and Pharisees, under false condemna-
                    tion of hired false witnesses, under the threats, epithets, and
                    curses of the mob, He was at peace. The only disturbance of
                    Jesus' peace that we see was when in Gethsemane He became
                    our Sin Bearer. This is why His body swayed as though beaten
                    by a tempest. This is why He clung to the ground as though to
                    hold Himself back from the abyss into which our sins were
                    pressing Him. This is why He sweat as it were great drops of
                    blood. This is why He cried out in anguish for the Father to take
                    away the cup if possible. He made the renewal of the commit-
                    ment and agreement which He and the Father had made before
                    the foundations of the world were laid. He determined to go
                    through with the contract, to complete the mission. An angel
                    sent from heaven strengthened Him, and He came forth from
                    the agony of Gethsemane with peace in His heart and peace in
                    His countenance.

THINK IT THROUGH      What easily troubles my heart? What makes me afraid?
                    Could it be that I have not yet accepted the peace which Christ
                    left for me?

                       "This peace is not the peace that comes through conformity
                    to the world. Christ never purchased peace by compromise with
                    evil. The peace that Christ left His disciples is internal rather
                    than external and was ever to remain with His witnesses
                    through strife and contention."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 84.

We Are At Peace       LESSON 9                                       ❑ Monday
                                                                       May 22
          Part 2  When we by nature are enemies of God, how can we be at
 "HE RECONCILED" peace with Him?

                     "And you, that were some time alienated and enemies in
                   your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled" (Col.
                   1:21).

                      We stressed in the introduction of the lesson that guilt is the
                   greatest destroyer of our inner peace, and that Christ has made
                   provision for us to receive His peace. This the apostle Paul well
                   understood and explained to the church at Colossae. Yet he
                   pointed them to the cross and the blood of the cross by which
                   peace has been made between God and sinful man, because
                   through the blood of the cross it is possible for all things to be
                   reconciled to God through Christ. And we who by nature were
                   alienated and enemies of God by our wicked works and our
                   inherited propensities toward evil—even we can be reconciled
                   "in the body of his flesh through death" so that we might be
                   presented "holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight"
                   (verse 22).
                      That term "reconciled" does not appear a great many times in
                   the Scriptures. In the Old Testament it is mostly used in connec-
                   tion with the sanctuary services whereby the shed blood pro-
                   vides an atonement or a cover (kaphar) so that sinful man can be
                   at peace with a holy and righteous God. In the New Testament it
                   carries most frequently the thought of being - thoroughly
                   changed, and how beautiful a thought that is. Christ has made
                   provision for us to be thoroughly changed so that, whereas we
                   were at enmity with God through sin, we now can be at peace
                   with God and be the friends of God through righteousness—not
                   our own righteousness, but through the righteousness of Jesus
                   Christ in whom we believe. And, strangely and beautifully, the
                   more we contemplate our dependence upon His righteousness,
                   then the more we recognize that we can make no contribution
                   to improve upon that righteousness of His; with the result that
                   our will is surrendered more completely to the indwelling of His
                   Spirit, who creates within us a new man after the likeness of
                   Jesus our Saviour and Redeemer.

THINK IT THROUGH      What grounds do I have for claiming or expecting reconcilia-
                   tion with God?

                      "We have nothing in ourselves of which to boast. We have no
                   ground for self-exaltation. Our only ground of hope is in the
                   righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought by
                   His Spirit working in and through us."—Steps to Christ, p. 63.

                                                                            May 23
           Part 3   What blessed assurance does the apostle Paul offer Gentile
      "HE IS OUR believers to share with Christ's followers in Israel?
         PEACE".
                    "For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath
                  broken down the middle wall of partition between us" (Eph.
                  2:14).

                       "He is our peace. The 'he' is emphatic in the Greek. Christ is
                   not only the peacemaker; He Himself is peace, the bond of
                   union and of peace. In Him all the divisions of mankind are to be
                   abolished. . . .
                      "Middle wall of partition. Literally, 'partition wall of the
                   fence,' meaning, 'the partition wall which is the fence.' The
                   imagery may have been derived from the barrier in the Temple
                   separating the court of the Gentiles from the court of the Jews.
                   . . . Beyond this wall no Gentile dared go."—SDA Bible Com-
                   mentary, vol. 6, p. 1009.
                      Paul had been addressing himself to the Christians at
                   Ephesus, many of whom, if not most, would be of Gentile
                   background. He reminded them that at one time they were
                   "without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
                   and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope,
                   and without God in the world" (verse 12). But now he assures
                   them that in Christ Jesus they who "sometimes were far off are
                   made nigh by the blood of Christ" (verse 13). And, really, that
                   had been God's intention all through the Old Testament era,
                   that those not of Israel should know from Israel and through
                   Israel that the blood of Messiah would be shed for them as well
                   as for Israel.

THINK IT THROUGH     What change in relationship between Jew and Gentile was
                   effected by Christ's death upon the cross?
                      "Through Christ the hidden glory of the holy of holies was to
                   stand revealed. He had suffered death for every man, and by this
                   offering the sons of men were to become the sons of God....
                   The mercy seat, upon which the, glory of God rested in the
                   holiest of all, is opened to all who accept Christ as the propitia-
                   tion for sin, and through its medium, they are brought into
                   fellowship with God. The veil is rent, the partition walls broken
                   down, the handwriting of ordinances canceled. By virtue of His
                   blood the enmity is abolished. Through faith in Christ Jew and
                   Gentile may partake of the living bread."—Ellen G. White Com-
                   ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1109.
                      "Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or
                   creed.... Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He
                   came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as
                   the air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the
                   earth."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 190.

We Are At Peace       LESSON 9                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      May 24
          Part 4    Who takes the initiative in creating peace between man and
    "GOD . . . IN God?
        CHRIST
   RECONCILING"     "To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
                  himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
                  committed unto us the word of reconciliation" (2 Cor. 5:19).

                     One thing for sure is implied by these inspired words of the
                   text today: There is need for a reconciliation. Some have the
                   idea that Christ is shielding us from a God who is angry with His
                   creatures—that Christ has to reconcile His Father to us. In order
                   to know that an enmity had arisen, we have only to go back to
                   the Garden of Eden to see our first parents hiding in the recesses
                   of the Garden from the God who had given them life. Man had
                   sold out his first options to Satan. He was utterly helpless to buy
                   them back. God gave him the first promise that there would
                   come a Man who would be at enmity with the serpent and not in
                   league with him. This Man would conquer the serpent and offer
                   all the sons of men the opportunity to be reconciled to God.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do the words of Second Corinthians 5:20 contradict those of
                   verse 19?

                      No, the expression "be ye reconciled to God" is still an appeal
                   from God to man, and the apostle Paul indicates that he and his
                   fellow laborers are apostles, or ambassadors, who speak for
                   Christ, urging sinners to be reconciled to God. The initiative is
                   with God, the provision is made by God. Let us never forget that
                   it is God in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.
                      The very next verse—verse 21—gives us the ground for this
                   work and act of reconciliation. It provides the justification, the
                   legal rationale, for this to be done. The Revised Standard Ver-
                   sion reads, "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no
                   sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
                      Here in these few words we have the ground upon which it is
                   possible for sinful man to be again at peace with the holy and
                   righteous God. It is a glorious exchange that is offered for which
                   there is no basis other than the eternal love of God.

                     What spirit of prophecy statement closely parallels the pro-
                   found thought of Second Corinthians 5:21?

                     "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as
                   He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had
                   no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in
                   which we had no share. He suffered the death which was ours,
                   that we might receive the life which was His. 'With His stripes we
                   are healed.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 25.

We Are At Peace          LESSON 9                                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                           May 25
                Part 5   What sanctuary office again portrays Christ's key role in
         "MERCIFUL bringing us to be at peace with God?
          . . . HIGH
            PRIEST"      "Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every
                       respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high
                       priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins of
                       the people" (Heb. 2:17, RSV).

                         Think for a moment of the work and service of the high priest
                      in the earthly sanctuary. Think particularly of the fact that his
                      major work in the whole series of sanctuary services fell on the
                      annual Day of Atonement. On that day in a particularly specific
                      and awesome manner he became the direct mediator between
                      the people of Israel and Yahweh. It was his solemn task, after
                      due preparation of himself and his family, to go in before the
                      manifestation of God's glory—the shekinah. There, veiled only
                      by the rising incense from the censer in his hand, he made an
                      atonement, a covering, an expiation, a reconciliation of and for
                      the people and their sins before God.
                         How prayerfully, how earnestly, how penitentially the believ-
                      ing Israelites gathered about the sanctuary. There they awaited
                      the return of the high priest in order to know that the offering
                      had been accepted. Only then would they know that the recon-
                      ciliation of the sins sent in penitence to the sanctuary had been
                      effectual, and that the waiting worshipers were reconciled anew
                      to God. Their sins would then be removed from their place of
                      record before God and His commandments.
                         So Christ, after He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet
                      without sin (Heb. 4:15), after He was tested and tried and
                      afflicted as no other man ever can be, became our High Priest
                      and also our Sacrifice—the Lamb of God—and through His own
                      sacrifice He has made provision to remove from us our sins;
                      and, if the whole world were willing, the sins of the whole world.

THINK IT THROUGH        Do I truly believe and count as mine personally the assur-
                      ance that I am at peace with God?

                        "When we become absorbed in worldly things so that we have
                      no thought for Him in whom our hope of eternal life is centered,
                      we separate ourselves from Jesus and from the heavenly
                      angels. These holy beings cannot remain where the Saviour's
                      presence is not desired, and His absence is not marked. This is
                      why discouragement so often exists among the professed fol-
                      lowers of Christ. . . .
                        "It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in
                      contemplation of the life of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 83.

We Are At Peace       LESSON 9                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                            May 26
              Part 6   Is the peace which Jesus offers one that is free from trou-
             "IN ME ble?
      . . . PEACE"
                       "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might
                     have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of
                     good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).

                     It should be noted that the promises which Jesus offers in this
                   verse today were made to His disciples just before He would be
                   taken by the mob and led from trial to trial. The Lord predicted
                   that every one of His seemingly faithful followers would forsake
                   Him, and He would be left alone. "And yet," said Jesus, "I am not
                   alone, because the Father is with me" (verse 32).
                     No, the peace which Jesus offers is not peace which guaran-
                   tees immunity from trouble. But His peace is one which endures
                   in spite of trouble. In His own trials and agonies He had about
                   Him a peace which impressed the beholders that they were
                   looking upon the Majesty of heaven.

THINK IT THROUGH     Could the peace just described above be the peace of which
                   Paul was speaking in Philippians 4:7?

                     It is interesting again to note that this promise of "the peace of
                   God which passeth all understanding" is assured to those who
                   are anxious for nothing but who "in every thing by prayer and
                   supplication with thanksgiving" make known their requests
                   unto God (verse 6). And these words were spoken by a man who
                   had been through every type of trial and persecution short of the
                   Gethsemane agony of the Lord Jesus Himself.
                      "Christ did not fail, neither was He discouraged; and His
                   followers are to manifest a faith of the same enduring nature.
                   They are to live as He lived, and work as He worked, because
                   they depend on Him as the great Master-worker."—Gospel
                   Workers, p. 39.
                      "In order to be candidates for heaven we must meet the
                   requirement of the law: 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
                   all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and
                   with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself' (Luke 10:27). We
                   can do this only as we grasp by faith the righteousness of Christ.
                   By beholding Jesus we receive a living, expanding principle in
                   the heart, and the Holy Spirit carries on the work, and the
                   believer advances from grace to grace, from strength to
                   strength, from character to character. He conforms to the image
                   of Christ, until in spiritual growth he attains unto the measure of
                   the full stature in Christ Jesus. Thus Christ makes an end of the
                   curse of sin, and sets the believing soul free from its action and
                   effect."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 395.
                      Shalom, shalom.

We Consecrate Ourselves              LESSON 10                           ❑ Sunday
                                                                              May 28

             Part 1      In the preparation of the materials for the building of the
        "WHO . . . IS temple of the Lord, what appeal did David make to the congre-
          WILLING?" gation of Israel?

                        "And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day
                      unto the Lord?" (1 Chron. 29:5).

                         We remember well the desire of King David to build a temple
                      unto the Lord, but he was not permitted this privilege primarily
                      because he had been a man of war. We recall, however, that he
                      desired to do everything possible short of building the temple,
                      and so he gave generously of the riches that were his at the peak
                      of the power of the kingdom of Israel. He accumulated gold,
                      silver, brass, iron, wood, precious stones of varying kinds and
                      colors, and marble in abundance.
                         In the light of his consecration to God's service, David ap-
                      pealed to the princes and to the congregation of Israel also to
                      make a consecration to the Lord.
                         There was great rejoicing as the people brought in their gifts.
                      "Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, be-
                      cause with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and
                      David the king also rejoiced with great joy" (1 Chron. 29:9).
                         The dedication of the people and of their gifts was made with
                      the whole heart. They were not holding back. Their dedication
                      was complete, finished, and whole—a genuine consecreation.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is my personal brand of Christianity the dedication of my
                      whole heart?

                         Ellen G. White wrote of the rich young ruler that he "must
                      accept the conditions of discipleship. He must give himself
                      unreservedly to God. At the Saviour's call, John, Peter,
                      Matthew, and their companions 'left all, rose up, and followed
                      Him.' Luke 5:28. The same consecration was required of the
                      young ruler. And in this Christ did not ask a greater sacrifice
                      than He Himself had made. 'He was rich, yet for your sakes He
                      became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.' 2 Cor.
                      8:9. The young man had only to follow where Christ led the
                      way."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 393.
                         "To the rich no less than to the poor are the words of the Holy
                      Spirit spoken, 'Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a
                      price.' 1 Cor. 6:19, 20. When men believe this, their possessions
                      will be held as a trust, to be used as God shall direct, for the
                      saving of the lost, and the comfort of the suffering and the poor.
                      With man this is impossible, for the heart clings to its earthly
                      treasure.... But with God all things are possible. By beholding
                      the matchless love of Christ, the selfish heart will be melted and
                      subdued."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 394.

We Consecrate Ourselves          LESSON 10                          ❑ Monday
                                                                      May 29
          Part 2     How would Christ's message to the Laodicean church relate
     WHO OPENS     to the question of consecration?
     THE DOOR?
                     "Here I stand knocking at the door; if anyone hears my voice
                   and opens the door, I will come in and sit down to supper with
                   him and he with me" (Rev. 3:20, NEB).

                      Let us never overlook the fact that Christ is standing at the
                   heart door of the people of this church, and He is knocking for
                   admission. In one sense this is not an experience unique to any
                   single individual, or to any particular period of the church's
                   history, or to any one segment of human history.
                      With every believer in Christ there has been the experience of
                   His knocking at the heart's door. At no time has He forced an
                   entrance. At all times He has been the pursuer of the lost rather
                   than the reverse. The Laodicean church in a unique way has this
                   problem of the human heart. Whereas others have kept Christ at
                   the door because of covetousness, riches, lust, or false doc-
                   trine, the Laodiceans keep Him at the door because they do not
                   feel their need of Him. Spiritually speaking they feel rich and
                   increased with goods and in need of nothing. This condition
                   blinds them to their true spiritual state, so that when the
                   heavenly Merchantman offers them the riches of eternity. the
                   spiritual equipment to be ready for His swiftly coming kingdom
                   and the hour of judgment, they feel no need.

THINK IT THROUGH     Can a person maintain his Laodicean condition of heart and
                   still consecrate himself to the Lord?

                     He who persists in maintaining his Laodicean condition will
                   keep the Lord standing at the door of his heart.

                     Do we perhaps weary of hearing the Laodicean message?

                      "Some may say, Why is this message sounded so constantly
                   in our ears? It is because you do not thoroughly repent. You do
                   not live in Christ and have Christ abiding in you. When one idol
                   is expelled from the soul, Satan has another prepared to supply
                   its place. Unless you make an entire consecration to Christ and
                   live in communion with Him, unless you make Him your Coun-

                                                                                May 30
              Part 3     Can one be truly consecrated to God if his love is any less
         KEEP YOUR     than once it was?
         FIRST LOVE
                         "I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love
                       you had at first" (Rev. 2:4, RSV).

                         The following verse clearly answers the question by indicat-
                       ing that those who have abandoned their first love "have fallen"
                       and need to "repent and do the works . . . [they] did at first"
                       (verse 5). It is impossible to have true consecration when there
                       has been a lessening of the love that once we had for our
                       Saviour. This manifested itself in that faith which works by love.

                         How is it in human relationships? Do you love your wife or
                       husband as once you did? Do you love your son or daughter
                       as once you did? Do you love father or mother or brother or
                       sister as once you did?

                           True, there may be a modification of the love, the maturing of
                       it. It may have elements of greater peace and quiet confidence in
                       it than originally. But is it less intense, less wholehearted? Is it
                       subtle to the point of being deceptive? Is it clever?

THINK IT THROUGH         What test might I apply to know whether or not I have lost
                       any measure of my first love for Christ?

                          "The atmosphere of the church is so frigid, its spirit is of such
                       an order, that men and women cannot sustain or endure the
                       example of primitive and heaven-born piety. The warmth of their
                       first love is frozen up, and unless they are watered over by the
                       baptism of the Holy Spirit, their candlestick will be removed out
                       of its place, except they repent and do their first works. The first
                       works of the church were seen when the believers sought out
                       friends, relatives, and acquaintances, and with hearts overflow-
                       ing with love told the story of what Jesus was to them and what
                       they were to Jesus."—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 167, 168.

                         In what way is Solomon's experience an illustration of a loss
                       of first love?

                         "Did Solomon know God when he was doing according to the
                       ways of idolaters?—No; he had forgotten the rich experience of
                       his youth and the prayers he had made in the temple. [Rev. 2:4, 5
                       quoted.]
                         "The candlestick was removed out of its place when Solomon
                       forgot God. He lost the light of God, he lost the wisdom of God,

We Consecrate Ourselves           LESSON 10                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      May 31
            Part 4   What characteristic does John see belonging to those who
   "HE . . . DOES will stand for eternity?
    GOD'S WILL"
                     "And that world is passing away with all its allurements, but
                   he who does God's will stands for evermore" (1 John 2:17,
                   NEB).

                     John has just been urging us not to set our hearts upon the
                   godless world. He has pointed out that anyone who loves the
                   world is a stranger to the Father's love. Everything the world
                   affords—all that panders to the appetites or entices the eyes, all
                   the glamour of its life—springs from the godless world. And that
                   world is passing away. (See verses 15 and 16.)
                      We can only believe that under inspiration and in the experi-
                   ence of revelation, John has foreseen the disintegration of this
                   world and all that belongs to it as the godless world. By contrast
                   he sees those who do God's will standing eternally. We cannot
                   rejoice with the thought that the people of the godless world will
                   be destroyed with it, but we can rejoice that those who do God's
                   will will stand forever.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is there generally a relationship between consecration and
                   obedience?

                      "Moses defines genuine consecration as obedience to God,
                   to stand in vindication of the right and to show a readiness to
                   carry out the purpose of God in the most unpleasant duties,
                   showing that the claims of God are higher than the claims of
                   friends or the lives of the nearest relatives. The sons of Levi
                   consecrated themselves to God to execute His justice against
                   crime and sin."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 301.
                      We may wonder what was the setting for this definition of
                   consecration as obedience to God. It is an inspired commentary
                   upon the occasion when Israel, with Aaron's cooperation, made
                   a golden calf such as they had seen worshiped in Egypt and
                   caused the people to bow down to it and to inflame their senses
                   with rioting and drunkenness. It was on this occasion, as Moses
                   returned from the presence of the Lord, that he took a strong
                   and awful stand in the face of apostasy. (See Exodus 32.)
                      This is a side to consecration that we hear or see little of
                   today. We may console ourselves that we are not living under a
                   theocracy and therefore such stern steps as these cannot be
                   taken. Certainly the fact that the church today is living under
                   many different jurisdictions, different governments, different
                   philosophies of government, differing laws, has a bearing. But it
                   is a solemn question whether the church of Jesus Christ today,
                   through its leadership and ministry, through its institutional
                   directors, is prepared to equate obedience and consecration as
                   was done when Moses came down from the mount.

We Consecrate Ourselves            LESSON 10                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                               June 1
          Part 5     According to the apostle John, what is the relationship of a
          NOT A    consecrated man to the practice of sin?
         SINNER
                     "We know that no child of God is a sinner; it is the Son of God
                   who keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot touch him"
                   (1 John 5:18, NEB).

                      Almost any translation of this text carries the same message.
                   "The true child of God does not sin, he is in the charge of God's
                   own Son and the evil one cannot touch him" (Phillips).
                      There can be no compromise with sin on the part of him who
                   is consecrated to God. Sin and he are in opposite camps. Sin
                   belongs to the camp of the evil one, and righteousness belongs
                   to the camp of Jesus Christ. A man cannot be serving in both
                   camps. This is not to say that he will never falter, never fail, never
                   stumble; but it is clear whose side he is on, which direction he is
                   traveling, and for which cause he is fighting. When he falls, he
                   acknowledges it; he grieves that he has fallen; he confesses his
                   error, and he seeks restoration in the Lord; and he listens even
                   more carefully to his Commander. Sinning is the contradiction
                   of consecration. "No one who abides in him sins; no one who
                   sins has either seen him or known him" (1 John 3:6, RSV).
                      "It is through faith in Jesus Christ that the truth is accepted in
                   the heart and the human agent is purified and cleansed. Jesus
                   was 'wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
                   iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and
                   with his stripes we are healed.' Is it possible to be healed, while
                   knowingly committing sin?—No; it is genuine faith that says, I
                   know that I have committed sin, but that Jesus has pardoned my
                   sin; and hereafter I will resist temptation in and through His
                   might."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 297.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do the thoughts just presented mean that we have moved
                   back to righteousness by works?

                      "We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for salvation is
                   the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is the
                   fruit of faith. [1 John 3:5, 6 quoted.] Here is the true test. If we
                   abide in Christ, if the love of God dwells in us, our feelings, our
                   thoughts, our purposes, our actions, will be in harmony with the
                   will of God as expressed in the precepts of His holy law. . . .
                      "That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men
                   from the obligation of obedience to God, is not faith, but
                   presumption."—Steps to Christ, p. 61.
                      Sinning is not the climate for consecration. The climate for
                   consecration is joyous, willing obedience to God's will.

                   may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
                   gates into the city" (Rev. 22:14).

                      Some of the ancient authorities read this text as "Blessed are
                   those who wash their robes." If one's robes are washed in the
                   blood of the Lamb, will not such a person keep the command-
                   ments? Or can a person truly keep the commandments apart
                   from the cleansing blood of Jesus?

                   tree in the midst of the Garden, or its leaves, which are for the

                      "Obedience through Jesus Christ gives to man perfection of

                      It is one of the greatest tragedies of our time that some among
                   us are fearful of speaking of obedience anymore, lest the very
                   mention of obedience to the. commandments of God would
                   suggest legalism. How successful the devil has been in confus-
                   ing the signposts on the highway of eternal life! It may help us to
                   keep our thinking straight on this matter if we will remember
                   what the plan of salvation is designed to do. It, is designed to
                   bring the ultimate conquest and destruction of sin.
                      Sin is disobedience to the law of God. It is a placing of one's
                   own will above the will of God. The plan of salvation is designed
                   to restore man to that harmony with the will of God in which he
                   was first created. So who can do anything but rejoice when men
                   choose the commandments of God as the rule of their lives? If
                   they are unhappy in their obedience to God, perhaps they have
                   not washed their robes recently.

THINK IT THROUGH     By what means may I be numbered with that innumerable
                   company that will stand before the throne and before the
                   Lamb clothed in white robes with palm branches in their
                   hands? (See Rev. 7:9, 13, 14.)

                      "All who are found worthy to be counted as the members of
                   the family of God in heaven, will recognize one another as sons

                   strength and pardon from the same source, even from Jesus
                   Christ who was crucified for their sins. They know that they are
                   to wash their robes of character in His blood, to find acceptance

                                                                            June 4
          Part 1     What is one of the clearest evidences that we are living
        "IF YOU    followers of the Lord Jesus Christ?
     HAVE LOVE"
                     "By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you
                   have love for one another" (John 13:35 RSV).

                      It may be natural for love to exist within a family, brother for
                   brother, parent for child, husband for wife. It is not natural,
                   however, for the divergent personalities which make up the
                   church to be marked with mutual love and forbearance, each for
                   each and all for all. Individuals with different personalities and
                   backgrounds are drawn together and others are repelled.
                      Two of the clearest evidences to the world that we are Christ's
                   and that we are bearing fruit as a result of our life in Him will be
                   (1) the unity of the church and (2) the mutual love and respect of
                   all the varying members of that church.
                     If we are not convinced about the variables within the mem-
                   bership of the church, why not look at the twelve disciples of
                   Jesus Christ? How natural was it for them to love one another
                   and to give each other the place of honor? Do we recall the very
                   human reaction of the ten when the two asked for the two top
                   places of honor in the kingdom? (See Matt. 20:20-24.)

THINK IT THROUGH     Can I just decide to make myself love those who are not "my
                   type"? (See "Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 266.)

                     Note that loving one another is the evidence to the world that
                   we are Christ's disciples. We do not make ourselves love one
                   another, and then say, "Please notice us, this makes us disci-
                   ples of Christ." Because we are His disciples, we do love one
                   another, and this fact is an evidence to all men that we are
                   disciples of Christ.
                     "In this last meeting with His disciples, the great desire which
                   Christ expressed for them was that they might love one another
                   as He had loved them. Again and again He spoke of this.... His
                   very first injunction when alone with them in the upper chamber
                   was, 'A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one
                   another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.' To
                   the disciples this commandment was new; for they had not
                   loved one another as Christ had loved them. He saw that new
                   ideas and impulses must control them; that new principles must
                   be practiced by them; through His life and death they were to
                   receive a new conception of love. The command to love one
                   another had a new meaning in the light of His self-sacrifice. The
                   whole work of grace is one continual service of love, of self-
                   denying, self-sacrificing effort."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 677,

                                                                          June 5
          Part 2     What close parallel to love within the church is evidence to
      "THAT THE    the world of the effectiveness of Christ's mission?
         WORLD
     MAY KNOW"       "The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them,
                   that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and thou in
                   me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may
                   know that thou hast sent me and that thou hast loved them
                   even as thou hast loved me" (John 17:22, 23, RSV).

                      Love and unity are almost twin experiences. It would be ex-
                   tremely difficult to think of a situation where love could reign
                   and unity not result: or where unity exists without love being
                   present unless the unity were of the superficial variety for
                   mutual self-interest (like the unity between two former national
                   enemies who become allies in the face of a mutual foe).
                      Let us note that it is no ordinary unity that is here made an
                   evidence to the world of the effectiveness of Christ's mission.
                   The unity is of the caliber and character of the oneness between
                   Christ and His Father. One would hesitate to give expression to
                   such a thought were it not given us in Holy Scripture. But that is
                   indeed Christ's prayer (for this is part of His great intercessory
                   prayer) that His disciples should be one in the same way that
                   Christ and His Father are one—obviously we in our sphere, and
                   the members of the Godhead in their sphere.

THINK IT THROUGH     Does unity require conformity?

                     If by conformity we have in mind lack of conviction, surrender
                   of conscience, a fawning adulation of those in position, then—
                   No. On the other hand, how can a person who is automatically
                   against what someone else is for think that he is in any way a
                   part of the answer to Christ's prayer for His church?
                     "When men are bound together, not by force or self-interest,
                   but by love, they show the working of an influence that is above
                   every human influence. Where this oneness exists, it is evidence
                   that the image of God is being restored in humanity, that a new
                   principle of life has been implanted. It shows that there is power
                   in the divine nature to withstand the supernatural agencies of
                   evil, and that the grace of God subdues the selfishness inherent
                   in the natural heart."—The Desire of Ages, p. 678.
                      "We must study the truth for ourselves. No living man should
                   be relied upon to think for us. No matter who it is, or in what
                   position he may be placed, we are not to look upon any man as a
                   perfect criterion for us. We are to counsel together, and to be
                   subject to one another; but at the same time we are to exercise
                   the ability God has given us to learn what is truth."—Counsels

We Bear Fruit       LESSON 11                                           ❑   Tuesday
                                                                             June 6
           Part 3     What is the relationship between the fruitful follower and
       "I AM THE    the Lord Himself?
           VINE"
                      "I am the vine, you are the branches: He who abides in me,
                    and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit: for apart from me you
                    can do nothing" (John 15:5, RSV).

                      Perhaps in no other place in Scripture is the relationship
                    between Christ and His follower more clearly illustrated and
                    more fully expounded than in His illustration of the vine and the
                    branches. And if there is any one thing more than another that is
                    stressed in this illustration, it is that the branches should be
                    fruitful.
                      It was particularly significant that Christ would give this illus-
                    tration to His disciples on that night on which He was to be
                    betrayed. Within a very few hours He was to be taken from them
                    as they each fled in search of self-preservation. Yet He intended
                    that they were to be as close to Him as branches are to a vine.
                      "The connection of the branch with the vine, He said, repre-
                    sents the relation you are to sustain to Me. The scion is en-
                    grafted into the living vine, and fiber by fiber, vein by vein, it
                    grows into the vine stock. The life of the vine becomes the life of
                    the branch."—The Desire of Ages, p. 675.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the major requirement of the branch if it is to be
                    fruitful?

                       "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
                    itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye
                    abide in me" (John 15:4).

                      How does the principle of unity apply in the illustration of the
                    vine and the branches?

                       "The branches of the vine cannot blend into each other; they
                    are individually separate; yet every branch must be in fellowship
                    with every other if they are united in the same parent stock. They
                    all draw nourishment from the same source; they drink in the
                    same life-giving properties. So each branch of the True Vine is
                    separate and distinct, yet all are bound together in the parent
                    stock. There can be no division. They are all linked together by
                    His will to bear fruit wherever they can find place and opportun-
                    ity. But in order to do this, the worker must hide self. He must not
                    give expression to his own mind and will. He is to express the
                    mind and will of Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

We Bear Fruit      LESSON 11                                    ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     June 7
          Part 4   What interest does the heavenly Father have in the fruitful-
     "MY FATHER ness of the branches?
            THE
      GARDENER'"   "I am the real vine, and my Father is the gardener. Every
                 barren branch of mine he cuts away; and every fruiting branch
                 he cleans, to make It more fruitful still" (John 15:1, 2, NEB).

                     It is significant that the heavenly Father is portrayed as the
                   Husbandman, or the Gardener. The gardener controls the vine.
                   The heavenly Father is concerned about the fruitfulness of the
                   individual branches of the True Vine. He supervises the grafting
                   of the branches into the parent stock. It is He who prunes the
                   branches (purges them) in order that they might become in-
                   creasingly fruitful.
                     Think of it, those of you who tend plants and trees—whether
                   for a livelihood or as a hobby—the heavenly Father watching
                   tenderly over His vine and overthe brancheS! With what care the
                   skillful horticulturist grafts buds into the parent stock! How
                   carefully he binds about the union to exclude undesirable ele-
                   ments (insects, bacteria), to shelter the new part of the plant
                   from undue stress that might destroy the union that is taking
                   place, as fiber by fiber and vein by vein the life of the vine
                   becomes the life of the branch. It is the heavenly Father who
                   takes this kind of care.

THINK IT THROUGH     What means does the Father use to prune the human
                   branches?
                     "From the chosen twelve who had followed Jesus, one as a
                   withered branch was about to be taken away; the rest were to
                   pass under the pruning knife of bitter trial. Jesus with solemn
                   tenderness explained the purpose of the husbandman. The
                   pruning will cause pain, but it is the Father who applies the
                   knife. He works with no wanton hand or indifferent heart. There
                   are branches trailing upon the ground; these must be cut loose
                   from the earthly supports to which their tendrils are fastening.
                   They are to reach heavenward, and find their support in
                   God."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 676, 677.

                      Compare church membership with fruitfulness.
                     "While the.graft is outwardly united with the vine, there may
                   be no vital connection. Then there will be no growth or fruitful-
                   ness. So there may be an apparent connection with Christ
                   without a real union with Him by faith. A profession of religion
                   places men in the church, but the character and conduct show
                   whether they are in connection with Christ. If they bear no fruit,
                   they are false branches. Their separation from Christ involves a
                   ruin as complete as that represented by the dead branch."—The

We Bear Fruit      LESSON 11                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                         June 8

          Part 5   What is the one purpose of the vine in supporting its
     "BEAR MUCH branches?
         FRUIT"
                   "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so
                 shall ye be my disciples" (John 15:8).

                      There is only one purpose in the fiery trial, the numbing
                   disappointment, the almost overwhelming sorrow, that you
                   have just endured. The gardener does not carelessly wield the
                   knife. He does not permit trial and tragedy to come to us indis-
                   criminately. Neither, on the other hand, is there any assurance
                   that we are automatically immune from the common tragedies
                   that may occur at random throughout the human race.
                      Jesus Himself came to this world to do His Father's will, to
                   bear fruits of righteousness in human flesh, to demonstrate the
                   character of God and the possibility of man. It is only natural
                   then that those who would constitute His branches would have
                   the same purpose, the same reason for existence.
                      "God desires to manifest through you the holiness, the be-
                   nevolence, the compassion, of His own character."—The De-
                   sire of Ages, p. 677.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is fruit bearing the result of our own striving?

                      "The Saviour does not bid the disciples labor to bear fruit. He
                   tells them to abide in Him. 'If ye abide in Me,' He says, 'and My
                   words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done
                   unto you.' It is through the word that Christ abides in His follow-
                   ers. This is the same vital union that is represented by eating His
                   flesh and drinking His blood. The words of Christ are spirit and
                   life. Receiving them, you receive the life of the Vine. You live 'by

                                                                              June 9
           Part 6     How does Jesus abide in the believer?
   "ABIDE IN ME"
                       "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
                    itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye
                    abide in me."
                       "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
                    what ye will, and it shall be done unto you" (John 15:4, 7).

                       If by His word Jesus abides in us, then we abide in Him by faith
                    in what He says. Ellen G. White wrote, "This spiritual relation [of
                    abiding in Jesus] can be established only by the exercise of
                    personal faith. This faith must express on our part supreme
                    preference, perfect reliance, entire consecration. Our will must
                    be wholly yielded to the divine will, our feelings, desires, inter-
                    ests, and honor identified with the prosperity of Christ's king-
                    dom and the honor of His cause, we constantly receiving grace
                    from Him, and Christ accepting gratitude from us."—

                    for Christ in every possible way.

                      What result does John attribute to faith? 1 John 5:4.
                      This is a faith that works by love and purifies the soul. It is an
                    active faith, a fruit-bearing faith. But it is a dependent faith—as
                    dependent as a branch upon the parent vine. (See The Desire of
                    Ages, p. 314.)

THINK IT THROUGH      What does it mean to abide in Christ and He in us?
                       "Abiding in Christ means a constant receiving of His Spirit, a
                    life of unreserved surrender to His service. The channel of
                    communication must be open continually between man and his
                    God. As the vine branch constantly draws the sap from the living
                    vine, so are we to cling to Jesus, and receive from Him by faith
                    the strength and perfection of His own character."—The Desire
                    of Ages, p. 676.

                      What are the characteristics of that faith which will give us
                    victory over the world?
                       "It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in
                    Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces
                    Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to
                    ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. But saving faith is a
                    transaction, by which those who receive Christ join themselves
                    in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith
                    means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul
                    becomes a conquering power."—Gospel Workers, p. 261.

We Have Great Promises            LESSON 12                            ❑ Sunday
                                                                           June 11
           Part 1    What is Peter's description of God's promises?
      "EXCEEDING
       GREAT . . .   "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
       PROMISES" that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
                   him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given
                   unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these
                   ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped
                   the corruption that is in the world through lust" (2 Peter 1:3, 4).

                       It is as though Peter reached out for words that are not in
                    language in his effort to ascribe sufficient greatness and pre-
                    ciousness to the promises of God. How great is "exceeding
                    great"? And how precious is "exceeding ... precious"? There is
                    no top limit to the measure of these promises. They are available
                    "through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus
                    Christ" (verse 1). They are ours only because of "his divine
                    power" (verse 3). Then comes the incredible assurance that
                    through the acceptance, the claiming of these unbelievably
                    great promises, we actually become "partakers of the divine
                    nature."
                       Now we need to remind ourselves constantly that, in the
                    person of His Son Jesus Christ, God came down and took upon
                    Him our human nature with its risks, its weaknesses, its
                    liabilities. And that is incomprehensible enough! But for the
                    Lord to indicate that we poor sinners can, by His grace, receive
                    His great promises and in receiving them become partakers of
                    the divine nature—that is almost too much for our feeble human
                    comprehension and vision to grasp.

THINK IT THROUGH      What condition must be met by those who would partake of
                    the divine nature in connection with the acceptance of God's
                    great promises?

                       "Let every one who desires to be a partaker of the divine
                    nature appreciate the fact that he must escape the corruption
                    that is in the world through lust. There must be a constant,
                    earnest struggling of the soul against the evil imaginings of the
                    mind. There must be a steadfast resistance of temptation to sin
                    in thought or act.... We should meditate upon the mission of
                    Him who came to save His people from their sins. By constantly
                    contemplating heavenly themes, our faith and love will grow
                    stronger. Our prayers will be more and more acceptable to God,
                    because they will be more and more mixed with faith and love.
                    They will be more intelligent and fervent. There will be mote
                    constant confidence in Jesus, and you will have a daily, living
                    experience in the willingness and power of Christ to save unto
                    the uttermost all that come unto God by Him."—Ellen G. White

We Have Great Promises           LESSON 12                            ❑ Monday
                                                                        June 12
          Part 2     Is there any reason for us to question Christ's willingness to
       "NO WISE    receive us?
      CAST OUT"      "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
                   cometh to me I will in no wise cast out" (John 6:37).

                     This is a pure and unadorned promise of God. It has no
                   conditions, no qualifications other than an attitude on our part
                   of believing what He says. He invites us to come. We believe that
                   He means what He says. We come. As we come, we are assured
                   that we will not be cast out. He will never turn us away. Does it
                   not remind us of the other illustration where Christ is knocking
                   at the heart's door, and gives assurance that, if any will hear His
                   voice and open the door, He will come in? That is the mirror
                   image of the promise we have before us today.

THINK IT THROUGH      What inherited and cultivated tendencies toward evil make
                   it seem difficult for me to come to Jesus? Should these pre-
                   vent my acceptance of the "exceeding great and precious
                   promises"?
                      "It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us
                   strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ, God
                   has provided means for subduing every sinful trait, and resist-
                   ing every temptation, however strong. But many feel that they
                   lack faith, and therefore they remain away from Christ. Let these
                   souls, in their helpless unworthiness, cast themselves upon the
                   mercy of their compassionate Saviour. Look not to self, but to
                   Christ. He who healed the sick and cast out demons when He
                   walked among men is the same mighty Redeemer today. Faith
                   comes by the word of God. Then grasp His promise, 'Him that
                   cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.' "—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 429.

                     Should I try to improve before I come fully to the Lord? (See
                   Luke 15:18.)
                     "Do not listen to the enemy's suggestion to stay away from
                   Christ until you have made yourself better; until you are good
                   enough to come to God. If you wait until then, you will never
                   come. When Satan points to your filthy garments, repeat the
                   promise of Jesus, 'Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast
                   out.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 205, 206.
                     "Let none look to self, as though they had power to save
                   themselves. Jesus died for us because we were helpless to do
                   this. In Him is our hope, our justification, our righteousness.
                   When we see our sinfulness we should not despond and fear
                   that we have no Saviour, or that He has no thoughts of mercy
                   toward us. At this very time He is inviting us to come to Him in
                   our helplessness and be saved."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

      UNBELIEF"
                     If I tell the Lord my problem with unbelief and solicit His
                   help, will He accept me on such a feeble approach?

                       It may be difficult to see one of God's exceeding great and
                   precious promises in this rather negative declaration of faith,
                   and some who consider themselves strong in faith may be ready
                   to despise this poor father who confessed to the Saviour his
                   terrible weakness of unbelief.
                       We can discover in this father's plea, and in God's response to
                   it, one of the most exceeding great and precious promises of all,
                   especially to those who feel themselves exceedingly weak in
                   faith, those who feel overwhelmed by doubt and unbelief.
                      The Lord Jesus Christ responded to this pitiful heart cry from
                   the father whose son was possessed of a "dumb spirit." (See
                   verse 17.) He rebuked the evil spirit so that it came out of the boy
                   and left him in normal health and strength.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does the spirit of prophecy turn this declaration of
                   unbelief into an exceeding great and precious promise?

                     "Cast yourself at His feet with the cry, 'Lord, I believe; help
                   Thou mine unbelief.' You can never perish while you do this—
                   never."—The Desire of Ages, p. 429.
                     Spend whatever time may be necessary to let feeble faith
                   grasp this glorious assurance. No one need wait for faith. Even
                   asking the Lord to help and relieve our lack of faith will bring a
                   quick connection with Heaven and strength for coping with the
                   powers of darkness. It is our need that argues with Heaven with
                   undeniable eloquence—nothing else.

                     What could have cost the life of the demon-possessed son?

                     Suppose that the father had persisted with the attitude, "If
                   thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us."
                   Would Jesus have healed his son? (See Mark 9:22, 23.)
                     "There is no lack of power on the part of Christ; the healing of
                   the son depends upon the father's faith. With a burst of tears,
                   realizing his own weakness, the father casts himself upon
                   Christ's mercy, with the cry, 'Lord, I believe; help Thou mine
                   unbelief.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 428.

We Have Great Promises               LESSON 12                         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                           June 14
              Part 4     How does the heavenly Father Himself feel about people?
       "THE FATHER
 . . . LOVES YOU"        "The Father himself loves you, because you have loved me
                       and have believed that I came from the Father" (John 16:27,
                       RSV).

                         We have made reference to this point earlier in the quarter.
                       Too many of us still think of the Father as one to be feared and of
                       Christ as one to be loved. Jesus spoke the above text to His
                       disciples in an attempt to comfort them and to prepare them for
                       the tragedies of Gethsemane and Calvary. Do you believe, my
                       brother, my sister, that the Father loves you? that the Father
                       loves you? that the Father loves you? Emphasize the words as
                       we will, this is an assurance to our faith.
                         Some may say that the Father loves only those who love Christ
                       and who believe that He came from God. But that is not the
                       emphasis here. Christ is about to leave His disciples. He is
                       seeking to direct their faith and trust to the Father—through the
                       name of the Son, it is true, but still to the Father. They need to
                       believe and understand before Jesus leaves them that they can
                       approach the Father, for the Father Himself loves them.
                         It is like shalom, shalom. You've got to believe it. It is true that
                       the Father can do for those who respond to the love of His Son,
                       the Sent of God, what He cannot do for those who turn away in
                       unbelief, even though He lovesthem also. He made and sustains
                       us all and causes His sun to shine on the wicked as well as upon
                       the righteous. God has no prejudices and no favorites, but there
                       is no way for Him to take into His kingdom of righteous-
                       ness those who do not trust themselves to Him.

THINK IT THROUGH         Do we need one more and greater assurance of God's love
                       for us? (See John 3:16.)

                         " 'And the counsel of peace shall be between Them both.' The
                       love of the Father, no less than of the Son, is the fountain of
                       salvation for the lost race. Said Jesus to His disciples before He
                       went away: 'I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:
                       for the Father Himself loveth you.' John 16:26, 27. God was 'in
                       Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.' 2 Corinthians 5:19.
                       And in the ministration in the sanctuary above, 'the counsel of
                       peace shall be between Them both.' God so loved the world,
                       that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
                       Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' "—The Great

         "I HAVE   have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of
      OVERCOME" good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).
                       It is beautiful to read this text in various translations, but they
                    all concur in the fact that Christ has overcome or conquered the
                    world. He gives that as the reason why we should be of good
                    cheer, even though we shall have tribulation in the world, and as
                    the reason why in the midst of tribulation we may have His
                    peace—peace in Him.

                     How does this text become one of the exceeding great and
                   precious promises whereby we may partake of the divine
                   nature?
                     To the extent that He is our victory, He is our conquest of evil.
                   He is our Master over temptation. He is our sanctification, our
                   complete holiness. He is our redemption, righteousness, and
                   wisdom. All of these things He is for us; and because He is these
                   for us, they are counted to us; they are ours.
                     What chance have we to be overcomers? In ourselves, none.
                   In and of ourselves we are like those who are without God and
                   without hope in the world. But Christ is our victory. Be of good
                   cheer, He has overcome the world. It is not a question of
                   whether one of us might yet make it. He has made it; He is our
                   victory. Do we remember that: "Wonderful—almost too won-
                   derful for man to comprehend—is the Saviour's sacrifice in our
                   behalf, shadowed forth in all the sacrifices of the past, in all the
                   services of the typical sanctuary. And this sacrifice was called
                   for. When we realize that His suffering was necessary in order to
                   secure our eternal well-being, our hearts are touched and
                   melted. He pledged Himself to accomplish our full salvation in a
                   way satisfactory to the demands of God's justice, and consis-

                   bk. 1, p. 309.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is some nagging weakness still robbing you of His victory?
                     "In our own strength it is impossible for us to deny the clamors of
                   our fallen nature. Through this channel Satan will bring temptation
                   upon us. Christ knew that the enemy would come to every human
                   being, to take advantage of hereditary weakness, and by his false
                   insinuations to ensnare all whose trust is not in God. And by passing
                   over the ground which man must travel, our Lord has prepared the
                   way for usto overcome. It is not Hiswill that we should be placed at a
                   disadvantage in the conflict with Satan. He would not have us intimi-

We Have Great Promises           LESSON 12                               ❑ - Friday
                                                                         • June 16
          Part 6     We have been listing this week some of the exceeding great
    "WE HAVE AN    and precious promises. By these we may be partakers of the
      ADVOCATE"    divine nature. There is no reason for us not to have a life of
                   victory over temptation and therefore over sin. But God in His
                   great mercy is fully aware of the weakness of the flesh. He
                   knows of the persistent desire of the old man of sin to rise from
                   the grave and be allowed at least a little more time of existence.
                   Just a little time, and just a feeble existence—anything but
                   permanent death.

                     What merciful provision has God made for those who have
                   set their feet on the path to the kindgom to be overcomers?

                     "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
                   not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
                   Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1).

                      This exceeding great and precious promise is not written to
                   unbelievers. It is written to "my little children" or "my children."
                   It is a term of affection' from the aged apostle John to the
                   believers in the early church of Jesus Christ. He, too, has re-
                   corded in this very same letter repeated assurances and evi-
                   dences that God has made provision for us to overcome sin.
                   (See 1 John 1:7, for example.) He has written these things to
                   help them and us to avoid sin. There is no excuse or reason for
                   sin; but if, having said all of that, we fall into sin, the merciful
                   God has provided us an Advocate, "Jesus Christ the righteous."

THINK IT THROUGH     How complete is the provision that my heavenly Father has
                   delivered me from the power of darkness and accepted me
                   into the kingdom of His dear Son?

                     Jesus, our Advocate, takes our place in every needful way.
                     "The religious services, the prayers, the praise, the penitent
                   confession of sin ascend from true believers as incense to the
                   heavenly sanctuary; but passing through the corrupt channels
                   of humanity, they are so defiled that unless purified by blood,
                   they can never be of value with God. They ascend not in spotless
                   purity, and unless the Intercessor who is at God's right hand
                   presents and purifies all by His righteousness, it is not accepta-
                   ble to God. All incense from earthly tabernacles must be moist
                   with the cleansing drops of the blood of Christ. He holds before
                   the Father the censer of His own merits, in which there is no
                   taint of earthly corruption. He gathers into this censer the
                   prayers, the praise, and the confessions of His people, and with
                   these He puts His own spotless righteousness. Then, perfumed
                   with the merits of Christ's propitiation, the incense comes up
                   before God wholly and entirely acceptable. Then gracious

          Part 1   How does the prophet Isaiah classify human righteous-
"AS FILTHY RAGS" nesses?

                     "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteous-
                   nesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our
                   iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away" (Isa. 64:6).

                      Isaiah was writing of the sinfulness of Judah. (See verses
                   9-12.) But the condition of Judah is the condition of all human-
                   ity. In the frankness of the Hebrew approach to life, this is
                   Heaven's estimate of our righteousnesses.
                      "Unclean thing. Heb. tame' , an adjective meaning 'unclean.'
                   Standing by itself, as here, it may refer either to an unclean thing
                   or to an 'unclean person.' Tame' is the word that appears re-
                   peatedly throughout Leviticus describing ceremonial unclean-
                   ness. Left to himself, man cannot wash away the impurity of
                   sin—he remains unclean.

                   with a clouded mind; but he now [in the presence of Jesus]
                   began to comprehend their meaning. He saw that the most rigid
                   obedience to the mere letter of the law as applied to the outward
                   life could entitle no man to enter the kingdom of heaven. In the
                   estimation of men, his life had been just and honorable; but in
                   the presence of Christ, he felt that his heart was unclean, and his
                   life unholy."—The Desire of Ages, p. 174.
                      "Everything that we of ourselves can do is defiled by sin.. ..
                   When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His
                   heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind becomes one with
                   His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him; we live
                   His life. This is what it means to be clothed with the garments of
                   His righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon us He sees, not
                   the fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and deformity of sin, but
                   His own robe of righteousness, which is perfect obedience to
                   the law of Jehovah."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 311, 312.

                     What was the reason for the condemnation of the man who
                   entered the feast without a wedding garment? (See Matt.
                   22:11-14.)

We Are Righteous By Faith LESSON 13                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                           June 19
           Part 2   What is the earliest biblical reference to righteousness by
        COUNTED faith, or being counted righteous?
      RIGHTEOUS
                    "And he [Abram] believed in the Lord; and he counted it to
                  him for righteousness" (Gen. 15:6).

                      Some may be surprised that this text is in the Old Testament.
                   We are aware of the use which the apostle Paul made of it in
                   Romans 4:3 and Galatians 3:6 for example. But we often fail to
                   recognize how much of the New Testament is drawn from and
                   built upon the Old. Notice that our text does not say that Ab-
                   ram's belief in the Lord made him righteous, but his belief in the
                   Lord was counted to him for righteousness. This is the basic
                   biblical concept of justification by faith, the term for having
                   righteousness counted to us—someone else's righteousness.
                      "Abram was a sinner and needed redemption, as does every
                   other human being; but when righteousness was imputed to
                   him, mercy and grace were also extended, effecting the pardon
                   of his sin and bringing the rewards of righteousness. Here for
                   the first time the full importance of faith is brought to view. Here
                   also, for the first time, imputed righteousness is mentioned.
                   From this point onward both fundamental concepts run
                   through the Holy Scriptures, to find exhaustive and masterful
                   treatment by the pen of the apostle Paul (see Rom. 4)."—SDA
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 312.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the relationship between faith and actions?

                      "Thus they [the Israelites] provoked Him [the Lord] to anger
                   with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. Then
                   stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague
                   was stayed. And that was counted unto him for righteousness
                   unto all generations for evermore" (Ps. 106:29-31).
                      You will recall that on a number of occasions the New Testa-
                   ment points to the actions of Abraham as the evidence of his
                   faith, which faith laid hold of the righteousness of God so that
                   Abraham was counted righteous. It seems important to stress
                   this matter, because some may feel that fo be righteous by faith
                   is unrelated to daily life. On the other hand, the Scriptures on
                   numerous occasions state that action is the evidence of faith, as
                   though it were the basis for the imputed (or counted) righteous-
                   ness. (See Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 453, 456.)
                      The experience from the history of Israel referred to by the
                   apostle Paul "and as recorded in the one hundred fifth and one
                   hundred sixth psalms, contains lessons of warning that the
                   people of God in these last days especially need to study. I urge
                   that these chapters be read at least once every week."—

We Are Righteous By Faith LESSON 13                                    ❑ Tuesday
                                                                         June 20

          Part 3     How does law fit in to righteousness by faith?
  RIGHTEOUSNESS
        AND LAW      Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy
                   law is the truth" (Ps. 119:142).

                       In a typical Hebrew parallelism righteousness and law are
                   made synonymous. The same truth is repeated using different
                   but similar terms. And when one thinks about it, it is inevitable
                   that righteousness and law would be synonymous, because the
                   law of God defines righteousness. It expresses it. It explains it. It
                   shows the limits and size of it. Until righteousness is described,
                   it is an empty word. When God made it into a law form that
                   governs human relationships with man and with God, it became
                   something tangible, something that touched life and reality. So
                   it is really impossible to have righteousness by faith divorced
                   from law.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can we relate righteousness, law, and salvation?

                     Salvation is not an abstraction. Salvation is salvation from sin.
                   Sin is without specific definition where there is no law. By the
                   law is the knowledge of sin. Sin is the transgression of the law
                   and the plan of salvation provides the means for victory over sin
                   and its consequences and its power.
                     "The law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable. It is a
                   revelation of the will and the character of its Author. God is love,
                   and His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and
                   love to man. 'Love is the fulfilling of the law.' Romans 13:10. The
                   character of God is righteousness and truth; such is the nature
                   of His law. Says the psalmist: 'Thy law is the truth;' all Thy
                   commandments are righteousness.' Psalm 119:142, 172. And
                   the apostle Paul declares: 'The law is holy, and the command-
                   ment holy, and just, and good.' Romans 7:12. Such a law, being
                   an expression of the mind and will of God, must be as enduring
                   as its Author."—The Great Controversy, p. 467.

                     How should we define the righteousness which is accepta-
                   ble with God?

                      "The righteousness which Christ taught is conformity of
                   heart and life to the revealed will of God. Sinful men can become
                   righteous only as they have faith in God and maintain a vital
                   connection with Him. Then true godliness will elevate the
                   thoughts and ennoble the life."—The Desire of Ages, p. 310.

We Are Righteous By Faith LESSON 13                                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       June 21
          Part 4   What false type of righteousness was in evidence in Christ's
    "EXCEPT YOUR day?
 RIGHTEOUSNESS"
                   "For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
                 exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
                 shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:20).


                      This is a serious indictment coming from the Lord of glory. He
                    was speaking about men in His day, religious leaders of the
                    chosen people. Immediately we should ask ourselves: What
                    kind of righteousness had they?
                      "The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees consisted in
                    external adherence to the letter of the law; Christ called for
                    insight into, and cooperation with, the underlying principles of
                    the law.... They taught that a man is to be judged by a majority
                    of his deeds; that is, if his 'good' deeds are in excess of-his evil
                    deeds, God will adjudge him righteous."—SDA Bible Commen-
                    tary, vol. 5, p. 333.

THINK IT THROUGH      What are the warnings for us in the righteousness claimed
                    by the scribes and Pharisees?

                      "The greatest deception of the humari mind in Christ's day
                    was that a mere assent to the truth constitutes righteousness.
                       . A jealous regard for what is termed theological truth often
                    accompanies a hatred of genuine truth as made manifest in life.
                    The darkest chapters of history are burdened with the record of
                    crimes committed by bigoted religionists. The Pharisees
                    claimed to be children of Abraham, and boasted of their pos-
                    session of the oracles of God: yet these advantages did not
                    preserve them from selfishness, malignity, greed for gain, and
                    the basest hypocrisy. They thought themselves the greatest
                    religionists of the world, but their so-called orthodoxy led them
                    to crucify the Lord of glory.
                       "The same danger still exists. Many take it for granted that
                    they are Christians, simply because they subscribe to certain
                    theological tenets. But they have not brought the truth into
                    practical life. They have not believed and loved it, therefore they
                    have not received the power and grace that come through
                    sanctification of the truth. Men may profess faith in the truth;
                    but if it does not make them sincere, kind, patient, forbearing,
                    heavenly-minded, it is a curse to its possessors, and through
                    their influence it is a curse to the world."—The Desire of Ages,
                    pp. 309, 310.
                       "The only true faith is that which 'worketh by love' (Galatians
                    5:6) to purify the soul. It is as leaven that transforms the
                    character."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 53.

We Are Righteous By Faith LESSON 13                                  ❑ Thursday
                                                                        June 22

            Part 5   In contrast to Israel as a whole, what had Gentiles found
"RIGHTEOUSNESS with respect to salvation?
    . . OF FAITH"
                     "What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed
                   not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even
                   the righteousness which is of faith" (Rom. 9:30).

                      We said at the outset of the lesson for this week that there is
                   no other way for a human being to be righteous than to be
                   righteous by faith. Paul is emphasizing that point here in his
                   epistle to the Romans when he speaks of Israel, which followed
                   after the law of righteousness but failed to attain to that law. He
                   raises the question as to why they failed and gives the answer,
                   "Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works
                   of the law" (verse 32). So Israel's general failure to achieve to
                   the very righteousness which she professed, and which she
                   sought, is due to the fact that she sought it by works, her own
                   works, rather than by faith in Christ Jesus, the only truly and
                   perfectly obedient Man.

                      As we have been studying the simple steps in coming to
                   Christ for salvation this quarter, how shall we assess our own
                   righteousness? Where do we stand with regard to righteous-
                   ness?

                     "By the wedding garment in the parable [see Matt. 22:1-14] is
                   represented the pure, spotless character which Christ's true
                   followers will possess. To the church it is given 'that she should
                   be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white,' not having spot, or
                   wrinkle, or any such thing.' The fine linen, says the Scripture, 'is
                   the righteousness of saints.' Rev. 19:8; Eph. 5:27. It is the righ-
                   teousness of Christ, His own unblemished character, that
                   through faith is imparted to all who receive Him as their per-
                   sonal Saviour."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 310.

THINK IT THROUGH     Have you ever earnestly and prayerfully said to yourself,
                   "Christ is my righteousness"?

                      It may take continual repetition of that statement and prayer
                   and study regarding it, before the human heart can find the
                   humility to say "That is true. I know that it is true. Christ is my
                   righteousness." This is the experience to which each must
                   come in order to be counted righteous by faith.
                      God and His Son Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit, have told us
                   that we can only be righteous by faith. Do we believe it? Do we
                   accept it? Do we claim it? "Christ is my righteousness."
                      The sweetest joy ever known will flood the soul that believes
                   and claims this offer of the righteousness of Jesus Christ by
                   faith.

We Are Righteous By Faith          LESSON 13                              ❑ Friday
                                                                           June 23
         Part 6   According to the apostle John, what is it that shows a man to
    DOING RIGHT be righteous?

                    "Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righ-
                  teousness is righteous, even as he is righteous" (1 John 3:7).

                     That is what righteousness is. It is right doing. This is not to
                  say we do right in our own strength or by our own unaided will or
                  in our own human nature just as it is.
                     "Many are losing the right way, in consequence of thinking
                  that they must climb to heaven, that they must do something to
                  merit the favor of God. They seek to make themselves better by
                  their own unaided efforts. This they can never accomplish.
                  Christ has made the way by dying our sacrifice, by living our
                  example, by becoming our great high priest. He declares, 'I am
                  the way, the truth, and the life' (John 14:6). If by any effort of our
                  own we could advance one step toward the ladder, the words of
                  Christ would not be true. But when we accept Christ, good
                  works will appear as fruitful evidence that we are in the way of
                  life, that Christ is our way, and that we are treading the true path
                  that leads to heaven."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 368.
                     May we close this quarter's lessons as we opened them—in
                  gratitude for the simplicity of the instruction which God has
                  given whereby we may know how to come to Christ. While many
                  are asking where Jesus is and how they may find Him, He stands
                  knocking, knocking at the heart's door. Why not let us say with
                  Ellen White as we go to open the door of our heart, "Come in,
                  dear Lord."
                     If she was so thankful for the simplicity of the instruction
                  given as to how to find Him, perhaps we should be simple
                  enough in our faith to find Him on the same terms. Then, when
                  He enters, He comes not to find but to make "this troubled
                  room" a dwelling worthy of Himself. When the branch is grafted
                  into the True Vine, Jesus undertakes to make it fruitful. The
                  divine nature is imparted to us, of which we partake. As the fruit
                  of the Spirit is produced, and the Father does the pruning, we
                  come to reflect the likeness of our dear Saviour more and more
                   perfectly. But all the time, the nearer we come to Him the more
                  faulty we see ourselves to be and the more utterly we trust in His
                  righteousness, which is counted to us for righteousness. So let
                  us look unto Jesus, "the author and finisher of our faith" (Heb.
                  12:2).

                                Five loaves and two fish.
                                Just enough to feed one
                                hungry child. But Jesus
                                asked for it and the little
                                boy gave it gladly.
                                Suddenly he was part of a
                                miracle as thousands
                                marveled at the way the
                                Master multiplied his gift
                                to feed them all.

                                God is still multiplying gifts
                                today. This Sabbath, when
                                the Sabbath School offering
                                is taken, give God
                                something to work with.
                                When your offering is given
                                gladly, you too can
                                become part of a miracle!




        Open Heart
Let God's love show through your giving.
