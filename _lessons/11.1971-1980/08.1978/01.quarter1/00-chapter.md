   Dear Fellow Sabbath School Members,



           No country within the territory of the Australasian Division
   presents the Church with a greater challenge than does Papua New Guinea.
   This land, so recently lifted from the stone—age into the late 20th
   century is developing with tremendous momentum. This is also true of
   the Seventh—day Adventist church in Papua New Guinea whose resources
   are straining to maintain an ever developing medical, educational and
   evangelistic programme.

           Three special projects within the Papua New Guinea Union Mission
   will benefit from the 13th Sabbath offering, first quarter, 1978. They
   are:

               1. The replacement of mission aircraft which are so vital to
                  communication in a land of vast distances, high mountains
                  and inadequate roads and public transport services;

               2. A much needed classroom and administrative block at Sonoma
                  College, senior Adventist educational institution of the
                  Union, and;

               3. The erecting of a number of much needed evangelistic youth
                  centres in many of the fast—growing cities and towns of the
                  newly independent nation of Papua New Guinea.

           Scattered throughout the mission lands of the South Pacific are
   many useful monuments of Sabbath School members' sacrificial giving.
   These were special 13th Sabbath projects of the past which are now
   completed and performing an important function in the outreach of the church.

           Papua New Guinea thanks you again in anticipation of an overflowing
   offering this coming 13th Sabbath.

               Yours very sincerely,




                                                          K. S. Parmenter

fails,

the
instructions
So often we fail because we try to solve
our problems in our own way.

When we trust in God and study His
Word daily, we can be confident of
victory over the perplexities of this world
and have a home in the life to come.
                         GOD THE CREATOR
                                    Introduction
    The greatest demonstration of God's power is the creation of life in man and in all
living things. Although we cannot explain what life really is, we see its results, and all
who enjoy life dread the day when it will fade from the body and leave a lifeless
corpse.
    People want to live. There is no greater victory that God can gain for man than the
victory over death. That is basic. Without it every other gift becomes meaningless.
God's gift of life must head any list of divine blessings. The Bible is, in a sense, the
story of God's efforts to gain for man victory over death and to give him everlasting
life.
    God has no rival in His power to conquer death and to give eternal life to man, for He
is the Creator. No other god can justly make that claim.
    Our Creator God formed the earth and created Adam out of the dust of the ground.
This same God came to this earth and was born a child. When wicked men took His
life, they could not keep Him in the tomb. By His inherent power the resurrection took
place.
    In the near future God's power over death will be demonstrated again in the
resurrection and immortalization of the saints. Then those who have believed in
Jesus will experience the victory over death for which they have longed.
    When this takes place, God's children will be able to look forward to an unending
 life in Paradise. By this resurrection of believers, the purpose of God in creating the
 world will at last be realized. We shall enjoy fellowship again with our Creator, and the
entire universe will throb with undiminished love for the Lord. The greatest gift that
 can be given will have been bestowed upon the saints.
    This quarter we shall study about the Lord as Creator and Life-giver. The lessons
 will include the questions of time in the creation of the world, and of the relation of the
 Flood to understanding data often interpreted as supporting evolution.
    We live in a scientific age. Science dominates the thinking of many people. Some
 scientific theories have caused many people to doubt the authority of Scripture. In
 these last days it is important for God's church to understand what is true science and
 to call man back again to the worship of the Creator. The three great messages which
 are to be given in a loud cry in these days can be understood only in the light of the
 power and work of the Creator.

                                                                         January 1


           Part 1     How does the Lord, the true God, differ from other gods?
      GOD ABOVE
       ALL GODS       "Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made
                    the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the
                    earth, and from under these heavens. He hath made the earth
                    by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom,
                    and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion" (Jer.
                    10:11, 12).

                       In the tenth chapter of Jeremiah the prophet contrasts the
                    Lord and idols. He notes that an idol is made from a tree, crafted
                    and embellished by men. He likens idols to "scarecrows in a
                    cucumber field." They are worthless things that cannot speak,
                    walk, or act. And their instruction is like themselves—
                    "wooden." By contrast the Lord can act so mightily that He
                    created the heavens and the earth. His voice is heard in the
                    thunder, and it is He who makes the lightning, the rain, and the
                    wind. No scarecrow, He, but the true, living God, and everlasting
                    King.
                       "The Bible is a history that tells us of the creation of the world
                    and opens to us past centuries. Without it we should have been
                    left to conjecture and fable in regard to the occurrences of the
                    remote past. It reveals to us the Creator of the heavens and the
                    earth, with the universe that He has brought into being, and it
                    sheds a glorious light over the world to come."—Counsels to

                    42:5, 8.

THINK IT THROUGH      How does belief in spontaneous generation, the ability of
                    nonliving matter to change into living matter, relate to the
                    power of the Creator?
                      In recent times there has been a revival of belief in spontane-
                    ous generation. This view is totally contrary to all experience
                    with life and living things. It contradicts one of the most basic
                    laws of biology—life begets life. It also contradicts the teaching
                    of the Bible that the Lord made all living things.
                      "Not all the wisdom and skill of man can produce life in the
                    smallest object in nature. It is only through the life which God
                    Himself has imparted, that either plant or animal can live. So it is
                    only through the life from God that spiritual life is begotten in
                    the hearts of men. Unless a man is 'born from above,' he cannot
                    become a partaker of the life which Christ came to give. John
                    3:3, margin."—Steps to Christ, p. 67.

            GIVER    light" (Ps. 36:9).
           OF LIFE
                       In what ways is God "the fountain of life"?

                        What is life? Even scientists find difficulty in defining it. Life
                     makes the difference between a living body and a dead one. We
                     observe life and experience it, but we know very little about
                     what makes a living person alive. The Bible points to God as the
                     source of all life, and the breath of God as that which quickened
                     Adam after God formed him of the dust of the ground. Not only
                     did God originate life in this world, but He also sustains the life
                     of every living creature.
                        Ellen White notes: "For all the objects of His creation the
                     condition is the same—a life sustained by receiving the life of
                     God, a life exercised in harmony with the Creator's will. To
                     transgress His law, physical, mental, or moral, is to place one's
                     self out of harmony with the universe, to introduce discord,
                     anarchy, ruin."—Education, pp. 99, 100.

                       How is life maintained? Acts 17:28.

                       "The beating heart, the throbbing pulse, every nerve and
                     muscle in the living organism, is kept in order and activity by the
                     power of an ever-present God."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 417

                       What are some ways in which the Creator's power will be
                     active In the future? 1 Cor. 15:51-54.

THINK IT THROUGH       In the light of today's lesson, how should a Christian regard
                     his birthday celebrations?

                       "On birthday occasions the children should be taught that
                     they have reason for gratitude to God for His loving-kindness in
                     preserving their lives for another year. Precious lessons might

                                                                           January 3


             Part 3   What was wrong with Satan's statement to Eve in Genesis
      SATAN CANNOT 3:4?
        CREATE LIFE
                      "The serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die"
                    (Gen. 3:4).

                        The death of Adam and Eve showed that Satan either could
                     not or would not prevent their death. (See Gen. 5:5.) With the
                     opportunities offered during thousands of years, Satan has not
                     once made a person immortal or brought one person back to
                     life. It would be to his advantage to do so. Through spiritism he
                     makes people think the dead are alive. This trickery witnesses to
                     his desire to sustain his claim that Eve would not die if she
                     disobeyed God. We must conclude that he can't give life or
                     sustain it. The Bible claims that God alone can do this.

                       What lesson is taught by the efforts of magicians to dupli-
                     cate the miracles of Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh? Ex.
                     7:10-12; 8:17, 18.

                        "The magicians did not really cause their rods to become
                     serpents; but by magic, aided by the great deceiver, they were
                     able to produce this appearance. It was beyond the power of
                     Satan to change the rods to living serpents. The prince of evil,
                     though possessing all the wisdom and might of an angel fallen,
                     has not power to create, or to give life; this is the prerogative of
                     God alone. But all that was in Satan's power to do, he did; he
                     produced a counterfeit."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 264.
                        Claims have been made by scientists and by the news media
                     that life has been created in the laboratory. On close examina-
                     tion these claims have been shown to be false. Will man ever be
                     able to create life? Claims for the creation of life may well be
                     made in the near future which will be difficult to refute. Labora-
                     tory experimentation may produce results that are difficult to
                     distinguish from true living organisms. In Pharaoh's court it was
                     difficult to tell the living serpent from the counterfeit.

THINK IT THROUGH       Since Satan cannot create life, where do offensive features
                     of nature come from?

                       "Not one noxious plant was placed in the Lord's great garden,
                     but after Adam and Eve sinned, poisonous herbs sprang up. In
                     the parable of the sower the question was asked the Master,
                     'Didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? how then hath it
                     tares?' The Master answered, 'An enemy hath done this.' All
                     tares are sown by the evil one. Every noxious herb is of his
                     sowing, and by his ingenious methods of amalgamation he has
                     corrupted the earth with tares."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                                                                     January 4


           Part 4     What aspects of God's power are taught by the stars?
      THE GREAT
      SUSTAINER       "Lift up your eyes on high and see:
                        who created these?
                      He who brings out their host by number,
                        calling them all by name;
                      by the greatness of his might,
                        and because he is strong in power
                        not one is missing" (Isa. 40:26, RSV).

                       People often overreach themselves. They take on more jobs
                    than they can handle. They make more promises than they can
                    keep. They spend more money than they can earn. They have
                    larger families than they can support. Isaiah invites us to look at
                    the nighttime sky and assures us that God has not overreached
                    Himself. He can care for all that He has made. The stars we can
                    see with the naked eye on a clear night number about 2000.
                    Isaiah assures us that because of God's power "not one is
                    missing." And beyond our sight are countless galaxies, each
                    with billions of stars, all sustained by our heavenly Father.

                      Read the story of the manna in Exodus 16:14-35. What les-
                    son do you find related to today's topic?

                      "For forty years they [Israelites] were daily reminded by this
                    miraculous provision, of God's unfailing care and tender love.
                    In the words of the psalmist, God gave them 'of the corn of
                    heaven. Man did eat angels' food' (Psalm 78:24, 25)—That is,
                    food provided for them by the angels. Sustained by 'the corn of
                    heaven,' they were daily taught that, having God's promise, they
                    were as secure from want as if surrounded by fields of waving
                    grain on the fertile plains of Canaan."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 297.

                      What experience of king Hezekiah is evidence of the power
                    of God to maintain life? 2 Kings 20:5, 6.

                       "Upon all created things is seen the impress of the Deity.
                    Nature testifies of God. The susceptible mind, brought in con-
                    tact with the miracle and mystery of the universe, cannot but
                    recognize the working of infinite power. . . . A mysterious life
                    pervades all nature—a life that sustains the unnumbered worlds
                    throughout immensity, that lives in the insect atom which floats
                    in the summer breeze, that wings the flight of the swallow and
                    feeds the young ravens which cry, that brings the bud to blos-
                    som and the flower to fruit."—Education, p. 99.

God the Creator           LESSON 1                                      ❑ Thursday
                                                                          January 5


              Part 5     What claim does Moses make about God in Psalm 90:2?
       NO BEGINNING
           —NO END       "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou
                       hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
                       everlasting, thou art God" (Ps. 90:2).

                          "From everlasting to everlasting. God is from eternity in the
                       past to eternity in the future (see Ps. 93:2; Prov. 8:23; Micah 5:2;
                       Flab. 1:12). He is 'the Ancient of days' (Dan. 7:9). There could not
                       be a more sublime statement of the eternity of God. The man
                       who recognizes the eternity of God and regards his own life as
                       related to the Eternal, has a powerful stimulus to dignified,
                       worthy living."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 841.
                          Everything we experience begins and ends. There is no way
                       for us even to imagine an existence without a beginning, and
                       only a bit easier to think of no end. But the Bible affirms that
                       God's existence has neither beginning nor ending. Where we
                       can't investigate we can only believe, disbelieve, or withhold
                       judgment. The Christian has chosen to believe because the
                       evidence of the Word and his own experience in response to the
                       Word convince him of the truth of even those biblical teachings
                       he can neither prove nor comprehend.
                          If God had a beginning, it would mean that another had
                       created Him, and that other would really be Creator. If He were
                       to have an end, it would mean He is not able to sustain His own
                       life; much less the everlasting life promised by the Redeemer.
                       To be both Creator and Redeemer God must be from everlasting
                       to everlasting.

                          "The portions of Holy Writ presenting these great themes [the
                       mysteries of the Bible] are not to be passed by as of no use to
                       man. All that God has seen fit to make known we are to accept
                       upon the authority of His word. Only a bare statement of facts
                       may be given, with no explanation as to why or how; but though
                       we cannot comprehend it we should rest content that it is true,
                       because God has said it. All the difficulty lies in the weakness
                       and narrowness of the human mind."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp.

God the Creator      LESSON 1                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                        January 6


          Part 6     How do we receive eternal life?
       GIVER OF
    ETERNAL LIFE     "This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,
                   and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he
                   that hath not the Son of God hath not life" (1 John 5:11, 12).

                     The atonement made possible the use of creative power for
                   redemptive purposes. That power renews believers in the image
                   of Jesus. At the second advent it will change the living saints,
                   and resurrect the dead saints. Both will live forever.
                      "Hath the Son. To have the Son means so to believe on Him
                   that He becomes to us all that His name implies: a Saviour, a
                   Lord, One anointed to be our King.... It means to have Christ
                   dwelling in the heart as the supremely honored Guest... .
                      "Hath life. Literally, 'hath the life,' that is, the eternal life
                   referred to in v. 11. This life begins with the Christian's new
                   birth, and is continued in the world to come. . . . Those who
                   cultivate the friendship of Jesus come to share in His character.
                   In this way, having the Son guarantees having the life that never
                   ends."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 677.

                     What is the result of knowing God and Jesus His Son? John
                   17:3.

                     Here in this world it is often to our advantage to know some-
                   one important. But if that friend falls from his position in dis-
                   grace, his difficulties could spread to us. We cannot fully under-
                   stand what it means to us now and in the future to have God as
                   our friend. Furthermore there is no danger that any change in
                   the Godhead will ever occur. He is the same yesterday, today,
                   and forever.

THINK IT THROUGH     When does the believer receive everlasting life?

                      The saved will not have within them the intrinsic ability to live
                   eternally. Only as the eternal Creator God continues to bestow
                   upon His created beings the gift of life can they live forever with
                   Him.
                      "Christ became one flesh with us, in order that we might
                   become one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of this union that we
                   are to come forth from the grave,—not merely as a manifesta-
                   tion of the power of Christ, but because, through faith, His life
                   has become ours. Those who see Christ in His true character,
                   and receive Him into the heart have everlasting life. It is through
                   the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received
                   into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal."—The

                                            worship. Because God is Creator, He

                                                                          January 8


            Part 1    Since God is eternal, what beginning is God referring to In
      THE BEGINNING the first verse of the Bible?

                        "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth"
                      (Gen. 1:1).

                        Various theories and arguments have arisen over what is
                     meant by "in the beginning." We may speculate, and our specu-
                     lation will be harmless if it is not contrary to the facts already
                     revealed to us in the Scriptures. These include: (1) God is not
                     indebted to preexisting matter, (2) the week of Creation was
                     composed of literal days, and (3) the seventh day was estab-
                     lished as a memorial of the creative activity of the previous six
                     days.
                        "The divine mind and hand have preserved through the ages
                     the record of creation in its purity. It is the word of God alone
                     that gives to us an authentic account of the creation of our
                     world. This word is to be the chief study in our schools."
                     —Counsels to Teachers, p. 13.
                        "Genesis 1:1 affirms that God is before all else and that He is
                     the one and only cause of all else. This verse is the foundation of
                     all right thinking in regard to the material world. Here is set forth
                     the impressive truth that 'in the formation of our world, God was
                     not indebted to pre-existing matter' (8T 258). . . .
                        "No discussion of secondary questions regarding the mys-
                     tery of a divine creation, either as to time or method, should be
                     allowed to blur the fact that the real dividing line between a true
                     and a false belief on the subject of God and the origin of our
                     earth is acceptance or rejection of the truth set forth in this
                     verse."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, pp. 207, 208.

                       How all-Inclusive is God's creative power? John 1:3; Isa.
                     44:24.

                       "The theory that God did not create matter when He brought
                     the world into existence is without foundation. In the formation
                     of our world, God was not indebted to pre-existing matter. On
                     the contrary, all things, material or spiritual, stood up before the
                     Lord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His own
                     purpose."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 258, 259.

Creation    LESSON 2                                                    ❑ Monday
                                                                         January 9


           Part 2     What purpose is to be served by Israel's existence?
    THE PURPOSE
                      "Even every one that is called by my name: for I have
                    created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made
                    him" (Isa. 43:7).

                       Isaiah refers to Israel when he writes, "I have created him for
                    my glory." That is, the people of Israel were to demonstrate the
                    importance of God to those who didn't worship Him. The same
                    God who brought Israel into existence created all people; and
                    for the same purpose. Even in the unfal len society of God's plan
                    where everyone would have worshiped Him, people would have
                    lived to the glory of God. We, too, were created for God's glory.
                    God receives glory whenever we make Him impressive or ad-
                    mirable to another person.
                       "God created man for His own glory, that after test and trial
                    the human family might become one with the heavenly family. it
                    was God's purpose to re-populate heaven with the human fam-
                    ily, if they would show themselves obedient to His every word.
                    Adam was to be tested, to see whether he would be obedient, as
                    the loyal angels, or disobedient. If he stood the test, his instruc-
                    tion to his children would have been only of loyalty. His mind
                    and thoughts would have been as the mind and thoughts of
                    God. He would have been taught by God as His husbandry and
                    building. His character would have been moulded in accor-
                    dance with the character of God."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                    S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1082.

                      What will the person experience who accepts God as his
                    Creator? Ps. 146:5, 6.

                       "Those who abide in Jesus will be happy, cheerful, and joyful
                    in God. A subdued gentleness will mark the voice, reverence for
                    spiritual and eternal things will be expressed in the actions, and
                    music, joyful music, will echo from the lips; for it is wafted from
                    the throne of God. This is the mystery of godliness, not easily
                    explained, but nonetheless felt and enjoyed. A stubborn and
                    rebellious heart can close its doors to all the sweet influences of
                    the grace of God and all the joy in the Holy Ghost; but the ways
                    of wisdom are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
                    peace. The more closely we are connected with Christ, the more
                    will our words and actions show the subduing, transforming
                    power of His grace."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 626.

THINK IT THROUGH     As one of God's created beings, how do I presently give
                    God glory?

                                                                           January 10


             Part 3    What method does the psalmist say God used to bring
       THE METHOD     worlds into existence?
       OF CREATION
                        "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the
                      host of them by the breath of his mouth."
                        "For he spake, and It was done; he commanded, and it stood
                      fast" (Ps. 33:6, 9).

                        "He spake, and it was done. Or simply 'he spoke, and it was,'
                      the word 'done' being supplied; or perhaps better, 'he spoke,
                      and it became."He' is emphatic, as is indicated in the Hebrew by
                      the use of the pronoun; God is set forth as Creator, in sharp
                      contrast with any god that might claim creative ability. The
                      sublimity of the language used to describe the creative acts of
                      God is unsurpassed in literature (see Gen. 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24,
                      26).
                        "Stood fast. Or, 'stood forth,' or simply 'stood,' heightening
                      the sublime simplicity of the synonymous parallelism of this
                      verse."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, pp. 709, 710.

                        What other expression does David use to refer to God's
                      creative act? Ps. 8:3.

                         "In the creation of man was manifest the agency of a personal
                      God. When God had made man in His image, the human form
                      was perfect in all its arrangements, but it was without life. Then
                      a personal, self-existing God breathed into that form the breath
                      of life, and man became a living, breathing, intelligent being. All
                      parts of the human organism were put in action. The heart, the
                      arteries, the veins, the tongue, the hands, the feet, the senses,
                      the perceptions of the mind—all began their work, and all were
                      placed under law. Man became a living soul. Through Jesus
                      Christ a personal God created man and endowed him with
                      intelligence and power."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 264.
                         We do not really know how God did His work. The references
                      to God's fingers and breath in Scripture may be in part sym-
                      bolic. However, the results of His work clearly reveal His great
                      power.

                      know how He will do it?

                      take hold upon it, the life-giving power of Jesus will stimulate

          Part 4     What unit of time has its origin in the creation of the world?
       THE TIME
    OF CREATION      "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it
                   was very good. And the evening and the morning were the
                   sixth day" (Gen. 1:31).
                     "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had
                   made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work
                   which he had made" (Gen. 2:2).

                     "The weekly cycle of seven literal days, six for labor, and the
                   seventh for rest, which has been preserved and brought down
                   through Bible history, originated in the great facts of the first
                   seven days."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 90.

                     What expressions in the Creation account strongly support
                   the literal day interpretation? Gen. 1:5, 8.

                     Moses speaks of the first day, the second day, etc. He talks
                   about the light and the darkness, the night and day, and the
                   evening and the morning. How could he have made his Creation
                   account say more clearly than it does that each day of Creation
                   was a literal day? In Genesis 1 yom is the Hebrew word for day.
                   Throughout the Bible when this word (yom) is used with an
                   ordinal number, as in the first day, the second day, etc., it always
                   designates a 24-hour day.
                     "Geologists and biologists have taught men to believe that
                   this earth's early history covers millions of years, in which the
                   geological formation were slowly taking shape and living
                   species were evolving. Throughout its sacred pages the Bible
                   contradicts this evolution theory. The belief in a divine and
                   instantaneous creation as the result of words spoken by God
                   stands in complete opposition to the theory held by the majority
                   of scientists and many theologians today that the world and all
                   upon it came into being through a slow process of evolution
                   lasting for untold ages."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p.
                   211.
                     Those who believe that the days of Creation are not literal or
                   that the Creation story is mythical or allegorical twist and turn
                   the biblical Creation narrative to make it say something else.
                   Seventh-day Adventists have been given the task of reviving
                   belief in the Sabbath. The observance of the Sabbath provides a
                   weekly reminder that God created the world in six days and
                   rested on the seventh. Belief in a six-day Creation and observ-
                   ance of the seventh-day Sabbath reinforce each other in the
                   believer's mind.

             Part 5     What family relationship was seen in Adam's appearance?
     IN HIS IMAGE
                        "God created man in his own image, In the image of God
                      created he him; male and female created he them" (Gen.
                      1:27).

                         The words "image of God" cover a number of ideas. The most
                      apparent are shown by the context. Man was to relate to his
                      environment as God had related to the earth before its creation,
                      bringing new life and order to the world. The "image of God"
                      then meant that Adam had the ability to do, on his human level,
                      acts that were similar to what God did on His divine level. God
                      created life; man could procreate people. God made an orderly
                      earth system; man could maintain order in the world. God lov-
                      ingly provided for the needs of His creatures; similarly, man
                      could direct his work with a loving purpose.
                         "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance
                      and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' (Hebrews
                      1:3) of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God.
                      His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was
                      capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were
                      pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of
                      reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God and
                      in perfect obedience to His will.
                         "As man came forth from the hand of his Creator, he was of
                      lofty stature and perfect symmetry. His countenance bore the
                      ruddy tint of health and glowed with the light of life and joy.
                      Adam's height was much greater than that of men who now
                      inhabit the earth. Eve was somewhat less in stature; yet her form
                      was noble, and full of beauty."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.45.

THINK IT THROUGH        Although the cumulative effects of sin through the millennia
                      have marred my physical nature, in what ways do I have, or
                      not have, the Image of God?

                         "As the coin [in the parable] bore the image and superscrip-
                      tion of the reigning power, so man at his creation bore the
                      image and superscription of God. Though now marred and dim
                      through the influence of sin, the traces of this inscription re-
                      main upon every soul. God desires to recover that soul and to
                      retrace upon it His own image in righteousness and holiness.
                         "How little do we enter into sympathy with Christ on that
                      which should be the strongest bond of union between us and
                      Him—compassion for depraved, guilty, suffering souls, dead in
                      trespasses and sins! The inhumanity of man toward man is our
                      greatest sin. Many think that they are representing the justice of
                      God while they wholly fail of representing His tenderness and
                      His great love."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 163.

         Part 6      How did the Creator feel about His work of Creation?
   THE RESULTS
                     "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, It
                   was very good. And the evening and the morning were the
                   sixth day" (Gen. 1:31). (See also verses 10, 12, 18, 21, 25.)

                     The creation of the world and its fascinating array of plants
                   and animals, with man the crowning work, were the result of
                   love in action. An artisan finds satisfaction with the results of his
                   creative work. God experienced the same satisfaction when He
                   saw the results of His work. Add to this satisfaction the element
                   of love for a being created in His own image and we get a small
                   glimpse of God's joy when He finished His work.
                      "The hills, mountains, and very beautiful plains, were
                   adorned with plants and flowers, and tall, majestic trees of every
                   description, which were many times larger, and much more
                   beautiful, than trees now are. The air was pure and healthful,
                   and the earth seemed like a noble palace. Angels beheld and
                   rejoiced at the wonderful and beautiful works of God."—

                     "Next to the Bible, nature is to be our great lessonbook. But
                   there is no virtue in deifying nature, for this is exalting the thing

                   and who every hour keeps it operating according to His

                      " 'And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
                   there He put the man whom He had formed.' Everything that
                   God had made was the perfection of beauty, and nothing
                   seemed wanting that could contribute to the happiness of the
                   holy pair; yet the Creator gave them still another token of His
                   love, by preparing a garden especially for their home. In this
                   garden were trees of every variety, many of them laden with
                   fragrant and delicious fruit. There were lovely vines, growing
                   upright, yet presenting a most graceful appearance, with their
                   branches drooping under their load of tempting fruit of the
                   richest and most varied hues."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp.

            Part 1     Through whom did God do the work of creation?
     OWNERSHIP OF
       THE WORLD       "By him [the Son] were all things created, that are in heaven,
                     and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
                     thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things
                     were created by him, and for him" (Col. 1:16).

                       How Inclusive is Jesus' work of creation? Col. 1:17.

                        "Four things are here asserted: 1. That Jesus Christ is the
                     Creator of the universe; of all things visible and invisible; of all
                      things that had a beginning, whether they exist in time or in
                     eternity. 2. That whatsoever was created was created for him-
                     self; that he was the sole end of his own work. 3. That he was
                     prior to all creation, to all beings, whether in the visible or
                     invisible world. 4. That he is the preserver and governor of all
                     things; for by him all things consist.
                        "Now, allowing St. Paul to have understood the terms which he
                     used, he must have considered Jesus Christ as being truly and
                     properly God."—Adam Clarke, Commentary, on Col. 1:16, 17.

                       Of what does God claim ownership? Ps. 50:1, 10-12.

                        The context of this passage gives the meaning that God does
                     not need Israel's sacrifices because everything belongs to Him
                     already. Why is it His? He made it.
                        A maker owns his product unless he gives or sells it to
                     another. God never relinquished ownership of the world, even
                     though Satan wrested the dominion from Adam. After centuries
                     of sin, the psalmist still wrote, "The earth is the Lord's, and the
                     fulness thereof" (Ps. 24:1).
                        In creating, God has no competitor, and He alone retains the
                     rights of ownership.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what way does a person belong to God? In what way does
                     he not belong?

                        "Our first duty toward God and our fellow beings is that of
                     self-development. Every faculty with which the Creator has en-
                     dowed us should be cultivated to the highest degree of perfec-
                     tion, that we may be able to do the greatest amount of good of
                     which we are capable. Hence that time is spent to good account
                     which is directed to the establishment and preservation of
                     sound physical and mental health.
                        "Man is God's workmanship, His masterpiece, created for a
                     high and holy purpose; and on every part of the human taberna-
                     cle God desires to write His law. . . . Every nerve and muscle,

           Part 2     What jealous desire did Lucifer develop?
      OWNERSHIP
      CONTENDED       "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
                    the most High" (Isa. 14:14).

                       "Before the fall of Satan, the Father consulted his Son in
                    regard to the formation of man. They purposed to make this
                    world, and create beasts and living things upon it, and to make
                    man in the image of God, to reign as a ruling monarch over every
                    living thing which God should create. When Satan learned the
                    purpose of God, he was envious at Christ, and jealous because
                    the Father had not consulted him in regard to the creation of
                    man."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 36.
                       Why was it impossible for Lucifer to become like God? Be-
                    cause Lucifer was a created being, he could not become like the
                    Most High who is Creator. (See Eze. 28:15.)
                       "Little by little Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-
                    exaltation. The Scripture says, 'Thine heart was lifted up be-
                    cause of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason
                    of thy brightness." Ezekiel 28:17. 'Thou hast said in thine heart,
                    ... I will exalt my throne above the stars of God....1 will be like
                    the most High.' Isaiah 14:13, 14."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                    p. 35.
                       Man has never faced a situation where an object that he has
                    made challenges him, the maker. Even the computer, despite
                    science fiction, will never challenge man because it is merely
                    the lifeless result (although efficient and useful) of man's crea-
                    tive design. God, however, now faces this problem unknown to
                    man—the creature challenging the Creator. Lucifer, a created
                    being, has challenged his Creator. All humans who refuse to
                    acknowledge God as their Creator challenge Him also.

                      With whom did Satan appear before God? Job. 1:6, 7. What
                    did he do there? Verses 9-11.

                      "After tempting man to sin, Satan claimed the earth as his,
                    and styled himself the prince of this world. Having conformed to
                    his own nature the father and mother of our race, he thought to
                    establish here his empire. He declared that men had chosen him
                    as their sovereign. Through his control of men, he held domin-
                    ion over the world."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 114, 115.

THINK IT THROUGH      Does my life confirm or deny Satan's contention that he had
                    the right to represent the earth in the council of heaven? How?

     THE SPIRITUAL    blood" warriors?
     CONTROVERSY
                         "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
                      stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against
                      flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
                      against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
                      spiritual wickedness in high places" (Eph. 6:11, 12).

                        "There is a grand rebellion in the earthly universe. Is there not
                      a great leader of that rebellion? Is not Satan the life and soul of
                      every species of rebellion which he himself has instigated? Is he
                      not the first great apostate from God? A rebellion exists. Lucifer
                      revolted from his allegiance and makes war on the divine gov-
                      ernment. Christ is appointed to put down the rebellion. He
                      makes this world His battlefield."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                        What example shows the influence on character and
                      spirituality when Satan is not resisted? John 13:2.

                        "But Judas did not walk in the light so graciously permitted to
                      shine upon him. By indulgence in sin he invited the temptations
                      of Satan. His evil traits of character became predominant. He
                      yielded his mind to the control of the powers of darkness, he
                      became angry when his faults were reproved, and thus he was
                      led to commit the fearful crime of betraying his Master. So do all
                      who cherish evil under a profession of godliness hate those who
                      disturb their peace by condemning their course of sin. When a
                      favorable opportunity is presented, they will, like Judas, betray
                      those who for their good have sought to reprove them."—The

                        What illustration of the great controversy does Zechariah
                      provide? Zech. 3:1, 2.

THINK IT THROUGH         Am I a brand in the fire, or am I a "brand plucked out of the
                      fire"? Where do I stand in the controversy? How do I know?

                         "In a vision given in 1880Iasked, 'Where is the security for the
                      people of God in these days of peril?' The answer was, 'Jesus
                      maketh intercession for His people, though Satan standeth at
                      His right hand to resist Him.' . . . As man's Intercessor and
                      Advocate, Jesus will lead all who are willing to be led, saying,
                      'Follow Me upward, step by step, where the clear light of the Sun
                      of Righteousness shines.' "—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 465.

          Part 4     What have been the results of sin on the whole creation?
   THE PHYSICAL
   CONTROVERSY       "We know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
                   pain together until now" (Rom. 8:22).

                      As soon as Adam and Eve sinned, Satan began to destroy
                   God's creation. Nature had reflected only love and tenderness.
                   Now hostility and harshness began to be manifest in nature.
                   Thus nature no longer exhibited God's perfect character. It
                   became a mixture of love and hate, a symbol of the controversy
                   waging beyond the sight and hearing of earth's people.
                      "Although we cannot explain all the details seen in what
                   appear to be changes resulting from sin, we do know that there
                   are, throughout nature, two conflicting forces, one tending
                   toward beauty and perfection and the other toward degenera-
                   tion and death. It is Satan's desire to bring discredit upon the
                   Creator, to cause discomfort to man, and to support his coun-
                   terfeit of the creation story by working through the laws of
                   genetics to bring about thorns on roses, stingers on nettles,
                   parasites, predators, and the host of other ugly and degenera-
                   tive changes. The Creator, on the other hand, has given plants
                   and animals the capacity to adapt to the crisis brought on by sin,
                   thus counteracting in part the power of the great destroyer."—
                   Harold G. Coffin, Creation: Accident or Design, p. 365.

                     What were the physical effects of the great controversy
                   upon Job? Job. 2:7.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do I complain about the thorns, or do I enjoy the roses?

                      "The same God who guides the planets works in the fruit
                   orchard and in the vegetable garden. He never made a thorn, a
                   thistle, or a tare. These are Satan's work, the result of degenera-
                   tion, introduced by him among the precious things; but it is
                   through God's immediate agency that every bud bursts into
                   blossom."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 186.
                      "Through the agencies of nature, God is working, day by day,
                   hour by hour, moment by moment, to keep us alive, to build up
                   and restore us.... But the power working through these agen-

          Part 5   In exchange for "all the kingdoms of the world" what did
     CONTROVERSY Satan ask of Jesus?
           OVER
        WORSHIP    "The devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed
                 unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
                 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and
                 the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whom-
                 soever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall
                 be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee
                 behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord
                 thy God, and him only shalt thou serve" (Luke 4:5-8).

                        Why does worship belong to God alone? Rev. 14:7; 4:11.

                       "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the
                     Creator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence.
                     And wherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship,
                     above the gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the
                     evidence of His creative power. 'All the gods of the nations are
                     idols: but the Lord made the heavens.' Psalm 96:5. 'To whom
                     then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift
                     up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
                     things.' Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God
                     himself that formed the earth and made it:... I am the Lord; and
                     there is none else.' Isaiah 40:25, 26; 45:18. Says the psalmist:
                     'Know ye that the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us, and
                     not we ourselves.' 0 come, let us worship and bow down: let us
                     kneel before the Lord our Maker.' Psalms 100:3; 95:6. And the
                     holy beings who worship God in heaven state, as the reason why
                     their homage is due to Him: 'Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive
                     glory and honor and power: for Thou hast created all things.'
                     Revelation 4:11."—The Great Controversy, pp. 436, 437.
                       If Christ had succumbed to this temptation as a quick way to
                     settle the question of sovereignty of this world, He would have
                     acknowledged by His act that someone other than the Creator
                     should rule the world and be entitled to worship. How grateful
                     we should be that the great controversy was not settled in this
                     way.
                       "The true ground of divine worship, not of that on the seventh
                     day merely, but of all worship, is found in the distinction be-
                     tween the Creator and His creatures. This great fact can never
                     become obsolete, and must never be forgotten."—J. N. An-

                                                                        January 20


           Part 6     What is the relation of God to earthly governments?
    THE ISSUE OF
    SOVEREIGNTY        "This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the
                    demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the
                    living may know that the most High ruleth In the kingdom of
                    men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over
                    It the basest of men" (Dan. 4:17).

                       Whether people recognize it or not, God is the Supreme
                    Power in this world. His sovereignty rests on who He is, what He
                    knows, and what He can do. The Bible identifies Him as the
                    original Person of the universe who has never been equaled by
                    any later person. (See Isa. 44:6-8.) His knowledge is such that He
                    sees the future (Isa. 42:9) and the results of any course of action.
                    He possesses power that makes any action possible to Him.
                    With that kind of Person any other ruler must rule only at His
                    discretion.
                       "In the affairs of nations God is ever 'silently, patiently work-
                    ing out the counsels of His own will' (Ed. 173). At times, as with
                    the call of Abraham, He ordains a series of events designed to
                    demonstrate the wisdom of His ways. Again, as in the antedilu-
                    vian world, He permits evil to run its course and provide an
                    example of the folly of opposition to right principles. But even-
                    tually, as in the deliverance of the Hebrewsfrom Egypt, He inter-
                    venes lest the forces of evil overcome His agencies for the salva-
                    tion of the world."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 790.

                      What sovereignty is attributed to Jesus by Paul? Col. 2:9,10.

                       "Paul is here again emphasizing that Christ is the head of all
                    power and authority. His sovereign strength is the fountain of
                    life. The apostle's implication is that through Christ's dwelling
                    in us, the same victorious authority and creative power will
                    enable us to triumph."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
                    202.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways Is, or Is not, the Lord God first and last, King
                    In my life?
                      "With the sovereignty of God is bound up the well-being of
                    man. The glory of God is the joy and the blessing of all created
                    beings. When we seek to promote His glory we are seeking for
                    ourselves the highest good which it is possible for us to receive.
                    Brethren and sisters in Christ, God calls for the consecration to
                    His service of every faculty, of every gift, you have received from
                    Him. He wants you to say, with David: 'All things come of Thee,
                    and of Thine own have we given Thee.' "—Testimonies, vol. 5,13.

           Part 1     How was the seventh day of Creation Week different from
     THE SABBATH    the previous six days?
     ESTABLISHED
                      "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the
                    host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work
                    which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all
                    his work which he had made" (Gen. 2:1, 2).

                       "God ended ... ; and he rested." The seventh day of Creation
                    Week marked the end of a process that had taken six days to
                    complete. Yet the week is not complete without the seventh day
                    in which God rests. God had made all things good, and now He
                    caps them with an institution that is to be a blessing to all and a
                    memorial of Creation. God rests, not because He is tired, obvi-
                    ously, but because He considers it important for all His created
                    beings to rest after a period of endeavor. This is more than a
                    pause that refreshes. It is a pause that recognizes the Creator
                    and His plan and purpose to do all things well for the sake of
                    man who was created in His image and would soon take on
                    dominion over all the earth.

                      How does the writer to the Hebrews confirm the historicity of
                    the Genesis account of God's resting on the Sabbath? Heb.
                    4:4.

                      The seven-day week owes its origin to the week of Creation.
                    Other divisions of the calendar are related to the motions of the
                    moon around the earth or of the earth around the sun. But the
                    week is not related to any physical phenomena around the
                    planet. The cycle of six days of work followed by the seventh day
                    of rest is the result of an example set by God Himself.
                      References to the Sabbath in the New Testament indicate an
                    acceptance of the historicity of the accounts of Genesis regard-
                    ing Creation and the Sabbath.

THINK IT THROUGH      Show how resting on the Sabbath does not mean ceasing
                    from all kinds of activity.

                       "The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactiv-
                    ity. The law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the
                    toil that gains a livelihood must cease; no labor for worldly
                    pleasure or profit is lawful upon that day; but as God ceased His
                    labor of creating, and rested upon the Sabbath and blessed it,
                    so man is to leave the occupations of his daily life, and devote
                    those sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and to holy

                    (Eze. 20:20).

                      To hallow a day is to set it apart for a holy use. This means that
                    the normal activities of the week can be gladly laid aside on the
                    Sabbath. After six days' work to earn a living, we gratefully make
                    ourselves available on the seventh day for those activities that
                    are related to worship and doing good. We joyfully find our-
                    selves in harmony with the Genesis record and walk in the
                    footsteps of Jesus and His disciples, who kept the Sabbath holy.
                      "By keeping His Sabbath holy we are to show that we are His
                    people. His Word declares the Sabbath to be a sign by which to
                    distinguish the commandment-keeping people. Thus God's
                    people are to preserve among them a knowledge of Him as their
                    Creator. Those who keep the law of God will be one with Him in
                    the great controversy commenced in heaven between Satan
                    and God. Disloyalty to God means contention and strife against
                    the principles of God's law."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p.160.

                      What reason does the fourth commandment give for keep-
                    ing the Sabbath? Ex. 20:11.

                      Man is to keep the Sabbath because God in the very begin-
                    ning set apart the seventh day as a day of holiness and blessing.
                    To neglect the Sabbath is to deny the authority of God in the first
                    instance and to reject an order that God has clearly laid down.
                      The seventh-day Sabbath, coming as it does once every week,
                    reminds us regularly that our God is a great God, the Creator.
                    When the first day of the week, which was not a memorial of
                    Creation, was substituted for the seventh-day Sabbath, man no
                    longer was reminded that his God is Creator. As a result, or-
                    ganic evolution, a basic tenet of modern philosophy, became
                    established eventually. If man had always kept the seventh-day
                    Sabbath, there would not now be prevalent in society this de-
                    grading belief that eliminates the Creator.

                      What knowledge about God brought forth praise and wor-
                    ship from David? 1 Chron. 29:11.

 THINK IT THROUGH    How does my worship of God become more meaningful
                    when I am reminded each Sabbath that He is Creator?

               Part 3      For what reason do the hosts of heaven worship God?
           THE BASIS
         OF WORSHIP       "Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou Nast made heaven,
                        the heaven of heavens, with all their hosts, the earth, and all
                        things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and
                        thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth
                        thee" (Neh. 9:6).

                           It is noteworthy that, of all the created beings in heaven and
                        earth, only man dares to ignore the source of all being. All other
                        creatures worship and praise Him, animate and inanimate, rec-
                        ognizing His sovereignty and power. (See Psalm 148.) Can you
                        explain this situation?
                           Man, created in the image of God, should be the first to bow
                        down before the Creator and acknowledge His greatness. Week
                        after week, as he comes to the Sabbath, he should be reminded
                        of the One who spoke everything into existence. In grateful
                        acknowledgement he should bow down and worship.

                          What admonition does the psalmist give because God is
                        Creator? Ps. 95:1-6.

                          The sovereignty of God is evident in His created works. When
                        we look at mountains with their mass and height, when we look
                        at the sea with its depths and turbulence, when we look at the
                        stars and recognize the vast distances between them, we can-
                        not help bowing down before the majesty of One who, not only
                        brought them into being, but upholds and controls them from
                        day to day.

THINK IT THROUGH          What are the objects that claim our attention from day to
                        day? How can one make sure that he is worshiping the Crea-
                        tor rather than the creatures?

                           "God's claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the
                        heathen, is based upon the fact that He is the Creator, and that
                        to Him all other beings owe their existence.... The Sabbath, as a
                        memorial of God's creative power, points to Him as the maker of
                        the heavens and the earth. Hence it is a constant witness to His
                        existence and a reminder of His greatness, His wisdom, and His
                        love. Had the Sabbath always been sacredly observed, there
                        could never have been an atheist or an idolater."—Patriarchs

The Sabbath—A Memorial of Creation               LESSON 4 ❑ Wednesday
                                                            January 25


          Part 4   How does Jeremiah describe those who worship idols
     A BULWARK rather than the Creator?
        AGAINST
         ERROR      "Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is
                 confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
                 falsehood, and there is no breath in them. They are vanity, and
                 the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall
                 perish. The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the
                 former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance:
                 The Lord of hosts is his name" (Jer. 10:14-16).

                      The Sabbath is not only a memorial of Creation; it is a bulwark
                   against error. So long as we keep the Sabbath, so long are we
                   saved from adopting any teaching that denies the truth of Crea-
                   tion as we have it recorded in Genesis 1 and 2. It also points to
                   the Creator as the only true object of worship.
                      For the word "brutish" in the above text the R.S.V. uses the
                   word "stupid." It is utter stupidity to turn-to idols and worship
                   them when they are lifeless and worthless, helpless and a work
                   of vanity.
                      " The true ground of divine worship, not of that on the
                   seventh day merely, but of all worship, is found in the distinction
                   between the Creator and His creatures. This great fact can never
                   become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.' —J. N. An-
                   drews, History of the Sabbath, chapter 27. It was to keep this
                   truth ever before the minds of men, that God instituted the
                   Sabbath in Eden; and so long as the fact that He is our Creator
                   continues to be a reason why we should worship Him, so long
                   the Sabbath will continue as its sign and memorial. Had the
                   Sabbath been universally kept, man's thoughts and affections
                   would have been led to the Creator as the object of reverence
                   and worship, and there would never have been an idolater, an
                   atheist, or an infidel. The keeping of the Sabbath is a sign of
                   loyalty to the true God, 'Him that made heaven, and earth, and
                   the sea, and the fountains of waters.' "—The Great Controversy,
                   pp. 437, 438.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does Sabbath observance keep me from idolatry? Is
                   evolution a form of idolatry?

                      "The Sabbath and the family were alike instituted in Eden,
                   and in. God's purpose they are indissolubly linked together. On
                   this day more than on any other, it is possible for us to live the
                   life of Eden. . . . In His own day He preserves for the family
                   opportunity for communion with Him, with nature, and with one
                   another."—Education, pp. 250, 251.

The Sabbath-A Memorial of Creation                   LESSON 4          ❑ Thursday
                                                                        January 26


            Part 5     What great truth do the 24 elders assert regarding God?
           GOD IS
         CREATOR       "Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and
                     power: for thou hest created all things, and for thy pleasure
                     they are and were created" (Rev. 4:11).

                         It is because God is before all things, the originator and
                     upholder of all things, that He is the object of worship. Although
                     many Christian people today believe that God is Creator, they
                     limit His creative power. They may feel that He was responsible
                     for the formation of the original spark of life but that He allowed
                     it to develop by the process of evolution. What the world really
                     needs to know today is that God created man, not by a long
                     process of evolution, but in a moment of time, and He is able to
                     re-create him. Only this kind of God can save us from sin and
                     give us hope for the future.

                       What Bible evidence is there that the earth is not a con-
                     stantly evolving entity? Gen. 2:1, 2.

                        "As regards this earth, Scripture declares the work of crea-
                     tion to have been completed. 'The works were finished from the
                     foundation of the world.' Hebrews 4:3. But the power of God is
                     still exercised in upholding the objects of His creation. It is not
                     because the mechanism once set in motion continues to act by
                     its own inherent energy that the pulse beats, and breath follows
                     breath. Every breath, every pulsation of the heart, is an evidence
                     of the care of Him in whom we live and move and have our being.
                     From the smallest insect to man, every living creature is daily
                     dependent upon His providence."—Education, pp. 130-131.

THINK IT THROUGH       How far away Is God from each one of us? What are the evi-
                     dences of His presence? (See Acts 17:27-30.)

                        "If we will but listen, God's created works will teach us pre-
                     cious lessons of obedience and trust. From the stars that in their
                     trackless courses through space follow from age to age their
                     appointed path, down to the minutest atom, the things of nature
                     obey the Creator's will. And God cares for everything and sus-
                     tains everything that He has created. He who upholds the un-
                     numbered worlds throughout immensity, at the same time cares
                     for the wants of the little brown sparrow that sings its humble
                     song without fear."—Steps to Christ, pp. 85, 86.

                                                                        January 27


          Part 6     What is God's plan concerning the observance of Sabbath
     A SABBATH     in the future?
   FOR ETERNITY
                     "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will
                   make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your
                   seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that
                   from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to
                   another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the
                   Lord" (Isa. 66:22, 23).

                     Just as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was not
                   merely a tree, but was a symbol of the recognition of God's love
                   and authority, so the Sabbath is not only a period of time; it is a
                   symbol of a covenant relationship between the Creator, who
                   rested and blessed, and man made in the image of God, who
                   also rests and blesses. When man ignores the Sabbath by delib-
                   erately rejecting its God-given role, he is virtually rejecting the
                   authority of God and repudiating a loving relationship the Sab-
                   bath is intended to establish.
                     Since the loving relationship between God and His people is
                   intended to last forever, it is not surprising that the Sabbath
                   institution should last forever.

                     What will be a characteristic of those who live in the time of
                   the Lord's coming? Rev. 14:12.

THINK IT THROUGH     What do you envisage will be the activities of the Sabbath
                   in the earth made new?

                     "Now [while in Joseph's tomb] Jesus rested from the work of
                   redemption; and though there was grief among those who
                   loved Him on earth, yet there was joy in heaven. Glorious to the
                   eyes of heavenly beings was the promise of the future. A re-
                   stored creation, a redeemed race, that having conquered sin
                   could never fall,—this, the result to flow from Christ's com-
                   pleted work, God and angels saw. With this scene the day upon
                   which Jesus rested is forever linked. For 'His work is perfect;'
                   and 'whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever.' Deut. 32:4; Eccl.
                   3:14. When there shall be a 'restitution of all things, which God
                   hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the
                   world began' (Acts 3:21), the creation Sabbath, the day on
                   which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph's tomb, will still be a day of rest
                   and rejoicing."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 769, 770.

                     the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep,
                     things continue as they were from the beginning of the cres'
                     tion" (2 Peter 3:3, 4).

                        Scoffers are those who reject the predictions of the prophets
                     and the message of Jesus (2 Peter 3:2). They cannot envisage a
                     day when the end will come and Jesus will be seen in the clouds
                     of heaven (verse 4). The basis of their rejection is the supposi-
                     tion that if things have operated a certain way for a number of
                     years, there is no reason to suppose any change will take place.
                     They will even project this continuity into the past, and thereby
                     set up a principle of uniformity by which they seek to explain all
                     aspects of the universe.
                        The rule of uniformity has been used by geologists to inter-
                     pret the past. According to them, past geological processes can
                     be understood by examining the present. Uniformity is based on
                     the maxim "the present is the key to the past." Because the
                     theory of evolution requires much time to account for change,
                     and because the principle of uniformity provides the concept of
                     aeons of time, uniformity has become the interpretive tool for
                     evolutionists.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why do you accept the biblical account of history rather
                     than the concepts and theories of man?

                        "I have been shown that without Bible history, geology can
                     prove nothing. Relics found in the earth do give evidence of a
                     state of things differing in many respects from the present. But
                     the time of their existence, and how long a period these things
                     have been in the earth, are only to be understood by Bible
                     history. It may be innocent to conjecture beyond Bible history, if
                     our suppositions do not contradict the facts found in the sa-
                     cred Scriptures. But when men leave the word of God in regard
                     to the history of creation, and seek to account for God's creative
                     works upon natural principles, they are upon a boundless
                     ocean of uncertainty. Just how God accomplished the work of
                     creation in six literal days he has never revealed to mortals."—

Uniformity or Catastrophe?          LESSON 5                          ❑   Monday
                                                                       January 30


         Part 2  What catastrophic event does the apostle Peter look for-
    CATASTROPHE ward to?

                     "Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,
                   wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the
                   elements shall melt with fervent heat" (2 Peter 3:12).

                      In contrast to the uniformitarian belief, catastrophism claims
                   that unnatural events have occurred in the past. These geologi-
                   cal events cannot be understood by examining the modern
                   world—except as the observations are related to the study of
                   the Scriptures. The Bible contains the only accurate account of
                   Creation and the Flood (as portrayed in vision to Moses who
                   recorded them in Genesis). Accurate accounts of future un-
                   natural events (conveyed in the same way to prophets in both
                   the Old and New Testaments) have also been recorded for our
                   warning and admonition.
                      "That voice shakes the heavens and the earth. There is a
                   mighty earthquake, 'such as was not since men were upon the
                   earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.' Rev. 16:17, 18.
                   The firmament appears to open and shut. The glory from the
                   throne of God seems flashing through. The mountains shake
                   like a reed in the wind, and ragged rocks are scattered on every
                   side. There is a roar as of a coming tempest. The sea is lashed
                   into fury. There is heard the shriek of the hurricane like the voice
                   of demons upon a mission of destruction. The whole earth
                   heaves and swells like the waves of the sea. Its surface is break-
                   ing up. Its very foundations seem to be giving way. Mountain
                   chains are sinking. Inhabited islands disappear. The seaports
                   that have become like Sodom for wickedness are swallowed up
                   by the angry waters."—The Great Controversy, pp. 636, 637.

                      In contrast to the Genesis Flood, what will cause destruc-
                   tion on the earth at Christ's second coming? 2 Peter 3:12;
                   2 Thess. 1:8.

THINK IT THROUGH    What confidence can the Christian place in God and His
                   Word? (See Psalm 91.)

                      "A marvelous change has come over those who have held fast
                   their integrity in the very face of death. They have been suddenly
                   delivered from the dark and terrible tyranny of men transformed
                   to demons. Their faces, so lately pale, anxious, and haggard, are
                   now aglow with wonder, faith, and love. Their voices rise in
                   triumphant song: 'God is our refuge and strength, a very pres-
                   ent help in trouble.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 639.

Uniformity or Catastrophe?           LESSON 5                         ❑ Tuesday
                                                                       January 31


          Part 3     What does the apostle Peter point to as an example of an
       CREATION    unnatural (nonuniform) event which contradicts the claim of
                   the scoffers? Why do they disbelieve in Creation?

                     "In taking this view they lose sight of the fact that there were
                   heavens and earth long ago, created by God's word out of
                   water and with water" (2 Peter 3:5, N.E.B.).

                      "There is a constant effort made to explain the work of crea-
                   tion as the result of natural causes; and human reasoning is
                   accepted even by professed Christians, in opposition to plain
                   Scripture facts. There are many who oppose the investigation of
                   the prophecies, especially those of Daniel and the Revelation,
                   declaring them to be so obscure that we cannot understand
                   them; yet these•very persons eagerly receive the suppositions of
                   geologists, in contradiction of the Mosaic record. But if that
                   which God has revealed is so difficult to understand, how in-
                   consistent it is to accept mere suppositions in regard to that
                   which He has not revealed!"—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 113.

                      "The sophistry in regard to the world being created in an
                   indefinite period of time is one of Satan's falsehoods. God
                   speaks to the human family in language they can comprehend.
                   He does not leave the matter so indefinite that human beings
                   can handle it according to their theories."—Ellen G. White,
                   Letter 31, 1898.
                      To be a creationist or an evolutionist is a matter of faith, since
                   neither can be proved true. To be a creationist is to have faith in
                   the creation account of origins, in a Creator God and in the
                   inspiration of Scripture. To be an evolutionist is to have faith in
                   the evolutionary account of origins, in the accuracy of the scien-
                   tists' interpretation of data, and in the ability of life to arise,
                   unaided by intelligence, from lifelessness.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can you be saved from delusions that come upon the
                   earth in the last days?

                     "The Christian is required to be diligent in searching the
                   Scriptures, to read over and over again the truths of God's word.
                   Willful ignorance on this subject endangers the Christian life
                   and character. It blinds the understanding and corrupts the
                   noblest powers. It is this that brings confusion into our lives.
                   Our people need to understand the oracles of God; they need to
                   have a systematic knowledge of the principles of revealed truth,
                   which will fit them for what is coming upon the earth and
                   prevent them from being carried about by every wind of
                   doctrine."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 273.

Uniformity or Catastrophe?          LESSON 5                    ❑     Wednesday
                                                                      February 1


          Part 4  As a second example, what did the apostle Peter point to as
      THE FLOOD an example of catastrophism?

                    "Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with
                   water, perished" (2 Peter 3:6).

                      The Genesis Flood had a profound effect on the surface of the
                   earth and is the key to understanding geology. Most of the
                   characteristics of the crust of the earth, the thick beds of sedi-
                   ments, their fossil contents, and the strong marks of erosion
                   came about through the action of flood waters.
                      -Geologists claim to find evidence from the earth itself that it
                   is very much older than the Mosaic record teaches. . . .
                      "   In the history of the Flood, inspiration has explained that
                   which geology alone could never fathom."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 112.

                    What did Jesus point to as an example of catastrophe?
                   Matt. 24:37-39.

                     What future event, similar to the Flood, will surprise those
                   unprepared? Matt. 24:39, last part.

                      "The solemn fact is to be kept not only before the people of
                   the world, but before our own churches also, that the day of the
                   Lord will come suddenly, unexpectedly. The fearful warning of
                   the prophecy is addressed to every soul. Let no one feel that he
                   is secure from the danger of being surprised. Let no one's
                   interpretation of prophecy rob you of the conviction of the
                   knowledge of events which show that this great event is near at
                   hand."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 336.

THINK IT THROUGH     What evidences do you have that God's word is safer to rely
                   on than the prognostications of scientists?

                      "In Noah's day philosophers declared that it was impossible
                   for the world to be destroyed by water; so now there are men of
                   science who endeavor to show that the world cannot be de-
                   stroyed by fire—that this would be inconsistent with the laws of
                   nature. But the God of nature, the Maker and Controller of her
                   laws, can use the works of His hands to serve His own purpose.
                      "When great and wise men had proved to their satisfaction
                   that it was impossible for the world to be destroyed by water,
                   when the fears of the people were quieted, when all regarded
                   Noah's prophecy as a delusion, and looked upon him as a
                   fanatic—then it was that God's time had come."—Patriarchs

           Part 5     What third example does Peter use against the uniformi-
       A TIME OF    tarian arguments of the scoffers?
      JUDGMENT
                      "The heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same
                    word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
                    judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
                      "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
                    the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
                    the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
                    the works that are therein shall be burned up" (2 Peter 3:7,10).

                       "When the reasoning of philosophy has banished the fear of
                    God's judgments; when religious teachers are pointing forward
                    to long ages of peace and prosperity, and the world are ab-
                    sorbed in their rounds of business and pleasure, planting and
                    building, feasting and merrymaking, rejecting God's warnings
                    and mocking His messengers—then it is that sudden destruc-
                    tion cometh upon them, and they shall not escape."—
                    Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 104.

                      What power involved in creation of the earth Is now preserv-
                    ing and maintaining the earth until the time of Judgment?
                    2 Peter 3:5, 7.

                      The day of judgment referred to in verse 7 could refer to either
                    the second coming of Christ or the time of judgment at the end
                    of the millennium. The context suggests that Peter is thinking
                    mostly of the second coming.

                      What are some of the expressions of catastrophe Peter
                    uses in describing the "day of judgment"? Verses 10, 12.

THINK IT THROUGH      Peter poses this searching question: "Seeing then that all
                    these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons
                    ought ye to be?" What does this really mean to me?

                       "When the divine Presence was manifested upon Sinai, the
                    glory of the Lord was like devouring fire in the sight of all Israel.
                    But when Christ shall come in glory with His holy angels the
                    whole earth shall be ablaze with the terrible light of His pres-
                    ence. 'Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire
                    shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
                    about Him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the
                    earth, that He may judge His people.' Psalm 50:3, 4. A fiery
                    stream shall issue and come forth from before Him, which shall
                    cause the elements to melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and

                      In verse 5 we noticed that God's word created the earth. In
                    verse 7, that word preserves the earth. The same word promises
                    new heavens and new earth. We have every reason to believe
                    God can and will keep that promise.

                    heavenly home—that world of beauty which no artist can pic-

             Part 1      What is a danger religious people often face?
         DOCTRINES
           OF MEN       "In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
                      commandments of men" (Matt. 15:9).

                        It is not the religiously indifferent or the secular minded who
                      face the danger of replacing the teachings of the Bible with
                      human theories; it is those who recognize the importance of
                      religion in their lives and have a form of godliness, yet fail to
                      exercise what religion really means. They follow the outward
                      forms, but their hearts are not in their worship. (See Matt. 15:8.)

                         Where does the Christian find his supreme authority and the
                      light of truth? Ps. 119:105.

                         "The Bible is the most instructive and comprehensive history
                      that has ever been given to the world. Its sacred pages contain
                      the only authentic account of the creation. Here we behold the
                      power that 'stretched forth the heavens, and laid the founda-
                      tions of the earth.' Here we have a truthful history of the human
                      race, one that is unmarred by human prejudice or human
                      pride."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 84, 85.

                        What was the attitude of Jesus to the Scriptures? Matt.
                      5:17, 18.

                        Give examples to show how Jesus accepted the truth and
                      accuracy of the Scriptures as to:
                        (a) the historicity of Jonah (Matt. 12:40)
                        (b) the creation of man (Matt. 19:4)
                        It is obvious that Jesus did not look upon the Old Testament
                      as a collection of fables.

THINK IT THROUGH        What should the Christian do when he finds a conflict be-
                      tween the teachings of the Bible and the so-called findings
                      of science?

                         "In true science there can be nothing contrary to the teaching
                      of the word of God, for both have the same Author. A correct
                      understanding of both will always prove them to be in harmony.
                      Truth, whether in nature or in revelation, is harmonious with
                      itself in all its manifestations."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 258.

                                                                         February 6


        Part 2   What does Paul say is obvious to the one who studies
    WORSHIPING nature?
       NATURE
                 "The invisible things of him from the creation of the world
               are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
               made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
               without excuse" (Rom. 1:20).

                      It is illogical to suppose that the world around us is self-
                   originating or self-perpetuating. Behind nature is nature's God,
                   the One who made "heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all
                   things that are therein" (Acts 14:15).
                      There are phenomena in nature that are frightening—
                   earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions. You can think of
                   others. But there are also aspects of nature that are very beauti-
                   ful: the mountain peak with its cap of snow, the stream gurgling
                   its way to the valley below, the sunset glow, and others. Im-
                   pressed with these things, some people have glorified nature
                   and worshiped it. But we need to look beyond nature to the One
                   who controls everything by His mighty hand.
                      Study the following phenomena of nature that have accom-
                   panied God's activity:
                      (a) The Flood (Genesis 7 and 8). How far was this the work of
                   nature, if at all?
                      (b) Sinai (Ex. 19:18). Do you think that a realization of the
                   power of God in nature can lead to a healthy regard and respect
                   for God? Why is this so?
                      (c) The crucifixion and resurrection (Matt. 27:51; 28:2).
                       "If the soldiers at the sepulcher were so filled with terror at the
                   appearance of one angel clothed with heavenly light and
                    strength, that they fell as dead men to the ground, how will His
                   enemies stand before the Son of God, when He comes in power
                    and great glory, accompanied by ten thousand times ten
                   thousand and thousands of thousands of angels from the
                    courts of heaven? Then the earth shall reel to and fro like a
                    drunkard, and be removed as a cottage."—Ellen G. White

             Part 3      What warning did Moses give to Israel?
        FORGETTING
              GOD       "Beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth
                      out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage" (Deut.
                      6:12).

                        It was prosperity that Moses warned would lead the people to
                      forget God. (See verses 10, 11.)
                        "There are many whose hearts have been so hardened by
                      prosperity that they forget God, and forget the wants of their
                      fellow-men.... Men and women who claim redemption through
                      a Saviour's blood will squander the means intrusted to them for
                      the saving of other souls, and then grudging dole out their
                      offerings for religion, giving liberally only when it will bring
                      honor to themselves. These are idolaters."—Sons and

                        What question did the Lord ask about Judah's relation to
                      Him? Isa. 51:12, 13.

                         Judah experienced the fear of man when they forgot God
                      their Creator. If God made them and the world they lived in, why
                      should they be afraid of an oppressor?
                         When our thoughts are filled with fear of what people will do
                      to us, or fear of some other possible harm, then the mind is
                      directed away from God.
                         "Our minds must be stayed upon God, and we must not fear
                      the fear of the wicked, that is, fear what they fear, and reverence
                      what they reverence, but be bold and valiant for the truth. Could
                      our eyes be opened, we should see forms of evil angels around
                      us, trying to invent some new way to annoy and destroy us. And
                      we should also see angels of God guarding us from their power:
                      for God's watchful eye is ever over Israel for good, and He will
                      protect and save His people, if they put their trust in Him. When
                      the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift
                      up a standard against him."— Early Writings, p. 60.

                      accountability to Him as their Creator and their Redeemer.
                      While they should keep the Sabbath in the proper spirit, idolatry
                      could not exist; but should the claims of this precept of the

                                                                      February 8


           Part 4     How does the apostle Paul describe the origin of sin?
      THE DENIAL
          OF SIN      "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
                    death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all
                    have sinned" (Rom. 5:12).

                      Paul did not question the historicity of the Genesis account of
                    the creation and fall of man. By contrast, there is no place in the
                    theory of evolution for the origin of sin. Instead of a loss of
                    original perfection through the entrance of sin, the evolutionist
                    sees mankind constantly improving. Evolving people have no
                    need for the atoning blood of Jesus Christ—only sinners do.
                      Is man a sinner or is he not? Paul makes it clear that all have
                    sinned.

                      How does Scripture define sin? 1 John 3:4.

                       There is an inherent tendency to evil in all men. They find it
                    easy to hate, to indulge in sexual sins, to transgress the laws of
                    health. Shall man excuse himself on the basis of environment or
                    quirks of nature? Many do, and thus deny that sin is a deliberate
                    choice to do evil. Some will deny that evil really exists and will
                    talk of crime, for example, as a kind of disease which needs to
                    be cured. It is true that diseases are rampant and man needs all
                    the arts of medicine, but he needs more than physical treat-
                    ment; he needs the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                       "In these scriptures [Rev. 6:12-17 and Rev. 7:9-17] two parties
                    are brought to view. One party permitted themselves to be
                    deceived and took sides with those with whom the Lord has a
                    controversy. They misinterpreted the messages sent them and
                    clothed themselves in robes of self-righteousness. Sin was not
                    sinful in their eyes. They taught falsehood as truth, and by them

                   "The prophecy came not In old time by the will of man: but
                  holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
                  Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21).

                       "Although I am as dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in
                     writing my views as I am in receiving them, yet the words I
                     employ in describing what I have seen are my own, unless they
                     be those spoken to me by an angel, which I always enclose in
                     marks of quotation."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 37.

                       The Scriptures were written over a span of many years.
                     Are they all inspired? 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

                        "He [God] has not, while presenting the perils clustering
                     about the last days, qualified any finite man to unravel hidden
                     mysteries or inspired one man or any class of men to pronounce
                     judgment as to that which is inspired or is not. When men, in
                     their finite judgment, find it necessary to go Into an examination
                     of scriptures to define that which is inspired and that which is
                     not, they have stepped before Jesus to show Him a better way
                     than He has led us.
                        "I take the Bible just as it is, as the Inspired Word. I believe its
                     utterances in an entire Bible. . . .
                        "Brethren, cling to your Bible, as it reads, and stop your
                     criticisms in regard to its validity, and obey the Word, and not

                     that have not been sustained by science?

                        "God is the foundation of everything. All true science is in
                     harmony with His works; all true education leads to obedience
                     to His government. Science opens new wonders to our view;
                     she soars high and explores new depths; but she brings nothing
                     from her research that conflicts with divine revelation. Ignor-

           Part 6     What Is the basis of all true knowledge?
      ACCEPTING
   FALSE SCIENCE      "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the
                    knowledge of the holy is understanding" (Prov. 9:10).

                      "All true science is but an interpretation of the handwriting of
                    God in the material world. Science brings from her research
                    only fresh evidences of the wisdom and power of God. Rightly
                    understood, both the book of nature and the written word make
                    us acquainted with God by teaching us something of the wise
                    and beneficent laws through which He works."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 599.

                      How does Paul warn against a knowledge that is falsely so
                    called? 1 Tim. 6:20.

                      Scientific method has its place in the pursuit of knowledge,
                    but it is limited in scope. It can tell us much about our world; it
                    can tell us how to travel to the moon and undertake other
                    unbelievable projects. But it cannot tell us anything about ori-
                    gins; it cannot forecast the distant future. When science pre-
                    sumes to tell us how the world began, or what our destiny is,
                    then science goes beyond its bounds and is immediately sus-
                    pect. Only the One who created the universe can reveal when
                    and why and how He did it. Only the Bible can speak with
                    authority in such matters.
                      "There should be a settled faith in the divinity of God's holy
                    word. The Bible is not to be tested by men's ideas of science, but
                    science is to be brought to the test of this unerring standard.
                    When the Bible makes statements of facts in nature, science
                    may be compared with the written word, and a correct under-
                    standing of both will always prove them to be in harmony. One
                    does not contradict the other."—Ellen G. White,'Signs of the
                    Times, March 13, 1884.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is there a popular concept that there Is a contradic-
                    tion between the Bible and science? Show how the Bible has
                    been misinterpreted In the past so as to conflict with the evi-
                    dence of scientific research. What does Ellen White say about
                    the importance of scientific knowledge?

                      "The college at Battle Creek was established for the purpose
                    of teaching the sciences and at the same time leading the
                    students to the Saviour, whence all true knowledge flows. Edu-
                    cation acquired without Bible religion is disrobed of its true
                    brightness and glory.... The great object in the establishment
                    of our college was to give correct views, showing the harmony
                    of science and Bible religion."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 274.

              Part 1     How does Jesus show that the One who created us will also
         HIS POWER     provide for our living?
         TO SUSTAIN
                         "Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life,
                       what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
                       what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
                       body than raiment?" (Matt. 6:25).

                          "He who has given you life knows your need of food to sustain
                       it. He who created the body is not unmindful of your need of
                       raiment. Will not He who has bestowed the greater gift bestow
                       also what is needed to make it complete?"—Thoughts From the
                       Mount of Blessing, p. 95.

                         What two examples from the Old Testament show God's
                       power to sustain? 1 Kings 17:3, 6, 14-16.

                         Many question the miracles performed in Elijah's day, but in
                       so doing they are denying God's power to sustain life by other
                       than normal means. God does not always work a miracle to
                       provide our needs, but it is assuring to know that if this is
                       necessary He will not fail to do so.

                         What example from the New Testament is an Illustration of
                       creative power operating to provide sustenance for man?
                       John 6:5-13.

                         It is significant to note that in the above miracles God makes
                       use of what is already available: The widow had a jar of oil; the
                       disciples found five loaves and two fishes. God takes what man
                       has to offer and multiplies it according to need.•
                         God is no less powerful today than He was in the days of old.
                       Modern life may be different, but our needs are just as real, and
                       God's power is just as effective.

THINK IT THROUGH         How often have you found your needs met in an outstanding
                       way by a loving heavenly Father? Be prepared to recount
                       your experience to the class. What is the basis of trust in God?

                          "Not because we see or feel that God hears us are we to
                       believe. We are to trust in His promises. When we come to Him in
                       faith, every petition enters the heart of God. When we have
                       asked for His blessing, we should believe that we receive it, and
                       thank Him that we have received it. Then we are to go about our
                       duties, assured that the blessing will be realized when we need
                       it most. When we have learned to do this, we shall know that our
                       prayers are answered."—The Desire of Ages, p. 200.

           Part 2     What example does Jesus give that should encourage us to
    HIS CARE FOR    trust Him for daily food?
  HIS CREATURES
                      "Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
                    reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
                    them. Are ye not much better than they?" (Matt. 6:26).

                       Birds were not considered to be of very great value in Bible
                    times. (See Matt. 10:29.) Yet God cares for them. They are
                    dependent for their food on what God has provided. Further,
                    some birds have the ability to navigate accurately over long
                    distances. Part of their ability to find their way seems to stem
                    from their observations of the starry sky. The physiology of the
                    animal may also be involved. In the springtime a certain star
                    configuration in the sky may cause the bird to migrate toward
                    the north. In the fall the same birds would respond in the oppo-
                    site direction to the same or another star pattern. The improba-
                    bility that this type of behavior could arise through natural
                    selection and survival of the fittest is staggering.
                       The study of birds and animals is full of examples of God's
                    protecting care. This is not to deny the preying habits of one
                    creature on another, but to recognize that all creatures have
                    built-in instincts that warn of danger and make for survival.

                      What comparison of values does Jesus make to help us
                    learn to trust Him? Luke 12:6, 7.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it that many Christians worry? What is the antidote
                    to worry?

                      "When we take into our hands the management of things with
                    which we have to do, and depend upon our own wisdom for
                    success, we are taking a burden which God has not given us,
                    and are trying to bear it without His aid. We are taking upon
                    ourselves the responsibility that belongs to God, and thus are
                    really putting ourselves in His place. . . . But when we really
                    believe that God loves us and means to do us good we shall
                    cease to worry about the future. We shall trust God as a child
                    trusts a loving parent. Then our troubles and torments will
                    disappear, for our will is swallowed up in the will of God."—

          Part 3     What contrast does Jesus draw between the clothing of a
       HIS LOVE    king and the beauty of living plants?
      OF BEAUTY
                      "Why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the
                   field, how they grow; they toll not, neither do they spin: and yet
                   I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not
                   arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the
                   grass of the field, which to day Is, and to morrow is cast into
                   the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, 0 ye of little
                   faith?" (Matt. 6:28-30).

                   be, will always show crudeness and lack of perfection, espe-
                   cially if viewed under magnification. The objects that God
                   created always reveal greater and more perfect detail under
                   magnification.
                      "Christ pointed His disciples to the flowers of the field, grow-
                   ing in rich profusion and glowing in the simple beauty which the
                   heavenly Father had given them, as an expression of His love to
                   man.... The most gorgeous attire produced by the skill of art
                   cannot bear comparison with the natural grace and radiant
                   beauty of the flowers of God's creation. . . . If God, the divine
                   Artist, gives to the simple flowers that perish in a day their
                   delicate and varied colors, how much greater care will He have
                   for those who are created in His own image?"—Steps to Christ,
                   pp. 123, 124.

                     What was Solomon's glory like? 2 Chron. 9:17-22.

                     There is nothing wrong with wealth in itself. But we are not to
                   covet what we do not have; nor forget to give glory to God for
                   what we have.
                     In Matthew 6:28-30 Jesus makes a striking contrast between
                   clothing artificially made and the natural beauty of flowers in
                   the field. God is a lover of the beautiful. It is not a question of
                   how long that beauty is to last; many plants live and bloom for
                   only a short time. God intends that everything shall be beautiful,
                   and we may be sure that He intends that our lives shall be
                   beautiful too.
                     We may seek to adorn ourselves with silks and satins, and
                   make ourselves attractive with perfumes and color, but there is
                   no beauty so appealing as that which comes from the hand of
                   the Creator in terms of a meek and gentle and loving spirit, a
                   whole and healthy personality which comes from the re-creative
                   activity of God in the life.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can I give glory to God for everything that I own and for
                   all the beautiful experiences of life?

                                                                     February 15


           Part 4    What responsibility of stewardship did God place upon
   HIS PROVISION    Adam in Eden?
        OF WORK
                     "The Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of
                    Eden to dress it and to keep it" (Gen. 2:15).

                      Just as the Creator cares for His creation, so man, created in
                    His image, has the responsibility of caring for that which has
                    been placed under his dominion.
                      "In the laws which God gave for the cultivation of the soil, He
                    was giving the people opportunity to overcome their selfishness
                    and become heavenly-minded. Canaan would be to them as
                    Eden if they obeyed the Word of the Lord. Through them the
                    Lord designed to teach all the nations of the world how to
                    cultivate the soil so that it would yield healthy fruit, free from
                    disease. The earth is the Lord's vineyard, and is to be treated
                    according to His plan."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
                    Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1112.
                      Modern man lives in a materialistic society. He somehow feels
                    that happiness is directly proportional to the wealth that he
                    possesses. Jesus taught that we are stewards and that happi-
                    ness comes when we use our possessions to bring blessings to
                    others.

                     How did Jesus describe the man who thought he could stop
                    working and just enjoy his leisure? Luke 12:16-21.

                      "By the parable of the foolish rich man, Christ showed the
                    folly of those who make the world their all. This man had re-
                    ceived everything from God.... The Lord had caused vegetation
                    to flourish, and the fields to bring forth abundantly.... His barns
                    were full to overflowing, and he had no place to put the surplus
                    of his harvest. He did not think of God, from whom all his
                    mercies had come. He did not realize that God had made him a
                    steward of His goods that he might help the needy. He had a
                    blessed opportunity of being God's almoner, but he thought
                    only of ministering to his own comfort."—Christ's Object Les-
                    sons, p. 256.

                      What plan to prevent materialism and selfishness did God
                    establish with Israel? Ex. 23:10, 11.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can the Christian show that he considers himself a
                    steward rather than the owner of properties placed in his
                    hand?

                                                                       February 16


             Part 5   Why should the Christian not be concerned about food and
     HIS PROVISION drink?
          OF LIFE'S
       NECESSITIES    "Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
                    What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
                    (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
                    heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
                    things" (Matt. 8:31, 32).

                       "Our Lord adapts Himself to our special needs. He is a shade
                    on our right hand. He walks close by our side, ready to supply all
                    our necessities. He comes very near to those who are engaged
                    in willing service for Him. He knows every one by name. 0 what
                    assurances we have of the tender love of Christ."—Ellen G.
                    White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1153.

                      How do I know that the Christian's lack of concern for food
                    and drink does not mean that he will eat anything and every-
                    thing? Gen. 2:16, 17; 9:3, 4; Leviticus 11.

                        It is only reasonable that he who designs a machine is the one
                    best qualified to know what is needed to operate and maintain
                    it. Our heavenly Father created us. Surely He will know what is
                    needed and will see that His creation is supplied with the neces-
                    sities for proper function and maintenance if we cooperate.

THINK IT THROUGH      If God knows that we need food and drink, why should we
                    pray, "Give us this day our daily bread"?

                      "It is a part of God's plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of
                    faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask."—
                    The Great Controversy, p. 525.
                      "The first half of the prayer Jesus has taught us is in regard to
                    the name and kingdom and will of God—that His name may be
                    honored, His kingdom established, His will performed. When
                    you have thus made God's service your first interest, you may
                    ask with confidence that your own needs may be supplied. If you
                    have renounced self and given yourself to Christ you are a
                    member of the family of God, and everything in the Father's
                    house is for you. All the treasures of God are open to you, both
                    the world that now is and that which is to come. The ministry of
                    angels, the gift of His Spirit, the labors of His servants—all are
                    for you."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 110.

                                                                     February 17


            Part 6    If we make God first in our lives, what can we expect?
      MAN'S FIRST
        CONCERN        "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
                     and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore
                     no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought
                     for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil
                     thereof" (Matt. 6:33, 34).

                        It is very easy to be mixed up in our priorities, to place the
                     temporal over the eternal or the secular over the spiritual. That
                     which is closest at hand seems to occupy our time and atten-
                     tion. But we must look beyond the immediate, to the One who
                     has placed us here, and to the purpose for which we are alive.
                     There is a great controversy on, and we must do our part to
                     hasten God's kingdom. We must not settle down to the affairs of
                     this world as though we had an abiding city here. The Christian
                     can safely lean upon God to supply his needs even when he has
                     lost all in famine or disaster.

                       Why can we rest assured that God can back up His promise
                     to take care of our material needs if we place Him first? Ps.
                     50:10-12.

                        "The word of God has much to say in regard to sacrificing.
                     Riches are from the Lord and belong to Him. 'Both riches and
                     honor come of Thee.' The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,
                     saith the Lord of hosts.' For every beast of the forest is Mine,
                     and the cattle upon a thousand hills.' The earth is the Lord's,
                     and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.'
                     It is the Lord thy God that giveth thee power to get wealth.
                        "Riches are in themselves transient and unsatisfying. We are
                     warned not to trust in uncertain riches. 'Riches certainly make
                     themselves wings; they fly away.' Lay not up for yourselves
                     treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and
                     where thieves break through and steal."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p.
                     549.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I stop worrying about my situation and show trust
                     In my Creator's ability to provide my needs?

                       "Worry is blind, and cannot discern the future; but Jesus sees
                     the end from the beginning. In every difficulty He has His way
                     prepared to bring relief. Our heavenly Father has a thousand
                     ways to provide for us, of which we know nothing. Those who
                     accept the one principle of making the service and honor of God
                     supreme will find perplexities vanish, and a plain path before
                     their feet."—The Desire of Ages, p. 330.

     OF CONVERSION
                          "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
                       within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your

                          The miracle of conversion is a miracle of the heart, or more

                       involved to change the controlling center of the body so that the
                       life is changed? Only the One who made us in the first place can
                       fully answer these questions.
                          We may not be able to explain conversion, but we cannot
                       deny that it has taken place either in our lives or in the lives of
                       others. There has been a complete change in direction.
                       Whereas we once loved to break the law, now we find ourselves
                       living in harmony with the law. Whereas at one time we were
                       concerned only with ourselves, now we find our thoughts and
                       affections going out to others. At one time we were in the
                       bondage of sin; now we find ourselves free to enjoy all that is
                       high and noble, pure and beautiful. All this is nothing short of a
                       miracle because it represents a change contrary to our fallen
                       nature.

                         How did the psalmist express his desire for re-creation? Ps.
                       51:10.

                         It is wonderful to think that a change of heart is only a prayer
                       away! Only the Creator can effect the changes in heart and mind
                       that are necessary; but we are assured that there is nothing the
                       Creator would rather do than to erase the effects of sin, remake
                       us in the image of God, and bring us back to the perfection in
                       which Adam was originally created.

THINK IT THROUGH         What changes took place in your life when you experienced
                       conversion?

                         "You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them away.
                       You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and
                       ask that He will wash away your sins and give you a new heart.
                       Then believe that He does this because He has promised."—

The Creator and Re-creator             LESSON 8                          ❑ Monday
                                                                        February 20


           Part 2     What surprising message did Jesus give Nicodemus?
   THE NECESSITY
      OF REBIRTH       "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
                    thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
                    of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born
                    when he Is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's
                    womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto
                    thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
                    cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the
                    flesh is flesh; and that which Is born of the Spirit is spirit.
                    Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John
                    3:3-7).

                      Nicodemus knew the meaning of being born again. What he
                    couldn't see was how it applied to him—a Jew of devotion and
                    of considerable age. But Jesus insists on the necessity of
                    Nicodemus' rebirth and points out that a life of rectitude, how-
                    ever noble (as was no doubt the case with Nicodemus himself),
                    was no substitute for a denial of man's righteousness and the
                    acceptance of the miracle of God's grace in the heart. Man
                    cannot enter the kingdom of heaven without being re-created,
                    renouncing the family of fallen man and entering into the family
                    of God.
                      Being "born of water" refers to the experience of baptism.
                    The old man of sin dies within us when we turn to Christ. (See
                    Rom. 6:3, 4.)
                      Being "born of the spirit" means that we no longer walk after
                    the dictates of the flesh, but after the mind of the Spirit. (See
                    Rom. 8:5-11.)
                      The conversation of Jesus with Nicodemus made two things
                    perfectly clear: (1) that a man cannot enter the kingdom merely
                    by being good; (2) that a man must accept and experience the
                    redeeming grace of God to enter the kingdom.

                      What is the mode of life after being born again? 1 John 3:9;
                    5:18.

                      The laws of genetics seem to work in the spiritual world as
                    effectively as they do in the natural. Just as a child takes after his
                    parents in build and appearance and habits of mind, so the child
                    of God, being born from above, develops the characteristics of
                    his heavenly Father. He is kind and loving; he keeps the com-
                    mandments. He no longer continues in the way of his
                    forefathers in the flesh, sinning and sinning again, because, he
                    has, as it were, a new set of genes.

           Part 3     What illustration does Jesus use to show that the work of
     THE WORK OF    the Holy Spirit is mysterious?
       THE SPIRIT
                      "The wind bloweth where It listeth, and thou hearest the
                    sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
                    whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit"
                    (John 3:8).

                        Wind is a mighty power whose effect can be seen and felt, but
                     is itself invisible to the human eye. So is the work of the Spirit,
                    says Jesus. The Spirit comes and goes; it chooses its own time
                    and purpose, its own power and effect. Just as man cannot
                    control the wind, so he cannot begin to control the Spirit. He
                    must wait and see and hear, for it is God who takes the initiative.
                        The power of the Holy Spirit, we are told, is working for man's
                    salvation. It is possible to resist the Spirit, to grieve the Spirit,
                    and thus cause the Spirit to go away. Man has freedom to
                    choose what he will do in this regard. But when a man decides
                    to yield to the influences of God's Spirit, there comes into his life
                    a force and a power that is re-creative. He is a new creature: Old
                    things have passed away; everything becomes new. In this re-
                    birth there is an element of mystery that we cannot fathom.
                       With all the progress that science has made today, we still
                    stand in awe before the mystery of life. We have made tremen-
                    dous progress in analyzing the structure of every particle of life.
                    Our microscopes have revealed in great detail the smallest parts
                    of human anatomy. But still we cannot explain the mystery of
                    life. Unless the God who created us and put all things together
                    comes to explain things to us, we shall stand in ignorance,
                    admitting our failure, and bowing before God's omniscience. If
                    this is true in the physical realm, need it surprise us if the means
                    of the spiritual rebirth remains partially hidden?

THINK IT THROUGH      What are the differences between physical birth and spiri-
                    tual rebirth?

                      "The old nature, born of blood and the will of the flesh, cannot
                    inherit the kingdom of God. The old ways, the hereditary ten-
                    dencies, the former habits, must be given up; for grace is not
                    inherited. The new birth consists in having new motives, new
                    tastes, new tendencies. Those who are begotten unto a new life
                    by the Holy Spirit, have become partakers of the divine nature,
                    and in all their habits and practices they will give evidence of
                    their relationship to Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.

                                                                     February 22


           Part 4   How did Jesus contrast the water of a well with the water
        SYMBOLS that He could give?
     OF CREATIVE
          POWER     "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall
                  never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a
                  well of water springing up into everlasting life" (John 4:14).

                       Just as adequate water and food are necessary for this pres-
                    ent life, so provision has been made for the Christian to partake
                    of spiritual water and food. Three elements are presented in this
                    part of the lesson: (1) water, (2) bread, (3) fruits from the tree of
                    life.
                       It is interesting to note that man cannot do without water for
                    more than three days. He can last without food for many days,
                    but if his body is dehydrated he develops a fever and dies.

                      What did John the revelator say he saw in the New
                    Jerusalem? Rev. 22:1.

                      Water is a symbol of God's creative and sustaining power.
                    Even in the earth made new there is a river gushing from the
                    throne of God and of the Lamb, a symbol of man's dependence
                    upon God, and God's constant provision for man's needs.

                      What article of food did Jesus say He symbolized? John
                    6:35.

                       Bread used to be called the staff of life, but in our modern diet
                    it occupies a less important role than in the past. Nevertheless, a
                    loaf of whole wheat bread is very nutritious and satisfying.

                      What important tree exists in heaven? Rev. 22:2.

                      Fruit from the tree of life! Freshly gathered fruits are very
                    appealing. They are usually juicy, sweet, and appetizing. They
                    are easily digested and deliciously complement one's diet.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How will immortality be sustained in the new earth?

                      "The fruit of the tree of life in the Garden of Eden possessed
                    supernatural virtue. To eat of it was to live forever. Its fruit was
                    the antidote of death. Its leaves were for the sustaining of life
                    and immortality. . . .
                      "After the entrance of sin, the heavenly Husbandman trans-
                    planted the tree of life to the Paradise above; but its branches
                    hang over the wall to the lower world. Through the redemption
                    purchased by the blood of Christ, we may still eat of its life-

            Part 5    What victory is promised to him that is born of God?
         VICTORY
        THROUGH       "Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
            FAITH is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith"
                   (1 John 5:4).

                      Faith is a relationship of trust. When we place our trust in God,
                   we can overcome the world, because He who is on our side is
                   greater than he that is against us. We need not fear what men
                   can do to us, because our lives are in God's hands.
                      "The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him
                   as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to our-
                   selves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transac-
                   tion by which those who receive Christ join themselves in cov-
                   enant relation with God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 347.

                     How can we obtain this faith which leads to victory? 1 John
                   5:1, first part.

                      Faith is an attitude to Jesus; it is a belief that Jesus is the
                   Christ, the Son of the living God. (See Matt. 16:16). But this
                   insight is not the result of human intuition; it is evidence that
                   God has been at work in the life of the individual. (See Matt.
                   16:17.) Paul points out that the confession of Jesus as Lord and
                   Christ can come only through the influence of the Holy Spirit.
                   (See 1 Cor. 12:3.)
                      "When we seek to gain heaven through the merits of Christ,
                   the soul makes progress. Looking unto Jesus, the author and
                   finisher of our faith, we may go on from strength to strength,
                   from victory to victory; for through Christ the grace of God has
                   worked out our complete salvation."—Selected Messages, bk.
                   1, p. 364.

THINK IT THROUGH      How does belief In God and Jesus Christ affect the daily
                   life of the converted person?

                      When we come to know what Jesus has done for us; when we
                   believe and accept Him as our personal Saviour, we cannot help
                   but love Him. God's love for us creates a response of love. And
                   how do I know that I love Him? When I keep His commandments.
                   (See 1 John 5:3.)
                      "Faith in the word of God and in the power of Christ to
                   transform the life will enable the believer to work His works and
                   to live a life of rejoicing in the Lord.
                      "Again and again I have been instructed to say to our people:

           Part 6     What characteristic of religious life will be apparent In the

    OF PRETENSE
                      "This know also, that In the last days perilous times shall

                      "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
                    from such turn away" (2 Tim. 3:1, 5).

                      It is very easy to maintain an outward display of religiosity.
                    Since people cannot always read our thoughts or feelings, we
                    can get away with the outward display and hope for the best. But
                    Scripture warns us that a form of godliness will not save; that in
                    the last days there will be many members of the church who will
                    pretend to be good, when in reality they are not. Are we at grips
                    with the reality, or are we deceived and deceiving by a show of
                    Christian piety?
                      In the last days there will be more than a spirit of hypocrisy
                    rampant. Some will deny that there is any other form of religious

                    who pretends that certain doctrines are true, when in fact they
                    are not; that a consistent Christian experience is beyond the
                    capacity of the average church member so why try; that to
                    renounce the world in its entirety is fanaticism and must be
                    avoided. Many deny the existence of a power from God to
                    enable the believer to live above the world and in harmony with
                    God's law. From such teaching we are to turn away.

                      What happens when people turn away from the worship of
                    the true God? Ex. 32:7, 8.

                       "A religion that permits men, while observing the rites of
                    worship, to devote themselves to selfish or sensual gratifica-
                    tion, is as pleasing to the multitudes now as in the days of Israel.
                    And there are still pliant Aarons, who, while holding positions of
                    authority in the church, will yield to the desires of the unconse-
                    crated, and thus encourage them in sin."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 317.

THINK IT THROUGH     What do I do when I do not feel religious, when I feel I
                    would rather do something wrong?

                      The solution to a mood of Indifference in religious matters is
                    not found in pretense. We must go back to the Source of
                    spiritual life and ask to be recreated. Read Psalm 51:10. This is a
                    prayer that God will never refuse to answer.
                      There is no excuse for hypocrisy; nor is there any virtue in it.
                    Notice in Revelation 3:18 what God says is the solution to the
                    lukewarm Laodicean experience.

Since it is our belief that the messages
of these three angels will constitute in

widespread religious call to return to
the worship of God, we watch with

fulfilling of the predictions concerning
the loud cry of these three messages.
   Seventh-day Adventists understand
that the Sabbath, the day that is set
aside for the worship of God, will be
the central point of religious
controversy just before the second
coming of Christ. Since the Sabbath is
so intimately connected with the
Creation event, it is obvious that no
real issue concerning Saturday and
Sunday can develop or be resolved

           Part 1     How does the Lord describe Himself to John the Revelator?
      THE CALLER
                      "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith
                    the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
                    Almighty."
                      "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive
                    for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death"
                    (Rev. 1:8, 18).

                       The authority behind the revelations given to John is God
                    Himself (Rev. 1:1). But we cannot think of God without refer-
                    ence to Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. In other words, the
                    three Persons of the Godhead are involved in communicating
                    with the church through the apostle and prophet.
                       The description of the Lord is impressive and comprehensive.
                    The use of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha
                    and Omega) indicates to Greek readers the entirety of a thing;
                    there is nothing beyond, before, or after. In other words, God is
                    the Lord of all history, and from the time it began to the time that
                    it shall end, and all the period in between.
                       In the days of John such an affirmation would come with
                    telling force because of the political powers that were opposing
                    the church. In our own day, when so many voices clamor for
                    attention, it is important to note that there is one voice that must
                    be heard above all others, the voice of God Himself.

                     What other terms are used to describe the Source of infor-
                    mation and warning to man? Rev. 3:14.

                      The Amen: This term from the Hebrew suggests truthfulness
                    and faithfulness (see Isa. 65:16, where the "God of truth" is in
                    the Hebrew, the God of Amen). Christians use this word at the
                    end of a prayer, or the close of an assertion, to indicate approval
                    or finality. In this context the meaning seems to be that Jesus
                    places His seal of finality on the purposes of God; that He is their
                    guarantor and executor. Contrast the fickleness of man and the
                    faithlessness of the Laodicean church.
                      The beginning of the creation of God: This refers to Jesus as
                    the Source of Creation; the One who brought all things into
                    being. (See John 1:3.)

THINK IT THROUGH      In the light of the source of the warnings that come In the
                    book of Revelation, what reasons would you give for paying
                    careful attention?

                                                                      February 27


          Part 2   What was the chain of communication through which the
       LINES OF truth of revelation came to man?
  COMMUNICATION
                   "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him,
                 to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to
                 pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant
                 John" (Rev. 1:1).

                      We cannot always understand how God works, so that the
                    poet says, "God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to
                    perform."—William Cowper. But we may be sure that God's
                    ways are best. He chooses to make His revelations through
                    Jesus Christ to an angel, who transmits it to John, and then John
                    writes it for the churches. Thus we have a line of communication
                    that is best suited to accomplish God's purposes.
                      In this hierarchy of descent we see an orderliness that is
                    characteristic of God. He is not only authoritative in Himself, but
                    His methods are right and proper. If we should listen when God
                    speaks, we ought to enter into His plans when He communi-
                    cates them to us.

                      In what way do the angels now inhabiting heaven show and
                    express their loyalty to their leader? Rev. 7:11, 12.

                      In human communication a message may be garbled as it
                    passes from mouth to mouth. But with the angels this possibility
                    does not exist; the angels are too conscious of the glory of God
                    to do anything other than the exact bidding of their Lord. Appar-
                    ently they are aware of, and enter into, the plans and purposes
                    of God, so that they cannot help but worship Him and ascribe to
                    Him the qualities of majesty they can see.
                       If men were also a part of God's line of communication they,
                    too, would be faithful in their responsibilities and glorifying in
                    their responses. This is the ideal toward which we should strive.

                      What significant message or warning is given by the first
                    angel of Revelation 14? (See verse 6.)

                      The reference to the "hour of his judgment" indicates the
                    time and importance of the message.

 THINK IT THROUGH    What responsibilities do I have. as one who receives a

            Part 3      What is the key thought in the first angel's message?
      WORSHIP OF
     THE CREATOR       "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;
                     for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that
                     made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
                     waters" (Rev. 14:7).

                        There is a worldwide need for such a message. Here are some
                     of the conditions that may exist:
                        (1) People no longer fear and reverence God. Their minds are
                     set on other things. Can you give some examples?
                        (2) People may recognize God, but they do not give Him the
                     glory for all the benefits they enjoy. Can you give examples of
                     how men credit science or their own achievements for bless-
                     ings of life that come from the hand of God?
                        (3) They do not accept God as the Creator, the origin and
                     source of all being. How does the theory of evolution undermine
                     the concept of God as Creator?
                        "The message itself sheds light as to the time when this
                     movement is to take place. It is declared to be a part of the
                     'everlasting gospel;' and it announces the opening of the judg-
                     ment. The message of salvation has been preached in all ages;
                     but this message is a part of the gospel which could be pro-
                     claimed only in the last days, for only then would it be true that
                     the hour of judgment had come."—The Great Controversy, pp.
                     355, 356.
                        "In the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of crea-
                     tion. It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the founda-
                     tions of the earth. It was His hand that hung the world in space,
                     and fashioned the flowers of the field. 'His strength setteth fast
                     the mountains.' The sea is His, and He made it.' Ps. 65:6; 95:5. It
                     was He that filled the earth with beauty, and the air with song.
                     And upon all things in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the
                     message of the Father's love."—The Desire of Ages, p. 20.

                      What is the relationship of the fourth commandment to the
                     message of the first angel? Ex. 20:8-11.

                        In the 1830s and 1840s when this message was first pro-
                     claimed, evolution was not an issue. Almost everyone believed
                     that God was Creator. Charles Darwin's book, Origin of the
                     Species, was published in 1859. The call to worship the Creator
                     is very relevant for our day when a majority of people believe in
                     the theory of evolution.

           Part 4     What message did the second angel give?
     THE FALL OF
        BABYLON       "And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is
                    fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
                    drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication" (Rev. 14:8).

                       "The term 'Babylon' is derived from 'Babel,' and signifies
                    confusion."—The Great Controversy, p. 381.
                       Only in the Bible, rightly interpreted and understood, do we
                    have a logical ground of knowledge. We know of the origin of
                    evil and the controversy that is going on between good and evil,
                    Christ and Satan. As soon as we turn to another source of
                    information, we become confused and lost.
                       Babylon represents all those organizations which oppose
                    God's plans and purposes. Often in the past God's purposes
                    seem to have been thwarted. The entrance of sin, the increase of
                    sin in the days of Noah, the apostasy of God's people culminat-
                    ing in the rejection of Christ. Even in the last days there will be
                    movements and organizations which will seek to defeat God's
                    plan for man's salvation. But God's warning message is that
                    Babylon is fallen. It is important for all people everywhere to link
                    up with God's everlasting gospel, and to shun any association
                    that will mean their utter destruction when truth finally gains the
                    victory over evil.
                       "The warnings of the word of God regarding the perils sur-
                    rounding the Christian church belong to us today. As in the days
                    of the apostles men tried by tradition and philosophy to destroy
                    faith in the Scriptures, so today, by the pleasing sentiments of
                    higher criticism, evolution, spiritualism, theosophy, and pan-
                    theism, the enemy of righteousness is seeking to lead souls into
                    forbidden paths. To many the Bible is as a lamp without oil,
                    because they have turned their minds into channels of specula-
                    tive belief that bring misunderstanding and confusion. The
                    work of higher criticism, in dissecting, conjecturing, recon-
                    structing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a divine

              Part 5      What happens to those who receive the mark of the beast in
      BEAST, IMAGE,     hand or forehead?
         AND MARK
                         "And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud
                       voice, if any man worship the beast and his image, and re-
                       ceive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall

                       without mixture into the cup of his indignation" (Rev. 14:9,10).

                         The beast is mentioned in Revelation 13:1 and is described as
                       having "the name of blasphemy" on its seven heads. This im-

                       mentioned in Revelation 13:14 and is described as demanding
                       worship (verse 15), which places it in the same category as
                       anti-God. The mark is obviously a sign given to an adherent so
                       that he may be distinguished from those who do not have the
                       mark. God's warning message is that any or all who engage in
                       activity that is opposed to God will suffer dire consequences,
                       described as drinking the wine of God's wrath.

                          "Thus the distinction is drawn between the loyal and the
                       disloyal. Those who desire to have the seal of God in their
                       foreheads must keep the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.
                       Thus they are distinguished from the disloyal, who have ac-
                       cepted a man-made institution in place of the true Sabbath."—

                         "To give glory to God is to reveal His character in our own,
                       and thus make Him known. And in whatever way we make
                       known the Father or the Son, we glorify God."—Ellen G. White

THINK IT THROUGH         Why is the keeping of the Sabbath so important in these last
                       days? When and how does one receive the mark of the beast?

                         "The substitution of the false for the true is the last act in the
                       drama. When this substitution becomes universal, God will re-
                       veal Himself. When the laws of men are exalted above the laws
                       of God, when the powers of this earth try to force men to keep
                       the first day of the week, know that the time has come for God to
                       work."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

                                                                             March 3


           Part 6     What will be the outcome for those who, in the face of
     THE SECRET     persecution, worship God on the day that commemorates His
     OF VICTORY     creative work?

                      "I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
                    that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,
                    and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on
                    the sea of glass, having the harps of God. And they sing the
                    song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb,
                    saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Al-
                    mighty; Just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who
                    shall not fear thee, 0 Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only
                    art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee;
                    for thy judgments are made manifest" (Rev. 15: 2-4).

                       It is not easy to keep the Sabbath in certain situations. Often it
                    involves persecution, loss of property, and being despised by
                    peers and fellow citizens. But some will not be kept from doing
                    right whatever the consequences, and one day they will find
                    themselves honored for their stand.
                       The song of Moses and the song of the Lamb are songs of
                    deliverance. Moses brought deliverance from the bondage of
                    Egypt. The Lamb (our Lord) brings escape from the bondage of
                    sin. Sometimes it looks as though evil will overcome the good,
                    but God's works are "great and marvellous," His ways are " just
                    and true." Those who are dedicated to God for accomplishing
                    His will soon find that God's truth always triumphs and they
                    triumph with it. The universe will come to acknowledge the
                    goodness of God.

                     What is the relationship to God of those who overcome?
                    Rev. 21:7.

                      The redeemed will worship God throughout eternity. They will
                    be forever grateful because they have been snatched as brands
                    from the burning. They recognize God's unlimited generosity
                    because they are being treated as sons, with love and respect.
                    What more could they ask for? Furthermore, they have inherited
                    "all things." There is a close tie of common interest. They are
                    members of a family where there is peace and harmony. They
                    work together and eat together and associate together in an
                    environment that is unbelievably beautiful. After years of strug-
                    gle and strife, they are now in a permanent home where there
                    will be no more the sorrow of parting.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it good sometimes to dwell on the rewards of the
                    righteous?

            Part 1     What great miracle illustrated Jesus' ability to give life?
      THE SOURCE
           OF LIFE     "When he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
                     Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound
                     hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound
                     about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let
                     him go" (John 11:43, 44).

                       Popular journals sometimes carry stories that purport to sus-
                     tain a belief that the dead are now alive. But the Bible teaches
                     that the dead will live again only by the resurrection. All claims
                     that the dead are now living are deceptions.

                       How did the scribes and Pharisees admit that Jesus had
                     performed many miracles? John 11:47.

                        Probably no other miracle Jesus performed was so spectacu-
                     lar as this one. There was no way to deny that Jesus had indeed
                     raised Lazarus from the dead; even the scribes and Pharisees
                     admitted it. This miracle demonstrated that Jesus had the
                     power that he claimed to be the resurrection and the life (John
                     11:25).

                       How did Caiaphas unwittingly acknowledge Jesus' saving
                     power? John 11:50-53.

                       "In declaring that one man should die for the nation,
                     Caiaphas indicated that he had some knowledge of the
                     prophecies, although it was very limited. But John, in his ac-
                     count of this scene, takes up the prophecy, and shows its broad
                     and deep significance. He says, 'And not for that nation only, but
                     that also He should gather together in one the children of God
                     that were scattered abroad.' How blindly did the haughty
                     Caiaphas acknowledge the Saviour's mission!"—The Desire of
                     Ages, p. 540.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the significance to you and me that Jesus was able
                     to raise Lazarus from the dead? In rejecting Jesus as the
                     Messiah, what were the scribes and Pharisees actually reject-
                     ing?

                       "We may refuse the invitations that Christ sends to us; we may
                     neglect His offer of pardon and peace; but still it remains a fact
                     that every one of us has been bought with a price, even with the
                     precious blood of the Son of God. Therefore, 'Consider him'

         Part 2   How does Peter reveal that provision was made for the
     GOD'S PLAN salvation of man (in case he fell) even before the foundation of
      UNFOLDED the world?

                     "He was destined before the foundation of the world but
                   was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake"
                   (1 Peter 1:20, RSV).

                      God is not caught unawares. He foresaw sin.
                      "The plan of salvation had its place in the counsels of the
                   Infinite from all eternity. The gospel is the revelation of God's
                   love to men, and means everything that is essential to the hap-
                   piness and well-being of humanity. The work of God in the earth
                   is of immeasurable importance, and it is Satan's special object
                   to crowd it out of sight and mind, that he may make his specious
                   devices effectual in the destruction of those for whom Christ
                   died. It is his purpose to cause the discoveries of men to be
                   exalted above the wisdom of God."—Fundamentals of Chris-
                   tian Education, p. 186.

                     When was God's plan first made known to man? Gen. 3:15.

                     "The central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every
                   other in the whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the
                   restoration in the human soul of the image of God. From the first
                   intimation of hope in the sentence pronounced in Eden to that
                   last glorious promise of the Revelation, 'They shall see His face;
                   and His name shall be in their foreheads' (Revelation 22:4), the
                   burden of every book and every passage of the Bible is the
                   unfolding of this wondrous theme,—man's uplifting,—the
                   power of God... .
                      "He who grasps this thought has before him an infinite field
                   for study. He has the key that will unlock to him the whole
                   treasure house of God's word.
                      "The science of redemption is the science of all sciences; ...
                   the science that enters into the purpose brooded in the mind of
                   the Infinite—'kept in silence through times eternal' (Romans

                     Why only could Jesus rather than an angel meet the death
                   penalty of sin? John 5:26.

                      agony while bearing the penalty of man's transgression. God
                      and the angels clothed themselves with darkness, and hid the
                      Saviour from the gaze of the curious multitude while He drank
                      the last dregs of the cup of God's wrath."—Ellen G. White
                      Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1108.

                        What other phenomenon typified the tremendous event
                      taking place with the death of Jesus? Matt. 27:51.

                        The shaking of the earth, the splitting of the rocks, must have
                      convinced every onlooker that the person on the cross was no
                      ordinary man; His death was no ordinary event. The Roman
                      centurion recognized it (Luke 23:47). Is it not surprising that
                      God's own people should be deaf to the voice of nature at this
                      time? All they could be concerned about was their personal
                      safety.
                        " 'Truly this was the Son of God.' Many who had scoffed and
                      jeered at, and taunted the Son of God were terribly afraid that
                      the shaking earth, the rent and trembling rocks would put an
                      end to their own lives. They hastened away from the scene,
                      beating upon their breasts, stumbling, falling, in awful terror
                      lest the earth should open and swallow them up."—Ellen G.
                      White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1108.

                        During what event that occurred two days later did the earth
                      quake again? Matt. 28:2.

THINK IT THROUGH       How does God use events in nature to speak to His people?
                      What physical signs can warn us of the second advent?

                        "The signs of the times are ominous. Coming events cast their
                      shadows before. The Spirit of God is withdrawing from the
                      earth, and calamity follows calamity by sea and by land. There
                      are tempests, earthquakes, fires, floods, murders of every
                      grade. Who can read the future? Where is security?"—The

                                                                       March 8


           Part 4   What principle of nature did Jesus point out to His disci-
      DYING AND pies?
    RISING AGAIN
                    "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
                  the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth
                  forth much fruit" (John 12:24).

                      What did Jesus predict would happen after He was slain?
                    Luke 9:22.

                       Jesus told the disciples what was going to happen to Him.
                    They no doubt listened politely, but they did not really under-
                    stand because they were obsessed with hopes for personal gain
                    in a tem poral kingdom. Can it be that we today are so concerned
                    with material goods that we also do not understand what Jesus
                    is saying to us even though we pretend to listen?
                       "Before His crucifixion the Saviour explained to His disciples
                    that He was to be put to death and to rise again from the tomb,
                    and angels were present to impress His words on minds and
                    hearts. But the disciples were looking for temporal deliverance
                    from the Roman yoke, and they could not tolerate the thought
                    that He in whom all their hopes centered should suffer an
                    ignominious death."—The Great Controversy, p. 594.
                       Death need not be the end of all things. The seed that is
                    placed in the ground ends its life as a seed, but it develops a root
                    and a stem that is to produce a plant after the order of the seed
                    itself, and this plant will produce many more seeds, some of
                    which will be used as food, and some will be used as seed for the
                    next harvest.

                      How does Paul describe the change that takes place at the
                    resurrection by means of the illustration of the seed? 1 Cor.
                    15:36-38.

THINK IT THROUGH      When can death be a tragedy, and when can it be the gate-
                    way to an even greater life? Why is the resurrection so im-
                    portant for us? 1 Thess. 4:14.

                       "In the prophecies the future is opened before us as plainly as
                    it was opened to the disciples by the words of Christ. The events
                    connected with the close of probation and the work of prepara-
                    tion for the time of trouble, are clearly presented. But multitudes
                    have no more understanding of these important truths than if
                    they had never been revealed. Satan watches to catch away
                    every impression that would make them wise unto salvation,
                    and the time of trouble will find them unready."—The Great

Creator and Life-giver LESSON 10                                     ❑     Thursday
                                                                            March 9


         Part 5      How did Jesus say He would rise from the dead?
      POWER TO
     RENEW LIFE       "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my
                   life, that I might take It again. No man taketh it from me, but I
                   lay it down of myself. I have power to lay It down, and I have
                   power to take It again. This commandment have I received of
                   my Father" (John 10:17, 18).

                     Jesus makes it clear that He laid down His life of His own
                   volition; no one seized it from Him. Judas betrayed Him; the
                   Jewish leaders rejected Him; the Roman soldiers crucified Him.
                   But in the strictest sense they did not take His life; He gave it up.
                   He died of a broken heart. This aspect of Jesus is important to
                   note because it points up where the power is. God is not subject
                   to the whims and fancies of this creation. He is the Sovereign
                   Ruler, and everything is in His control.

                      Why is the resurrection of Jesus so Important to the Chris-
                   tian? 1 Cor. 15:12-19.

                     The resurrection of Jesus means that the resurrection of the
                   saints is a certainty. It means that death is no longer a tragedy to
                   those who die in the Lord, but it may even be a blessing. (See
                   Rev. 14:13.) It means that those who mourn need not do so as
                   those who have no hope; they know that death is sleep and the
                   morning comes when loved ones will come to life and live
                   happily evermore. It also means that the concept that a person
                   goes to heaven or hell when he dies is wholly unscriptural.

THINK IT THROUGH     What does the power of the resurrection tell us about the
                   nature of Jesus? What Is His plan for humanity?

                       "All created beings live by the will and power of God. They are
                   recipients of the life of the Son of God. However able and
                   talented, however large their capacities, they are replenished
                   with life from the Source of all life. He is the spring, the fountain,
                   of life. Only He who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light and
                   life, should say, 'I have power to lay it [my life] down, and I have
                   power to take it again' (John 10:18). . . .
                      "Christ was invested with the right to give immortality. The life
                   which He had laid down in humanity, He again took up and gave
                   to humanity."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, pp. 301, 302.

Creator and Life-giver LESSON 10                                         ❑  Friday
                                                                          March 10


          Part 6     What would be our prospects if Christ had not risen?
       OUR ONLY
           HOPE      "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
                   sins.... If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all
                   men most miserable" (1 Cor. 15:17-19).

                      The expression, "ye are yet in your sins" points out the
                   hopelessness of man if Christ is not raised; it is not merely a
                   dark future that he faces, but a dismal present. Man in the
                   bondage of sin longs for release, a release that can be his only
                   when the Creator becomes also his Redeemer.
                      "The resurrection of Jesus was a type of the final resurrection
                   of all who sleep in Him. The countenance of the risen Saviour,
                   His manner, His speech, were all familiar to His disciples. As
                   Jesus arose from the dead, so those who sleep in Him are to rise
                   again. We shall know our friends, even as the disciples knew
                   Jesus. They may have been deformed, diseased, or disfigured,
                   in this mortal life, and they rise in perfect health and symmetry;
                   yet in the glorified body their identity will be perfectly preserved.
                   Then shall we know even as also we are known. 1 Cor. 13:12. In
                   the face radiant with the light shining from the face of Jesus, we
                   shall recognize the lineaments of those we love."—The Desire
                   of Ages, p. 804.

                     When Christ came forth victorious over death, what unusual
                   occurrence portended a great future event? Matt. 27: 52, 53.

                      It is interesting to note that inanimate creation responds in
                   kind to the mighty events taking place in the realm• of the
                   spiritual. Jesus triumphs over the grave, and all nature shakes
                   with the tremendous implications of that stupendous event.
                      Fear must have gripped the hearts of men and women as they
                   felt the earth shake and saw men and women come out of their
                   tombs. Yet how few related these physical manifestations to the
                   power of God that was working out man's salvation.

THINK IT THROUGH     If I should die before Jesus comes, what would make pos-
                   sible my arising in the first resurrection?

                                                                      March 12


         Part 1   What mystery did the apostle Paul say he would show to the
 THE MYSTERY OF Corinthians?
  RESURRECTION
                  "Behold, I chew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
                shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
                the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
                be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed" (1 Cor.
                15:51, 52).

                     The word "mystery" as used here by Paul is not something
                   hidden which cannot be known. It is a divine secret which is
                   revealed to the believer. Paul had revealed to him a matter
                   which was not known by the general public, but which was now
                   to be revealed, namely, the raising of people from the dead.
                     We do not know how God will accomplish the physical
                   changes necessary to bring the living righteous to perfection
                   when He comes, even as we do not know how He created Adam
                   or how He will raise to life again those long dead. But the
                   sureness of the promise and the reality of the change are not
                   dependent upon our understanding of the process.
                     "His [God's] creative power is as incomprehensible as His
                   existence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 113.

                     How is the great mysterious process of creation described
                   In Psalms? Ps. 104:24, 30.

                      "The greatest minds, if not guided by the word of God in their
                   research, become bewildered in their attempts to trace the
                   relations of science and revelation. Because the Creator and His
                   works are so far beyond their comprehension that they are
                   unable to explain them by natural laws, they regard Bible history
                   as unreliable. Those who doubt the reliability of the records of
                   the Old and New Testaments, will be led to go a step further, and

                   and show how they are physical and spiritual.

                      "When the voice of God awakes the dead, he will come from
                   the grave with the same appetites and passions, the same likes
                   and dislikes, that he cherished when living. God works no mira-
                   cle to re-create a man who would not be re-created when he was
                   granted every opportunity and provided with every facility. Dur-
                   ing his lifetime he took no delight in God, nor found pleasure in
                   His service. His character is not in harmony with God, and he
                   could not be happy in the heavenly family."-Christ's Object

          Part 2    What great demonstration of God's creative power is yet to
       THE DEAD occur?
    COME TO LIFE
                    "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, In the which all
                 that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come
                 forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life;
                 and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damna-
                 tion" (John 5:28, 29).

                     What additional unique power will God use on righteous
                   dead that He will not do for the wicked dead? 1 Cor. 15:49.

                      A new type of body is needed for the new conditions under
                   which the redeemed shall live. Identity is not lost, but the sub-
                   stance of the body will be changed.
                      "Our personal identity is preserved in the resurrection,
                   though not the same particles of matter or material substance
                   as went into the grave. The wondrous works of God are a
                   mystery to man. The spirit, the character of man, is returned to
                   God, there to be preserved. In the resurrection every man will
                   have his own character. God in His own time will call forth the
                   dead, giving again the breath of life, and bidding the dry bones
                   live. The same form will come forth, but it will be free from
                   disease and every defect. It lives again bearing the same indi-
                   viduality of features, so that friend will recognize friend. There is
                   po law of God in nature which shows that God gives back the
                   same identical particles of matter which composed the body
                   before death. God shall give the righteous dead a body that will
                   please Him."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Com-
                   mentary, vol. 6, p. 1093.
                      Through His power, God will bring to life each dead saint. The
                   product will be perfect but still readily recognizable by relatives
                   and friends. The brain will be purified from all impure thoughts
                   and memories and the beauty of holy thoughts will be present
                   and active.

THINK IT THROUGH     Show how the changes In the material substance of the
                   body do not affect a person's identity.

                      Even in this present life the body undergoes continual
                   change. Yet the "I" is the same. This may be a mystery of life, but
                   it helps us to understand that the changes necessary in the
                   resurrection do not affect one's identity.
                      The first thought of the resurrected person is one of victory.
                   He recognizes that he was dead but is alive again. The sting and
                   pain of death are gone forever.

             Part 3   What great experience awaits the righteous living when
      TRANSLATION Jesus comes the second time?
     OF THE LIVING
                      "Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
                    together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
                    and so shall we ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:17).

                       Not everyone will taste of death before the second advent.
                    Some will be alive to witness the coming of Jesus, and they will
                    have the experience of translation rather than resurrection.
                       "It was as a representative of those who shall be thus trans-
                    lated that Elijah, near the close of Christ's earthly ministry, was
                    permitted to stand with Moses by the side of the Saviour on the
                    mount of transfiguration [Matt. 17:1-8j. In these glorified ones,
                    the disciples saw in miniature a representation of the kingdom
                    of the redeemed. They beheld Jesus clothed with the light of
                    heaven... ; and there also stood Elijah, representing those who
                    at the close of earth's history will be changed from mortal to
                    immortal and be translated to heaven without seeing
                    death."—Prophets and Kings, p. 227.
                      The change that takes place at translation cannot be under-
                    stood any easier than the miracle of raising a person from the
                    dead. Earthly beings adapted to life in this world will be enabled
                    to transfer to another world, remain for 1000 years, and return.
                    God uses His creative power to make this possible.

                      What miracle of healing in the past can give us an insight
                    into the marvel of translation? Matt. 9:2-8.

                       "It required nothing less than creative power to restore health
                    to that decaying body. The same voice that spoke life to man
                    created from the dust of the earth had spoken life to the dying
                    paralytic. And the same power that gave life to the body had
                    renewed the heart. He who at the creation 'spake, and it was,'
                    who 'commanded, and it stood fast' (Ps. 33:9), had spoken life
                    to the soul dead in trespasses and sins. The healing of the body
                    was an evidence of the power that had renewed the heart. Christ
                    bade the paralytic arise and walk, 'that ye may know,' He said,
                    'that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins.' "

           Part 4   What complete transformation takes place at the resurrec-
FROM CORRUPTION tion?
 TO INCORRUPTION
                    "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mor-
                  tal must put on immortality" (1 Cor. 15:53).

                      The perishable must become imperishable. But in the pro-
                    cess there is no change in identity. This thought is expressed by
                    the verb "put on," which is closely linked with the idea of
                    clothing. The individual accepts a change which is to his advan-
                    tage, but he has not ceased to exist in the process. On the
                    contrary, he has become more fitted for the new estate.
                      It is very difficult to realize in detail the changes that take
                    place when mortal puts on immortality. We are so used to the
                    process of dying, which begins even the moment we are born,
                    that we cannot visualize what is going to happen. But we are so
                    anxious for the change to take place that we are willing to
                    ignore the process and snatch at the result.

                       What will be the end product of the change? Phil. 3:21.

                       "Our vile body" IS contrasted with the "glorious body" of
                    Jesus Christ. "Vile" is rather a harsh term to use in this connec-
                    tion (compare RSV, "lowly body"). The meaning is that our
                    bodies now are subject to the frailties of human flesh, such as a
                    proclivity to sin, to disease, to painful experiences, and to a
                    depressing sense of limitation. All this is exchanged for a
                    "glorious body," one that gives joy and pride, that lives up to all
                    the expectations of the Spirit.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What will it mean to me to have a body like Jesus has?

                        "Restored to the tree of life in the long-lost Eden, the re-
                     deemed will 'grow up' (Malachi 4:2) to the full stature of the race
                     in its primeval glory. The last lingering traces of the curse of sin
                     will be removed, and Christ's faithful ones will appear 'in the
                     beauty of the Lord our God,' in mind and soul and body reflect-

          Part 5   in addition to the change discussed in part 4, what further
 FROM MORTALITY change will occur to the bodies of the saints at Christ's corn-
  TO IMMORTALITY ing?

                       "So when this corruptible shall have put on Incorruption,
                     and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
                     brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
                     up in victory" (1 Cor. 15:54).

                        God never intended that anything should die. It is sin that
                     brought death. God is the author of life and it is His purpose that
                     everything shall reflect His glory throughout eternity. God's
                     avowed purpose, ever since sin entered into the universe, is that
                     sin shall be known for the destructive force that it is, and then be
                     forever rejected. The resurrection is the time when God begins
                     to make all things new.
                        " 'I am the resurrection, and the life.' [John 11:25]. This lan-
                     guage can be used only by the Deity. All created things live by
                     the will and power of God. They are dependent recipients of the
                     life of the Son of God.... All the human beings in our world take
                     their life from Him. He is the spring, the fountain of life."—Ellen
                     G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1113.

                       What did Christ abolish that made immortality possible?
                     2 Tim. 1:10.

                        By wiping out the sin of which man was guilty, Christ
                     abolished the death to which man was subject because of sin. In
                     this way man is enabled to enjoy eternal life that can know no
                     death.
                       "No one less holy than the Only Begotten of the Father, could
                     have offered a sacrifice that would be efficacious to cleanse
                     all—even the most sinful and degraded—who accept the
                     Saviour as their atonement and become obedient to Heaven's
                     law. Nothing less could have reinstated man in God's favor."

                     life? 1 Cor. 15:16, 18, 20.

           Part 6     What will be the greatest of all victories?
        VICTORY
     OVER DEATH       "Death is swallowed up in victory. 0 death, where is thy
                    sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory? ... But thanks be to God,
                    which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ"
                    (1 Cor. 15:54-57).

                      Death is personified here as an enemy that will finally be
                    defeated. Sin is the sting which causes human death. The vic-
                    tory that overcame sin did away with death.
                      There are two kinds of death, one is irrevocable and eternal;
                    the other is temporary and is frequently referred to in the Bible
                    as sleep. Most of the redeemed will have experienced the latter
                    type of death; but praise God, this is not a final death; it is only a
                    short cessation of life until victory over death has been com-
                    pletely achieved.

                      What has made it possible for us to partake of glorious
                    victory? John 11:25.

                       Although Christ is the resurrection and the life, this fact alone
                    is not sufficient to ensure that you and I can live. You and I must -
                    appropriate that life to ourselves by believing in Him who can
                    raise us from the dead.
                       "Many are unwilling to accept of Christ until the whole mys-
                    tery of the plan of salvation shall be made plain to them. They
                    refuse the look of faith, although they see that thousands have
                    looked, and have felt the efficacy of looking, to the cross of
                    Christ. Many wander in the mazes of philosophy, in search of
                    reasons and evidence which they will never find, while they
                    reject the evidence which God has been pleased to give.... If
                    those who were bitten by the serpents had stopped to doubt and
                    question before they would consent to look, they would have
                     perished. It is our duty, first, to look; and the look of faith will
                     give us life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 432.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can I show my belief in the resurrection and hope of
                    eternal life?

                       " 'If any man's work abide, . . . he shall receive a reward.'
                    Glorious will be the reward bestowed when the faithful workers
                    are gathered about the throne of God and the Lamb. When John
                    in his mortal state beheld the glory of God, he fell as one dead;
                    he was not able to endure the sight. But when mortal shall have
                    put on immortality, the ransomed ones are like Jesus, for they
                    see Him as He is. They stand before the throne, signifying that
                    they are accepted. All their sins are blotted out, all their trans-
                    gressions borne away. Now they can look upon the undimmed

Lucifer seduced man into sin, he               But the restoration goes beyond

life, and he lost physical perfection of    struggle of many thousands of years,

to the Creator was lost. All these will     nail-pierced hands—all are aspects of
be restored again by God. Man will          history that will never be erased; they
again be able to communicate directly       ensure that sin can never raise its ugly

magnificent beauty of Eden which was        raises man to a higher level than he
                                            ever attained before. The entrance of
                                            sin was a tragedy. But through God's

               Part 1     How does Isaiah describe the wonders of heaven?
           SOJOURN
          IN HEAVEN       "Since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
                        perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, 0 God, beside
                        thee, what he hath prepared for him that walteth for him" (isa.
                        64:4).

                          It is impossible for man fully to comprehend what God has in
                        store for him. However far he stretches his imagination, he will
                        always be tied to what he has seen. Since God is limitless, He
                        can produce a world of wonders that far exceed man's capacity
                        for visualization, and this is what we are assured will be the case
                        when God effects a restoration.
                          "The nearest we can come to a description of the reward that
                        awaits the overcomer is to say that it is a far more exceeding and
                        eternal weight of glory. It will be an eternity of bliss, a blessed
                        eternity, unfolding new glories throughout the ceaseless
                        ages."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 131.

                          What will the saints be doing in heaven, and how long will It
                        take? Rev. 20:4.

                           At the second coming the wicked will be destroyed when the
                        righteous are raised. The earth will remain a scene of desolation
                        until the end of the thousand years.
                           Meanwhile the saints are in heaven and they have access to
                        the records which have determined who is worthy to be in the
                        kingdom and who is not. If there should be any question in
                        anyone's mind regarding the justice of the treatment meted out
                        to each person, the records are there for confirmation. In this
                        fair way God vindicates His judgments, and everyone will rec-
                        ognize the justice and mercy of God.

THINK IT THROUGH          Why do you think there will be no such thing as boredom
                        in the new earth? What interests can you develop here that
                        you can continue then?

                           In the new earth the redeemed will build houses and inhabit
                        them, plant trees and enjoy their fruit. Since there is no limit to
                        the good that can be done and no end to the variety of occupa-
                        tions that can be indulged in, there can be no time when a
                        person will say, I am tired and bored.
                           How often in our experience, legitimate desires and ambi-
                        tions have been stifled because of lack of time? How many
                        projects and interests have we put aside because there was no
                        time or opportunity? In the heavenly land, with eternity spread
                        out before us, this will never again be a problem. For as long as
                        interest lasts, we may pursue our activities; and as long as
                        desire persists, there will be opportunities to fulfill them.

The Creator and the Restoration             LESSON 12                  ❑  Monday
                                                                         March 20


           Part 2     What makes the first resurrection so important?
   THE FIRST AND
  SECOND DEATHS        "Blessed and holy Is he that hath part in the first resurrec-
                    tion: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall
                    be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a
                    thousand years" (Rev. 20:6).

                       Those who rise in the first resurrection will have passed from
                    death to life. That is what makes the experience so important.
                    Now they can do the work of praising God and attributing to Him
                    all glory and power and the victory over sin. No one will need to
                    tell the other of the goodness of God, but everyone will be
                    anxious to testify to God's loving care and goodness. Rather
                    than being a consuming fire to them, God is a sun and shield. He
                    is now seen to be a Creator and re-Creator.

                      What is the meaning of the expression, "second death"?

                       The first death is the death that has passed on all men be-
                    cause all have sinned (Rom. 3:23). The second death is the final
                    annihilation of the wicked that takes place at the end of the
                    thousand years. After the first death there is hope of a resurrec-
                    tion. But after the second death there is no hope of life. Dean
                    Henry Alford comments, "As there is a second and higher life,
                    so there is a second and deeper death. And as after that there is
                    no more death, so after that death there is no more life."

                     Because the saints are delivered from the second death,
                    what past song of deliverance will they sing? Rev. 15:3.

                       The wicked who are raised after the first death are given only a
                    temporary restoration of life. The righteous who die in the first
                    death have only a temporary sleep. The wicked who are raised
                    temporarily continue their downward march toward eternal
                    death. The righteous continue to live in the presence of God.
                    The wicked are annihilated and cease to exist forever. The
                    righteous are glorified and have eternal life in God.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why Is the second death Just and merciful at the same time?

                       "As the priest, in removing the sins from the sactuary, con-
                    fessed them upon the head of the scapegoat, so Christ will place
                    all these sins upon Satan, the originator and instigator of sin....
                    Thus the great plan of redemption will reach its accomplish-
                    ment in the final eradication of sin and the deliverance of all who
                    have been willing to renounce evil."—The Great Controversy,
                    pp. 485, 486.

        PURIFIED
                       "They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
                     the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire
                     came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
                       "And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
                     whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was
                     found no place for them" (Rev. 20:9, 11).

                       What event of the past is a type of this future event? Gen.
                     7:23; 2 Peter 3:5-7.

                        Fire with its heat is a purifying agent. Through strong heat
                     iron can be cleared of its impurities. Boiling water destroys the
                     living matter within it. Thus the very elementary processes of
                     nature illustrate what God needs to do to purge the earth of all
                     its imperfections and sin. The way is now prepared for a new
                     earth where the former things are forgotten, and all things
                     reflect the perfection of their Creator.
                        "When the flood of waters was at its height upon the earth, it
                     had the appearance of a boundless lake of water. When God
                     finally purifies the earth, it will appear like a boundless lake of
                     fire. As God preserved the ark amid the commotions of the
                     Flood, because it contained eight righteous persons, He will
                     preserve the New Jerusalem, containing the faithful of all ages,
                     from righteous Abel down to the last saint which lived. Although
                     the whole earth, with the exception of that portion where the
                     city rests, will be wrapped in a sea of liquid fire, yet the city is
                     preserved as was the ark, by a miracle of Almighty power. It
                     stands unharmed amid the devouring elements."—Ellen G.
                     White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 986.

                       What expression used in Genesis 1:2 is also used to de-
                     scribe the earth during the 1000 years before it is purified?
                     Gen. 1:2; Jer. 4:23-26.

                       God is a God of order. When He began His creative acts as
                     recorded in Genesis He established form and order, system and
                     beauty, in that which was essentially chaotic. At the end of the
                     thousand years God will restore law and order, beauty and
                     usefulness, to that which has been marred and scarred by sin. In
                     the Edenic state and the condition of the earth during the
                     thousand years we see a contrast between what God desires
                     and what sin has succeeded in achieving.

THINK IT THROUGH       As the saints in the Holy City witness the fires of purification
                     operate all around them, how do you think they feel?

The Creator and the Restoration              LESSON 12             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      March 22


           Part 4     After God purifies the earth of all sin, what will He do?
  A NEW CREATION
                      "I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
                    and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more
                    sea" (Rev. 21:1).

                       "There was no more sea." This expression in the context of
                    the first heaven and the first earth having passed away suggests
                    that there will be none of the activities of the sea which made it a
                    dreadful phenomenon. For instance, the sea separates people
                    by many miles; it can dash a ship against the rocks or swallow
                    the ship with all its passengers and crew without a survivor. It
                    can be seen as an inexorable power as it pounds mercilessly
                    along the shore. There will be no such frightening phenomenon
                    in the earth made new. At the same time there is a sea of glass
                    before the throne (Rev. 4:6). Whatever there is good about a sea
                    will be there.
                       "John is probably emphasizing the fact that the new heavens
                    and earth will be created from the purified elements of the old,
                    and thus be new in quality, different. The new heavens and the
                    new earth are, then, a re-creation, a forming anew of existing
                    elements, and not a creation ex nihilo."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                    tary, vol. 7, p. 889.
                       Some of the events of Creation Week will be repeated again.
                    The surface of the earth must be made into a suitable habitat for
                    living things. Plants and animals will be created. What a grand
                    opportunity the saints will have to witness Creation again!

                      How does Isaiah describe what happens when the new
                    earth is created? Isa. 65:17.

THINK IT THROUGH      What are aspects of life that you look forward to in the new
                    earth which will be different from what you experience now?

                      It will be a joy to be free from the shackles of sin, to see beauty
                    and cooperation in every element of nature. There will be cool-
                    ing springs of water, and luscious fruits to pluck from trees that
                    produce abundantly. The tree of life will invigorate every part of
                    the body. No more pain or weary striving; no frustrations or
                    disappointments. Somehow the whole being is raised to praise
                    the One who has provided such constant delight and ever grow-
                    ing experience.

                                                                         March 23


            Part 5      Every nation has a capital, a seat of government and author-
      JESUS WITH     ity. What will be the capital of the earth made new?
      HIS PEOPLE
                       "I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
                     God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her hus-
                     band. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold,
                     the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,
                     and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
                     them, and be their God" (Rev. 21:2, 3).

                        God has always wanted to be with His people. In the Garden of
                     Eden there is a clear picture of communication between God
                     and Adam and Eve. Sin brought about a separation of man from
                     God, but God still sought to communicate with men, as He did
                     with Cain when he sinned. In the wilderness of Sinai God asked
                     for a tabernacle to be built so that He could be in the midst of His
                     people. In the earth made new that objective of closeness be-
                     tween Creator and created will be realized.

                       How is the Holy City further described? Rev. 21:4, 10-27;
                     22:1-6.

                       The symbol of the bride is very striking. Note how an impor-
                     tant feature of the bride is her dress (Rev. 19:8). Note that the
                     symbol of marriage is to express the close and indissoluble
                     union that is to exist between Christ and His people. Also the
                     church is referred to as the bride of Christ. (See 2 Cor. 11:2.)

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is closeness to people so important to God?

                       The mutual relationship between God and His people shows
                     the high regard God has for them, and the great condescension
                     of God that He, the Creator and Source of all being, will as-
                     sociate on a personal level with His created beings. God is not
                     so much possessive as communicative, which means that His
                     presence brings incalculable blessings, and is the spring of
                     eternal happiness.
                       "By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than
                     recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's
                     purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and
                     man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if
                     we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound
                     Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through
                     the eternal ages He is linked with us. 'God so loved the world,
                     that He gave His only-begotten Son.' John 3:16. He gave Him not
                     only to bear our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to
                     the fallen race."—The Desire of Ages, p. 25.

The Creator and the Restoration              LESSON 12                    ❑ Friday
                                                                          March 24


          Part 6   What aspect of restoration makes the new earth state an
     • ETERNAL embodiment of eternal perfection?
     PERFECTION
                   "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
                 shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
                 shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
                 away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all
                 things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are
                 true and faithful" (Rev. 21:4, 5).

                     It is noteworthy that before a perfect universe can be erected
                   the old has to be taken away. Any work of reform will involve
                   some tearing down. (See Jer. 1:10.) The authority given to
                   Jeremiah involved pulling down and uprooting as well as build-
                   ing and planting.
                     What is taken away is always worthless, sometimes positively
                   harmful. Whatever it is, it cannot be built into the new. Among
                   the things that will disappear with this old world will be the bitter
                   tears and sorrow expressed in crying. In particular there will be
                   no more death. The way is opened now for an existence that will
                   have no end, an existence that will always be joyful.

                     What kind of people will not be found in the earth made
                   new? Rev. 21:8; 22:15.

                      These verses show clearly how different the new earth will be
                   from conditions that exist in the world today. Can you see why
                   these people are not found in the kingdom?

                     What kind of people will be found in the earth made new?
                   Rev. 14:4, 5; 7:14.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the basis for believing that what God promises He
                   will fulfill?

                     "Wherever we looked, everything upon which the eye rested
                   was beautiful and holy. And all the redeemed host, old and
                   young, great and small, cast their glittering crowns at the feet of
                   their Redeemer, and prostrated themselves in adoration before
                   Him, and worshiped Him that lived forever and ever."—Early
                   Writings, p. 295.
                     Although the earth will have no reminder of sin, there will be
                   one evidence that forever will be with the redeemed.
                     "Jesus will present His hands with the marks of His crucifix-
                   ion. The marks of this cruelty He will ever bear. Every print of the
                   nails will tell the story of man's wonderful redemption and the
                   dear price by which it was purchased."—Early Writings, p. 179.

                                The widow's mite. It wasn't
                                much. Yet it was
                                everything. God isn't
                                preoccupied with the
                                amount we give but He is
                                concerned with what's
                                going on in our heart as we
                                give. The widow's love
                                made her gift a fortune!

                                God has chosen to
                                advance His work through
                                you and your gift. But not
                                by twisting your arm. He
                                knows that if you've really
                                given Him your heart, you'll
                                also give your dollars.

                                When you reach into your
                                purse or wallet to support
                                the Sabbath School offering
                                this week, reach into your
                                heart also. That's where
                                God is looking when
                                you give.
