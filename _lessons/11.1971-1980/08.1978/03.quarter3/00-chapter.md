           Dear Sabbath School Member:

           How I wish you could come with me this Sabbath to worship in the crowded
           chapel of the Middle East College in Beirut. After participating in the
           lively Sabbath School exercises and joining in the spirited discussions
           in the classes we would stroll across the campus to visit some of the
           dormitory rooms. Here you will meet and speak to Bereket from Ethiopia,
           Wavomba from Kenya, Mugerwa from Uganda, Yousefi of Iran, Habib who comes
           from ancient Egypt and Sabah whose home Baghdad is near the Bible city of
           Babylon.

           These are representative of the 30 nations and language groups who enjoy
           the simple but adequate amenities of the men's dormitory because of the
           generosity of your Sabbath School offerings in 1976. Each student would
           greet you warmly in an appreciative hand clasp with sincere words which
           would assure you that your investment was one which will give you satis-
           faction for time and eternity.

            If we could speed south 2,500 miles to a beautiful hill on the side of
            Lake Victoria, we would be welcomed by the beaming smile of Mr Don Swan,
            the charming and enthusiastic manager of the Africa Herald Publishing
            House. With a sense of pride he will escort you through the spotlessly
            clean and efficient plant to the new offset printing machine which is busy
            churning out literature in 16 languages as a result of your offering in
            1976. He would relate the thrilling story of the miraculous and provi-
            dential experiences he went through in obtaining the very best machine at
            a fraction of its market value - God has multiplied your gift in a spec-
            tacular way. Together you will breathe a prayer that those thousands of
            pages which are speeding through the Heidelberg machine will reach their
            heaven ordained destination.

            This quarter your offerings and gifts will be helping three very promis-
            ing new projects.
                     1.   The expansion of the Parane School, beautifully situated in the
                          highlands of Tanzania. New classrooms and equipment will enrich
                          the lives of potential workers in this rapidly expanding field.
                     2.   New schools will be opened along the banks of the Nile to provide
                          Seventh-day Adventist Education for the children of members in
                          this land which has experienced so many spectacular miracles.
                     3.   In Ethiopia where our membership is doubling every few years,
                          the need adequately to house the new congregations, ministers
                          and schools is way beyond the resources of the membership. You
                          will help erect simple but representative homes for our district
                          leaders who sometimes care for twelve or fifteen churches in
                          areas where baptisms are conducted any day of the week to meet
                          the demands of the expanding work.

            We appreciate the prayers and the sharing of means which the Sabbath School
            affords.

             God bless you each in these exciting days as you share with us in the spirit-
             ual harvesting in which we are engaged.

             Yours sincerely,



             C D Watson, President
             Afro-Mideast Division

                EDUCATION FOR ETERNITY
                                     Introduction
    The year 1978 has been designated Education Year in the Seventh-day Adventist
Church. These lessons have been prepared to harmonize with this important theme.
Most Sabbath School members who study these lessons will not be engaged in a
formal course of study in a school. But school is only one kind of education. There are
others. Ellen White has pointed out to us that "our ideas of education take too narrow
and too low a range.... It has to do with the whole being, and with the whole period of
existence possible to man."—Education, p. 13. The church, the home, the job, the
social life, as well as the school, are educational agencies. All of life is an educational
process. This broad view of education is the subject of these 14 lessons.
    This broad Christian education is the way in which God changes human nature and
makes it Christlike. God enables a person to enter once more into the happy, fruitful
relationship that was interrupted by sin. Every man, woman, and child, regardless of
age or marital status, should be a learner in the school of Christ.
    God intends that every Christian shall be not only a learner but also a teacher in the
educational process of redemption. "Go . . . teach all nations" is a command that
might have been performed long ago by angels from heaven. But God in His infinite
wisdom chose to make human beings the transmitters of His transforming message
 because in teaching others we are benefited ourselves.
     Parents are teachers who learn as they teach. "The restoration and uplifting of
humanity begins in the home."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 349. Those who take
 upon themselves the responsibility for bringing a new life into the world also acquire
 the responsibility of feeding, clothing, and educating for God the child they have
 engendered. Young people who contemplate marriage and establishment of a new
 home should be conscious of this element in their planning for the future.
     Jesus said, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me" (John
12:32). Christ is the center of Christian education. Beholding Him, looking to Him, the
 beholder may be changed into His likeness.
     The lessons this quarter trace God's educational effort from the first school He
 established in the garden down through the Bible record of world history and into the
 school of the hereafter. The thrilling opportunities in the world to come, the chance to
 explore every avenue of interest without limitation of time or resources, should
 inspire us to allow the Lord to prepare us for admission to that school. We might have
 been there long ago were we not such slow learners in the classroom here below—so
 slow in applying to our teaching and witnessing the principles exemplified in the
  work of the Master Teacher. Let us look more closely to Him!
     Christian education, as taught and practiced in varying degrees of perfection by
  Seventh-day Adventists, is derived from biblical injunctions and examples contained
  in these lessons. The light of Holy Scripture is cast into a broad spectrum of applica-
  tion through the prism of Ellen White's book Education and other books and compila-
  tions accepted as divinely inspired for our time.
     One may recognize in these writings principles previously advocated by other great
  educators. Comenius stressed character education and visual stimulation. Pes-
  talozzi stressed the educational importance of early childhood. Thoreau, a contem-
  porary of Ellen White, postulated in Walden that students would appreciate their
  schools more if they constructed the buildings with their own hands. Oberlin College
   pioneered the implementation of a work-study program in contemporary America.
      The very first chapter of the book Education acknowledges a Source behind all
   "sources" of thought about education. "As the moon and the stars [planets] of our
   solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun, so, as far as their teaching is true,
   do the world's great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun of Righteousness."—Page 14.
      So wherever you are in the school of life, join with your fellow Sabbath School
   members in a study of Education for Eternity.

                      With what environment did God surround man in the sinless
                    beginning of this world?

                       " 'The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
                    there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the
                    ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to
                    the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of
                    the garden.' Genesis 2:8, 9. Here, amidst the beautiful scenes of
                    nature untouched by sin, our first parents were to receive their
                    education."—Education, pp. 20, 21.
                       Moses, Elijah, Jesus, John the Baptist, and Paul all retired to
                    the solitude of nature in search of communion with God and
                    inspiration for their work for Him. In some cases God's servants
                    were driven to quiet places by persecution or the consequences
                    of their own mistakes, but God used these circumstances to
                    speak with His "still, small voice."
                       Notice God's plan, even before sin entered, for man's de-
                    velopment as human population spread across the earth:
                       "The Garden of Eden was a representation of what God de-
                    sired the whole earth to become, and it was His purpose that, as
                    the human family increased in numbers, they should establish
                    other homes and schools like the one He had given. Thus in
                    course of time the whole earth might be occupied with homes
                    and schools where the words and the works of God should be
                    studied, and where the students should thus be fitted more and
                    more fully to reflect, throughout endless ages, the light of the
                    knowledge of His glory."—Education, p. 22.

THINK IT THROUGH      What does nature say when she speaks to me?

                         "To him who in the love of Nature holds
                          Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
                         A various language: for his gayer hours
                         She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
                         And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
                         Into his darker musings, with a mild
                         And healing sympathy that steals away
                         Their sharpness ere he is aware."
                                                  —William Cullen Bryant.
                       "The poet and the naturalist have many things to say about
                    nature, but it is the Christian who enjoys the beauty of the earth
                    with the highest appreciation, because he recognizes his Fa-
                    ther's handiwork and perceives His love in flower and shrub and
                    tree. No one can fully appreciate the significance of hill and
                    vale, river and sea, who does not look upon them as an expres-
                    sion of God's love to man."--Steps to Christ, p. 87.

                                                                          June 26
         Part 2   Who directed the learning experiences of Adam and Eve in
    THE TEACHER the garden?

                       "Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the
                    field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to
                    see what he would call them" (Gen. 2:19).
                       "They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the gar-
                    den in the cool of the day" (Gen. 3:8, RSV).

                      Out of His special regard for His children, our heavenly Father
                    personally directed the education of Adam and Eve. "Often they
                    were visited by His messengers, the holy angels, and from them
                    received counsel and instruction. Often as they walked in the
                    garden in the cool of the day they heard the voice of God, and
                    face to face held communion with the Eternal. His thoughts
                    toward them were 'thoughts of peace, and not of evil.' Jeremiah
                    29:11. His every purpose was their highest good."—Education,
                    p. 21.

                      What has God stood ready to do for His people even after sin
                    came into the world? Isa. 30:20, 21; Ps. 32:8.

                       For a whole quarter, in 1976, the world Sabbath School
                    studied, under the topic "God Is Not Silent," the ways in which
                    God seeks to communicate with man. When a message is of
                    life-and-death importance, it may be sent through several
                    channels in the hope that the message may be received through
                    one of them. This is what God has done through nature, through
                    His Son, through the Bible, through angels, through human
                    witnesses, and through the spirit of prophecy.

                       When will God's plan again encompass face-to-face rela-
                    tionship with human beings? Rev. 21:3; 22:3, 4.

 THINK IT THROUGH     "The world has had its great teachers, men of giant intellect
                    and extensive research, men whose utterances have stimulated
                    thought and opened to view vast fields of knowledge; and these
                    men have been honored as guides and benefactors of their
                    race; but there is One who stands higher than they. We can trace
                    the line of the world's teachers as far back as human records
                    extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the
                    stars of our solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun,
                    so, as far as their teaching is true, do the world's great thinkers
                    reflect the rays of the Sun of Righteousness. Every gleam of
                    thought, every flash of the intellect, is from the Light of the
                    world."—Education, pp. 13, 14.

The School in a Garden             LESSON 1                              ❑ Tuesday
                                                                              June 27
            Part 3    "Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the
       THE SUBJECT field, and every fowl of the air: and brought them unto Adam to
           MATTER see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
                    every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam
                    gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every
                    beast of the field" (Gen. 2:19, 20).

                         The information the Bible provides regarding Creation Week
                      and the first thousand years of human existence is very sketchy,
                      but it is enough to let us understand that God put man in touch
                      with the world of nature. Assigning names to living things is
                      even today an intellectual challenge. It requires an understand-
                      ing of many factors that serve as the basis for classification.
                      There are broad categories such as phylum, division, class, and
                      order, and more narrow categories such as family, genus,
                      species, and variety. The names given by Adam were not the
                      scientific names used in textbooks today, but no doubt revealed
                      a keen observation of nature.
                         "Nature was the lesson book," says Ellen White quoted in the
                      introduction to this week's lesson. "The book of nature, which
                      spread its living lessons before them, afforded an exhaustless
                      source of instruction and delight. On every leaf of the forest and
                      stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth and sea
                      and sky, God's name was written. With both the animate and the
                      inanimate creation—with leaf and flower and tree, and with
                      every living creature, from the leviathan of the waters to the
                      mote in the sunbeam—the dwellers in Eden held converse,
                      gathering from each the secrets of its life. God's glory in the
                      heavens, the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions,
                      'the balancings of the clouds' (Job 37:16), the mysteries of light
                      and sound, of day and night—all were objects of study by the
                      pupils of earth's first school.
                         "The laws and operations of nature, and the great principles
                      of truth that govern the spiritual universe, were opened to their
                      minds by the infinite Author of all. In 'the light of the knowledge
                      of the glory of God' (2 Corinthians 4:6), their mental and
                      spiritual powers developed, and they realized the highest plea-
                      sures of their holy existence."—Education, pp. 21, 22.

The School in a Garden          LESSON 1                          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      June 28
         Part 4   "The Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be
        SOCIAL alone; I will make him an help meet for him.... And the Lord
   DEVELOPMENT caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he
                took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
                and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he
                a woman, and brought her unto the man" (Gen. 2:18-22).

                       Loneliness is not a part of God's recommended way of life for
                   men and women. It may be a necessary consequence of stand-
                   ing for the right in a world of sin. It may be one of the prices that
                   people pay when they accept responsibilities of leadership or
                   command. To Joshua God said, "As I was with Moses, so I will
                   be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" (Joshua 1:5).
                   To His people God said through Isaiah (43:2, 5): "When thou
                   passest through the waters, I will be with thee." "Fear not: for I
                   am with thee." Esther and Daniel stood alone, at times, except
                   for the company of God and His angels.
                       But even when God's presence was in the Garden of Eden, He
                   provided human companionship as an important part of human
                   development. An only child in a family tends to miss something
                   that enriches the lives of children in larger families. And schools
                   do well to emphasize the social graces along with intellectual
                   and manual skills. One of the advantages of dormitory life is
                    learning to get along with other young people of varied temper-
                    aments and backgrounds.
                       Ellen White has left us the following comment on today's
                    scripture: "The Eden home of our first parents was prepared for
                    them by God Himself. When He had furnished it with everything
                    that man could desire, He said: 'Let Us make man in Our image,
                    after Our likeness.' . . .
                       "The Lord was pleased with this last and noblest of all His
                     creatures, and designed that he should be the perfect inhabi-
                    tant of a perfect world. But it was not His purpose that man
                    should live in solitude. He said: 'It is not good that the man
                    should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.'
                       "God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided 'an help
                    meet for him'—a helper corresponding to him—one who was
                    fitted to be his companion, and who could be one with him in
                     love and sympathy. Eve was created from a rib taken from the
                     side of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him as the
                     head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to
                     stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him.
                     A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was
                     his second self; showing the close union and the affectionate
                     attachment that should exist in this relation."—The Adventist

             Part 5     What provision did God make for testing the character de-
        CHARACTER     velopment of the students In the Eden school?
      DEVELOPMENT
                         "Out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree
                      that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life
                      also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of
                      good and evil."
                         "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every
                      tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the
                      knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the
                      day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:9,
                      16, 17).

                         Adam and Eve, though created innocent and holy, were not
                      placed beyond the possibility of wrongdoing. God made them
                      free to choose, capable of appreciating the wisdom and benevo-
                      lence of His character and the justice of His requirements, with
                      full liberty to yield or to withhold obedience.
                         "At the very beginning of man's existence a check was placed
                      upon the desire for self-indulgence, the fatal passion that lay at
                      the foundation of Satan's fall. The tree of knowledge, which
                      stood near the tree of life in the midst of the garden, was to be a
                      test of the obedience, faith, and love of our first parents. While
                      permitted to eat freely of every other tree, they were forbidden to
                      taste of this, on pain of death. They were also to be exposed to
                      the temptations of Satan; but if they endured the trial, they
                      would finally be placed beyond his power, to enjoy perpetual
                      favor with God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 48, 49.

The School in a Garden         LESSON 1                              ❑ Friday
                                                                      June 30
        Part 6     "The Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of
    PRODUCTIVE Eden to dress it and to keep it" (Gen. 2:15).
      ACTIVITY
                   It appears to have been part of God's plan that useful manual
               labor should contribute to the balanced education offered in
               Eden's model school.
                   "To Adam and Eve was committed the care of the garden, 'to
               dress it and to keep it.' Genesis 2:15. Though rich in all that the
               Owner of the universe could supply, they were not to be idle.
               Useful occupation was appointed them as a blessing, to
               strengthen the body, to expand the mind, and to develop the
               character."—Education, p. 21.
                   Through the week we have seen a balanced combination of
               activities in the life of man as he came from the Creator's hand.
               This has included communion with God, intellectual probing of
               the natural world, social development in sharing life with a
               human companion. It has also included character development
               through useful, productive manual labor.
                   This balance requires conscious effort on the part of outdoor
               people to cultivate the intellectual and the spiritual. And it re-
                quires a special effort on the part of sedentary workers and
                brain workers to foster the physical exercise necessary for the
                maintaining of health. Although sports can furnish some vigor-
                ous exercise, there is an additional dimension of satisfaction
                and creativity in productive manual work in the out-of-doors.
                Many church members could benefit from the same counsel
                given to ministers through God's messenger:
                    "If all our workers were so situated that they could spend a
                few hours each day in outdoor labor, and felt free to do this, it
                would be a blessing to them. . . .
                    "Some of our ministers feel that they must every day perform
                some labor that they can report to the conference. And as the
                result of trying to do this, their efforts are too often weak and
                inefficient. They should have periods of rest, of entire freedom
                from taxing labor. But these cannot take the place of daily
                physical exercise.
                    "Brethren, when you take time to cultivate your garden, thus
                gaining the exercise needed to keep the system in good work-
                ing order, you are just as much doing the work of God as in
                holding meetings."—Gospel Workers, p. 240.
                    To the teachers in our early schools similar words of counsel
                were given, no doubt for their own good as much as for the
                 learning experience furnished to students:
                    "Several hours each day should be devoted to working with
                 the students in some line of manual training."—Counsels to

                                                                         July 2
         Part 1   "He removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
      ABRAHAM   Bethel, and pitched his tent ... : and there he builded an altar
     AND ISAAC unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord" (Gen.
                12:8).

                     The first notable example of parental instruction and its re-
                  sults is found in the life of Abram, who erected an altar to the
                  Lord wherever he pitched his tent (see also Gen. 13:18 and PP
                  128). The key text for the week was spoken by God referring to
                  Abraham: "I know him, that he will command his children and
                  his household after him."
                     The fellowship of father and son in worshiping God is evident:
                  "I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to
                  you" (Gen. 22:5).
                     Apparently Abraham's devotional habits were effectively
                  transmitted to Isaac. On the eve of his wedding to Rebecca we
                  find Isaac in a unique setting for his evening worship: "Isaac
                  went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up
                  his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming" (Gen.
                 24:63). No doubt while he was praying, the answer was on the
                  way!
                     "Like the patriarchs of old, those who profess to love God
                 should erect an altar to the Lord wherever they pitch their tent. If
                 ever there was a time when every house should be a house of
                 prayer, it is now. Fathers and mothers should often lift up their
                 hearts to God in humble supplication for themselves and their
                 children. Let the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the
                 altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice, while the wife
                 and children unite in prayer and praise. In such a household
                 Jesus will love to tarry."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 144.
                     "Not until parents themselves walk in the law of the Lord with
                 perfect hearts will they be prepared to command their children
                 after them. A reformation in this respect is needed—a reforma-
                 tion which shall be deep and broad. Parents need to reform;
                 ministers need to reform; they need God in their households. If
                 they would see a different state of things, they must bring His
                 word into their families and must make it their counselor. They
                 must teach their children that it is the voice of Godaddressed to
                 them, and is to be implicitly obeyed. They should patiently
                 instruct their children, kindly and untiringly teach them how to
                 live in order to please God. The children of such a household are
                 prepared to meet the sophistries of infidelity. They have ac-
                 cepted the Bible as the basis of their faith, and they have a
                 foundation that cannot be swept away by the incoming tide of
                 skepticism."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 143.

                                                                             July 3
         Part 2      "Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock
     JACOB AND     with his brethren.... Now Israel loved Joseph more than all
        JOSEPH     his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he
                   made him a coat of many colours. And when his brethren saw
                   that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they
                   hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him" (Gen.
                   37:2-4).

                     This second notable home in Bible history reveals problems
                   that resulted from the seeds of deceit sown early in Jacob's life.
                   He was himself deceived, and his children's loyalties were di-
                   vided among four mothers. In addition to this, Jacob made a
                   mistake in showing favoritism to Joseph. At seventeen, Joseph
                   was a spoiled child. But there was a basic solid foundation
                   which God used to good purpose, not only for Joseph, but for
                   His plan to save the human race! Watch for the drama in this
                   scene!
                     "As the caravan journeyed southward toward the borders of
                   Canaan, the boy could discern in the distance the hills among
                   which lay his father's tents.... What a change in situation—from
                   the tenderly cherished son to the despised and helpless slave!

                      "But, in the providence of God, even this experience was to
                   be a blessing to him. He had learned in a few hours that which
                   years might not otherwise have taught him.... Faults had been
                   encouraged that were now to be corrected. He was becoming
                   self-sufficient and exacting. Accustomed to the tenderness of
                   his father's care, he felt that he was unprepared to cope with the
                   difficulties before him, in the bitter, uncared-for life of a
                   stranger and a slave.
                      "Then his thoughts turned to his father's God. In his child-
                   hood he had been taught to love and fear Him. Often in his
                   father's tent he had listened to the story of the vision that Jacob
                   saw as he fled from his home an exile and a fugitive. He had
                   been told of the Lord's promises to Jacob, and how they had
                   been fulfilled—how, in the hour of need, the angels of God had
                   come to instruct, comfort, and protect him. And he had learned
                   of the love of God in providing for men a Redeemer. Now all
                   these precious lessons came vividly before him. Joseph be-
                   lieved that the God of his fathers would be his God. He then and
                   there gave himself fully to the Lord. . . .
                      "One day's experience had been the turning point in Joseph's
                   life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 213, 214.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what beautiful words did Joseph express the way In
                   which God had overruled the well-intentioned mistakes of his

             Part 3      "By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of
         JOCHEBED     his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they
        AND MOSES     were not afraid of the king's commandment. By faith Moses,
                      when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of
                      Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with
                      the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
                      season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than
                      the treasures in Egypt.... For he endured, as seeing him who
                      is invisible" (Heb. 11:23-27).

                         Abraham and Jacob have been cited as examples of godly
                      fathers whose influence was reflected in the lives of their sons.
                      Jochebed was a woman of the tribe of Levi, the tribe later to be
                      charged with the religious instruction of an entire nation. Cer-
                      tainly she made wonderful use of the short time that was
                      granted to her for the education of the baby rescued from the
                      waters of the river Nile (Ex. 2:2-9). Mothers, especially, should
                      find encouragement in thinking about the content of today's
                      lesson.
                         "The whole future life of Moses, the great mission which he
                      fulfilled as the leader of Israel, testifies to the importance of the
                      work of the Christian mother. There is no other work that can
                      equal this. To a very great extent the mother holds in her own
                      hands the destiny of her children. She is dealing with develop-
                      ing minds and characters, working not alone for time, but for
                      eternity. She is sowing seed that will spring up and bear fruit,
                      either for good or for evil. She has not to paint a form of beauty
                      upon canvas or to chisel it from marble, but to impress upon a
                      human soul the image of the divine. Especially during their early
                      years the responsibility rests upon her of forming the character
                      of her children. The impressions now made upon their develop-
                      ing minds will remain with them all through life. . . . They are
                      placed in our care to be trained, not as heirs to the throne of an
                      earthly empire, but as kings unto God, to reign through unend-
                      ing ages."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 244.

THINK IT THROUGH         "Let every mother feel that her moments are priceless; her
                      work will be tested in the solemn day of accounts. Then it will be
                      found that many of the failures and crimes of men and women
                      have resulted from the ignorance and neglect of those whose
                      duty it was to guide their childish feet in the right way. Then it
                      will be found that many who have blessed the world with the
                      light of genius and truth and holiness, owe the principles that
                      were the mainspring of their influence and success to a praying,

         Part 4     "For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my
       HANNAH     petition which I asked of him: therefore also have I lent him to
   AND SAMUEL     the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And
                  he worshipped the Lord there" (1 Sam. 1:27, 28).

                     The fourth parent in this week's lesson is Hannah. She was
                  the one who went to the sanctuary at Shiloh with a heavy burden
                  on her heart. It was not only the hurt of Peninnah's scorn and
                  ridicule that weighed on her, but the unfulfilled longing of
                  having a child to hold in her arms. The round of ceremonies in
                  the tabernacle, the bright-colored embroidery on the veil, the
                  precious stones on the vestment of the high priest—none of the
                  elements of the divine service were sufficient to retain her atten-
                  tion. "She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord,
                  and wept sore" (1 Sam. 1:10). Her lips moved, but tier voice was
                  not heard, and Eli thought that she was under the influence of
                  alcohol.
                     The depth and earnestness of her desire, intensified by delay
                  of fulfillment, made her appreciative of God's gift when at last
                  her wish was granted and Samuel was born. "He was her only
                  son, the special gift of heaven; but she had received him as a
                  treasure consecrated to God, and she would not withhold from
                  the Giver His own."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 571. Hannah's
                  devotion followed Samuel into the years he spent under Eli's
                  tutelage in the sanctuary, opening and closing the doors,
                  sweeping, tending the lamps.
                     "From the earliest dawn of intellect she had taught her son to
                  love and reverence God and to regard himself as the Lord's. By
                   every familiar object surrounding him she had sought to lead
                   his thoughts up to the Creator. When separated from her child,
                   the faithful mother's solicitude did not cease. Every day he was
                   the subject of her prayers. Every year she made, with her own
                   hands, a robe of service for him; and as she went up with her
                   husband to worship at Shiloh, she gave the child this reminder
                   of her love. Every fiber of the little garment had been woven with
                   a prayer that he might be pure, noble, and true. She did not ask
                   for her son worldly greatness, but she earnestly pleaded that he
                   might attain that greatness which Heaven values—that he might
                   honor God and bless his fellow men.
                      "What a reward was Hannah's! and what an encouragement
                   to faithfulness is her example!"—Patriarchs and Prophets,

                        Daniel and his companions were chosen because of qualities

                      what Daniel's home and home training must have been like.
                     There is evidence of health ("well favoured"), of intellectual
                     development ("skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowl-
                     edge"), and also of social graces and character development
                     ("ability . . . to stand in the king's palace").
                        Today's lesson deserves special attention from young people
                     because in universities today they are often thrown into the
                     company of the future intellectual leaders of their country.
                        "You should be prepared to follow the example of these noble
                     youth [Joseph, Daniel, and his fellows]. Never be ashamed of
                     your colors; put them on, unfurl them to the gaze of men and

                       Notice that Daniel did not enter the university of Babylon
                     because of selfish ambition. He was placed there through cir-
                     cumstances that God used to further His own purposes.
                     Daniel's character was the result of faithful early education in
                     his godly home. And God could use him to penetrate the highest

     ELISABETH,       "When they had performed all things according to the law of
JESUS AND JOHN      the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
                    And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
                    wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. Now his parents
                    went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover."
                      "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour
                    with God and man" (Luke 2:39-41, 52).

                        The formative years of the Son of God were spent in a quiet
                     mountain village. The educational experiences of the annual
                     feasts in Jerusalem were part of God's plan for the education of
                     Israel. Jesus' parents obediently followed God's plan in taking
                     their child to the Passover when He reached the age of twelve. A
                   ' balanced growth of the intellectual and the physical, of the
                     spiritual and the social—all these are expressed in the three
                     verses cited above.
                        The following paragraph by Ellen White gives us a picture of
                     the family school in Nazareth: "With deep earnestness the
                     mother of Jesus watched the unfolding of His powers, and
                     beheld the impress of perfection upon His character. With de-
                     light she sought to encourage that bright, receptive mind.
                     Through the Holy Spirit she received wisdom to co-operate with
                     the heavenly agencies in the development of this child, who
                     could claim only God as His Father."—The Desire of Ages, p. 69.

                       What does the Bible record tell us of divine planning for the
                    life of Jesus' cousin, John the Baptist, and of his parents'
                    concern for carrying out the divine instructions? Luke 1:13-15,
                    60, 76-79.

                      What was the result of their faithfulness? Luke 1:80.

                       "John was to stand as a reformer. By his abstemious life and

                        The book of Deuteronomy is composed of four orations given
                      by Moses to the people of Israel before he climbed the heights of
                       Mount Nebo. He turned over to Joshua the leadership of the

      REPEATED God?

                    "These words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
                  thy heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy chil-
                  dren, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house,
                  and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down,
                  and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign
                  upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine
                  eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house,
                  and on thy gates" (Deut. 6:6-9).

                      These memorable words are part of Moses' second great
                   oration, recorded in Deuteronomy 4:44 to 26:19. There is not
                   necessarily any reference here to formal education in a class-
                   room. The context is that of the family home; Moses speaks of
                   conversation during shared activities, of evening and morning
                   communion, of visible reminders in prominent locations in the
                   home. But there is no question as to the responsibility that God
                   places upon parents for the religious upbringing of their chil-
                   dren. The final paragraph of the passage referred to in the
                   introduction to this lesson states: "The Lord would use the
                   church school as an aid to the parents in educating and prepar-
                   ing their children for this time before us. Then let the church
                   take hold of the school work in earnest and make it what the
                   Lord desires it to be."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 167.
                      In ancient Israel the parents had the main responsibility, but
                   God also appointed the Levites to be scattered throughout all
                   the tribes as teachers of the law of God.
                      "From the earliest times the faithful in Israel had given much
                   care to the education of the youth. The Lord had directed that
                   even from babyhood the children should be taught of His good-
                   ness and His greatness, especially as revealed in His law, and
                   shown in the history of Israel. Song and prayer and lessons from
                   the Scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind. Fathers
                   and mothers were to instruct their children that the law of God is
                   an expression of His character, and that as they received the
                   principles of the law into the heart, the image of God was traced
                   on mind and soul. Much of the teaching was oral; but the youth
                   also learned to read the Hebrew writings; and the parchment
                    rolls of the Old Testament Scriptures were open to their

                       "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
                     he will not depart from it" (Prov. 22:6).

                        God's command to Israel, given through Moses, is repeated
                     again through these words of Solomon: "Train up a child in the
                     way he should go."
                        "This language is positive. The training that Solomon enjoins
                     is to direct, educate, develop. But in order for parents to do this
                     work, they must themselves understand the 'way' the child
                     should go. It is impossible for parents to give their children

                       What is the most difficult part of training a child "in the way
                     he should go"?

                        "Physical training, the development of the body, is far more
                     easily given than spiritual training. The nursery, the playground,
                     the workshop; the sowing of the seed; and the gathering of the
                     harvest—all these give physical training. Under ordinarily fa-
                     vorable circumstances a child naturally gains healthful vigor
                     and proper development of the bodily organs. Yet even in phys-
                     ical lines the child should be carefully trained.
                        "Soul culture, which gives purity and elevation to the
                     thoughts and fragrance to word and act, requires more
                     painstaking effort. It takes patience to keep every evil motive
                     weeded from the garden of the heart. The spiritual training
                     should in no case be neglected; for 'the fear of the Lord is the
                     beginning of wisdom' Psalm 111:10. By some, education is
                     placed next to religion, but true education is religion. The Bible
                     should be the child's first textbook. From this book, parents are
                     to give wise instruction."—Counsels to Teachers, pp. 108, 109.
                       Sanctification, both for adults and for little children, can be
                     said to be the work of the Holy Spirit in aiding us to develop a
                     new set of habits. Someone has said that we are fortunate in that
                     good habits are just as hard to break as bad habits. This is
                     probably true of acquired ways of responding to situations. But
                     because of our inherited tendencies to sin (to bad habits), we
                     contantly need to be dependent on the presence and the ena-
                     bling grace of Christ to make us "more than conquerors
                     through him who loved us."

God's Command: Religious Education              LESSON 3 ❑ Wednesday
                                                              July 12
          Part 4     "0 thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
       ALL THY     behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
      CHILDREN     foundations with sapphires. And I will make thy windows of
                   agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of
                   pleasant stones. And all thy children shall be taught of the
                   Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children" (Isa.
                   54:11-13).

                      To whom are these dramatic, encouraging, poetic words
                   spoken? The context gives us the clue. Who, although barren
                   will break forth into singing (verse 1)? Who is to enlarge the
                   place of her tent, to lengthen her cords and strengthen her
                   stakes (verse 2)? Who is the forsaken woman (verses 5, 6)? Who
                   will have mountains of obstacles removed before her (verses 9,
                   10)? Ancient Israel, of which the antitype is the Christian
                   church, is beautifully pictured in the whole chapter—her trials
                   and her triumphs.
                      Tucked away in verse 13, above, is an expression that has
                   been a great comfort to Christian parents who are separated
                   from their children—"All thy children shall be taught of the
                   Lord." The seal of one of our colleges established in the early
                   days of the church contains this promise. It is an all-inclusive
                   statement regarding the education of the children of the
                   church. The Lord Himself will teach them, according to this
                   prophecy, and the result will be great peace. The ultimate ful-
                   fillment of the prophecy, no doubt, refers to conditions in the
                   earth made new. But it is evident from statements in the writings
                   of Ellen White that God designs part of the triumph of the
                   church even here below to be the establishment of church
                   schools.
                       "In some countries parents are compelled by law to send their
                   children to school. In these countries, in localities where there
                   is a church, schools should be established if there are no more
                   than six children to attend. Work as if you were working for your
                   life to save the children from being drowned in the polluting,
                   corrupting influences of the world."—Testimonies, vol. 6,
                   p. 199.
                       "Before the overflowing scourge shall come upon the dwell-
                   ers of the earth, the Lord calls upon all who are Israelites indeed
                   to prepare for that event. To parents He sends the warning cry:
                   Gather your children into your own houses; gather them away
                   from those who are disregarding the commandments of God,
                    who are teaching and practicing evil. Get out of the large cities
                   as fast as possible. Establish church schools. Give your children
                    the word of God as the foundation of all their education."—

                                                                     July 13
             Part 5   "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the
        AN HERITAGE womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty
        OF THE LORD man; so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath
                    his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they
                    shall speak with the enemies in the gate" (Ps. 127:3-5).

                          The building of a house, rising up early, sitting up late, eating
                       the bread of sorrows—these are the images in the first part of
                       this psalm. The writer then approaches, in the second stanza,
                       the vibrant living element that makes a house a home—the
                       family, the house full of children. In societies based on agricul-
                       ture it is perhaps a blessing to have a large family with many
                       hands to help cultivate and harvest the crops. In an over-
                       crowded, industrial society, and in developing countries where
                       the demand for modern conveniences outstrips the supply,
                      population control is a lively issue. Family planning is debated
                       in the press, on radio and TV, and on the billboards. Both the
                      privileges and the responsibilities that parents have when they
                      bring children into the world are reflected in the inspired coun-
                      sel sent by God to His church in these latter days:
                         "Children are the heritage of the Lord, and we are answerable
                      to Him for our management of His property.... In love, faith, and
                      prayer let parents work for their households, until with joy they
                      can come to God saying, 'Behold, I and the children whom the
                      Lord hath given me.'
                         "A childless house is a desolate place. The hearts of the
                      inmates are in danger of becoming selfish, of cherishing a love
                      for their own ease, and consulting their own desires and con-
                      veniences. They gather sympathy to themselves, but have little
                      to bestow upon others."—The Adventist Home, p. 159.

THINK IT THROUGH         "Before increasing their family, they [Christians] should take
                      into consideration whether God would be glorified or dishon-
                      ored by their bringing children into the world. They should seek
                      to glorify God by their union from the first, and during every year
                      of their married life. They should calmly consider what provi-
                      sion can be made for their children. They have no right to bring
                      children into the world to be a burden to others. Have they a
                      business that they can rely upon to sustain a family, so that they
                      need not become a burden to others? If they have not, they
                      commit a crime in bringing children into the world to suffer for
                      want of proper care, food, and clothing."—Messages to Young

God's Command: Religious Education                LESSON 3             ❑    Friday
                                                                           July 14

         Part 6     Why did the psalmist want an unpolluted environment for
    PLANTS AND    the children of God's people?
       PALACES
                    "That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth;
                  that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the
                  similitude of a palace" (Ps. 144:12).

                     Let us examine the context of this verse. Twice, in verses 7
                  and 8, and in verse 11, David expresses the desire to be deliv-
                  ered "from the hand of strange children, whose mouth
                  speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of false-
                  hood." The rest of the psalm is joyful praise of the Lord's power
                  for good and the resulting prosperity of His people.
                     The "strange children" may refer to David's enemies from
                  whose sword the Lord delivered him, thus creating a peaceful
                  condition in which his own children could grow to prosperous
                  maturity. However, a morally secure environment is important
                  to spiritual growth. When Jesus wanted to instruct His disciples,
                  He often retired to a secluded, quiet place, even though He
                  might be followed eventually by a large crowd to whom He
                  ministered, as in the case of feeding the five thousand. Most
                  Seventh-day Adventist boarding schools have been established
                  initially, by deliberate choice, under the guidance of God, in
                  country locations, free from the corrupting influences of the
                  large cities.
                     "That education alone which brings the student into close
                  relation with the Great Teacher is true education. The youth are
                  to be taught to look to Christ as their guide. They are to be
                  taught lessons of forbearance and trust, of true goodness and
                  kindness of heart, of perseverance and steadfastness. Their
                  characters are to answer to the words of David: 'That our sons
                  may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters
                  may be as cornerstones, polished after the similitude of a
                   palace.' Psalm 144:12.
                     "The converted student has broken the chain which bound
                  him to the service of sin, and has placed himself in right relation
                   to God. His name is enrolled in the Lamb's book of life. He is
                   under solemn obligation to renounce evil and come under the
                   jurisdiction of heaven. Through earnest prayer he is to cleave to
                   Christ. To neglect this devotion, to refuse this service, is to
                   become the sport of Satan's wiles."—Counsels to Teachers,

         Part 1     What Is the greatest gift ever given by God to man?
      GOD GAVE
       HIS SON      "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
                  Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
                  have everlasting life" (John 3:16).

                      The following paragraphs bring out, each in its own way, a
                  special aspect of the gift God gave. Can you identify each one?
                      "The heart of the human father yearns over his son. He looks
                  into the face of his little child, and trembles at the thought of
                  life's peril. He longs to shield his dear one from Satan's power,
                  to hold him back from temptation and conflict. To meet a bit-
                  terer conflict and a more fearful risk, God gave His only-
                  begotten Son, that the path of life might be made sure for our
                  little ones. 'Herein is love,' Wonder, 0 heavens! and be as-
                  tonished, 0 earth!"—The Desire of Ages, p. 49.
                      "It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation
                  between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely
                  united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature,
                  the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never
                  to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us.
                  'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.'
                  John 3:16. He gave Him not only to bear our sins, and to die as
                  our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His
                  immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son
                  to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human
                  nature."—The Desire of Ages, p. 25.
                      "The Lord would be so bountiful to His human family that it
                  could not be said of Him that He could do more. In the gift of
                  Jesus, God gave all heaven.... Well may the heavenly host look

                                                                         July 17
        Part 2    What did God ask of Abraham as an expression of his fidel-
  ABRAHAM GAVE ity?
      HIS SON
                  "He said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
               lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
               there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
               will tell thee of" (Gen. 22:2).

                     Abraham's gift of his son on Mount Moriah was accepted by
                  the Father, who had not spared His own Son. God confirmed
                  with a solemn oath the blessing He had promised to Abraham
                  when He called him from Haran: "By myself have I sworn, saith
                  the Lord, for because thou has done this thing, and hast not
                  withheld thy son, thine only son: that in blessing I will bless thee,
                  and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the
                  heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy
                  seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall
                  all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast
                  obeyed my voice" (verses 16-18).
                     "Abraham's great act of faith stands like a pillar of light,
                  illuminating the pathway of God's servants in all succeeding
                  ages. Abraham did not seek to excuse himself from doing the
                  will of God. During that three days' journey he had sufficient
                  time to reason, and to doubt God, if he was disposed to doubt.
                  He might have reasoned that the slaying of his son would cause
                  him to be looked upon as a murderer, a second Cain; that it
                  would cause his teaching to be rejected and despised, and thus
                  destroy his power to do good to his fellow men. He might have
                  pleaded that age should excuse him from obedience. But the
                  patriarch did not take refuge in any of these excuses. Abraham
                  was human; his passions and attachments were like ours; but
                  he did not stop to question how the promise could be fulfilled if
                  Isaac should be slain. He did not stay to reason with his aching
                  heart. He knew that God is just and righteous in all His require-
                  ments, and he obeyed the command to the very letter."—

                  by the consecration of the first-born son. He was to be devoted

                                                                             July 18
             Part 3      Following the example of Isaac, who was rescued from the
          A LIVING    sacrificial altar by an angel's voice, what should every Chris-
         SACRIFICE    tian youth be?

                        "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
                      that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
                      unto God, which is your reasonable service" (Rom. 12:1).

                          Isaac was to have been a burnt offering, slain on the altar. But
                       the provision of a substitute made him a living sacrifice instead
                       of a dead sacrifice. This did not make his sacrifice of lesser
                       importance. Someone has said that it takes more courage to live
                       for Christ than it does to die for Christ. The courage to face
                       death is the courage of a moment. The courage to live for Christ
                       requires a daily sacrifice of self, such as Isaac had already
                       learned before he went to Mount Moriah.
                          "It was with terror and amazement that Isaac learned his fate,
                       but he offered no resistance. He could have escaped his doom,
                      had he chosen to do so; the grief-stricken old man, exhausted
                      with the struggle of those three terrible days, could not have
                      opposed the will of the vigorous youth. But Isaac had been
                      trained from childhood to ready, trusting obedience, and as the
                      purpose of God was opened before him, he yielded a willing
                      submission. He was a sharer in Abraham's faith, and he felt that
                      he was honored in being called to give his life as an offering to
                      God. He tenderly seeks to lighten the father's grief, and encour-
                      ages his nerveless hands to bind the cords that confine him to
                      the altar."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 152.
                         It is clear that the sacrifice made by Abraham was also a
                      commitment made by the young man Isaac. The call to become
                      a living sacrifice, made by Paul, is applied by Ellen White to the
                      youth of today, who are to live pure, clean lives like that of
                      Daniel. (See The Adventist Home, pp. 301, 302.) Not only are
                      parents called to dedicate their children to God, but the youth
                      are invited to commit themselves:
                         "Christ is calling for volunteers to enlist under His standard,
                      and bear the banner of the cross before the world. The church is
                      languishing for the help of young men who will bear a coura-
                      geous testimony, who will with their ardent zeal stir up the slug-
                      gish energies of God's people, and so increase the power of the
                      church in the world. Young men are wanted who will resist the
                      tide of worldliness, and lift a voice of warning against taking the

Responding to God's Gift         LESSON 4                        ❑   Wednesday
                                                                        July 19
         Part 4     What did Jesus tell the seventy disciples before sending
      THE NEED    them out to prepare the way for His coming?
  FOR WORKERS
                    "After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also,
                  and sent them two and two before his face into every city and
                  place, whither he himself would come. Therefore said he unto
                  them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few:
                  pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send
                  forth labourers into his harvest" (Luke 10:1, 2).

                     There is an inescapable relationship between the prayer that
                  Jesus instructed the seventy to pray and their own participation
                  in bringing about the answer to that prayer. Praying about the
                  harvest creates a concern that leads one to commit himself to
                  being a part of it and helping to bring it in.
                     The agricultural way of life in Jesus' time was especially apt
                  for illustrating certain factors in the work of the gospel, more so
                  than industrial life today. There was an element of timeliness, of
                  urgency, associated with the ripening of the grain and fruit.
                  When harvesttime came, the landowner sought by every means
                  to get sufficient help to finish the harvest before the fruit or the
                  grain was spoiled. In the parable of the vineyard, even at the
                  eleventh hour, what we would call five p.m., he was recruiting
                  harvest hands. He was willing to pay them for a whole day's
                  work even if they worked only one hour before night came.
                     "We are nearing the close of earth's history. We have before
                  us a great work,—the closing work of giving the last warning
                  message to a sinful world. There are men who will be taken from
                  the plow, from the vineyard, from various other branches of
                  work, and sent forth by the Lord to give this message to the
                  world."—Gospel Workers, p. 36.
                     "We must manifest confidence in our young men. They
                  should be pioneers in every enterprise involving toil and sac-
                  rifice, while the overtaxed servants of Christ should be
                   cherished as counselors, to encourage and bless those who
                   strike the heaviest blows for God."—Gospel Workers, p. 83.
                     "Young men are wanted. God calls them to missionary fields.
                   Being comparatively free from care and responsibilities, they
                   are more favorably situated to engage in the work than are those
                   who must provide for the training and support of a large family.
                   Furthermore, young men can more readily adapt themselves to
                   new climates and new society, and can better endure incon-
                   veniences and hardships. By tact and perseverance, they can
                   reach the people where they are."—Gospel Workers, p. 84.

Responding To God's Gift              LESSON 4                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                           July 20
             Part 5     How did Jesus feel when He saw and came into contact with
       COMPASSION     the needy multitudes of His time?
          FOR THE
       MULTITUDES       "When he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compas-
                      sion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered
                      abroad, as sheep having no shepherd" (Matt. 9:36).

                         The verse immediately preceding this verse describes Jesus
                       personally mingling with the people in their villages. The verses
                      following repeat the appeal to pray for the Lord of harvest to
                      send forth laborers into His harvest.
                         Down through history, one of the elements of God's call to a
                      person to be His mouthpiece in a given period or place was the
                      bringing of that person into contact with the world's need,
                      giving him or her a perception of the situation. The realization of
                      the need became a burden that could not be thrown off without
                      a commitment to service.
                         Isaiah saw God's glory in the temple and sensed not only his
                      own great need but that of his people also: "I dwell in the midst
                      of a people of unclean lips." His lips were purified by a live coal
                      from the altar, and then he responded to the call by saying,
                      "Here am I; send me" (Isa. 6:5-8).
                         Paul was waiting in Athens for Silas and Timothy. While he
                      waited, touring the city perhaps, "he was greatly upset when he
                      noticed how full of idols the city was" (Acts 17:16, TEV).
                         If you have stood at the top of the World Trade Center in
                      New York, or the Torre Latinamericana in Mexico City, or a sky-
                      scraper in one of the other great cities of the world, perhaps you
                      also have felt something of the same tug at your heartstrings.
                      Perhaps you have heard a song that echoes the refrain, "Where
                      do all the lonely people go?" And you ache to reach some way to
                      the millions who need the peace and the joy that Christian
                      workers can bring them. You long to be one of those workers, as
                      a layman or as a denominational employee. And you long to see
                      your children sharing in the work that has become your very
                      motive for existence ever since Christ came into your heart.

THINK IT THROUGH        "Let the youth who need an education set to work with a
                      determination to obtain it. Do not wait for an opening; make one

          Part 6   "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he
     FOLLOWING   had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith
     ABRAHAM'S wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
       EXAMPLE   And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
                 God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.... Ye see
                 then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith
                 only" (James 2:21-24).
                   "They which are of faith, the same are the children of Abra-
                 ham. . . . They which be of faith are blessed with faithful
                 Abraham" (Gal. 3:7-9).

                      Our faith is demonstrated by its fruitage, which can be seen by
                   all. If we believe Christ is coming, we will do all that is in our
                   power to hasten His coming. We will strive to finish the task He
                   has given His church to do, and this includes giving our children
                   an education to become workers for the Lord. God's blessing
                   upon Abraham that in him all nations of the earth should be
                   blessed is shared by those who have given of their children to go
                   to the far corners of earth with the gospel message for this time.
                      "It was to impress Abraham's mind with the reality of the
                   gospel, as well as to test his faith, that God commanded him to
                   slay his son. The agony which he endured during the dark days
                   of that fearful trial was permitted that he might understand from
                   his own experience something of the greatness of the sacrifice
                   made by the infinite God for man's redemption. No other test
                   could have caused Abraham such torture of soul as did the
                   offering of his son. God gave His Son to a death of agony and
                   shame. The angels who witnessed the humiliation and soul
                   anguish of the Son of God were not permitted to interpose, as in
                   the case of Isaac. There was no voice to cry, 'It is enough.' To
                   save the fallen race, the King of glory yielded up His life. What
                   stronger proof can be given of the infinite compassion and love
                   of God? 'He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
                   for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all
                   things?' Romans 8:32."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 154.

THINK IT THROUGH     "By faithfully maintaining their Christian integrity, they [the

                      "It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naloth in
                    Ramah. And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when
                    they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and
                    Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God
                    was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
                    And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and
                    they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again
                    the third time, and they prophesied also" (1 Sam. 19:19-21).

                        The scriptures cited for the first four days' study of this week
                     mention four places where companies of prophets or sons of
                     the prophets were gathered: Ramah, Bethel, Jericho, and Gil-
                     gal. The first mention of them is tied to the name of Samuel. The
                     others are tied to the names of Elijah and Elisha, immediately
                     preceding and following Elijah's translation to heaven in a
                     chariot of fire. We today often refer to these companies as
                     schools of the prophets.
                       This first mention is notable not only for the fact that Samuel
                     was presiding, but for the powerful influence that drew three
                     successive companies of the messengers of Saul into the spirit
                     of praise to God, in poetry and song.
                       "The schools of the prophets were founded by Samuel to
                     serve as a barrier against the widespread corruption, to provide
                     for the moral and spiritual welfare of the youth, and to promote
                     the future prosperity of the nation by furnishing it with men
                     qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders and counselors. In
                     the accomplishment of this object Samuel gathered companies
                    of young men who were pious, intelligent, and studious. These
                     were called the sons of the prophets. As they communed with
                     God and studied His word and His works, wisdom from above
                    was added to their natural endowments. The instructors were
                    men not only well versed in divine truth, but those who had
                    themselves enjoyed communion with God and had received the
                     special endowment of His Spirit. They enjoyed the respect and
                    confidence of the people, both for learning and piety.
                       "In Samuel's day there were two of these schools—one at
                    Ramah, the home of the prophet, and the other at Kirjath-jearim,
                    where the ark then was. Others were established in later
                    times."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 593.

       OF GOD"
                     "The sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to
                   Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take
                   away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
                   know it; hold ye your peace" (2 Kings 2:3).

                       Beth-el was the place where Jacob lay down to sleep with a
                   stone for a pillow as he fled from his brother Esau. Alone and
                   unbefriended, he dreamed he saw a ladder of light reaching
                   down from heaven to his resting place. He arose to name the
                   place Beth-el, house of God, "for surely God is in this place, and
                   I knew it not. .'. . This is none other but the house of God."
                       How appropriate it is that a school of the prophets should be
                   established in such a place as this. Every Christian school today
                   should have an atmosphere such that the name Beth-el would
                   fit. "Ministers and teachers, let your work be fragrant with rich
                   spiritual grace."—Gospel Workers, p. 272. To students God
                   says, "Notice for yourself if all things in your own room are
                   spotless and in order, that nothing there may be an offense to
                   God, but that when holy angels pass through your room, they
                   may be led to linger because attracted by the prevailing order
                   and cleanliness."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 171.
                       "The chief subjects of study in these schools were the law of
                    God, with the instructions given to Moses, sacred history, sa-
                    cred music, and poetry. The manner of instruction was far dif-
                    ferent from that in the theological schools of the present day,
                    from which many students graduate with less real knowledge of
                    God and religious truth than when they entered. In those
                    schools of the olden time it was the grand object of all study to
                    learn the will of God and man's duty toward Him. In the records
                    of sacred history were traced the footsteps of Jehovah. The
                    great truths set forth by the types were brought to view, and faith
                    grasped the central object of all that system—the Lamb of God
                    that was to take away the sin of the world.
                       "A spirit of devotion was cherished. Not only were students
                    taught the duty of prayer, but they were taught how to pray, how
                    to approach their Creator, how to exercise faith in Him, and how
                    to understand and obey the teachings of His Spirit. Sanctified
                     intellects brought forth from the treasure house of God things
                    new and old, and the Spirit of God was manifested in prophecy

     SACRED SONG
                       "The sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to
                    Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that thy Lord will take
                    away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea,
                    I know it; hold ye your peace" (2 Kings 2:5).

                       Jericho had been the scene of God's mighty demonstration of
                     power on behalf of his chosen people. The younger generation
                     saw in the opening of the river Jordan and the fall of Jericho a
                     special indication the Lord was with them. A monument was
                     erected near Jericho with specific instructions that it should be
                     used to answer the questions of the children in years to come
                    for educational purposes. (See Joshua 4:19-24.) This was an
                    appropriate location for a school of the prophets. Here music
                     was part of the curriculum.
                       "Music was made to serve a holy purpose, to lift the thoughts
                    to that which is pure, noble, and elevating, and to awaken in the
                    soul devotion and gratitude to God. What a contrast between
                    the ancient custom and the uses to which music is now too
                    often devoted! How many employ this gift to exalt self, instead
                    of using it to glorify God! A love for music leads the unwary to
                    unite with world lovers in pleasure gatherings where God has
                    forbidden His children to go. Thus that which is a great blessing
                    when rightly used, becomes one of the most successful agen-
                    cies by which Satan allures the mind from duty and from the
                    contemplation of eternal things.
                       "Music forms a part of God's worship in the courts above, and
                    we should endeavor, in our songs of praise, to approach as
                    nearly as possible to the harmony of the heavenly choirs. The
                    proper training of the voice is an important feature in education
                    and should not be neglected."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                    p. 594. Sacred music (1) fixes God's word in memory; (2) has
                    power to subdue rude and uncultivated natures: (3) has power
                    to quicken thought and to awaken sympathy; (4) promotes
                    harmony of action; (5) banishes the gloom and foreboding that
                    destroys courage and weakens effort. (See Education, pp. 167,
                    168.)
                       "The value of song as a means of education should never be
                    lost sight of. Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are
                    sweet and pure, and there will be fewer words of censure and
                    more of cheerfulness and hope and joy. Let there be singing in
                    the school, and the pupils will be drawn closer to God, to their
                    teachers, and to one another."—Education, p. 168.

       SCHOOL     school of the prophets at Gilgal?
        HOMES
                    "Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
                  land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him:
                  and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe
                  pottage for the sons of the prophets" (2 Kings 4:38).

                      Elisha, the miracle-working prophet, is often referred to as
                  the symbol or type of Christ, just as Elijah, his predecessor, was
                  the type of John the Baptist. As a teacher in the schools of the
                  prophets, he knew the value of constant companionship with
                  his students in the formation of character. This was the method
                  chosen by Christ, and should be one of the main considerations
                  in providing dormitories in our academies and colleges. A very
                  special responsibility rests upon the deans to create the atmos-
                  phere of a Christian home for those who are away from home.
                      "The most complete illustration of Christ's methods as a
                  teacher is found in His training of the twelve first disciples. Upon
                  these men were to rest weighty responsibilities. He had chosen
                  them as men whom He could imbue with His Spirit, and who
                  could be fitted to carry forward His work on earth when He
                  should leave it. To them, above all others, He gave the advan-
                  tage of His own companionship. . . .
                      " ... The Twelve first chosen, with a few others who through
                  ministry to their needs were from time to time connected with
                  them, formed the family of Jesus. They were with Him in the
                  house, at the table, in the closet, in the field. They accompanied
                  Him on His journeys, shared His trials and hardships, and, as
                  much as in them was, entered into His work.
                      "Sometimes He taught them as they sat together on the
                  mountainside, sometimes beside the sea, or from the fisher-
                   man's boat, sometimes as they walked by the way. Whenever He
                   spoke to the multitude, the disciples formed the inner
                   circle."—Education, pp. 84, 85.
                      Early in the history of Seventh-day Adventist education stu-
                   dents were left to make their own living arrangements. But
                   divine direction was given to make school homes a part of the
                   educational process: "Our school homes have been estab-
                   lished that our youth may not be left to drift hither and thither,
                   and be exposed to the evil influences which everywhere
                   abound; but that, as far as possible, a home atmosphere may be

                     "The sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
                   place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. Let us go,
                   we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a
                   beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.
                   And he answered, Go ye. And one said, Be content, I pray
                   thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go. So
                   he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
                   down wood" (2 Kings 6:1-4).

                      Elisha personally participated in procuring lumber for expan-
                   sion of the living quarters at this school of the prophets. He is an
                   example for teachers today. Instruction was given in 1902 to
                   those who were leading in the establishment of secondary edu-
                   cation in California that "our teachers should not think that
                   their work ends with giving instruction from books. Several
                   hours each day should be devoted to working with the students
                   in some line of manual training. In no case should this be
                   neglected."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 211.
                      "Useful manual labor is a part of the gospel plan. The Great
                   Teacher, enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, gave directions to
                   Israel that every youth should be taught some line of useful
                   employment. Therefore it was the custom of the Jews, the
                    wealthy as well as the poorer classes, to teach their sons and
                   daughters some useful trade, so that, should adverse cir-
                   cumstances arise, they would not be dependent upon others,
                   but would be able to provide for their own necessities."—

                     "Various industries should be carried on in our schools. The
                   industrial instruction given should include the keeping of ac-
                   counts, carpentry, and all that is comprehended in farming.
                   Preparation should be made for the teaching of blacksmithing,

                                                                           July 28
          Part 6     What indication is there that Paul understood the need of

                     "There accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
                   the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of
                   Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus"
                   (Acts 20:4).

                      The first young helper mentioned in connection with Paul's
                   work was John Mark, Barnabas's nephew. "Mark proposed to
                   Paul and Barnabas that he should accompany them on their
                   missionary tour. He felt the favor of God in his heart and longed
                   to devote himself entirely to the work of the gospel ministry."—
                   The Acts of the Apostles, p. 167. The first experience was not
                   eminently successful, and Paul was displeased when Mark
                   turned back in the face of difficulties. But Paul later sent for
                   Mark; the story ended well. (See Col. 4:10 and 2 Tim. 4:11.)
                      On that same first missionary journey Paul met Timothy at
                   Lystra. On the second journey, returning to the same place,
                   "Paul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and he
                   chose him as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had
                   taught Timothy in his childhood were rewarded by seeing the
                   son of their care linked in close fellowship with the great
                   apostle."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 203.
                      By the time we come to the lesson text for today, on Paul's
                   third missionary journey, he had at least seven young men with
                   him in addition to Silas and Luke; Titus, not mentioned in Acts
                    20, had gone ahead to Corinth, as indicated in Second Corin-
                    thians. (See SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 1104.)
                      "This feature of Paul's work contains an important lesson for
                   ministers today. The apostle made it a part of his work to edu-
                   cate young men for the office of the ministry. He took them with
                   him on his missionary journeys, and thus they gained an experi-
                   ence that later enabled them to fill positions of responsibility.
                   When separated from them, he still kept in touch with their
                    work, and his letters to Timothy and to Titus are evidences of
                    how deep was his desire for their success.
                       "Experienced workers today do a noble work when, instead
                    of trying to carry all the burdens themselves, they train younger
                    workers and place burdens on their shoulders."—The Acts of

                         The miracle of feeding the five thousand, which was the basis
                      for Jesus' discourse on the bread of life, contains at least ten
                      practical lessons that are brought out in the inspired commen-
                      tary in The Desire of Ages, pp: 365-371.
                         1. Jesus was just as thoughtful of people's temporal neces-
                      sities as of their spiritual need.
                         2. Christ never worked a miracle except to supply a genuine
                      necessity.
                        3. The food was simple. If men today were simple in their
                     habits, as Adam and Eve in the beginning, there would be an
                     abundant supply for the needs of the human family.
                        4. Jesus lifted the veil from the world of nature and revealed
                     the power that is constantly exercised for our good. In the
                     production of earth's harvests there is a miracle every day.
                        5. Nothing was to be wasted, in material or spiritual matters—
                     the leftovers were taken home to be shared.
                        6. The providence of God had placed Jesus where He was; He
                     depended on His heavenly Father for the means to provide.
                        7. Christ received from the Father, He imparted to the disci-
                     ples, they imparted to the multitude, and the people to one
                     another.

                     stow only as they receive.
                        9. When surrounded by souls in need, do not send for some-
                     one from afar—bring your barley loaves to Jesus.
                       10.The little that is wisely and economically used in the service
                     of the Lord of heaven will increase in the very act of imparting.
                        Parents, teachers, and church leaders are responsible for
                     fostering the spiritual life of the youth. Some of the means by
                     which they can do this are the Sabbath School, the church
                     school, the MV society, good reading, and a personal interest in
                     each youth. They should find encouragement in this story of
                     how Jesus, depending on His heavenly Father, provided food
                     for the multitude even though no resources seemed to be in
                     sight.

          Part 2   To what kind of food did Jesus seek to direct people's
   "MEAT WHICH   attention in interpreting the miracle of feeding the five
     ENDURETH" thousand?

                    "Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto
                  you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but be-
                  cause ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. Labour not for
                  the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth
                  unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you:
                  for him hath God the Father sealed" (John 6:26, 27).

                    Important things happened between the miracle of feeding
                  the five thousand and the discourse on the bread of life. The
                  intervening evening had seen Jesus frustrate the intent of
                  stormy men to make Him king. The night had seen Him come to
                  the aid of His disciples in a stormy night on the lake. This was a
                  critical moment in Jesus' life—the peak of popularity was to be
                  followed by falling shadows as people realized the spiritual
                  nature of His mission and turned away.
                    The contrast between the "meat that perisheth" and the
                  "meat which endureth unto everlasting life was dramatically
                  presented to Ellen White in a vision of a group discussing
                  education:
                     "There was a hush in the assembly, and conviction came
                  upon each heart. Men who had thought themselves wise and
                  strong saw that they were weak and lacking in the knowledge of
                  that Book which concerns the eternal destiny of the human
                  soul.
                     "The messenger of God then took from the hands of several
                  teachers those books which they had been making their study,
                  some of which had been written by infidel authors and con-
                  tained infidel sentiments, and laid them aside, saying: 'There
                  never has been a time in your lives when the study of these
                  books was for your present good and advancement, or for your
                  future, eternal good. Why will you fill your shelves with books
                  that divert the mind from Christ? Why do you spend money for
                  that which is not bread? Christ calls you: "Learn of Me; for I am
                  meek and lowly in heart." You need to eat of the Bread of life
                  which came down from heaven. You need to be more diligent
                  students of the Holy Scriptures and to drink from the living
                  Fountain. Draw, draw from Christ in earnest prayer. Obtain a
                  daily experience in eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the
                  Son of God. Human authors can never supply your great need
                  for this time; but by beholding Christ, the Author and Finisher of
                  your faith, you will be changed into His likeness."—

                      five thousand referred to their past history: "Our fathers did eat
                      manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from
                      heaven to eat" (verse 31). They looked for a Messiah that would
                      free them from Roman rule, as Moses had freed their ancestors
                      from Egyptian slavery.
                         Jesus' reply was, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave
                      you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the
                      true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which
                      cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world"
                      (verses 32, 33).
                         "The life of Christ that gives life to the world is in His word. It
                      was by His word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons;
                      by His word He stilled the sea, and raised the dead; and the
                      people bore witness that His word was with power. He spoke the
                      word of God, as He had spoken through all the prophets and
                      teachers of the Old Testament. The whole Bible is a manifesta-
                      tion of Christ, and the Saviour desired to fix the faith of His
                      followers on the word. When His visible presence should be
                      withdrawn, the word must be their source of power. Like their
                      Master, they were to live 'by every word that proceedeth out of
                      the mouth of God.' Matt. 4:4."—The Desire of Ages, p. 390.
                         "The springs of heavenly peace and joy, unsealed in the soul
                      of the teacher by the words of Inspiration, will become a mighty
                      river of influence to bless all who connect with him. The Bible
                      will not become a tiresome book to the student. Under a wise
                      instructor the word will become more and more desirable. It will
                      be as the bread of life, and will never grow old. Its freshness and
                      beauty will attract and charm the children and youth. It is like the
                      sun shining upon the earth, perpetually imparting brightness
                      and warmth, yet never exhausted.
                         "God's holy, educating Spirit is in His word. A light, a new and
                      precious light, shines forth from every page. Truth is there
                      revealed, and words and sentences are made bright and ap-
                      propriate for the occasion, as the voice of God speaking to the
                      soul. . .

                                                                   August 2
         Part 4     What parallel did Paul trace between the Communion ser-
   MANNA IN THE vice and the manna in the wilderness? 1 Cor. 10:1-6, 16, 21.
    COMMUNION
       SERVICE      Though the passage in First Corinthians 11:24-26 is often
                used in the Communion service in many Christian churches,
                seldom is any attention paid to chapter 10, preceding it.
                    Paul says all Israel was "baptized unto Moses in the cloud and
                in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all
                drink the same spiritual drink" (1 Cor. 10:2-4). He argues that
                the great majority perished in the wilderness because they did
                not perceive the spiritual truths symbolized in the experiences
                of the Red Sea passage, the manna, and the water from the rock.
                Likewise, in the Christian church at Corinth, there was danger
                that the baptismal font might have been only a bath for fully
                clothed Corinthians in whose heart the Egypt of immorality and
                fornication still existed (verses 6-8). There was danger of linger-
                ing at the table of idol's food without seeing the idol worship
                implied (verses 16-21, 28). And there was danger that the Com-
                munion service might be only another meal at which gluttony
                and selfishness were common (chapter 11, verses 20-22, 33, 34);
                Paul sought to highlight again the spiritual food, so much
                needed by us today.
                    "When we eat Christ's flesh and drink His blood, the element
                of eternal life will be found in the ministry. There will not be a
                fund of stale, oft-repeated ideas. The tame, dull sermonizing will
                 cease. The old truths will be presented, but they will be seen in a
                new light. There will be a new perception of truth, a clearness
                and a power that all will discern. Those who have the privilege of
                sitting under such a ministry will, if susceptible to the Holy
                 Spirit's influence, feel the energizing power of a new life. The
                 fire of God's love will be kindled within them. Their perceptive
                 faculties will be quickened to discern the beauty and majesty of
                 truth.
                    "The faithful householder represents what every teacher of
                 the children and youth should be. If he makes the word of God
                 his treasure, he will continually bring forth new beauty and new
                 truth. When the teacher will rely upon God in prayer, the Spirit of
                 Christ will come upon him, and God will work through him by
                 the Holy Spirit upon the minds of others. The Spirit fills the mind
                 and heart with sweet hope and courage and Bible imagery, and
                 all this will be communicated to the youth under his
                 instruction."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 130-132.

Food for Thought            LESSON 6                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                         August 3
            Part 5     What tragedy befell the students in the school of the
          MEAL TO   prophets at Gilgal, and how did Elisha remedy the situation?
        COUNTERACT 2 Kings 4:38-41.
           POISON
                       The wild gourds that were shredded into the pottage were not
                    known to be poisonous. But when the pottage was served and
                    tasted, the students "cried out, and said, 0 thou man of God,
                    there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. But he
                    said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said,
                    Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no
                    harm in the pot." The meal in Elisha's hand became a miracu-
                    lous agent for life, counteracting the poison.
                       This incident can serve as an illustration of the healing power
                    of the word of God in dissipating the deathly poison of worldly
                    thought and principles in the mental food of students. Ellen
                    White speaks of the reading of objectionable books as "impart-
                   ing poison" to the reader.
                       "The world acknowledges as teachers some whom God can-
                   not endorse as safe instructors. By these the Bible is discarded,
                   and the productions of infidel authors are recommended as if
                   they contained those sentiments which should be woven into
                   the character. What can you expect from the sowing of this kind
                   of seed? In the study of these objectionable books the minds of
                   teachers as well as of students become corrupted, and the
                   enemy sows his tares. It cannot be otherwise. By drinking of an
                   impure fountain, poison is introduced into the system. Inex-
                   perienced youth taken over this line of study receive impres-
                   sions which lead their thoughts into channels that are fatal to
                   piety. Youth who have been sent to our schools have learned
                   from books which were thought to be safe because they were
                   used and encouraged in the schools of the world. But from the
                   worldly schools thus followed many students have gone forth
                   infidels because of the study of these very books."—
                   Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 164.
                      "The knowledge that comes from God is the bread of life. It is
                   the leaves of the tree of life which are for the healing of the
                   nations. The current of spiritual life thrills the soul as the words
                   of Christ are believed and practiced. Thus it is that we are made
                   one with Christ. The experience that was weak and feeble be-
                   comes strong. It is eternal life to us if we hold the beginning of
                   our confidence firm unto the end.
                      "All truth is to be received as the life of Jesus. Truth cleanses
                   us from all impurity, and prepares the soul for Christ's presence.
                   Christ is formed within, the hope of glory."—Ellen G. White

Food for Thought        LESSON 6                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                           August 4
          Part 6     How was Jesus' own victorious life sustained in a sinful
 "MEAT . . . THAT world?
YE KNOW NOT OF"
                      "He said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
                  ... My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish
                  his work" (John 4:32-34).

                       Not only in receiving, but in giving, there is life. Jesus' prayer
                    life and His study of the Scriptures was complemented by an
                    active ministry to others. Jesus was refreshed by finding in the
                    Samaritan woman a receptive audience. (See John 4:31-34.)
                    The three paragraphs that follow illustrate: (1) the active wit-
                    ness that characterizes the life in Christ; (2) the thirst for the
                    Word within the church; and (3) the thirst for the Word in the
                    world at large.
                       1. "Christ's gracious presence in His word is ever speaking to
                    the soul, representing Him as the well of living water to refresh
                    the thirsting soul. It is our privilege to have a living, abiding
                    Saviour. He is the source of spiritual power implanted within us,
                    and His influence will flow forth in words and actions, refresh-
                    ing all within the sphere of our influence, begetting in them
                    desires and aspirations for strength and purity, for holiness and
                    peace, and for that joy which brings no sorrow with it. This is the
                    result of an indwelling Saviour."—Testimonies to Ministers,
                    p. 390.
                       2. "If the people of God would appreciate His word, we should
                    have a heaven in the church here below. Christians would be
                    eager, hungry, to search the word. They would be anxious for
                    time to compare scripture with scripture and to meditate upon
                    the word. They would be more eager for the light of the word
                    than for the morning paper, magazines, or novels. Their
                    greatest desire would be to eat the flesh and drink the blood of
                    the Son of God. And as a result their lives would be conformed
                    to the principles and promises of the word. Its instruction would
                    be to them as the leaves of the tree of life. It would be in them a
                     well of water, springing up into everlasting life."—Testimonies,
                    vol. 8, p. 193.
                       3. "The hearts of many in the world as well as many church
                    members are hungering for the bread of life and thirsting for the
                     waters of salvation. They are interested in the service of song,
                     but they are not longing for that or even prayer. They want to
                     know the Scriptures. What saith the Word of God to me? The
                     Holy Spirit is working on mind and heart, drawing them to the
                     bread of life. They see everything round them changing. Human
                     feelings, human ideas of what constitutes religion, change.

                    "At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, 0
                  Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
                  things from the wise and prudent, and hest revealed them
                  unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy
                  sight" (Matt. 11:25, 26).

                     To understand more fully the story of Jesus' use of the Sab-
                  bath with His disciples, following the familiar invitation to "rest"
                  and "learn of me," go back to Matthew 11:1. Christ had just
                  received the embassy from the imprisoned John the Baptist.
                    Jesus foresaw that He would be rejected, as John had been.
                  Popular opinion criticized John for fasting and Jesus for feast-
                  ing. Popular opinion was, then, as inconsistent as foolish, quar-
                  reling children in a marketplace (verses 16-19). In contrast,
                  "wisdom is justified of her children" (verse 19). Jesus' mighty
                  works had been wasted on Chorazin and Bethsaida and on
                  Capernaum, which was "exalted unto heaven" (verses 20-23),
                  too proud to accept His message. But Jesus rejoiced that there
                  were "babes" to whom, in their humility and simplicity, God
                  could reveal spiritual truth. Wisdom's children were those who
                  took time to listen to Jesus' message. Today, those will be
                  rewarded who take time to listen to His voice in the study of His
                  Word. For this, specific "leisure" time has been provided:
                    "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the
                  Sabbath are invaluable. Let the Sabbath school lesson be
                  learned, not by a hasty glance at the lesson scripture on Sab-
                  bath morning, but by careful study for the next week on Sabbath
                  afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
                  Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure
                  never to be wholly lost."—Education, pp. 251, 252.

                    How did Paul distinguish the wisdom of God from the wis-
                  dom of the world? 1 Cor. 2:6, 7.

                     In the previous chapter the wisdom of God is identified with
                  Christ crucified, that is, with the plan of salvation and the im-
                  measurable love of God manifested in Christ's giving His life on
                  the cross. The whole theme of First Corinthians chapters 1 to 13
                  is that this love is superior to the gnosis, or knowledge, which
                  certain Corinthians professed to have.
                     The kind of education obtained in association with the Sab-
                  bath rest is foolishness in the eyes of worldly educators, but it is
                  the power of God and the wisdom of God to the believer.

                                                                          August 7

        Part 2      Through whom does the Father reveal to His "babes" the
     REVEALED     things that have been hidden from the "wise" and "prudent"?
     THROUGH
       CHRIST       "All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
                  knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
                  Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
                  reveal him" (Matt. 11:27).

                     Christ is the channel through whom knowledge of the Father
                  and of the universe over which the Father presides is conveyed
                  to the "babes" (verse 25).
                     "In the Teacher sent from God, all true educational work finds
                  its center. Of this work today as verily as of the work He estab-
                  lished eighteen hundred years ago, the Saviour speaks in the
                  words—
                     " 'I am the First and the Last, and the Living One.'
                     " 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.'
                  Revelation 1:17, R.V.; 21:6, R.V.
                     "In the presence of such a Teacher, of such opportunity for
                  divine education, what worse than folly is it to seek an education
                  apart from Him—to seek to be wise apart from Wisdom; to be
                  true while rejecting Truth; to seek illumination apart from the
                  Light, and existence without the Life; to turn from the Fountain
                  of living waters, and hew out broken cisterns, that can hold no
                  water.
                     "Behold, He is still inviting: 'If any man thirst, let him come
                  unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture
                   hath said,' out of him 'shall flow rivers of living water.' The
                   water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water
                   springing up unto eternal life.' John 7:37, 38; 4:14, R.V."—
                  Education, p. 83.
                         "Like the woman at the well I was seeking
                         For things that could not satisfy;
                         And then I heard my Savior speaking:
                         'Draw from My well that never shall run dry.'
                         Fill my cup, Lord,—I lift it up, Lord!
                         Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
                         Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more—
                         Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!"

                                                                             August 8
               Part 3     In what familiar and beautiful words is the invitation "learn
     "REST . . . AND    of me" associated with the invitation to rest?
      LEARN OF ME"
                           "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
                        will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for
                        I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
                        souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matt.
                        11:28-30).

                            The Sabbath is the day of rest, and the word in Hebrew means
                         "rest." The word "sabbath" is interchangeable with other
                         words for rest in many settings. The word used in the above text
                         is broader than the Sabbath rest, but can be understood as
                        including it.
                           Care must be taken to distinguish between the ceremonial
                        sabbaths, and the weekly Sabbath of the fourth commandment.
                        The latter is more completely and permanently appropriate to
                        the rest of the soul referred to in verse 29. Jesus Himself links
                        learning, learning of Him, with this rest of the soul.
                            "The Sabbath and the family were alike instituted in Eden,
                        and in God's purpose they are indissolubly linked together. On
                        this day more than on any other, it is possible for us to live the
                        life of Eden. It was God's plan for the members of the family to
                        be associated in work and study, in worship and recreation, the
                        father as priest of his household, and both father and mother as
                        teachers and companions of their children. But the results of
                        sin, having changed the conditions of life, to a great degree
                        prevent this association. Often the father hardly sees the faces
                        of his children throughout the week. He is almost wholly de-
                        prived of opportunity for companionship or instruction. But
                        God's love has set a limit to the demands of toil. Over the
                        Sabbath He places His merciful hand. In His own day He pre-
                        serves for the family opportunity for communion with Him, with
                        nature, and with one another."—Education, pp. 250-251.
                           Because so many Adventist families have not sent their chil-
                        dren to the church school, they should make their family wor-
                        ships and the Sabbath an especially fascinating experience for
                        their children. How else can they even hope to see them safely
                        through the gates into God's kingdom? The children's Sabbath
                        School should have the very best talent in the church, and
                        ample financing to provide room decorations, felt craft illustra-
                        tions, attendance and offering devices, a well-tuned piano, and
                        other needed equipment. The Sabbath sermon should have a
                        corner for the children, and the whole sermon should be simple
                        enough for the older children to understand it. A good minister
                        knows that Jesus said to Peter, "Feed my lambs."

The Sabbath and Education           LESSON 7                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    August 9
         Part 4     What truth did Jesus state in concluding His dialog with the
       SABBATH    Pharisees in the cornfield?
      LEARNING
     ACTIVITIES     "At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the
                  corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck
                  the ears of corn, and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it,
                  they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not
                  lawful to do upon the sabbath day. But he said unto them, ...
                  the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day" (Matt. 12:1-8).

                     The Sabbath is Christ's day, for man to use to His glory.
                     "An All-wise Creator knew that man, the creature of His hand,
                  needed opportunity for moral and spiritual growth, for charac-
                  ter development. He needed time in which his own interests and
                  pursuits should be subordinated to a study of the character and
                  will of God as revealed in nature, and later, in revelation. The
                  seventh-day Sabbath was ordained of God to meet this need....
                     "God ordained that the Sabbath should be a blessing, not a
                  burden, and it is to man's interest and not his injury to observe it.
                  It was designed to increase his happiness, not to work a hard-
                  ship on him. Sabbathkeeping does not consist essentially in the
                  petty observance of certain formalities and in abstention from
                  certain pursuits; to think of it in this light is to miss completely
                  the true spirit and objectives of Sabbath observance and to
                  engage in the pursuit of righteousness based on works. We
                  refrain from certain tasks, from certain pursuits, from certain
                  topics of thought and conversation, not because that by so
                  doing we think to win favor with God. We refrain from these
                  things in order that we may devote our time, our energies, and
                  our thought to other pursuits that will increase our understand-
                  ing of God, our appreciation-of His goodness, our capacity to
                  cooperate with Him, and our ability to serve Him and our fellow
                   men more effectively."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 588.
                     "We can walk out with them [our children] in the open air; we
                   can sit with them in the groves and in the bright sunshine, and
                   give their restless minds something to feed upon by conversing
                   with them upon the works of God, and can inspire them with
                   love and reverence by calling their attention to the beautiful
                   objects in nature.
                      "The Sabbath should be made so interesting to our families
                   that its weekly return will be hailed with joy. In no better way can
                   parents exalt and honor the Sabbath than by devising means to
                   impart proper instruction to their families and interesting them
                   in spiritual things, giving them correct views of the character of
                   God and what He requires of us in order to perfect Christian
                   characters and attain to eternal life. Parents, make the Sabbath
                   a delight, that your children may look forward to it and have a
                   welcome in their hearts for it."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 584,

The Sabbath and Education               LESSON 7                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                        August 10
           Part 5      What was Jesus' custom regarding formal worship on the
FORMAL WORSHIP       Sabbath, and how did He participate?
 ON THE SABBATH
                       "He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and,
                     as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath
                     day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto
                     him the book of the prophet Esaias [Isa. 61:1-3]. . . And he
                     closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat
                     down, And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue
                     were fastened on him" (Luke 4:16-20).

                        Jesus was already a young man of thirty when He read the
                      day's scripture in the synagogue of his home town. But His
                      "custom," already established, dated from childhood.
                        As they listen to the sermon, parents and children may note
                      the texts quoted and the line of thought, to be repeated to one
                      another at home. This helps relieve weariness for little ones, and
                      cultivates in parents and children the habit of attention and
                      connected thought. Undreamed-of treasures will open to the
                      minds of both, and they will have a new experience:
                        "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was
                      unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart" (Jer. 15:16).
                        "I will meditate in thy statutes" (Ps. 119:48).
                        "More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
                     gold. . . . Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in
                     keeping of them there is great reward" (Ps. 19:10, 11).
                        "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is
                     the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words
                     spoken by Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agen-
                     cies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier
                     worship into which there can enter nothing that defileth.
                        "From the sacredness which was attached to the earthly
                     sanctuary, Christians may learn how they should regard the
                     place where the Lord meets with His people. There has been a
                     great change, not for the better, but for the worse, in the habits
                     and customs of the people in reference to religious worship.
                     The precious, the sacred, things which connect us with God are
                     fast losing their hold upon our minds and hearts, and are being

                     met with God in sacred service has largely passed away.

         Part 6     When the Sabbath of eternity begins in the new earth, what
   THE SABBATH    will be the activity of the redeemed each Sabbath day?
   OF ETERNITY
                    "As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
                  shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and
                  your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one
                  new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall
                  all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord" (Isa.
                  66:22, 23).

                     "In this life we can only begin to understand the wonderful
                  theme of redemption. With our finite comprehension we may
                  consider most earnestly the shame and the glory, the life and
                  the death, the justice and the mercy, that meet in the cross; yet
                  with the utmost stretch of our mental powers we fail to grasp its
                  full significance. The length and the breadth, the depth and the
                  height, of redeeming love are but dimly comprehended. The
                  plan of redemption will not be fully understood, even when the
                  ransomed see as they are seen and know as they are known; but
                  through the eternal ages new truth will continually unfold to the
                  wondering and delighted mind. Though the griefs and pains
                  and temptations of earth are ended and the cause removed, the
                   people of God will ever have a distinct, intelligent knowledge of
                   what their salvation has cost.
                      "The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the
                   redeemed through all eternity. In Christ glorified they will be-
                   hold Christ crucified. Never will it be forgotten that He whose
                   power created and upheld the unnumbered worlds through the
                   vast realms of space, the Beloved of God, the Majesty of heaven,
                   He whom cherub and shining seraph delighted to adore—
                   humbled Himself to uplift fallen man; that He bore the guilt and
                   shame of sin, and the hiding of His Father's face, till the woes of
                   a lost world broke His heart and crushed out His life on Calvary's
                   cross. That the Maker of all worlds, the Arbiter of all destinies,
                   should lay aside His glory and humiliate Himself from love to

                       "Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
                     shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
                     thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
                     thou risest up" (Deut. 6:7).

                         Of Jesus as a teacher it is said: "To Him nothing was without
                      purpose. The sports of the child, the toils of the man, life's
                      pleasures and cares and pains, all were means to the one end—

                     The environment in and around our homes must support the
                     work of the school and the church. "It is often the case that
                     parents are not careful to surround their children with the right
                     influences. In choosing a home, they think more of their worldly

                     ventist Home, p. 136.
                        In the early days of the church many parents moved to Battle
                     Creek to give their children the opportunity of obtaining a Chris-
                     tian education and to surround them with a Christian atmos-
                     phere. But even in this there was a danger—the danger of
                     suffocation through inaction. "God calls upon many in Battle

                     needed in His cause."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 187.
                        The atmosphere chosen for our children should include ac-
                     tive personal involvement in the missionary activities of the

                     week, that is conducive to spiritual growth. "A living faith like
                     threads of gold should run through the daily experience in the
                     performance of little duties" is one sentence from the chapter
                     on "School Homes"—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 171.
                        In an imperfect world, among the things that "work together
                     for good to them that love God" is included a love for Christ that
                     actively seeks in all things around us the element of good that
                     feeds the spiritual life within. (Compare Romans 8:28 with Ro-

        Part 2  What indication is there of God's intention that visual media
       VISUAL  were to play a part in communicating His plan for the life of His
    REMINDERS people?

                    "Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
                  shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write
                  them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates" (Deut.
                  6:8, 9).

                     God directed that the Israelites write His commandments on
                  the posts of the house and on the gates. He told Habakkuk to
                  "Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run
                  that readeth it" (2:2). These directions had the purpose of etch-
                  ing His message on the sensitive film of the mind through the
                  sharply focused lenses of the human eye. The result would
                  affect the entire person.
                     "Some efforts have been made to interest children in the
                  cause, but not enough. Our Sabbath schools should be made
                  more interesting. The public schools have of late years greatly
                  improved their methods of teaching. Object lessons, pictures,
                  and blackboards are used to make difficult lessons clear to the
                  youthful mind. Just so may present truth be simplified and made
                  intensely interesting to the active minds of the children. . . .
                     " ... The modes of teaching which have been adopted with
                  such success in the public schools could be employed with
                  similar results in the Sabbath schools, and be the means of
                  bringing children to Jesus and educating them in Bible truth.
                  This will do far more good than religious excitement of an
                  emotional character, that passes off as rapidly as it comes."—
                  Counsels on Sabbath School Work, pp. 114, 115.
                     Teachers today should be quick to adapt truth to enter
                  through the eye-gate. "The use of object lessons, blackboards,
                  maps, and pictures, will be an aid in explaining these lessons,
                  and fixing them in the memory. Parents and teachers should
                  constantly seek for improved methods. The teaching of the
                  Bible should have our freshest thought, our best methods, and
                  our most earnest effort."—Education, p. 186.
                     "In His [Jesus'] teaching were embraced the things of time
                  and the things of eternity—things seen, in their relation to
                   things unseen."—Education, p. 82. But He did not depend on a
                   complicated maze of mechanical gadgets for His audiovisual
                   penetration of the mind. Ready-made before Him were the
                   world of nature and the experiences of life. And the greatest

                     possess it" (Deut. 31:10-13).

                         "Three times a year seasons were appointed for social inter-
                      course and worship. First at Shiloh, and afterward at Jerusalem,
                      these gatherings were held. Only the fathers and sons were

                     and the Feast of Tabernacles. The first two were in the
                     springtime and early summer, the latter in the fall. "By the
                     devout in Israel, fully a month of every year was occupied in this

                     children. The songs that had cheered the wilderness wandering
                     were sung. God's commandments were chanted, and, bound
                     up with the blessed influences of nature and of kindly human

                                                                    August 16
          Part 4   What was Paul's counsel to early Christians regarding what
        CHOOSE they should feed their minds?
      THE GOOD
                   "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
                 things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
                 things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
                 things are of good report; If there be any virtue, and If there be
                 any praise, think on these things" (Phil. 4:8). (See also Col.
                 3:1, 2; 2 Cor. 3:18.)

                      The hours spent in formal schooling are only a portion of the
                   student's total experience. Many educators feel that it is an
                   injustice to expect of the school that it should be responsible for
                   education in its full, true sense. Rather, they believe, the school
                   should analyze the experience of the child in the home and in
                   society. Then it should provide those learning experiences that
                   he might otherwise miss, or which can best be given to him in an
                   organized way in school. He will obtain everything considered
                   important to his success and happiness.
                      Parents and pastors and all others who share with teachers
                   the burden for the youth of the church should realize how
                   influential the environment is outside the school. Be aware of
                   the pictures on the wall, the magazines and books in the den or
                   recreation room, the TV and radio programs, the newspaper,
                   the conversation at the dinner table, the children's corner in the
                   sermon, the Pathfinder club, and the children's Sabbath
                   School.
                      Even among good things, the Christian must choose the best.
                   And young people have their own choices to make. "Dear youth,
                   cease to read the magazines containing stories. Put away every
                   novel.. . . We would do well to clear our houses of all the story
                   magazines and the publications containing ridiculous
                   pictures—representations originated by satanic agencies. The
                   youth cannot afford to poison their minds with such things.
                    'What is the chaff to the wheat?' Let every one who claims to be
                   a follower of Christ read only that which is true and of eternal
                   value.
                       "We must prepare ourselves for most solemn duties. A world
                    is to be saved.... In view of the great work to be done, how can
                    any one afford to waste precious time and God-given means in
                    doing those things that are not for his best good or for the glory
                    of God?"—Messages to Young People, p. 286.

Education-A Total Experience               LESSON 8                    ❑ Thursday
                                                                        August 17
             Part 5   What should be the Christian's reaction to the flood of influ-
            REJECT  ences that impinge on his consciousness and from the world
           THE BAD around him?

                        "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
                      the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
                      good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God" (Rom. 12:2).

                         A vivid experiment often performed in the physics laboratory
                      has impressed many students with a dramatic demonstration of
                      atmospheric pressure. A five-gallon kerosene can could be
                      stood on and even jumped on without visibly deforming it. But
                      when a vacuum pump was attached to it and the air inside was
                      removed, the can crumpled into a flattened mass of metal. It
                      caved in under a column of air that reaches up 50,000 feet or
                      more from the surface of the earth. All that normally kept the can
                      intact was the pressure inside that equaled the pressure from
                      the outside.
                         "We have a work to do to resist temptation. Those who would
                      not fall a prey to Satan's devices must guard well the avenues of
                     the soul; they must avoid reading, seeing, or hearing that which
                      will suggest impure thoughts."—Messages to Young People,
                     p. 285.
                        It is evident that the avenues of the soul are the five senses,
                      which must be guarded as are the approaches to a castle or the
                     airlanes into a modern metropolitan area in time of war.
                        It is not enough to select what is true. Even the news and
                     history past and present will be filtered by the Christian. "Books
                     on sensational topics, published and circulated as a money-
                     making scheme, might better never be read by the youth. There
                     is a satanic fascination in such books. The heartsickening re-
                     cital of crimes and atrocities has a bewitching power upon
                     many, exciting them to see what they can do to bring themselves
                     into notice, even by the wickedest deeds. The enormities, the
                     cruelties, the licentious practices, portrayed in some of the
                     strictly historical writings have acted as leaven on many minds,
                     leading to the commission of similar acts. . . .
                        " ... These horrible particulars need not be lived over, and no

Education-A Total Experience           LESSON 8                       ❑ Friday
                                                                     August 18
         Part 6     In what words do the Scriptures dramatize the fact that we
    CHANGED BY    are indeed influenced by what we see and hear?
     BEHOLDING
                    "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
                  of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
                  glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord" (2 Cor. 3:18).
                    "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
                  the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when
                  ye turn to the left" (Ise. 30:21).

                     In the early days of Western education children were often
                  required to practice handwriting by copying the same line many
                  times over. A child might do well the first time he imitated the
                  model written for him at the top of the sheet by the teacher. But
                  if he modeled the third line on the second, and the fourth on the
                  third, et cetera, the last might be totally distorted and unrecog-
                  nizable. How important to keep the eye on the top line, on the
                  perfect model!
                     Ellen White's appeal to church leaders might well apply to
                  every Christian who teaches others: "0 that I could command
                  language of sufficient force to make the impression that I wish
                  to make upon my fellow-laborers in the gospel. My brethren,
                  you are handling the words of life; you are dealing with minds
                  that are capable of the highest development. Christ crucified,
                  Christ risen, Christ ascended into the heavens, Christ coming
                  again, should so soften, gladden, and fill the mind of the minis-
                  ter that he will present these truths to the people in love and
                  deep earnestness. The minister will then be lost sight of and
                  Jesus will be made manifest.
                     "Lift up Jesus, you that teach the people, lift Him up in ser-
                  mon, in song, in prayer. Let all your powers be directed to
                  pointing souls, confused, bewildered, lost, to the 'Lamb of God.'
                  Lift Him up, the risen Saviour, and say to all who hear, Come to
                  Him who 'hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us.' Let the
                  science of salvation be the burden of every sermon, the theme
                  of every song. Let it be poured forth in every supplication. Bring
                  nothing into your preaching to supplement Christ, the wisdom
                  and power of God. Hold forth the word of life, presenting Jesus
                  as the hope of the penitent and the stronghold of every believer.
                  Reveal the way of peace to the troubled and the despondent,
                  and show forth the grace and completeness of the Saviour."—

         FROM GOD
                        "The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him,
                      Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no
                      man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be
                      with him" (John 3:2).

                         "In the Teacher sent from God, heaven gave to men its best
                      and greatest. He who had stood in the councils of the Most High,
                       who had dwelt in the innermost sanctuary of the Eternal, was
                      the One chosen to reveal in person to humanity the knowledge
                      of God."—Education, p. 73.
                         Jesus is the Great Physician, and the Scripture often calls Him
                      a preacher or refers to His preaching. But this lesson singles out
                      His work as a teacher, a Teacher whose objective was to restore
                      in man the knowledge of the true God in a world full of miscon-
                      ceptions about Him. (See John 1:18.)
                         "As the evil passions and purposes of men banished God
                      from their thoughts, so forgetfulness of Him inclined them more
                      strongly to evil. The heart in love with sin clothed Him with its
                      own attributes, and this conception strengthened the power of
                      sin. Bent on self-pleasing, men came to regard God as such a
                      one as themselves—a Being whose aim was self-glory, whose
                      requirements were suited to His own pleasure; a Being by whom
                      men were lifted up or cast down according as they helped or
                      hindered His selfish purpose. The lower classes regarded the
                      Supreme Being as one scarcely differing from their oppressors,
                      save by exceeding them in power. . .
                         "There was but one hope for the human race—that into this
                      mass of discordant and corrupting elements might be cast a
                      new leaven; that there might be brought to mankind the power
                      of a new life; that the knowledge of God might be restored to the
                      world.
                         "Christ came to restore this knowledge. He came to set aside
                      the false teaching by which those who claimed to know God had
                      misrepresented Him. He came to manifest the nature of His law,

                                                             August 21
        Part 2    What was the supreme objective Jesus sought to attain in
     NEW BIRTH teaching Nicodemus, who came to Him by night in search of
                wisdom?

                     "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
                   thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
                   of God" (John 3:3).

                      The new birth represents a complete change in the direction
                   of one's life, a radical change far deeper than external be-
                   havioral objectives so popular in current educational vocab-
                   ularies. It represents a complete change in motivation, a new
                   fountain for the stream of human life. Paul represents it, in
                   Romans 6, as the death of the old life and a resurrection to new
                   life, symbolized in baptism by immersion. The new life was
                   exemplified in Jesus' own conduct, and, in the Sermon on the
                   Mount, He also described in words the characteristics of the
                   citizens in the kingdom He had come to establish.
                      "The beatitudes were His greeting to the whole human family.
                   Looking upon the vast throng gathered to listen to the Sermon
                   on the Mount, He seemed for the moment to have forgotten that
                   He was not in heaven, and He used the familiar salutation of the
                   world of light. From His lips flowed blessings as the gushing
                   forth of a long-sealed fountain."—Education, p. 79.
                      The new life that follows the new birth is, of course, the
                   embodiment in human life of the life of God, the life of love for
                   others expressed in the two tables of the law, which Jesus not
                   only identified for the scribe who queried Him about the
                   greatest commandment, but applied in His explanation of the
                   spiritual nature of the law in Matthew 5.
                      As Michelangelo could see a Moses in the rock from the
                   quarry, so Jesus could see beneath a rough exterior the promise
                   of a reborn son of God. "In the light of His purity, men saw
                   themselves unclean, their life's aims mean and false. Yet He
                   drew them. He who had created man, understood the value of
                   humanity.... In every human being, however fallen, He beheld a
                   son of God, one who might be restored to the privilege of his
                   divine relationship.
                      " 'God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world;
                   but that the world through Him might be saved.' John 3:17."—

The Teacher Sent From God-Objectives                    LESSON 9 ❑ Tuesday
                                                                  August 22
            Part 3   In what other words did Jesus express His desire regarding
     SANCTIFICATION the changes He wished to see in the lives of his students?

                       "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth" (John
                     17:17).

                        The new life following the new birth is a progressive growth
                     toward likeness to the character of God.
                        To sanctify is to make holy; and to be holy is to be "spiritually
                     whole, sound, or perfect: of unimpaired innocence or proved
                     virtue: pure in heart: godly: pious."—Webster's Third New In-
                     ternational Dictionary, unabridged.
                        "He who is being sanctified by the truth will be self-
                     controlled, and will follow in the footsteps of Christ until grace
                     is lost in glory. The righteousness by which we are justified is
                     imputed; the righteousness by which we are sanctified is im-
                     parted. The first is our title to heaven, the second is our fitness
                     for heaven."—Messages to Young People, p. 35.
                        Much is made in the educational world today of education's
                     objectives in the areas of knowledge, attitudes, and skills.
                        It is encouraging to see educators state these objectives in
                     terms of the students' behavior rather than the students' words.
                        The paragraph quoted above also contains these sentences:
                     "Righteousness within is testified to by righteousness without.
                     He who is righteous within is not hard-hearted and unsympa-
                     thetic, but day by day he grows into the image of Christ, going
                     on from strength to strength."—Page 35.
                        "Erroneous theories of sanctification, . . . springing from
                     neglect or rejection of the divine law, have a prominent place in
                     the religious movements of the day. These theories are both
                     false in doctrine and dangerous in practical results; and the fact
                     that they are so generally finding favor, renders it doubly essen-
                     tial that all have a clear understanding of what the Scriptures
                     teach upon this point. . . .
                        " ... And since the law of God is 'holy, and just, and good,' a
                     transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a character
                     formed by obedience to that law will be holy. Christ is a perfect
                     example of such a character. He says: 'I have kept My Father's
                     commandments.' I do always those things that please Him.'
                     John 15:10; 8:29. The followers of Christ are to become like
                     Him—by the grace of God to form characters in harmony with
                     the principles of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification."—The

The Teacher Sent From God-Objectives             LESSON 9 ❑ Wednesday
                                                             August 23
          Part 4     What additional objective expressed by Jesus in His work
          UNITY    for His disciples is especially significant in today's complex
                   and divided world?

                     "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
                   thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
                   believe that thou hast sent me" (John 17:21).

                     The parable or illustration of the vine, to which Jesus had
                   pointed the disciples earlier, on the same evening of the inter-
                   cessory prayer from which our key text is taken, emphasized the
                   necessity of union between Christ, the vine, and His disciples,
                   the branches.
                     They were walking in the light of the paschal full moon from
                   the upper chamber toward Gethsemane. This was the eve of
                   their "graduation" from the school of Christ, and their "com-
                   mencement" in their further training under His Holy Spirit.
                   Jesus knew of the selfish striving that had divided them before
                   the supper, and He longed for the achievement of this important
                   goal of unity before sending them into a world divided by lan-
                   guage and race and culture and sinful human nature.
                      Today rapid transportation, as well as other types of com-
                   munication, make even more obvious the divided nature of the
                   world. In view of this, Jesus' prayer takes on new meaning in the
                   context of the world church.
                      "Christ sought to teach the disciples the truth that in God's
                   kingdom there are no territorial lines, no caste, no aristocracy;
                   that they must go to all nations, bearing to them the message of
                   a Saviour's love. But not until later did they realize in all its
                   fullness that God 'hath made of one blood all nations of men for
                   to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the
                   times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that
                   they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and
                   find Him, though He be not far from every one of us.' Acts
                   17:26, 27.
                      "In these first disciples was presented marked diversity. They
                   were to be the world's teachers, and they represented widely
                   varied types of character. In order successfully to carry forward
                   the work to which they had been called, these men, differing in
                   natural characteristics and in habits of life, needed to come into
                   unity of feeling, thought, and action. This unity it was Christ's
                   object to secure."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 20.

          Parl 5     How did Jesus summarize the life principle which He wished
          LOVE     His students to live by?

                     "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one
                   another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another"
                   (John 13:34).

                      The steps in mental perception are often listed in the follow-
                   ing progression, from the simple to the complex: knowledge,
                   comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evalua-
                   tion. Jesus' objective for His disciples, that they should love one
                   another, obviously was and is attained at various levels.
                      There are four kinds of love: (1) Love of self for the sake of self
                   (narcissism) evokes no returned love from anyone. (2) Love of
                   others for the sake of self, which abounds in the world and in the
                   church—kind words are spoken, a compliment is paid, flowers
                   or candy are given, with the conscious or unconscious desire of
                   being loved in return. (3) Love of others for the sake of others,
                   which is the love Jesus came to the world to teach and
                   exemplify—the Christian's own emotional needs are fully satis-
                   fied in Christ, and he can love and give without expecting
                   anything in return. (4) Love of self for the sake of others—the
                   coming apart to rest, the taking of the vacation, the temperance
                   in work and eating—this is motivated by the knowledge that the
                   happiness of others depends on the results of these actions
                   taken in fulfillment of God's instructions to His workers.
                      The statement that "the truths of the divine word can be best
                   appreciated by an intellectual Christian" (Counsels to
                   Teachers, p. 361) should lead us to seek to love not only with all
                   the heart but also with the mind and the whole being. (See Matt.
                   22:36-40.)
                      "To the disciples this commandment was new; for they had
                   not loved one another as Christ had loved them. He saw that
                   new ideas and impulses must control them; that new principles
                   must be practiced by them; through His life and death they were
                   to receive a new conception of love. The command to love one
                   another had a new meaning in the light of His self-sacrifice. The
                   whole work of grace is one continual service of love, of self-
                   denying, self-sacrificing effort. During every hour of Christ's
                   sojourn upon the earth, the love of God was flowing from Him in
                   irrepressible streams. All who are imbued with His Spirit will
                   love as He loved."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 677, 678.

         Part 6   What indication did Jesus give that His purposes for His
   THIS WORLD disciples extended beyond the present world?
  AND THE NEXT
                  "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
                also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were
                not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
                And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
                receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
                also" (John 14:1-3).

                     Some Christians are defensive or embarrassed about their
                  church schools because they think in terms of buildings or
                  facilities, which may not appear to be as splendid as multimil-
                  lion dollar plants built with public funds.
                     On the contrary, they should realize that the scope of Chris-
                  tian education is much broader both in function and in time
                  than public education is designed to be. Speaking of the world's
                  education at large, and of the limited thinking of many Chris-
                  tians, God's messenger says (in a book which has been recog-
                  nized by governments to be valid enough to be printed on
                  government presses and distributed by governments to their
                  teachers):
                     "Our ideas of education take too narrow and too low a range.
                  There is need of a broader scope, a higher aim. True education
                  means more than the pursuel of a certain course of study. It
                  means more than a preparation for the life that now is. It has to
                  do with the whole being, and with the whole period of existence
                  possible to man."—Education, p. 13.
                     The whole being is amplified to mean "the harmonious de-
                  velopment of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual
                  powers." The whole period of existence possible to man is
                  referred to when the statement is made that education "pre-
                  pares the student for the joy of service in this world and for the
                  higher joy of wider service in the world to come."
                     The same book, on page 82, describes the teaching of Jesus:
                   "In His teaching were embraced the things of time and the
                  things of eternity—things seen, in their relation to things un-
                   seen, the passing incidents of common life and the solemn
                  issues of the life to come.
                     "The things of this life He placed in their true relation, as
                   subordinate to those of eternal interest; but He did not ignore
                  their importance. He taught that heaven and earth are linked
                   together, and that a knowledge of divine truth prepares man
                   better to perform the duties of daily life."

         Part 1     "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we

                  Father), full of grace and truth" (John 1:14).
                     One of the most important requirements for the communica-
                  tion of knowledge is that the communicator and the com-
                  municatee have a common language (verbal or nonverbal), a set
                  of signals that mean approximately the same thing to both of
                  them. The signals may be spoken words, hand signals, facial
                  expression, written words, wigwags of a flag, Morse code, short
                  and long blinks of a flashlight, or groups of digits in numerals
                  decipherable only with a codebook. But whatever the medium
                  or the signal, the communicator and the communicatee must
                  have a common background of experience to which each sym-
                  bol can be referred for meaning. The little child must have seen
                  and touched and smelled and heard a cow and even tasted its
                  milk before the picture in the book or the letters C-O-W can have
                  for the child the same meaning that they have for the teacher.

                     What basis for communication did Jesus establish when He
                  sought to teach man about God? John 1:14; Heb. 2:14-18;
                  4:15, 16.
                    Jesus sought and found the common ground upon which His
                  students could view the divine nature that was His objective for
                  them—from time to time they recognized divinity flashing
                  through His humanity. "He who seeks to transform humanity
                  must himself understand humanity."
                     "Born amidst surroundings the rudest, sharing a peasant's
                  home, a peasant's fare, a craftsman's occupation, living a life of
                  obscurity, identifying Himself with the world's unknown
                  toilers,—amidst these conditions and surroundings,—Jesus
                  followed the divine plan of education. . .
                       . . . Never another of woman born was so fiercely beset by
                  temptation; never another bore so heavy a burden of the world's
                  sin and pain. Never was there another whose sympathies were
                  so broad and so tender. A sharer in all the experiences of
                  humanity, He could feel not only for, but with, every burdened
                  and tempted and struggling one."—Education, pp. 77, 78.

                    Once communication was established on common ground,
                  what did Jesus communicate, and how? John 1:18; 13:15;
                  15:10.
                    "What He taught, He lived.... Thus in His life, Christ's words
                  had perfect illustration and support. And more than this; what
                  He taught, He was. His words were the expression, not only of
                  His own life experience, but of His own character. Not only did
                  He teach the truth, but He was the truth. It was this that gave His
                  teaching, power."—Education, pp. 78, 79.

                                                                     August 28
         Part 2   What was Jesus' favorite means of transmitting His mes-
       STORIES sage so that all levels of people could benefit?
     FROM LIFE
                  "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude In para-
                bles; and without a parable spake he not unto them" (Matt.
                13:34).

                     About forty examples of Jesus' parables have been preserved
                  for us in Scripture. These stories disarmed prejudice, caught
                  the attention, and in a delayed-action sequence drove home
                  their meaning after Jesus was no longer present, when the
                  scenes of nature or the events to which He had linked spiritual
                  truth were repeated in aftertime.
                     "His messages of mercy were varied to suit His audience. He
                  knew 'how to speak a word in season to him who is weary' (Isa.
                  50:4); for grace was poured upon His lips, that He might convey
                  to men in the most attractive way the treasures of truth. He had
                  tact to meet the prejudiced minds, and surprise them with illus-
                  trations that won their attention. Through the imagination He
                  reached the heart. His illustrations were taken from the things of
                  daily life, and although they were simple, they had in them a
                  wonderful depth of meaning. The birds of the air, the lilies of the
                  field, the seed, the shepherd and the sheep,—with these objects
                  Christ illustrated immortal truth; and ever afterward, when His
                  hearers chanced to see these things of nature, they recalled His
                   words. Christ's illustrations constantly repeated His lessons."
                  —The Desire of Ages, p. 254.

                   What was one of the reasons why Jesus used this powerful
                  means of conveying truth? Matt. 13:13-15.

                     Jesus quoted from Isaiah 6:9, 10, as Paul did, to describe the
                  besotted condition of people's minds, which required a very
                  special, captivating approach. The enemy had created this con-
                  dition lest they "should understand with their heart, and should
                  be converted, and I should heal them." Isaiah was assured that a
                  remnant would hear and be saved, and Jesus also will "see of
                  the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied" (Isa. 53:11).
                     In the SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 205-207, (and in the
                  appendix of helps in some Bibles) is a listing of the parables of
                  Jesus. On page 192 there is a table which summarizes the
                  features of each Gospel. It shows that Matthew records 21
                  parables, Mark 6, Luke 26, and John none.

             Part 3   What informal settings did Jesus use for His teaching?
          OUTDOOR
        CLASSROOM     "The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the
         SIMPLICITY sea side. And great multitudes were gathered together unto
                    him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole
                    multitude stood on the shore" (Matt. 13:1, 2).

                        Picture yourself standing with the rest of the people on the
                     beach. While Jesus tells His simple stories from the boat, you
                     feel the kiss of the breeze on your cheek, and your eyes rest on
                     the deep blue of the lake or on the hazy blue-green of the
                     mountainous shore beyond. Or you may be sitting on the grassy
                     hillside plucking a wild flower with one hand while your eyes
                     scrutinize the lovely face of this Teacher whose musical voice
                     does something to set the echoes ringing inside the hallways of
                     your soul.
                        "To him who learns thus to interpret its teachings, all nature
                     becomes illuminated; the world is a lesson book, life a school.
                     The unity of man with nature and with God, the universal domin-
                     ion of law, the results of transgression, cannot fail of impressing
                     the mind and molding the character."—Education, p. 100.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why do you think it is said (in Mark 12:37) that the common
                     people heard Jesus gladly? (See also Luke 4:32; Matt. 7:29.)

                        No doubt there was more than one reason. Was it because His
                     questions, immediately preceding this statement, silenced the
                     haughty, upper-class rulers or the very wise scribes? Was it
                     because His simple dress and speech made them feel He was
                     their champion against the oppressive requirements of their
                     leaders? What other reasons can you think of that might apply?
                        "Jesus met the people on their own ground, as one who was
                     acquainted with their perplexities. He made truth beautiful by
                     presenting it in the most direct and simple way. His language
                     was pure, refined, and clear as a running stream. His voice was
                     as music to those who had listened to the monotonous tones of
                     the rabbis. But while His teaching was simple, He spoke as one
                     having authority. This characteristic set His teaching in contrast
                     with that of all others. The rabbis spoke with doubt and hesi-
                     tancy, as if the Scriptures might be interpreted to mean one
                     thing or exactly the opposite. The hearers were daily involved in
                     greater uncertainty. But Jesus taught the Scriptures as of un-
                     questionable authority. Whatever His subject, it was presented
                     with power, as if His words could not be controverted."—The

         Part 4       What do you think Jesus was trying to accomplish in asking
      THOUGHT-      each of the following questions?
     PROVOKING
     QUESTIONS        "Whose is this image and superscription?" (Matt. 22: 20).
                      "If David then called him Lord, how is he his son?" (Matt.
                    22:45).
                      "But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not
                    read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the
                    God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
                    Jacob?" (Matt. 22:31, 32). (Notice that Jesus answered His
                    own question.)

                      You might enjoy taking a red-letter Bible, in which the words
                    spoken by Jesus stand out because they are printed in red ink,
                    and try to find questions that illustrate the way in which Jesus
                    used questions to:
                      1.Elicit faith (necessary for healing He was about to perform).
                      2. Draw attention to a truth He was about to pronounce.
                      3. Draw from the lips of His opposers a truth which they might
                    have rejected if He Himself had said it.
                      4. Parry questions that were intended to embarrass Him and
                    undermine the work He was doing.
                      5. Elicit a logical sequence of statements conducive to truth.
                      6. Present His listeners with a choice.
                      7. Draw attention to a passage of Scripture.

 THINK IT THROUGH     After reading the following paragraph, ask yourself if Jesus'
                    use of questions has applications for family worship.

                       "The teaching of the Bible should have our freshest thought,
                    our best methods, and our most earnest effort.
                       "In arousing and strengthening a love for Bible study, much
                    depends on the use of the hour of worship. The hours of morn-
                    ing and evening worship should be the sweetest and most
                    helpful of the day. Let it be understood that into these hours no
                    troubled, unkind thoughts are to intrude; that parents and chil-
                    dren assemble to meet with Jesus, and to invite into the home
                    the presence of holy angels. Let the services be brief and full of
                    life, adapted to the occasion, and varied from time to time. Let
                    all join in the Bible reading and learn and often repeat God's
                    law. It will add to the interest of the children if they are some-
                    times permitted to select the reading. Question them upon it,
                    and let them ask questions. Mention anything that will serve to
                    illustrate its meaning. When the service is not thus made too
                    lengthy, let the little ones take part in the prayer, and let them

              Part 5  How was Jesus evaluated as a public speaker, even by the
           FORMAL agents of His enemies?
      PRESENTATION
          OF TRUTH    "Why have ye not brought Him? The officers answered,
                     Never man spake like this man" (John 7:45, 46).

                        The lecture method, the formal presentation of a subject in
                      logical sequence to a group of interested learners, has always
                      been one of the tools of the teacher. Jesus was skilled in this as
                      in other approaches to the minds of men. The Gospel of
                      Matthew contains six such lectures or sermons: (1) the Sermon
                      on the Mount, chapters 5 through 7; (2) instructions to the
                      twelve disciples, chapter 10; (3) parables of the kingdom, chap-
                      ter 13; (4) human relations, chapter 18; (5) denunciation of
                      hypocrisy, chapter 23; (6) final events, chapters 24, 25.
                        A skilled speaker will study his audience and structure his
                      material into these steps: obtain attention, create a sense of
                     need, satisfy the need, visualize what this satisfaction will mean
                     to his hearers, and usually, a call to action.
                        The chapter, "At Capernaum" in the book The Desire of Ages,
                     contains one of our best descriptions of Jesus as a public
                     speaker. In a paragraph already quoted we have noted His
                     audience analysis: "His messages of mercy were varied to suit
                     His audience."—Page 254. Notice how He interacted with indi-
                     viduals in His audience:
                        "Jesus watched with deep earnestness the changing counte-
                     nances of His hearers. The faces that expressed interest and
                     pleasure gave Him great satisfaction. As the arrows of truth
                     pierced to the soul, breaking through the barriers of selfish-
                     ness, and working contrition, and finally gratitude, the Saviour
                     was made glad. When His eye swept over the throng of listeners,
                     and He recognized among them the faces He had before seen,
                     His countenance lighted up with joy. He saw in them hopeful
                     subjects for His kingdom. When the truth, plainly spoken,
                     touched some cherished idol, He marked the change of
                     countenance, the cold, forbidding look, which told that the light
                     was unwelcome. When He saw men refuse the message of
                     peace, His heart was pierced to the very depths."—The Desire of

                     prophets, and the Scriptures came to men as a new revelation.

                                                                     September 1
            Part 6      What examples can be cited to show that Jesus paid atten-

                     ing ability? Read John 3:1-6 and 4:1-30, 39-42.

                        In addition to the private interview given by Jesus to
                     Nicodemus at night, and to the personal work done for the
                     Samaritan woman by the well at Sychar, we have other exam-
                     ples of Jesus' work for individuals. The first five disciples were
                     contacted individually, as described in John 1. To Philip He
                     revealed His knowledge of the latter's personal devotional life.
                     To the fishermen, in Matthew 4, He said, "I will make you fishers
                     of men." To Levi Matthew and to Zacchaeus, and even to Pon-
                     tius Pilate, He gave individualized attention.
                        Jesus did not have a home of His own during the years of His
                     ministry, but the home of Lazarus and Martha and Mary in
                     Bethany was enriched by His presence and through the per-
                     sonal ministry highlighted by the resurrection of Lazarus re-
                     corded in John 11.
                        Even in His public ministry, individual differences in learning
                     readiness and learning ability were taken into account:
                        "Deep, unprejudiced thinkers received His teaching, and
                     found that it tested their wisdom. They marveled at the spiritual
                     truth expressed in the simplest language. The most highly edu-
                     cated were charmed with His words, and the uneducated were
                     always profited. He had a message for the illiterate; and He
                     made even the heathen to understand that He had a message for
                     them.
                         "His tender compassion fell with a touch of healing upon
                      weary and troubled hearts. Even amid the turbulence of angry
                     enemies He was surrounded with an atmosphere of peace. The
                     beauty of His countenance, the loveliness of His character,
                     above all, the love expressed in look and tone, drew to Him all
                      who were not hardened in unbelief. Had it not been for the
                      sweet, sympathetic spirit that shone out in every look and word,
                     He would not have attracted the large congregations that He
                      did. The afflicted ones who came to Him felt that He linked His
                      interest with theirs as a faithful and tender friend, and they
                      desired to know more of the truths He taught. Heaven was
                      brought near. They longed to abide in His presence, that the
                      comfort of His love might be with them continually."—The De-

             Part 1     What evidence do we have that Jesus' life left an indelible
         INDELIBLE    impression in the minds of those who lived with Him?
      IMPRESSIONS
                        "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard,
                      which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked
                      upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; ... that
                      which we have seen and heard declare we unto you" (1 John
                      1:1-3).
                        "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when
                      we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
                      Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.... this
                      voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with
                      him in the holy mount" (2 Peter 1:16-18).

                         Both Peter and John remembered very vividly, Peter after 30
                      years and John after 60 years, the scenes from the mount of
                      transfiguration, and the whole panorama of the wonderful life of
                      Jesus. John says, in verse 2 of the key passage quoted above,
                      "For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
                       witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the
                      Father, and was manifested unto us."
                         One of the results of Jesus' teaching was this vivid recollec-
                      tion in the minds of the disciples themselves, as they relived the
                      experiences they had shared with Jesus. These mental images
                      no doubt helped to shape their own conduct as they faced
                      situations similar to those that Jesus faced.
                         "They saw their own weakness; they saw something of the
                      greatness of the work committed to them; they felt their need of
                      their Master's guidance at every step.
                         "They knew that His personal presence was no longer to be
                      with them, and they recognized, as they had never recognized
                      before, the value of the opportunities that had been theirs to
                      walk and talk with the Sent of God. Many of His lessons, when
                      spoken, they had not appreciated or understood; now they
                      longed to recall these lessons, to hear again His words."—
                      Education, p. 94.
                         The Holy Spirit had been promised to "bring all things to your
                      remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (John 14:26).
                      Certainly this was one reason why the teachings of Christ were
                      so effective, as was exemplified in what His disciples wrote
                      many decades after the fact. Today, in the study of the Bible, we
                      should invoke the same Spirit that guided the writing of the
                      Book to interpret vividly for our benefit the events and thoughts
                      recorded in it so many centuries ago.

          Part 2     What did Jewish leaders see in Jesus' former students?
 "THEY HAD BEEN'
    WITH JESUS"      "Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
                   perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they
                   wondered; and they recognized that they had been with
                   Jesus" (Acts 4:13, RSV).

                      Peter and John had not been intimidated by the threats of the
                   highest authorities in the Jewish nation. What a contrast to the
                   night in Gethsemane when these authorities had seen the disci-
                   ples scatter in fear, and later when Peter had denied with curs-
                   ing that he ever knew Jesus! What made the difference?
                      "For these disciples the mission of Christ finally ac-
                   complished its purpose. Little by little His example and His
                   lessons of self-abnegation molded their characters. His death
                   destroyed their hope of worldly greatness. The fall of Peter, the
                   apostasy of Judas, their own failure in forsaking Christ in His
                   anguish and peril, swept away their self-sufficiency. . . .
                      "No longer were they ignorant and uncultured. No longer
                   were they a collection of independent units or of discordant and
                   conflicting elements. No longer were their hopes set on worldly
                   greatness. They were of 'one accord,' of one mind and one soul.
                   Christ filled their thoughts. The advancement of His kingdom
                   was their aim. In mind and charauto, :ney had become like their
                   Master; and men 'took knowledge of them, that they had been
                   with Jesus.' Acts 4:13.
                      "Then was there such a revelation of the glory of Christ as had
                   never before been witnessed by mortal man. Multitudes who
                   had reviled His name and despised His power confessed them-
                   selves disciples of the Crucified. Through the co-operation of
                   the divine Spirit the labors of the humble men whom Christ had
                    chosen stirred the world. To every nation under heaven was the

        ONE DISAP-

                     testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you
                     shall betray me" (John 13:21).

                        Parents may be sorely disappointed if their children, for
                     whom they have labored faithfully and sought to educate for
                     God, take a course directly contrary to the life goal of their
                     parents. Such may experience the sympathy of Jesus who Him-
                     self lost 8 percent of His twelve disciples.
                        "With Judas an element of antagonism was introduced
                     among the disciples. In connecting himself with Jesus he had
                     responded to the attraction of His character and life. He had
                     sincerely desired a change in himself, and had hoped to experi-
                     ence this through a union with Jesus. But this desire did not
                     become predominant. That which ruled him was the hope of
                     selfish benefit in the worldly kingdom which he expected Christ
                     to establish. Though recognizing the divine power of the love of
                     Christ, Judas did not yield to its supremacy. He continued to
                     cherish his own judgment and opinions, his disposition to
                     criticize and condemn....
                        "Jesus, seeing that to antagonize was but to harden, re-
                     frained from direct conflict. The narrowing selfishness of Judas'
                     life, Christ sought to heal through contact with His own self-
                     sacrificing love.. ..
                        " ... Day after day, when the burden lay heaviest on His own
                     heart, He had borne the pain of continual contact with that
                     stubborn, suspicious, brooding spirit; He had witnessed and
                     labored to counteract among His disciples that continuous,
                     secret, and subtle antagonism. And all this that no possible

THINK IT THROUGH       Notice how Jesus turned a liability into an asset by the way
                     in which he dealt with Judas.

                       "So far as Judas himself was concerned, Christ's work of love
                     had been without avail. But not so as regards his fellow disci-
                     ples. To them it was a lesson of lifelong influence. Ever would its
                     example of tenderness and long-suffering mold their inter-
                     course with the tempted and the erring. And it had other les-
                     sons. At the ordination of the Twelve the disciples had greatly

          Part 6     What special promise is made to those who accept the
"STARS FOREVER     challenge of being teachers?
     AND EVER"
                     "Those who are teachers shall then shine as the brightness
                   of the firmament and those who turned many to righteousness
                   as the stars for ever and ever" (Dan. 12:3, Berkeley).

                      The context of Daniel 12:3 makes it clear that this promise is
                   associated with the time of the end. The close of probation, the
                   time of trouble, the deliverance of God's people are past. The
                   partial resurrection has brought from the grave the outstanding
                   figures on both sides of the conflict of the ages to witness the
                   final events. Eternity is ushered in. Shining with the brightness
                   of the stars will be those who have, through their life and teach-
                   ing, influenced others toward righteousness. Among them we
                   can expect to see those who have been teachers for God. They
                   have taught at home, in the Sabbath School, or in a formal
                   school setting.
                      "All the perplexities of life's experience will then be made
                   plain. Where to us have appeared only confusion and disap-
                   pointment, broken purposes and thwarted plans, will be seen a
                   grand, overruling, victorious purpose, a divine harmony.
                      "There all who have wrought with unselfish spirit will behold
                   the fruit of their labors. The outworking of every right principle
                   and noble deed will be seen. Something of this we see here. But
                   how little of the result of the world's noblest work is in this life
                   manifest to the doer! How many toil unselfishly and unweariedly
                   for those who pass beyond their reach and knowledge! Parents
                   and teachers lie down in their last sleep, their lifework seeming
                   to have been wrought in vain; they know not that their faithful-
                   ness has unsealed springs of blessing that can never cease to
                   flow; only by faith they see the children they have trained be-
                   come a benediction and an inspiration of their fellow men, and
                   the influence repeat itself a thousandfold. Many a worker sends
                   out into the world messages of strength and hope and courage,
                   words that carry blessing to hearts in every land; but of the
                   results he, toiling in loneliness and obscurity, knows little. So
                   gifts are bestowed, burdens are borne, labor is done. Men sow
                   the seed from which, above their graves, others reap blessed
                   harvests. They plant trees, that others may eat the fruit. They are
                   content here to know that they have set in motion agencies for
                   good. In the hereafter the action and reaction of all these will be

          Part 1   What did Jesus promise His disciples on the eve of His
 THE PROMISE OF crucifixion?
 THE COMFORTER
                   "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Com-
                 forter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of
                 truth, whom the world cannot receive" (John 14:16, 17).

                      The word translated "Comforter" is the same word translated
                    "Advocate" in First John 2:1. Parakletos, in the Greek, is com-
                   posed of two elements. The first means "beside," and the sec-
                   ond means to "be called." The Comforter stands beside me in
                   everyday life, puts His arm around me, and speaks to me words
                   of encouragement. The Advocate stands beside me in court,
                   puts His arm around me, and speaks to the Judge eloquent
                   words on my behalf.
                      Jesus, referred to as the Advocate in First John 2:1, is Himself
                   a Parakletos. This is why He promises in John 14:16 that the
                   Father will send another Parakletos to take Jesus' place now
                   that He is about to depart from their side.
                      The Holy Spirit was Christ's parting gift to His disciples. One
                   could almost say that this was their graduation gift, for it came
                   at the close of the three and one half years they had spent in the
                   school of Christ. It was a wise gift, for it anticipated a very real
                   need they would face as He sent them out into the world to be
                   His representatives.
                      "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world," was
                   a promise fulfilled through the Holy Spirit. It was through the
                   Spirit that Christ would be at their sides to help them and direct
                   their efforts. The promise made to them applies to us today, at
                   the end of time.

THINK IT THROUGH     Did the early disciples have a monopoly on the Holy Spirit?

                     "The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to
                   any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit
                   was to be with His followers unto the end. From the Day of
                   Pentecost to the present time, the Comforter has been sent to all
                   who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His
                   service."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 49.
                     "The Comforter is ours as well as theirs. The Spirit furnishes
                   the strength that sustains striving, wrestling souls in every
                   emergency, amidst the hatred of the world, and the realization
                   of their own failures and mistakes. In sorrow and affliction,
                   when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we
                   feel helpless and alone,—these are the times when, in answer to
                   the prayer of faith, the Holy Spirit brings comfort to the
                   heart."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 51.

The Holy Spirit as an Educator           LESSON 12                  ❑ Monday
                                                                  September 11
             Part 2    What was to be one of the functions of the Holy Spirit?
"THE COMFORTER
. . . SHALL TEACH      "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
             YOU" will send In my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
                    all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
                    you" (John 14:26).

                      Just as Jesus was a teacher, so His representative was also to
                   be a teacher to His disciples. The Holy Spirit was a follow-up, an
                   extension of the school of Christ. In a way, it was the real school
                   for which Christ's work had been only a preparation.
                      "Under the training of Christ the disciples had been led to feel
                   their need of the Spirit. Under the Spirit's teaching they received
                   the final qualification, and went forth to their lifework. No longer
                   were they ignorant and uncultured. No longer were they a col-
                   lection of independent units or discordant, conflicting ele-
                   ments. No longer were their hopes set on worldly greatness.
                   They were of 'one accord,' of one heart and of one soul.' Acts
                   2:46; 4:32. Christ filled their thoughts; the advancement of His
                   kingdom was their aim. In mind and character they had become
                   like their Master, and men 'took knowledge of them, that they
                   had been with Jesus.' Acts 4:13."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                   p. 45.
                      Today, even as in the first century of the Christian church,
                   God would use the Holy Spirit to educate and refine the workers
                   in His church, whether laymen or denominational employees.
                      "The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of
                   Christ. Those only who are thus taught of God, those only who
                    possess the inward working of the Spirit, and in whose life the
                    Christ-life is manifested, can stand as true representatives of
                    the Saviour.
                      "God takes men as they are, and educates them for His ser-
                    vice, if they will yield themselves to Him. The Spirit of God,
                    received into the soul, quickens all its faculties. Under the guid-
                    ance of the Holy Spirit, the mind that is devoted unreservedly
                    to God, develops harmoniously, and is strengthened to com-
                    prehend and fulfill the requirements of God. . . . The Christian
                    becomes like his Master in character. He has clearer, broader
                    views. His discernment is more penetrative, his judgment better
                    balanced. So quickened is he by the life-giving power of the Sun
                    of Righteousness, that he is enabled to bear much fruit to the
                    glory of God."—Gospel Workers, pp. 285, 286.

                 your heart. Nevertheless .. . it is expedient for you that I go
                 away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto
                 you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you" (John 16:5-7).

                      "Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in every place
                   personally. Therefore it was for their interest that He should go
                   to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth.
                   No one could then have any advantage because of his location
                   or his personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour
                   would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to
                   them than if He had not ascended on high."—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 669.
                      Parents and teachers are often conscious of their limitations
                   in trying to know what is going on. The teacher turns his back to
                   the class while he writes on the board. The parent must go to
                   work to earn a living for the family. What are the children doing?
                      As a parent or as a teacher I may find strength in knowing that
                   the Holy Spirit, the Parakletos who stands beside me, is my
                   Helper alerting me to the plans of Satan. Through Him I can be
                   made aware of the dangers or temptations facing those for
                   whom I am responsible. I can take wise measures to counteract
                   the influence of the enemy.
                     The Holy Spirit is also an influence that radiates from my
                   person when I have been long on my knees. Like a subtle
                   perfume that fills the room, He enters the classroom with me.
                   His presence surrounds the pulpit when I preach or lead the
                   Sabbath School. The home is different when I'm there, if the
                   Spirit dwells within me.

                      "If the teacher has the love of Christ abiding in the heart as a

      ALL TRUTH       "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear
                    them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will
                    guide you into all truth" (John 16:12, 13).

                        Pilate asked Jesus, "What is truth?" But he did not wait for the
                    answer.
                        In everyday life we can say that a verbal statement is true when
                    it is conformable to fact, conformable to nature or to reality. Our
                    hearing communicates to us a message that conforms to what
                    our other senses—sight, touch, taste, smell—tell us.
                        We also speak of a true copy when it conforms to the original,
                    of a true weight when it conforms to a standard, and of a true
                    likeness when it conforms to a pattern.
                        Spiritual truth also involves conformity or agreement. We
                    hear or read verbal statements regarding good or evil in human
                    conduct. What would our senses tell us about such values if
                    those senses could penetrate the barriers of time and space and
                    allow us to see everything as God does?
                         The Spirit of truth is to guide Christians into all truth. We can,
                     through Him, penetrate the barriers of time and space. Spirit-
                     inspired faith is the radar which penetrates the fog and reaches
                     out to reveal the rocky coastline. It enables us to steer a true
                     course to the safety of the harbor. Our verbal statements to
                     others will conform to the invisible facts. Others will not be
                     misled or shipwrecked.
                         To educate, in the transitive sense of the verb, is to provide
                     guidance in the student's spontaneous search for truth.
                         Jesus, even amid the agonies of five successive trials and
                     facing the final torture of the cross, was seeking to provide such
                      guidance to Pilate. "Pilate had a desire to know the truth.... He
                     eagerly grasped the words of the Saviour, and his heart was
                      stirred with a great longing to know what it really was, and how
                      he could obtain it.... But he did not wait for an answer."—The
                      Desire of Ages, p. 727.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Do I really want to know the whole truth? If so, how can I go
                     about attaining it?

                        "A knowledge of the truth depends not so much upon
                     strength of intellect as upon pureness of purpose, the simplicity
                     of an earnest, dependent faith. To those who in humility of heart
                     seek for divine guidance, angels of God draw near. The Holy
                     Spirit is given to open to them the rich treasures of the
                     truth."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 59.

The Holy Spirit as an Educator. LESSON 12                              ❑ Thursday
                                                                      September 14
           Part 5    What freedom do I obtain through being educated by the
CHANGED BEHAVIOR    Holy Spirit?
        THROUGH
       THE SPIRIT     "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
                    free from the law of sin and death" (Rom. 8:2).

                       Law, in nature, is a consistent relationship between cause
                    and effect. The passage of Romans 8:1-16 contrasts two ways of
                    life, walking after the flesh and walking after the Spirit. The
                     walk, or way of behaving, is the effect which follows after the
                     cause or motivating force.
                       This conflict was a very real one to Paul: "I delight in the law of
                    God after the inward man: but I see another law in my members,
                    warring against the law of my mind" (Rom. 7:22, 23). It made him
                    very miserable until Christ freed him.
                       Meade McGuire, a veteran youth leader in the Seventh-day
                    Adventist Church, used to compare the two natures in man to
                    two fighting dogs that are frequently in conflict with each other.
                    If both dogs are fed well and in good health, there will be a
                    horrendous fight every time they face each other. But suppose
                    that for two weeks one dog was starved and the other fed. There
                    wouldn't be much of a fight. And if the process were continued
                    consistently for three months, there would be no fight at all. One
                    dog would be dead.
                       The trouble with most unhappy Christians is that they keep
                    throwing scraps to the carnal nature, enough to keep it alive and
                    full of fight. They're always on the fence, too saintly to be happy
                    at a dance, and too worldly to be happy at a prayer meeting.
                       "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are
                    in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit"
                    (Rom. 8:1).

 THINK IT THROUGH     The freedom obtained by the power of the Holy Spirit is
                    similar to that of the barge salvaged from the bottom of the
                    Hudson River. Its cargo made it worth salvaging, but screaming
                    winches strained unsuccessfully as experienced engineers
                    sought to raise it from where it was stuck in the muck. Finally a
                    young engineer had a chance to try his ideas. At low tide he
                    harnessed cables from the barge to a score of pontoons floating
                    on the river above. As the tide came in, effortlessly and silently,
                    the strength of the ocean pulled by the moon freed the barge
                    and its cargo from the filthy bottom of the river.

The Holy Spirit as an Educator          LESSON 12                    ❑ Friday
                                                                 September 15
          Part 6    What special insight can the Christian have, thanks to the
   INSIGHT INTO    ministry of the Holy Spirit?
    THE FUTURE
                     "Whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will
                   shew you things to come" (John 16:13).

                     The Holy Spirit, a divine Person and one of the Trinity, is
                   Himself unlimited by time or space. Through His guidance He
                   enables man to break through the barriers of time and space in
                   his search for truth.
                     In parts 3 and 4 of this lesson we have seen how the Spirit
                   makes Christ omnipresent and breaks the barrier of space that
                   might separate man from Christ and from the universe of truth.
                     Let us now consider how the Holy Spirit, through His teach-
                   ing, enables man's mind to break through the barrier of time to
                   know the future. "He will shew you things to come."
                     This is especially important to our understanding of lessons
                   13 and 14, which deal with events still future, revealed to us
                   through Spirit-inspired messengers of God.

                     What have been the two great pillars around which Bible
                   prophecy has centered? 1 Peter 1:9-11.

                      Using another metaphor, the prophecies of Christ's suffer-
                   ings and the glory that should follow are like parallel threads of
                   crimson and gold, running from Genesis to Revelation. The
                   sufferings relate to His first advent—the humble birth, the sac-
                   rificing life, the crucifixion. The glory that should follow in-
                   cludes, perhaps, the resurrection and ascension, but focuses
                   more clearly on the second advent and the eternal glory of the
                   Messianic kingdom. Read the whole chapter and renew the
                   "lively hope" we Christians have.

                     What assurance has Peter sought to give us regarding the
                   reliability of the Spirit-inspired promises on which we base our
                   hope for the future? 2 Peter 1:19-21.

                      Peter has referred to "exceeding great and precious prom-
                   ises" in verse 4. He himself promises the Christian an abundant
                   entrance into the everlasting kingdom (verse 11). His own im-
                   mediate future, not a pleasant one, has been foretold by Jesus
                   (verse 14; compare John 21:18), and he is ready. Now he urges
                   Christians not to be shortsighted as they plan for the future
                   (verses 9, 10), but puts them "in remembrance" (verses 12, 13,
                   15). With his own eyes he had seen the glory of the transfigura-
                   tion. But "more sure" than the testimony of his own eyes is the
                   word of prophecy, as the divine is more sure than the human!
                   Memorize this thrilling passage!

        MESSAGES
                       "I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
                     everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
                     earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
                     people.... And there followed another angel.... And the third
                     angel followed them" (Rev. 14:6-9).

                        The first angel's message proclaimed the everlasting gospel
                     with urgency because the hour of God's judgment had come.
                     (The work of Joseph Wolff in Asia and Africa; of Bengel, Irving,
                     Drummond, Farel and Gaussen in Europe; of Miller, Nimes,
                     Bates, and many others in America constituted such a message.
                     Miller, especially, focused on the exact time, based on Daniel
                     8:14.)
                        The second angel's message announced the fall of Babylon;
                     and Fitch (see part 3) recognized this fall in the rejection by
                     popular churches of the first angel's message in 1842-1844.
                        The third angel's message draws attention to the mark of the
                     beast (easily contrasted with the seal of God in Revelation 7).
                     Our pioneers saw the counterpart of this message in their re-
                     newed discovery of the Sabbath and its proclamation beginning
                     in 1844 at Washington, New Hampshire, and in an organized
                     way in 1846. They saw Sabbath keeping versus Sunday keeping
                     as outward, visible marks of allegiance to God's law or to the
                     enemy of God's law, and of the characters that result from these
                     respective allegiances.
                        The final proclamation of the gospel seems to polarize the
                     population of the world, cutting across families and friendships.
                     Immediately following the three angels' proclamation, the Son
                     of man comes (Rev. 14:14); the grain is harvested (verses 15,
                     16), and the grapes are trodden in the winepress of God's wrath
                     (verses 17-19). Each kind of plant has produced its natural
                     fruitage, the fruit is ripe, and evaluation is made on the basis of
                     that fruitage (Matt. 7:16-20).
                        Parts 2 and 3 of this lesson examine some relations of the
                     three messages on one hand to the children and youth, and to
                     educational concepts of the advent movement on the other.
                        "I saw a company who stood well guarded and firm, giving no
                     countenance to those who would unsettle the established faith
                     of the body. God looked upon them with approbation. I was
                     shown three steps—the first, second, and third angels' mes-

      THE FIRST the special proclamation of the everlasting gospel by the first

                    "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judg-

                  and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (Rev. 14:7).

                     The transformation of the entire life by the gospel is especially
                  urgent because the hour of the judgment has come. Notice that
                  there is a certain parallelism between these three commands
                  and the threefold aspects of a balanced education in restoring
                  man to the image of his Maker.
                     1. Ps. 111:10: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wis-
                  dom" (mind).
                     2. 1 Cor. 6:20: "Glorify God in your body" (body).
                     3. John 4:23: "Worship the Father in spirit" (spirit).
                     The involvement of the whole man in the final polarization of
                  humanity for God or for the enemy of God is also implied in
                  phrases of Revelation 7 and 14 regarding the seal of God and
                  the mark of the beast. Every person is to receive either God's
                  seal in the forehead, or the mark of the beast in the forehead or
                  hand. God's seal applies only to the condition of heart and
                  mind. The beast's mark applies to either heart and mind or to
                  outward conformity.
                     Children and youth were involved in the proclamation of the
                  first angel's message in Europe. Farel and Gaussen addressed
                  themselves to the children in taking the gospel to Geneva,
                  hoping through them to reach their parents. (See The Great
                  Controversy, p. 365.) In more recent times the starting of a
                  school for children and youth has been the spearhead for pre-
                  senting the message in places like the Columbian Islands in the
                  Caribbean, and in Mexico City. Language schools have served a
                  like purpose in Japan and Korea and other places. Vacation
                  Bible Schools for children are based on a similar rationale. Of
                  Gaussen, on the page referred to above, Ellen White says: "The
                  effort was successful. As he addressed the children, older per-
                  sons came to listen. The galleries of his church were filled with
                  attentive hearers. Among them were men of rank and learning,
                  and strangers and foreigners visiting Geneva; and thus the
                  message was carried to other parts."
                     The child preachers of Scandinavia were also used by God in
                   proclaiming the first angel's message.

Evaluation in the Testing Time             LESSON 13                   ❑ Tuesday

            Part 3     What was the message of the second angel?
      THE SECOND
           ANGEL       "There followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
                     fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of
                     the wine of the wrath of her fornication" (Rev. 14:8).

                        Adventists early applied this prophecy to their own work of
                     warning the world about Christ's coming. In 1843 Charles Fitch
                     wrote, "If you are the true ministers of Christ, come out of
                     Babylon, and no longer be opposed to the coming of Christ."
                     Joshua Himes also phrased an appeal in the language of the
                     second angel's message. "In May, 1847, two years and six
                     months after the disappointment, there was issued a pamphlet
                     A Word to the 'Little Flock.' . . . In the main, the pamphlet is the
                     work of young James White, in which . . . we find the first
                     published reference to the third angel's message, in his
                     'Thoughts on Revelation 14.' "—A. W. Spalding, Origin and
                     History of Seventh-day Adventists (Washington, DC: Review
                     and Herald Publishing Association, 1961), pp. 175, 177.
                        Most Seventh-day Adventists do not realize how strongly
                     James White felt about applying the second angel's message to
                     the children of the church. Witness this statement made in the
                     church paper of which he was editor and publisher:
                        "We as a people hold that it is necessary to separate ourselves
                     from the world and the fallen churches, lest their associations
                     becloud our minds and destroy our faith. This we regard as a
                     scriptural position, and the only safe position for Christian men
                     and women in these perilous times. God's word has required
                     Christians in all past time to separate themselves from the
                     world; but how much more is this the duty of Christians in this
                     corrupt age. If this be our duty, then we have a duty to do in this
                     respect to our children. Shall we come out of Babylon, and leave
                     our children behind? Shall we send them where is seen the
                     boldest imprint of the filling up of the cup of her fury? Take care
                     brother, sister, lest you call down upon your own heads, the
                     displeasure of God, and the blood of your children. Separate
                     your children from the world. Like Israel, gather them into your
                     dwellings, and strike your door-posts with blood, for the de-
                     stroying angels will soon be on their way, to 'slay utterly old and
                     young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come
                     not near any man upon whom is the mark.' "—James White,

                                                                   September 20
           Part 4     What is the third angel's message? Rev. 14:9-12.
    THIRD ANGEL
   AND LOUD CRY        The mark of the beast stands in contrast to the seal of God.
                    (See Revelation 7.) The seal of God's authority in His law, giving
                    His name, title, and jurisdiction is found in the fourth com-
                    mandment. But the seal is broader; it includes the whole god-
                    like character of those who are obedient to His law.

                      What repetition of the three angels' messages is expected
                    with great power before the end of time?

                      "After these things I saw another angel come down from
                    heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with
                    his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying,
                    Babylon the great is fallen.... And I heard another voice from
                    heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not
                    partakers of her sins, and that ye may receive not of her
                    plagues" (Rev. 18:1-4).

                       "The light that was shed upon the waiting ones penetrated
                    everywhere, and those in the churches who had any light, who
                    had not heard and rejected the three messages, obeyed the call
                    and left the fallen churches.... The third message was to do its
                    work; all were to be tested upon it. . . . A compelling power
                    moved the honest, while the manifestation of the power of God
                    brought a fear and restraint upon their unbelieving relatives and
                    friends so that they dared not, neither had they the power to,
                    hinder those who felt the work of the Spirit of God upon
                    them."—Early Writings, p. 278.
                       The work of devout and consecrated church school teachers
                    will find its true test of success under similar circumstances:
                       "In the closing scenes of this earth's history many of these
                    children and youth will astonish people by their witness to the
                    truth, which will be borne in simplicity, yet with spirit and power.
                    They have been taught the fear of the Lord, and their hearts have
                    been softened by a careful and prayerful study of the Bible. In
                    the near future many children will be endued with the Spirit of
                    God, and will do a work in proclaiming the truth to the world,
                    that at that time cannot well be done by the older members of
                    the church.
                       "The Lord would use the church school as an aid to the
                     parents in educating and preparing their children for this time
                     before us. Then let the church take hold of the school work in
                    earnest and make it what the Lord desires it to be."—Counsels

Evaluation in the Testing Time             LESSON 13                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                      September 21
            Part 5    What does Daniel say will come upon the earth at the time
         THE TIME    when Michael stands up?
      OF TROUBLE
                       "There shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since
                     there was a nation even to that same time" (Dan. 12:1).

                        "The 'time of trouble, such as never was,' is soon to open
                     upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do not now
                     possess and which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often
                     the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but
                     this is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid presenta-
                     tion cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal. In that time of
                     trial, every soul must stand for himself before God."—The Great
                     Controversy, p. 622.
                        Adventist theology distinguishes between a "little time of
                     trouble" before the close of probation, and the "time of Jacob's
                     trouble" during the outpouring of the seven last plagues, in
                     which God's people will live without an intercessor. Their an-
                     guish at that time is not due to physical suffering or persecution
                     so much as their search for assurance of acceptance with God.

                      What example in the writings of Paul helps us to understand
                     what these difficult times will mean to believers? 1 Cor. 3:9-15.

                        Just as examination day reveals what a student has ac-
                     complished during the term, it also reveals something about the
                     work of the teacher. Dokimazd, the Greek word translated
                     "trial" in the above text is also used of the testing of gold. The
                     assayer's test requires great heat to melt the ore and separate
                     the fine metal from the dross.

THINK IT THROUGH        "Before the overflowing scourge shall come upon the dwell-
                     ers of the earth, the Lord calls upon all who are Israelites indeed
                     to prepare for that event. To parents He sends the warning cry:
                     Gather your children into your own houses; gather them away
                     from those who are disregarding the commandments of God,
                     who are teaching and practicing evil. Get out of the large cities
                     as fast as possible. Establish church schools. Give your children
                     the word of God as the foundation of all their education."—
                     Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 195.
                        "If ever we are to work in earnest, it is now. The enemy is
                     pressing in on all sides, like a flood. Only the power of God can
                     save our children from being swept away by the tide of evil. The
                     responsibility resting upon parents, teachers, and church
                     members, to do their part in co-operation with God, is greater
                     than words can express."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 166.

                                                                 September 22
        Part 6    "They sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
   COMPANIONS   before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
   OF THE LAMB that song but the hundred and forty four thousand, which were
                redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not
                defiled. . . . These are they which follow the Lamb whither-
                soever he goeth.... In their mouth was found no guile: for they
                are without fault before the throne of God" (Rev. 14:3-5).

                     The 144,000 have the special honor of constantly following
                  the Lamb. Only they, of the human race, have lived through the
                  time of trouble foretold in Daniel 12:1, the time Michael stands
                  up to leave His ministry in the•heavenly sanctuary. They have
                  washed their robes in Christ's blood and held fast to His truth.
                  (See Early Writings, p. 17.)
                      What a special privilege it will be to be among those who
                  participate in the final demonstration to the universe that the
                  plan of redemption is effective, that God's holy law can indeed
                  be kept by created beings! And what a special satisfaction it will
                  be for parents and teachers of those who form part of this
                  special group to see that their influence has by the grace of God
                  been successful!
                      "We must preach on the subject of the 144,000. The topic
                  must be given a larger place in our thinking and in our speaking.
                  It is not necessary that we enter the field of controversy that has
                  caused so many to avoid more than a simple mention of this
                  special group. (1) We may remain within the realm of that which
                  has been revealed and preach frequently on the kind of charac-
                  ter that will be possessed by each of the 144,000. We may deal
                  with the steps in the preparation of that translation character.
                  (2) Much has been revealed concerning the experience of the
                  144,000 just before the second Advent, during the seven last
                  plagues and the time of Jacob's trouble. How to prepare for that
                  time is pointed out. These things must be preached. (3) Revela-
                  tion has made plain that the religious beliefs of the 144,000 will
                  be free from erroneous teachings. We must instruct our people
                  in how to test their beliefs and become established on a firm
                  foundation. (4) Another clear point is that Satan, personally, and
                  through the beast, has had a special controversy with the
                  144,000, and they have come off victorious. We must lead our
                  people into the kind of experience that will withstand all the
                  onslaughts of the evil one. (5) A little insight is given into the
                  special reward that is to be theirs."—T. H. Jemison, in Our Firm

       AGAIN WITH    continue with Him beyond the three and one half years of
      THE MASTER     instruction He gave them on earth?

                       "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
                     also In me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if It were
                     not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
                     And If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
                     receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
                     also" (John 14:1-3).

                         The final chapter of Ellen White's book Education, entitled
                       "The School of the Hereafter," contains this thought: "The life
                      on earth is the beginning of the life in heaven; education on
                      earth is an initiation into the principles of heaven; the lifework
                      here is a training for the lifework there. What we now are, in
                      character and holy service, is the sure foreshadowing of what
                      we shall be."—Page 307.
                         A veteran Adventist educator summarizes today's priorities in
                      education in terms of the brevity of life, comparing it with the
                      brevity of Jesus' three and one half years with His disciples.
                         When I was 20, and had 50 years to go out of the 70 the
                      psalmist accepts as the measure of life's span (Ps. 90:10), I had a
                      long list of things I wanted to do in life. Some of them were
                      adventures of the physical domain—mountain climbing, travel,
                      sailing, flying, water-skiing. Others were intellectual in
                      nature—things I had only tasted of in secondary and higher
                     education and wished to explore with ample time and
                     resources—the calculus, chemistry, statistics, five or six lan-
                     guages instead of two.
                         Now that the figures have been reversed, with more than 50
                     years gone and even less than 20 to go, the satisfaction of the
                     accomplishments is tinged with the solemn realization that
                     life's agenda is ever longer as the time grows shorter. Cecil
                     Rhodes is said to have exclaimed on his deathbed, "So much to
                     do—so little time in which to do it." That's how I would feel if it
                     weren't for the confident expectation of being admitted to the
                     school of the hereafter, where I can enroll at leisure in a 3000-
                     year course in chemistry, or 5000 years In church history.
                        Jesus had only three and one half years for the education of
                     His disciples. He knew how to set up His priorities. "The things
                     of this life He placed in their true relation, as subordinate to
                     those of eternal interest."—Education, p. 82.

                                                                   September 25
           Part 2   What was the burden of Jesus' intercessory prayer to His
   JESUS' PRAYER Father?
      ANSWERED
                    "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be
                  with me where l am; that they may behold my glory, which thou
                  hast given me: for thou Iovedst me before the foundation of
                  the world" (John 17:24).

                       "Now is fulfilled the Saviour's prayer for His disciples: 'I will
                   that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I
                   am.' Faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding
                   joy' (Jude 24), Christ presents to the Father the purchase of His
                   blood, declaring: 'Here am I, and the children whom Thou hast
                   given Me.' Those that Thou gayest Me I have kept.' Oh, the
                   wonders of redeeming love! the rapture of that hour when the
                   infinite Father, looking upon the ransomed, shall behold His
                   image, sin's discord banished, its blight removed, and the
                   human once more in harmony with the divine!"—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 646.
                       Ellen White continues describing Jesus'"class reunion" with
                   His followers: "With unutterable love, Jesus welcomes His faith-
                   ful ones to the joy of their Lord. The Saviour's joy is in seeing, in
                   the kingdom of glory, the souls that have been saved by His
                   agony and humiliation. And the redeemed will be sharers in His
                    joy, as they behold, among the blessed, those who have been
                    won to Christ through their prayers, their labors, and their
                   loving sacrifice. As they gather about the great white throne,
                    gladness unspeakable will fill their hearts, when they behold
                    those whom they have won for Christ, and see that one has
                    gained others, and these still others, all brought into the haven
                    of rest, there to lay their crowns at Jesus' feet and praise Him
                    through the endless cycles of eternity."—The Great Con-
                   troversy, p. 647.
                       In lesson 12 we saw that the Holy Spirit gave the disciples their
                    "in-service training," which enabled them to accomplish their
                    life work.
                        But beyond all this lies the unhurried atmosphere, the reflec-
                    tive thinking, the polish that characterizes graduate study.
                    Jesus, while still on earth, wanted to take His disciples beyond
                    this world's cares and limitations to experience His glory. He
                     would be not only the Author but the Finisher of our faith.

                                                                  September 26
        Part 3  What beautiful promise do we have in the last two chapters
   NEW HEAVEN of the Bible that indicate it is God's plan to restore the Eden
 AND NEW EARTH school described in the first two chapters?

                    "I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
                  and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more
                  sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming
                  down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for
                  her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying,
                  Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell
                  with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall
                  be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all
                  tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
                  neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
                  pain: for the former things are passed away" (Rev. 21:1-4).

                     (Read also Rev. 22:1-7.)
                     The restoration of Eden includes a restoration of the "school
                  in a garden" on which attention was focused in the first lesson
                  of this quarter. This is the thought expressed in the final chapter
                  of the book Ellen White wrote, under divine inspiration, while
                  nurturing the infant Avondale College in Australia. While the
                  wind rustled in the gum trees and the kookaburra filled the
                  dawn with its far-reaching, inimitable call, she penned:
                     "Heaven is a school; its field of study, the universe; its
                  teacher, the Infinite One. A branch of this school was estab-
                  lished in Eden; and, the plan of redemption accomplished,
                  education will again be taken up in the Eden school.
                     " 'Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
                  the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
                  that love Him.' 1 Corinthians 2:9. Only through His word can a
                  knowledge of these things be gained; and even this affords but
                  a partial revelation."—Education, p. 301.
                     There will be similarities, yes, but also contrasts:
                     "Between the school established in Eden at the beginning
                  and the school of the hereafter there lies the whole compass of
                  this world's history—the history of human transgression and
                  suffering, of divine sacrifice, and of victory over death and sin.
                  Not all the conditions of that first school of Eden will be found in
                  the school of the future life. No tree of knowledge of good and
                  evil will afford opportunity for temptation. No tempter is there,
                  no possibility of wrong. Every character has withstood the test-
                  ing of evil, and none are longer susceptible to its power."—

          Part 4     What promise did the Lord make about Judah's children
    "TAUGHT OF     after the captivity?
     THE LORD"
                     "0 thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
                   behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
                   foundations with sapphires. And I will make thy windows of
                   agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of
                   pleasant stones. And all thy children shall be taught of the
                   Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children" (Isa.
                   54:11-13).

                      The antecedent of thou and thy in this promise is found in
                   verses 1 to 10. The promise is spoken to the barren woman who
                   was to enlarge her tent and strengthen her stakes. She is mar-
                   ried to her Maker, whose kindness will never more depart from
                   her though the mountains and the hills be removed. She is
                   God's people in ancient Judah and secondly God's church
                   today.
                      Ellen White has depicted for us the Lord's teaching of each
                   child of the church:
                      "Not until the providences of God are seen in the light of
                   eternity shall we understand what we owe to the care and
                   interposition of His angels. Celestial beings have taken an ac-
                   tive part in the affairs of men. They have appeared in garments
                   that shone as the lightning; they have come as men, in the garb
                   of wayfarers. They have accepted the hospitalities of human
                   homes; they have acted as guides to benighted travelers. They
                   have thwarted the spoiler's purpose and turned aside the stroke
                   of the destroyer.
                      "Though the rulers of this world know it not, yet often in their
                    councils angels have been spokesmen. Human eyes have
                    looked upon them. Human ears have listened to their appeals. In
                    the council hall and the court of justice, heavenly messengers
                    have pleaded the cause of the persecuted and oppressed. They
                    have defeated purposes and arrested evils that would have
                    brought wrong and suffering to God's children. To the students
                    in the heavenly school, all this will be unfolded.
                       "Every redeemed one will understand the ministry of angels
                    in his own life. The angel who was his guardian from his earliest
                    moment; the angel who watched his steps, and covered his
                    head in the day of peril; the angel who was with him in the valley
                    of the shadow of death, who marked his resting place, who was
                    the first to greet him in the resurrection morning—what will it be
                    to hold converse with him and to learn the history of divine
                    interposition in the individual life, of heavenly co-operation in
                    every work for humanity!"—Education, pp. 304, 305.

                  plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build,
                  and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for
                  as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect
                  shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labour
                  in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the

                      "There will be music there, and song, such music and song
                   as, save in the visions of God, no mortal ear has heard or mind
                   conceived. . . .
                      "There every power will be developed, every capability in-
                   creased. The grandest enterprises will be carried forward, the
                   loftiest aspirations will be reached, the highest ambitions
                   realized. And still, there will arise new heights to surmount, new
                   wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to
                   call forth the powers of body and mind and soul.
                      "All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of
                   God's children. With unutterable delight we shall enter into the
                   joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. We shall share the

                   vainly sacrificed their lives on earth? Physics and biology, food
                   chemistry, statistical inference, ancient history, and linguistics
                   may yield their secrets to minds refreshed by eating the fruit of
                   the tree of life. And the class bell will not interrupt the inquisitive
                   spirit in its search. Time as well as space will take on new
                   dimensions.

Forever Improving        LESSON 14                                     ❑ Friday
                                                                   September 29
          Part 6     What will be the subject of the study of the redeemed
   THE STORY OF    throughout eternity?
    REDEMPTION
                     "I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
                   the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of
                   them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
                   thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that
                   was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
                   strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every
                   creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the
                   earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,
                   heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be
                   unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for
                   ever and ever. And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four
                   and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for
                   ever and ever" (Rev. 5:11-14).

                      The redeemed have learned, by their own painful experience,
                   the evil of sin, its power, its guilt, its woe; and they look upon it
                   with abhorrence. Their perception of the infinite sacrifice by
                   which they have been rescued from sin's awesome grip hum-
                   bles them in their own sight and fills their hearts with gratitude
                   and praise that those who have never fallen cannot appreciate.
                   "They love much because they have been forgiven much. Hav-
                   ing been partakers of Christ's sufferings, they are fitted to be
                   partakers with Him of His glory."—The Great Controversy,
                   p. 650.
                      "In the plan of redemption there are heights and depths that
                   eternity itself can never exhaust, marvels into which the angels
                   desire to look. The redeemed only, of all created beings, have in
                   their own experience known the actual conflict with sin; they
                   have wrought with Christ, and, as even the angels could not do,
                   have entered into the fellowship of His sufferings; will they have
                   no testimony as to the science of redemption—nothing that will
                   be of worth to unfallen beings?
                      "Even now, 'unto the principalities and the powers in the
                   heavenly places' is 'made known through the church the man-
                   ifold wisdom of God.' And He 'hath raised us up together, and
                   made us sit together in heavenly places: . . . that in the ages to
                   come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His
                   kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.' Ephesians 3:10, R.V.;
                   2:6, 7."—Education, p. 308.

                                 good sense. Nicodemus
                                 knew that. But still he
                                 searched for something
                                 more. "Be born again" Jesu
                                 had said. The sight of
                                 Jesus on the cross final-
                                 ized the new birth in
                                 Nicodemus' life. And in ttx
                                 years which followed, he
                                 gave his entire wealth to
                                 establish the young church
                                 And considered it his best
                                 investment ever.

                                 invested his whole life. Ca
