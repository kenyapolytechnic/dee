               THE ADVENTURES OF YOUR
               SABBATH SCHOOL LESSONS
                            Arnold V. Wallenkampf
    In early August of 1975 I was teaching an extension class of the Seventh-day
 Adventist Seminary (Far East) at Seoul, Korea, for the workers in the Korean
 Union. My subject was the Holy Spirit. I had brought my manuscript for this Sab-
  bath School quarterly with me, inasmuch as it contained much material that I
  could use in teaching that course.
    Returning from a country medical clinic with Dr. and Mrs. Robson Newbold and
 some nurses near midnight, I entered my temporary home and stepped right into
 the arms of a man. As we wrestled in the dark entryway, I cried for help. Soon a
 second man came from inside the house. Somehow I got away and ran outside, still
 calling for help, hoping that Dr. Newbold next door would hear and come. But the
 two men got out the front door and ran away.
    Now for the first time I noticed some pain in my left shoulder. Dr. Newbold, finally
 coming to my rescue, put his hand on my shoulder and declared that my left clavicle
 was broken. He took me to the Seoul Adventist Hospital and had my shoulder
 X-rayed. By now the bone was completely broken and its two broken ends were over-
 lapping.
    Before departing for the hospital we had looked through my house to see what
 the "slicky boys," as home burglars are called by the English-speaking people in the
 Orient, had done in the house. In the study they had dumped out the contents of a
 cardboard box and had placed the electric typewriter in it, ready to be carried out.
 I had disrupted their scheme. In their hurry to get away, they took nothing but the
 briefcase that contained my notes on the Holy Spirit. On the way out to the
 clinic, I had also carried my camera and two extra- lenses in my briefcase. But on my
 return I had them in my hand with the briefcase. During the "wrestling match"
in the darkness, the briefcase, camera, and lenses fell to the floor and were kicked to
to the side with my glasses. We now found the camera, lenses, and glasses—
unharmed.
    As I woke up in my hospital bed the next morning, I thought of both my
class that would resume after my surgery and of the Sabbath School quarterly
that I would have to finish within the next few months. The deadline for the latter
was year-end. And now the "slicky boys" had stolen the only copy of my notes for
both the class lectures and the Sabbath School lessons on the subject of the
Holy Spirit. I chose not to worry about it at that time, however, but I reminded
God that I was working for Him and that soon I would need some help.
    The next morning after surgery, a teacher from Korean Union College came and
told me that my briefcase had been found. A man jogging had seen it lying in an alley
a few miles from the college. Being afraid to touch it for fear it might contain a
bomb, he had called the police who opened it. From the class cards the police
learned that it must belong to someone at the college. Not a page of my notes
was missing.
   One of my friends suggested that Satan hated this study on the Holy Spirit and did
not want it taught or published. When the manuscript finally reached the General
Conference Sabbath School Department, nearly all of the wrappings were gone, and
it was held together only by a string. The recipients wondered how it ever
reached its destination in that condition. God still watches over His Word.

ear Sabbath School Members Around The World:


he Far Eastern Division wishes to thank each of you for your support by Sabbath School
fferings each Sabbath. A special thanks is given for the very generous overflow offer-
ngs on past thirteenth Sabbaths. There are many monuments throughout the Far East to
hese overflow offerings. This quarter the Far Eastern Division is to be the recipient
f the Special Projects Offering.

he needs in our field are many. These are not all money needs. We need more workers
3r the harvest that is waiting to be garnered in. One of the greatest needs is for
uildings to use for Sabbath Schools and worship services. Several hundred jungle
hapels and lamb shelters have been built to help fill this need.

he following four projects will benefit from the Thirteenth Sabbath Special Projects
ffering this quarter:

    1. Jungle chapels, lamb shelters and village churches. The land and labor to
uild jungle chapels and lamb shelters are the responsibility of the local members.
he Thirteenth Sabbath Special Projects Offering will furnish the building material.
t a recent meeting with union officers, it was reported that the field currently
eeds 2,200 such buildings.

    2. Training Center, Korea. This center will coordinate the training of workers
n both vocational and lay work. Lay leaders will be used in places where there are
of enough pastors. New buildings are needed for the vocational school and dormitories.

    3. Goshen Adventist Secondary School, church/auditorium. A church auditorium
s greatly needed. Annual camp meetings are held at this school, but have very inAde-
uate facilities.

    4. Calbayog Clinic, Samar, Philippines. This clinic was opened in a place
here the gospel message seemed to make very little impact. It was opened in rented
uarters which now are much too small. A new building is an urgent need.

o make these projects a reality we are inviting Sabbath School members around the
orld to bring a special offering to the Lord for this Thirteenth Sabbath. The gospel
essage going to all the world depends upon the liberality of God's people. We praise
he Lord for His wonderful and generous family.

                          THE HOLY SPIRIT
                                       Introduction

   The Holy Spirit—the Third Person of the Godhead—is often forgotten and ignored
even by Christians. Some Christians frequently speak of the Father and the Son, but
seldom of the Holy Spirit. We pray to the Father in the name of the Son, but seem to
forget that it is the Holy Spirit that intercedes for us with "groanings which cannot be
uttered."
   One additional factor makes it imperative that we study about the Spirit at this time.
Other Christians speak much about the Spirit today. There is a current interest in
charismatics or the spectacular gifts of the Spirit. But talk about, and an alleged
devotion to, the Spirit do not necessarily imply that obedience or homage is rendered
to the Spirit, or that we are really acquainted with Him as He speaks to us through the
Scriptures.
   The study of the Spirit is of highest importance. Our eternal salvation is closely
related to an experimental knowledge or a close personal acquaintance with and
obedience to the biddings of the Spirit.
   The Bible mentions the Holy Spirit more than 300 times—over 100 times in the Old
Testament and over 200 times in the New Testament. It was the Spirit who inspired the
writers of the Scriptures. (See 2 Peter 1:21.) When the Spirit speaks today, He will
therefore of necessity speak in accordance with His own inspired messages given
through the prophets and apostles of the past; anything not in conformity with the
historical revelation, namely the Bible, must therefore obviously emanate from some
other source or some other spirit than God's Spirit.
   These lessons will present the biblical picture of the Spirit. But the emphasis will
not be placed on doctrine per se. It is all too possible for us to count the beads of
systematic theology without ever receiving the breath of life. Because of this we will
here attempt to present the Spirit as God's regenerating agent who alone can breathe
upon us the vivifying breath of God. It is this kind of experience that prevents us from
suffocating under the presentation of dogmatic truth. This revival experience is
especially important for the church today, since "the dispensation in which we are
now living is to be, to those that ask, the dispensation of the Holy Spirit."—
Testimonies to Ministers, p. 511.
   Therefore, the ultimate purpose of this quarter's study is to bring every student into
a right relationship to the Holy Spirit in order that He may be a mighty vivifying power
 in our lives.
   Please note also that it is only through the Spirit that we can hold personal
 communion with God. As the divine revelation, the Bible, was given through the
 Spirit, so it can only be understood through the personal illumination of the Spirit.
   As a people, Seventh-day Adventists should be most interested in studying about
 and becoming personally acquainted with the Spirit. We do not believe only in
 Christ's death for our sins, but also in His ongoing intercession for us in the heavenly
 sanctuary; and only the Spirit can apply the results of that intercession to our lives in
 anticipation of Christ's return in glory.
    The Spirit is God's means of reaching men in sin. His workings or movements are as
 unchartable as the path of the wind. But in mysterious ways He touches men, even
 those steeped in sin like the persecutor Saul on the Damascus road. In the same way
 that Saul the persecutor became Paul the committed apostle, many other dramatic
 changes have been witnessed in the lives of the vilest of sinners. For instance, the
 prevaricating, swindling, and profligate divinity student George Muller became a
 great man of faith, the noted orphanage operator of Bristol fame.
    There is hope of salvation for even the worst sinner as long as he does not steel his
 heart against the Spirit's pleadings. Certainly this same Holy Spirit can bring new life
 and power into the Adventist Church du ring'this quarter as we open our hearts to His
 influence.

                   "All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
                 to every man severally as he will" (1 Cor. 12:11).

                       (Compare Isa. 40:13.)

                       Corporeality, or a physically alive body, does not necessarily
                     constitute a person. An individual whose brain has ceased to
                     function is still a body, but he is no longer a person. The essence
                     of a personality is mind with knowledge and will. The references
                     above indicate that the Holy Spirit is a person. He has a mind
                     capable of both knowledge and volition.
                       The Spirit is thus not to be used by us according to our wills;
                     but, rather, He is to take possession of us and use us as He wills.
                     Instead of thinking of Him as a divine power that we should try to
                     get hold of or use, we must recognize that He is a divine person
                     who desires to direct us and use us according to His will.
                       In speaking to the students at Avondale College in 1899 Ellen
                     G. White emphasized the personhood of the Spirit as she said:
                     "We need to realize that the Holy Spirit, who is as much a person
                     as God is a person, is walking through these grounds."—
                     Evangelism, p. 616.

                       How is the personality of the Spirit emphasized in both the
                     Old and the New Testament? isa. 63:10, RSV; Eph. 4:30.

                       In these two texts the Spirit is presented as grieving or feeling
                     sorry. Grief is a love word. Only a person who loves can be
                     grieved. An influence cannot be grieved. But the Holy Spirit can.


THINK IT THROUGH       How do I conceive of the Spirit? Do I relate to Him as a
                     person who is interested in me?

                       "The Holy Spirit has a personality, else He could not bear
                     witness to our spirits and with our spirits that we are the chil-
                     dren of God. He must also be a divine person, else He could not
                     search out the secrets which lie hidden in the mind of God. 'For
                     what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
                     which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but
                     the Spirit of God.' "—Evangelism, p. 617.

The Personality and Divinity
of the Holy Spirit LESSON 1                                           ❑ Monday
                                                                       October 2
          Part 2     "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
    EVIDENCES OF not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Itself
     THE SPIRIT'S maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
    PERSONALITY uttered" (Rom. 8:26).
                     The Spirit intercedes for us because He loves us. Only a
                  person can love, and the Spirit does love us just as much as do
                  the Father and the Son. We owe our salvation to the Spirit as
                  well as to the Father and the Son. Because of the love of the
                  Spirit, and His willingness to come down here and work out in
                  us the salvation wrought for us potentially by Jesus on the
                  cross, we can become a new creation.
                     What evidences of personality does Nehemiah attribute to
                  the Spirit? Neh. 9:20, 30.
                     In these Old Testament passages both goodness and intelli-
                  gence are ascribed to the Spirit as a person.
                     How did Jesus refer to the Spirit? John 15:26; 16:13, 14.
                     Although the word "Spirit" is a neuter noun in the Greek, the
                  Gospel writers refer to Him by using the masculine pronoun
                  ekeinos—"he." The Spirit refers to Himself by using the pro-
                  noun for the first person in Acts 13:2—"me." Thus it is appro-
                  priate to use "he" when speaking of the Spirit. The neuter
                   gender for the Spirit, both in the original Greek and in English,
                   has undoubtedly contributed to the popular use of "it" as have
                   the symbols or emblems used in the Bible to present His nature
                   and operations—fire, wind, oil, seal, and others.
                      Since the Spirit loves us in the same way as do the Father
                    and the Son, what does He do jointly with Them? Rev. 22:17.
                      The triune Godhead is united in the plan of salvation. All three
                    extend the call to salvation to you and me. This demonstrates
                    both the deity and the equality of all three.
                      "The Godhead was stirred with pity for the race, and the
                    Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit gave Themselves to the
                    working out of the plan of redemption."—Counsels on Health,
                    p. 222.
 THINK IT THROUGH     Since the Spirit is one of the Persons of the Godhead, have
                    you ever considered thanking Him for His great love for you?
                    We pray to the Father in the Son's name. How is the Holy Spirit
                    related to our prayers?
                      "The Holy Spirit is not a mere spirit—a creature, for example,
                    or something apart from God and yet given to man by Him, or
                    merely the work of God which He perfoms in our hearts—but
                    that He is a Spirit who Himself is God in essence."—Luther's
                    sermon on John 15:26-27 in Luther's Works (Saint Louis, Mo.:

The Personality and Divinity
of the Holy Spirit LESSON 1                                              ❑ Tuesday
                                                                           October 3
         Part 3    "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
   THE SPIRIT OF And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
 GOD AT CREATION upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
                 the face of the waters" (Gen. 1:1, 2).

                       The Bible was written for man in sin—not for unfallen angels
                     or the inhabitants of other worlds. But even before the entrance
                     of sin into this world the Spirit is introduced as the active agent
                     in Creation.
                       All the Three Persons in the Trinity were united in the work of
                     Creation. What the members of the Godhead do, They do to-
                     gether as a unit, although Their particular activities or tasks may
                     be different.

                      What did God design as the earthly dwelling place of the
                     Spirit even before the entrance of sin? 1 Cor. 6:19.

                        "Nor, indeed, does Scripture in speaking of Him [the Spirit]
                     refrain from the designation 'God.' For Paul concludes that we
                     are the temple of God from the fact that his Spirit dwells in us....
                     The apostle himself sometimes writes that 'we are God's tem-
                     ple,' at other times in the same sense, 'the temple of the Holy
                     Spirit."—John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, I,
                     13:15 (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1960), pp. 131, 132.

                        "From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every created
                     being, from the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a
                     temple for the indwelling of the Creator. Because of sin, human-
                     ity ceased to be a temple for God. Darkened and defiled by evil,
                     the heart of man no longer revealed the glory of the Divine One.
                     But by the incarnation of the Son of God, the purpose of Heaven
                     is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity, and through saving grace
                     the heart of man becomes again His temple. God designed that
                     the temple at Jerusalem should be a continual witness to the
                     high destiny open to every soul. But the Jews had not under-
                     stood the significance of the building they regarded with so
                     much pride. They did not yield themselves as holy temples for
                     the Divine Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, p. 161.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I personally respond to the Spirit's desire to dwell
                     In my life during this dispensation of sin?

                        "Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His
                     guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God awaits
                     their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed
                     by faith, brings all other blessings in its train."—My Life Today,

The Personality and Divinity
of the Holy Spirit LESSON 1                                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 4
         Part 4   "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them In
           THE the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"
     TRIUNE GOD (Matt. 28:19).

                     Upon baptism the believer symbolically enters into, or be-
                   comes a member of, the heavenly family. The believer not only
                   becomes a son or daughter of God but a brother or sister of
                   Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit becomes a constant compan-
                   ion and guide. These three have adopted the believer as Their
                   own and will do everything Omnipotence can do to guide and
                   assist in the Christian walk.
                     "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the three holy
                   dignitaries of heaven, have declared that they will strengthen
                   men to overcome the powers of darkness. All the facilities of
                   heaven are pledged to those who by their baptismal vows have
                   entered into a covenant with God."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                   SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1110.

                     What persons of the Godhead are named In the apostolic
                   benediction? 2 Cor. 13:14.

                     "Together with Matt. 28:19 this verse provides the most com-
                   plete and explicit summary of the doctrine of the Trinity."—SDA
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 928.
                     Christians have often been, and still are, accused by both
                   Jews and Muslims of being polytheists, or worshipers of more
                   than one God. As Christians we admit there are three persons in
                   the Godhead, but "They are one in purpose, in mind, in charac-
                   ter, but not in person."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 422. The
                   Christian religion is not a belief in tritheism—belief in three
                   separate gods—but belief in one God—a trinity.

                     How is God presented by Moses in Deuteronomy 6:4?

                     "Our God" in the text could justly be translated "our Gods."
                   Even with their intense monotheism the Jews still used a plural
                   name for God. Rather than attribute this usage to "the pluralis
                   majestatis," or the plural of majesty, Moses used the plural
                   name for God, because there is a plurality of persons in the
                   Godhead—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. (See Gen.
                   1:26.)

THINK IT THROUGH     Is there a danger in attempting to explain scientifically or
                   theoretically the position and work of the Holy Spirit In the
                   Godhead? If so, what Is it?

                     "The worldly-wise have attempted to explain upon scientific
                   principles the influence of the Spirit of God upon the heart. The
                   least advance in this direction will lead the soul into the mazes
                   of skepticism."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 585.

The Personality and Divinity
of the Holy Spirit LESSON 1                                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                       October 5
             Part 5    "Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
          THE SPIRIT to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the
            AS GOD land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it
                     was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hest thou con-
                     ceived this thing in thine heart? thou hest not lied unto men,
                     but unto God" (Acts 5:3, 4).

                        In these two verses the Holy Ghost and God are used inter-
                      changeably. "This suggests the unity that exists between the
                      Spirit and the Father."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 177.

                        When the apostle Paul speaks about spiritual gifts, whom
                      does he say is dispensing these divine gifts? 1 Cor. 12:4-11,
                      28.

                        First Corinthians 12, as well as chapters 13 and 14, speaks of
                      divine gifts or heavenly endowments made to members of the
                      church. Interestingly enough, this discussion by the apostle
                      Paul uses the same interchange that Peter made in speaking to
                      Ananias and Sapphira. The Spirit in First Corinthians 12:4-11,
                      and Lord and God, in verses 5, 6 and 28, are used interchange-
                      ably.

                        What did Jesus call the representative He was going to send
                      to His followers after His ascension? John 14:16.

                         Here Jesus addresses His Father as an equal and petitions a
                      gift for His followers. For "another" here the Greek employs the
                      word altos. It actually means another of the same kind, in con-
                      tradistinction to heteros which means another of "another
                      kind." Jesus intended to send someone to the disciples, and
                      succeeding generations of His followers, who is like Himself—
                      divine. Previously Jesus had related Himself to His Father. Now
                      He relates Himself to the Spirit. Consequently They are all
                      alike—divine.

                       Notice how the Spirit and God are closely related in First
                      Corinthians 3:16; 6:19; 12:4-6.

THINK IT THROUGH        How do we explain that the Three Persons in the Godhead
                      are essentially alike In power, but with different positions in
                      the plan of salvation?

                        "There are three living persons of the heavenly trio; in the
                     name of these three great powers—the Father, the Son, and the
                     Holy Spirit—those who receive Christ by living faith are bap-
                     tized, and these powers will co-operate with the obedient sub-
                     jects of heaven in their efforts to live the new life in Christ."—

The Personality and Divinity
of the Holy Spirit LESSON 1                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                       October 6
         Part 6    "There Is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called In
     THE DIVINE one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one
    AMBASSADOR God and Father of all, who Is above all, and through all, and In
                 you all" (Eph. 4:4-6).

                     The different members in the human body do not perform the
                   same function. If they did, they would not compose or constitute
                   a body. So the Three Persons in the Godhead do not perform
                   identical work in relation to either this earth or the universe. In
                   an organization different members perform different functions.
                   The same is true of the Godhead. Consequently, specific tasks
                   devolve on each divine person in the heavenly economy. Their
                   particular functions do not subordinate one to the other, except
                   by Their choice to function in that particular way. One is not
                   intrinsically greater or higher than another, any more than the
                   president of a country or an organization is greater than another
                   citizen of the nation or another member of the organization,
                   except that after his election he fills that position by the choice
                   of the others. He is the first among equals. In this way the Three
                   Persons in the Godhead relate to people in different ways, for
                   example, Source, Mediator, and Communicator.

                     In the divine economy, what was, and is the Spirit's specific
                   function in representing the Godhead In a world of sin? Gen.
                   6:3; John 16:8-11.

                      After man's step into disobedience and fall into sin, it became
                   the work of the Third Person of the Godhead to contact man, to
                   try to find a dwelling place within him and bring him back into
                   willing obedience to God. Man, having become subject to his
                   passions rather than obedient to God, was to be the subject of
                   the Spirit's work. As man responds, the Holy Spirit dwells within
                   him and guides him back to his Creator.

                     How does the apostle Peter refer to the striving of the Spirit
                   with the antediluvians? 1 Peter 3:18-20.

                      The same Spirit that quickened or raised Jesus from the dead
                   worked on the hearts and minds of the antediluvians through
                   the preaching of Noah. Nearly all of them were captives in the
                   prison house of sin (see Isa. 42:7; Luke 4:18; 2 Tim. 2:26), and
                   the Spirit did all that God could to make them willing to be set
                   free. Jesus was to come and die for them for this purpose, and
                   the provision yet to be made at Calvary was available through
                   the ministry of the Holy Spirit to the antediluvians.

                     know who was the Messiah, and now as Jesus went up out of the
                     water, the promised sign was given; for he saw the heavens
                     opened, and the Spirit of God, like a dove of burnished gold,
                     hovered over the head of Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                     SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1078.
                       The dove as an emblem of the Spirit denotes His purity.
                     Matthew 10:16 speaks of Christ's followers who ought to be
                     harmless or, still better translated, "unmixed" or "pure" as
                     doves. As the dove descended from heaven, so purity can be
                     imparted to man only from heaven. The dove is further a symbol
                     of peace. It is not a scavenger, as a vulture or a raven; nor is it a
                     bird of prey. It is a gentle bird. It aptly symbolizes the beauty,
                     gentleness, peace, and heavenly origin of the Spirit as He im-
                     parts peace of heart and soul to Christ's followers.

                       What office do the following texts inform us the Spirit fills In
                     relation to men?" John 14:16, 17, 26; 15:26; 16:7.

                       Often the dove has been used as a messenger. The Spirit is
                     God's messenger to men, or God's ambassador to mankind,
                     sent in the name of Christ to be our Comforter. As such He
                     especially communicates peace and joy to the saints (see Rom.
                     14:17) and edifies the church (Acts 9:31).

                        What is the Spirit descriptively called in the book of Revela-
                     tion? Rev. 5:6 (Compare 1 Peter 1:11.)

                        "The number 7 indicates completeness, and is symbolic."—
                     The Acts of the Apostles, p. 585. As the eye of God the ministry of
                     the Spirit is complete and perfect, possessing insight, foresight,
                     and hindsight. God occasionally grants this gift to His servants
                     who are imbued with His Spirit. Elisha and Peter obviously had
                     hindsight (see 2 Kings 5:20-27; Acts 5:1-4). Paul through the
                     Spirit was given foresight of the "bonds and afflictions" that
                     would befall him in Jerusalem. (See Acts 20:23.) Our perceptiv-
                     ity will be enhanced through the imbuement of the Spirit.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I avail myself of the spiritual insight that may be
                     mine through the guidance of the Spirit?

The Holy Spirit Symbolized in Scripture                 LESSON 2          ❑ Monday
                                                                          October 9
          Part 2   "On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up
          WATER and proclaimed, 'If any one thirst, let him come to me and
                 drink. He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, "Out of
                 his heart shall flow rivers of living water."' Now this he said
                 about the Spirit" (John 7:37-39, RSV).

                       Jesus here likens the Spirit to water. Water is essential to life.
                    There can be no life without water. So there can be no spiritual
                    life without the presence of the Spirit.
                       "The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth, and it
                    appeals to us with even greater power than to those who heard it
                    in the temple on that last day of the feast. The fountain is open
                    for all. The weary and exhausted ones are offered the refreshing
                    draught of eternal life. Jesus is still crying, 'If any man thirst, let
                    him come unto Me, and drink.' Let him that is athirst come. And
                    whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.' "—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 454.

                      How does the prophet Isaiah compare water with the Spirit?
                    Isa. 44:3, 4.

                      The second part of verse 3 explains what the first part actually
                    means. Verse 4 indicates that as there will be growth as a result
                    of pouring out water upon parched land, so there will be
                    spiritual growth as a result of the outpouring of God's Spirit.
                    And growth alone is positive evidence of life. As parched land is
                    clothed with verdant growth through water, so the Spirit can
                    transform a barren soul into a person of Christian beauty. "The
                    Spirit of God through faith produces a new life in the soul."—
                    The Desire of Ages, p. 176.

                     How did Jesus make it plain that the Spirit, as symbolized by
                    water, satisfies seeking souls? John 4:13, 14.

                      "The water that Christ referred to was the revelation of His
                    grace in His word; His Spirit, His teaching, is as a satisfying
                    fountain to every soul."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 390.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I personally drink of the satisfying water of life?

                      "He who seeks to quench his thirst at the fountains of this
                    world will drink only to thirst again. Everywhere men are un-
                    satisfied. They long for something to supply the need of the
                    soul. Only One can meet that want. The need of the world, 'The
                    Desire of all nations,' is Christ. The divine grace which He alone
                    can impart, is as living water, purifying, refreshing, and in-
                    vigorating the soul."—The Desire of Ages, p. 187.

                                                              October 10
          Part 3    "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
         OIL AND virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the
        UNCTION bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
                 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
                 them: but the wise took oil In their vessels with their lamps"
                 (Matt. 25:1-4).

                      Oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. (See Christ's Object Lessons,
                   p. 407.) As lamps in the time of Christ did not give light without
                   oil, so a Christian cannot bring light to the world, as he is
                   commissioned to (see Matt. 5:14-16), without the Spirit in his
                   life. The wise virgins in the parable "had received the grace of
                   God, the regenerating, enlightening power of the Holy Spirit,
                   which renders His word a lamp to the feet and a light to the path.
                   In the fear of God they had studied the Scriptures to learn the
                   truth, and had earnestly sought for purity of heart and life."—
                   The Great Controversy, p. 394.

                     In what terms Is the light-giving power of the Holy Spirit
                   described In Zechariah? Zech. 4:1-6.

                     The lamps or the lampstands (the candlesticks) represent the
                   church or Christ's followers. (See Rev. 1:20.) "From the holy
                   ones that stand in God's presence His Spirit is imparted to the
                   human instrumentalities who are consecrated to His
                   service."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 408.
                     It is only through the anointing and "the renewing power of
                   the Holy Spirit upon the heart" (The Great Controversy, p. 256)
                   that you and I may develop the right attitude toward divine light
                   and truth.

THINK IT THROUGH     What happens concerning those around me when I become
                   a recipient of the Spirit?

                      "God's people are to be channels for the outworking of the
                   highest influence in the universe. In Zechariah's vision the two
                   olive trees which stand before God are represented as emptying
                   the golden oil out of themselves through golden tubes into the
                   bowl of the sanctuary. From this the lamps of the sanctuary are
                   fed, that they may give a continuous bright and shining light. So
                   from the anointed ones that stand in God's presence the full-
                   ness of divine light and love and power is imparted to His
                   people, that they may impart to others light and joy and refresh-
                   ing. They are to become channels through which divine in-
                   strumentalities communicate to the world the tide of God's

                                                                 October 11
          Part 4      "He has put his seal upon us and given us his Spirit in our
       SEAL AND     hearts as a guarantee" (2 Cor. 1:22, RSV).
      GUARANTEE
                       When a person by faith accepts Christ, he is immediately
                    sealed by God as His son or daughter. This "stamp of owner-
                    ship" is attested by the gift of the Holy Spirit.
                       "Paul here uses the figure of earnest [guarantee] money to
                    illustrate the gift of the Holy Spirit to believers, as a first install-
                    ment, an assurance of their full inheritance in the hereafter (see
                    Eph. 1:13, 14; cf. Rom. 8:16). It is the Christian's privilege to
                    receive the settled conviction of acceptance with God as His
                    adopted child at conversion and to retain it throughout life."—
                    SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 833.
                       The only being who can break the seal is the believer himself.
                    If he chooses no longer to be God's man or be controlled by
                    God, God will release him. This is in accordance with the free
                    moral choice God has granted to every intelligent being.

                      How does the believer receive the Spirit as the guarantee
                    [earnest] of the inheritance? Eph. 1:12-14.

                       The main idea in a guarantee [earnest] is a pledge. The gift of
                    the Spirit to the believer is the pledged guarantee to the believer
                    on the part of God that He will ultimately bring him the full gift of
                    salvation by taking him out of this world of sin and give him an
                    inheritance in His eternal kingdom. Even in human affairs the
                    earnest money or down payment is the purchaser's pledge that
                    he will go through with a particular transaction. The Spirit is
                    God's down payment on His promised salvation. As the rainbow
                    to Noah was God's guarantee that there would not be another
                    flood, so the. Spirit in the life of the believer is the believer's
                    constant reminder of ultimate salvation despite the typhoons of
                    trial along the way. (See Eph. 4:30.)

 THINK IT THROUGH     Am I willing to remain sealed by God with the Spirit, when I
                    realize that the seal of the Spirit involves God's ownership and
                    control over my entire life?

                       "There are quicksands upon which many are in danger of
                    being swamped. It is always safe to seek for the earnest of the
                    Spirit of God, if we do not mingle with it a force and presumption
                    that is not heaven born.... There is danger of running ahead of
                    Christ. We should honor the Holy Spirit by following where it
                    shall lead. 'Lean not unto thine own understanding' (Prov.
                    3:5)."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, pp. 59, 60.
                       A justified person's "understanding is under the control of
                    the Holy Spirit, and his character is molded after the divine

       LIGHT AND    cometh into the world" (John 1:9).
             FIRE
                       Through His Spirit Jesus reaches everywhere and "lighteth
                    every man that cometh into the world."
                       "Wherever there is an impulse of love and sympathy, wher-
                    ever the heart reaches out to bless and uplift others, there is
                    revealed the working of God's Holy Spirit. In the depths of
                    heathenism, men who have had no knowledge of the written law
                    of God, who have never even heard the name of Christ, have
                    been kind to His servants, protecting them at the risk of their
                    own lives. Their acts show the working of a divine power. The
                    Holy Spirit has implanted the grace of Christ in the heart of the
                    savage, quickening his sympathies contrary to his nature, con-
                    trary to his education. The 'Light which lighteth every man that

                    light, if heeded, will guide his feet to the kingdom of God."—

                       With what did John the Baptist say Jesus would baptize His
                    followers? Matt. 3:11.

                      Fire had a significant meaning to people familiar with Old
                    Testament traditions, for it denoted the presence of God (see
                    Ex. 3:2); it also represented the protection and leading provi-
                    dence of God (see Ex. 13:21); the approval of God (see Lev.
                    9:24); and the cleansing and sanctifying power of God (see Isa.
                    6:6, 7).

                      "The prophet Isaiah had declared that the Lord would cleanse
                    His people from their iniquities 'by the spirit of judgment, and by
                    the spirit of burning.' The word of the Lord to Israel was, 'I will
                    turn My hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and
                    take away all thy tin.' Isa. 4:4; 1:25. To sin, wherever found, 'our
                    God is a consuming fire.' Heb. 12:29. In all who submit to His
                    power the Spirit of God will consume sin. But if men cling to sin,
                    they become identified with it. Then the glory of God, which
                    destroys sin, must destroy them."—The Desire of Ages, p. 107.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I allow the Spirit to work in me so that I may live in
                    the presence of God, who Is a consuming fire? (See Heb.

The Holy Spirit Symbolized in Scripture              LESSON 2          ❑ Friday
                                                                      October 13

          Part 6  "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the
           WIND sound thereof, but canst not tell whence It cometh, and
                whither It goeth: so is every one that Is born of the Spirit"
                (John 3:8).

                      The wind is not visible; we do not know from where it comes
                   or where it goes. But although invisible, its effects are plainly
                   seen. Jesus likened the Spirit to the wind. He cannot be seen, yet
                   the effects He brings about in changed human lives are plainly
                   evident. But the Spirit Himself is a mystery. Of the three persons
                   in the Godhead, He is the most unfamiliar to man. Jesus came to
                   reveal or make known the Father (see John 1:18), and man saw
                   Jesus in human form. But no one has ever seen the Spirit nor
                   has anyone revealed Him to us.
                       "Christ uses the wind as a symbol of the Spirit of God. As the
                   wind bloweth whither it listeth, and we cannot tell whence it
                   cometh or whither it goeth, so it is with the Spirit of God. We do
                   not know through whom it will be manifested."—Selected Mes-
                   sages, bk. 2, p. 15.
                       The Spirit is sovereign. Man is not permitted to control the
                   Spirit, any more than man can control the wind. The wind blows
                    where it pleases. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 672.)
                       Jesus said to Nicodemus that man must be born from above.
                    (See DA 168.) The wind, too, is from the heavens above and
                    blows on the earth. And the wind is powerful. Anyone who has
                    experienced a tornado, a hurricane, or a typhoon knows the
                    dreadful force or power of the wind. The Spirit's work in regen-
                    eration is also a powerful rebuilding or regenerating force.
                       "Like the wind, which is invisible, yet the effects of which are
                    plainly seen and felt, is the Spirit of God in its work upon the
                    human heart. That regenerating power, which no human eye
                    can see, begets a new life in the soul; it creates a new being in
                    the image of God. While the work of the Spirit is silent and
                    imperceptible, its effects are manifest. If the heart has been
                    renewed by the Spirit of God, the life will bear witness to the
                    fact. While we cannot do anything to change our hearts or to
                    bring ourselves into harmony with God; while we must not trust
                    at all to ourselves or our good works, our lives will reveal
                     whether the grace of God is dwelling within us. A change will be
                     seen in the character, the habits, the pursuits. The contrast will
                     be clear and decided between what they have been and what
                     they are."—Steps to Christ, p. 57.

     DEVELOPMENT of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
        THROUGH which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost" (Matt. 1:20).
       THE SPIRIT
                     The Spirit—the agency through which God's power is
                   exercised—overshadowed Mary, and she conceived. We can-
                   not explain how this took place. Rather we choose to accept
                   God's statement about it as given through the physician-
                   evangelist Luke. (See Luke 1:35.)

                      Having been born through the Spirit, how did Jesus grow
                    and develop during His childhood? Luke 2:40.

                      How does Luke describe His adolescent development?
                    Luke 2:52.

                       "In the sunlight of His Father's countenance, Jesus 'in-
                    creased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.'
                    Luke 2:52. His mind was active and penetrating, with a thought-
                    fulness and wisdom beyond His years. Yet His character was
                    beautiful in its symmetry. The powers of mind and body de-
                    veloped gradually, in keeping with the laws of childhood.
                       "As a child, Jesus manifested a peculiar loveliness of disposi-
                    tion. His willing hands were ever ready to serve others. He
                    manifested a patience that nothing could disturb, and a truth-
                    fulness that would never sacrifice integrity. In principle firm as a
                    rock, His life revealed the grace of unselfish courtesy."—The

THINK IT THROUGH      Once we have been born of the Spirit, can He prompt our
                    thoughts and actions as He did in the case of Jesus?

                      "Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did. As we try to
                   become acquainted with our heavenly Father through His word,
                   angels will draw near, our minds will be strengthened, our
                   characters will be elevated and refined. We shall become more
                   like our Saviour. And as we behold the beautiful and grand in
                   nature, our affections go out after God. While the spirit is awed,
                   the soul is invigorated by coming in contact with the Infinite
                   through His works. Communion with God through prayer de-

        ANOINTED wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might,
          BY THE the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord" (isa. 11:2).
          SPIRIT
                    This verse indicates that Jesus, the Branch, was to be filled
                  with the Spirit throughout His life. Such infilling was the result
                  of Jesus' daily prayer and choice to submit to His Father's will.
                  "As a man He supplicated the throne of God, till His humanity
                  was charged with a heavenly current that connected humanity
                  with divinity."—Education, pp. 80, 81.

                      According to the Gospels, how was Isaiah's prophecy
                    further fulfilled? Luke 3:21, 22; Matt. 3:16, 17.

                      The time of baptism was a moment of further decision for
                    Jesus. He then decided the time had come for Him to enter upon
                    His special work and mission in conformity with the purpose of
                    His incarnation.
                      "Direct from the throne issue the beams of His glory. The
                    heavens are opened, and upon the Saviour's head descends a
                    dovelike form of purest light,—fit emblem of Him, the meek and
                    lowly One. . . .
                      " ... The Holy Spirit rested upon him [John the Baptist], and
                    with outstretched hand pointing to Jesus, he cried, 'Behold the
                    Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.' "—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 112.

                       Where did the Spirit lead Him immediately after His bap-
                    tism? Luke 4:1; compare Matt. 4:1.
                      Occasionally we may be prone to think that it was not the Holy
                    Spirit, but some other spirit that prompted Jesus to go into the
                    wilderness after His baptism. But Jesus heeded the promptings
                    of no spirit but the Holy Spirit. After His baptism Jesus felt the
                    need to be alone with His Father, and one reason the Spirit led
                    Him into the wilderness was so that He might enjoy this intimate
                    fellowship and gain directions for His life before He entered
                    upon His public ministry. (See DA 114.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Can I expect the Holy Spirit to guide in my life as He did In
                    Jesus'? If so, what must I do in order to allow Him to do so?

                      "His [Jesus'] hours of happiness were found when alone with
                    nature and with God. Whenever it was His privilege, He turned
                    aside from the scene of His labor, to go into the fields, to
                    meditate in the green valleys, to hold communion with God on
                    the mountainside or amid the trees of the forest. The early
                    morning often found Him in some secluded place, meditating,
                    searching the Scriptures, or in prayer."—The Desire of Ages,

           Part 3    "For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for
       GUIDED BY    God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him" (John 3:34).
       THE SPIRIT
                      Today's English Version lucidly renders this verse as follows:
                    "The one whom God has sent speaks God's words, because
                    God gives him the fullness of his Spirit."
                      "The Father gave His Spirit without measure to His Son, and
                    we also may partake of its fullness."—The Great Controversy, p.
                    477. Jesus was sealed by the Spirit as implied in John 6:27. The
                    Spirit-sealing was a sign that He was wholly committed to His
                    Father's will and way of life.

                      What was the source of the instruction Jesus gave? Acts 1:2.
                      Jesus did not speak His own words. (See John 14:10.) His
                    thoughts, as well as the words He spoke, were the thoughts and
                    the words of His Father indited by the Spirit.
                      "Not even by a thought did he yield to temptation."—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 123.
                      "Had there been one deviation from the divine mind in the
                    work of Christ, the plan of redemption would have proved a
                    failure."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, February 15,
                    1898.

                      What was Jesus' main objective during His life on earth?
                    John 4:34; 6:38; 8:29.

                       "Jesus did not try to find a name or title describing himself
                    and the work he had to do; he simply followed the will of God as
                    it was revealed to him."—The Interpreter's Bible (Nashville,
                    Tenn.: Abingdon Press, 1951), vol. 7, p. 267. It was through His
                    continuous obedience to the guidance of the Spirit that Jesus
                    was always able to please His Father.

THINK IT THROUGH      Am I willing to choose constantly to submit my thoughts and
                    my choices to the will of God? Or is my refusal to do this the
                    probable reason for my restless, troubled state of mind?

                       "Jesus stood, with reference to His human nature, during all
                    the days of His humiliation, under the constant and penetrating
                    operation of the Holy Spirit. The Son, who lacked nothing, but
                    as God in union with the Father and the Holy Spirit possessed all
                    things, compassionately adopted our human nature. . Altho
                    He was the Son, He did not take its preparation, enriching, and
                    operation into His own hand, but was willing to receive them
                    from the hand of the Holy Spirit."—Abraham Kuyper, The Work

Jesus and the Holy Spirit        LESSON 3                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      October 18
         Part 4    "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my
     SUSTAINED soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring
   BY THE SPIRIT forth judgment to the Gentiles."
                   "He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set Judg-
                 ment in the earth: and the Isles shall wait for his law" (Isa.
                 42:1, 4).

                     "My servant" in this passage applies specifically to Jesus.
                   Many expressions in this chapter of Isaiah can apply to no one
                   else. Jesus conclusively made this application by applying this
                   passage to Himself in Matthew 12:14-21.
                     The prophetic prediction foretells that the Spirit would up-
                   hold Jesus. Thus, "He shall not fail nor be discouraged." '

                     How was the promise of Isaiah 59:19 (second part), about
                   the Spirit of the Lord lifting up a standard against Satan,
                   fulfilled in the experience of Jesus? Matt. 4:4, 7, 10.

                     When Satan presented his inducements to Jesus during His
                   wilderness temptation, this promise was fulfilled in His experi-
                   ence. "He was fitted for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy
                   Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, p. 123. The words in Deuteronomy
                   8:3; 6:16 and '13 were brought to His mind in accordance with
                   His own promise to His disciples in John 14:26 (second part).
                     "Jesus met Satan with the words of Scripture. 'It is written,'
                   He said. In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was the
                   word of God. Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a sign of
                   His divinity. But that which is greater than all miracles, a firm
                   reliance upon a 'Thus saith the Lord,' was a sign that could not
                   be controverted. So long as Christ held to this position, the
                   tempter could gain no advantage."—The Desire of Ages, p.120.

THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do in order to be willing to follow the promptings
                   that the Spirit places in my mind in moments of temptation and
                   discouragement?

                      "Whenever one is encompassed with clouds, perplexed by
                   circumstances, or afflicted by poverty or distress, Satan is at
                   hand to tempt and annoy.... Often the tempter comes to us as
                   he came to Christ, arraying before us our weakness and infir-
                   mities. He hopes to discourage the soul, and to break our hold
                   on God. Then he is sure of his prey. If we would meet him as
                   Jesus did, we should escape many a defeat. By parleying with
                   the enemy, we give him an advantage."—The Desire of Ages,

Jesus and the Holy Spirit            LESSON 3                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                         October 19

              Part 5    "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
     SPIRIT-DIRECTED anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me
            ACTIVITY to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the cap-
                     tives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them
                     that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord"
                     (Luke 4:18, 19).

                         The indwelling Spirit not only brings joy to the heart of the
                       believer but prompts him to do something to bring joy to others.
                       In His life Jesus demonstrated the same concern and work that
                       will characterize the Spirit-filled person. He preached the gos-
                       pel to the poor demoniacs (Mark 5:1-16); He forgave fallen Mary
                       Magdalene (see John 8:1-11; Luke 7:36-48; DA 169) and deliv-
                       ered her from captivity to sin; He restored sight to the physically
                       blind (see Mark 10:46-52), as well as to the spiritually blind; He
                       set at liberty them that were bruised and proclaimed the accept-
                       able year of the Lord.
                         The Pharisees asserted that Jesus cast out devils through the
                       power of Beelzebub. But He made it clear that He performed His
                       miracles through the power of the Spirit. (See Matt. 12:28.)
                       Jesus was dependent on the power of the Spirit to perform His
                       miracles during His earthly ministry.

                         How did Jesus set at liberty a person who was bruised by
                       sin? John 8:2-11.

                          "The woman had stood before Jesus, cowering with fear. His
                       words, 'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
                       stone,' had come to her as a death sentence. She dared not lift
                       her eyes to the Saviour's face, but silently awaited her doom. In
                       astonishment she saw her accusers depart speechless and con-
                       founded; then those words of hope fell upon her ear, 'Neither do
                       I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.' Her heart was melted, and
                       she cast herself at the feet of Jesus, sobbing out her grateful
                       love, and with bitter tears confessing her sins."—The Desire of
                       Ages, p. 462.

                         What part did the Spirit play in Christ's offering Himself as a
                       ransom for our sins? Heb. 9:14.

                        How did Peter sum up the Spirit-inspired ministry of Jesus?
                       Acts 10:38.


THINK IT THROUGH         If I have received the Spirit, and been Imbued with His

    RESURRECTED unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
       THROUGH flesh, but quickened by the Spirit" (1 Peter 3:18).
      THE SPIRIT  (See also Rom. 8:11; 1:4.)

                     God is one, but triune. The Three Persons of the Trinity work
                   together. They are intimately united in Their work. Thus, al-
                   though this text says that Jesus was raised from the dead by the
                   Spirit, the other two persons of the Deity united in resurrecting
                   Jesus.

                    Who does the apostle Paul say raised Jesus from the dead?
                   Gal. 1:1; Eph. 1:17-20.

                     "The earth trembles at his [the angel's] approach, the hosts of
                   darkness flee, and as he rolls away the stone, heaven seems to
                   come down to earth. The soldiers see him removing the stone as
                   he would a pebble, and hear him cry, Son of God, come forth;
                   Thy Father calls Thee."—The Desire of Ages, p. 780.

                     What did Jesus Himself say about His resurrection? John
                   10:17, 18.

                      "Over the rent sepulcher of Joseph Christ had proclaimed in
                   triumph, 'I am the resurrection, and the life.' These words could
                   be spoken only by the Deity. All created beings live by the will
                   and power of God. They are dependent recipients of the life of
                   God. From the highest seraph to the humblest animate being,
                   all are replenished from the Source of life. Only He who is one
                   with God could say, I have power to lay down My life, and I have
                   power to take it again. In His divinity, Christ possessed the
                   power to break the bonds of death."—The Desire of Ages,

                   who have kept His law. 'They also which pierced Him' (Revela-

                          In this verse the prophet Isaiah points forward to the "out-
                        pourings of God's Spirit upon the world, which would cause
                        regions spiritually barren and desolate to blossom as the
                        rose."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 225.

                          In what beautiful words does the prophet Ezekiel express
                        the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit? Eze. 36:25-27.

                          Ezekiel, like Isaiah, speaks of the Spirit under the symbol of
                        water. By using the emblem of water, the prophet presents the
                        Spirit both as a cleansing and life-giving agent.
                          "In the preaching of the word of God, the sign that should be
                        manifest now and always is the presence of the Holy Spirit, to
                        make the word a regenerating power to those that hear. This is
                        God's witness before the world to the divine mission of His
                        Son."—The Desire of Ages, p. 407.

                          What would God have been willing to do if Israel had but
                        turned to Him in repentance and rededication? Eze. 39:29.

                          This verse shows that God would have poured out His Spirit
                        upon repentant Israel and given them enabling power to
                        evangelize the world in preparation for the coming Messiah, if
                        they had but been willing to follow His biddings.

                          In what well-known words does the prophet Joel promise an
                        outpouring of the Spirit, and in what respect does it differ from
                        many other Old Testament promises of the Spirit? Joel 2:
                        28, 29.

                          While some of the Scriptures in the Old Testament give no
                        indication with reference to time for the outpouring of the Spirit
                        upon God's children, Joel places the bestowal very definitely in
                        the final day of the Lord.
                          "If this prophecy of Joel met a partial fulfillment in the days of
                        the apostles, we are living in a time when it is to be even more
                        evidently manifest to the people of God. He will so bestow His
                        Spirit upon His people that they will become a light amid the
                        moral darkness; and great light will be reflected in all parts of

         PROMISE with fire" (Matt. 3:11).
                      "John proclaimed the coming of the Messiah, and called the
                    people to repentance. As a symbol of cleansing from sin, he
                    baptized them in the waters of the Jordan. Thus by a significant
                    object lesson he declared that those who claimed to be chosen
                    people of God were defiled by sin, and that without purification
                    of heart and life they could have no part in the Messiah's
                    kingdom."—The Desire of Ages, p. 104.
                      But John was keenly aware that his baptism would not suffice
                    to fit men and women to stand in the presence of God. More was
                    needed than a baptism with water.

                      Who according to John would administer a better baptism to
                    repentant sinners? Matt. 3:11 (second part).

                      " 'I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance,' said John;
                    'but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am
                    not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
                    with fire.' Matt. 3:11, R. V., margin."—The Desire of Ages, p. 107.

                      When was there an outstanding fulfillment of John's prom-
                    ise? Compare Matt. 3:11 with Acts 1:4, 5; 2:1-4.

                       "Fire and water are two great natural purifying agencies, and
                    it is appropriate that both should be used to represent the
                    regeneration of the heart.... If men persistently cling to sin, they
                    must eventually be consumed with it; how much better it is to
                    permit the Holy Spirit to carry forward the purifying work now,
                    while probation still lingers! A man will be either purged of sin or
                    purged along with it."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 300.

                      How does John's promise of the Spirit fit the purpose of
                    Jesus' life as given in Matt. 1:21?
                      "The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of
                    sin; it means taking away our sins, and filling the vacuum with
                    the graces of the Holy Spirit.... When Christ reigns in the soul,
                    there is purity, freedom from sin."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                    pp. 419, 420.
                      "He [Jesus] saves men, not in sin, but from sin; and those who
                    love Him will show their love by obedience."—The Desire of

            Part 3    "On the last and most important day of the festival Jesus
        THE SPIRIT stood up and said in a loud voice, 'Whoever is thirsty should
      NOT YET GIVEN come to me and drink. As the scripture says, "Whoever be-
                   lieves in me, streams of life-giving water will pour out from his
                   heart." ' Jesus said this about the Spirit, which those who
                   believed in him were going to receive. At that time the Spirit
                   had not yet been given, because Jesus had not been raised to
                   glory" (John 7:37-39, TEV).

                        When Jesus spoke these words, the Spirit as a dove had
                      already descended upon Him. An abundance of Old Testament
                      references indicate that the Holy Spirit had long been at work in
                      behalf of man. What then does John mean when he says, "The
                      Spirit had not yet been given"?
                        Even though the Spirit had worked with men from the very
                      entrance of sin, He had not come to earth in His fullness. That
                      was not to take place until Jesus had been glorified.
                        Jesus through His incarnation came to this earth to work out
                      man's salvation. He came in conformity with His Father's will.
                      But before His redemptive mission could be declared a success
                      and completed, Jesus' sacrifice must be acknowledged by His
                      Father and accepted as satisfactory.
                        "He died on the cross as a sacrifice for the world, and through
                      this sacrifice comes the greatest blessing that God could
                      bestow,—the gift of the Holy Spirit."—Sons and Daughters of
                      God, p. 242.

                        As Jesus was about to leave them, what promise did He give
                      His disciples with reference to His presence? Matt. 28:20; Acts
                      1:4, 5.

                        "Christ is to live in his representatives by the spirit of
                     truth."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, April 4, 1893.
                        "Is not the Spirit of God to come today in answer to earnest,
                     persevering prayer, and fill men with power? Is not God saying
                     today to His praying, trusting, believing workers. . . 'Lo, I am

The Promise of the Holy Spirit           LESSON 4                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 25
           Part 4   Shortly before His crucifixion what did Jesus again promise
          JESUS' His disciples?
        PROMISE
                    "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Com-
                  forter, that he may abide with you for ever" (John 14:16).

                      The word Jesus uses for "pray" in this verse has the basic
                    meaning of "to ask" or "to enquire." In John's writings it usually
                    connotes a person asking something from an equal.
                      This is the first direct promise made by Jesus to His disciples
                    concerning the coming of the Spirit. Evidently He is referring to
                    His coming on the Day of Pentecost. As briefly mentioned in part
                    3, this was not the Spirit's first appearance on the earth.
                      "Before this the Spirit had been in the world; from the very
                    beginning of the work of redemption He had been moving upon
                    men's hearts. But while Christ was on earth, the disciples had
                    desired no other helper. Not until they were deprived of His
                    presence would they feel their need of the Spirit, and then He
                    would come."—The Desire of Ages, p. 669.
                      Indeed the Spirit had been on earth since Creation, and "dur-
                    ing the patriarchal age the influence of the Holy Spirit had often
                    been revealed in a marked manner, but never in its fullness."—
                    The Acts of the Apostles, p. 37.

                      Who was to send the Spirit in whose name? John 14:26.

                      As Jesus came in the name of the Father (John 5:43), and did
                    His work in His Father's name (John 10:25), so the Spirit was to
                    come in the name of Jesus.

                      What did Jesus bestow upon the disciples before He left
                    them? John 20:22.

                      "Before He left His disciples, Christ 'breathed on them, and
                    saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.' John 20:22. Again
                    He said, 'Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you.'
                    Luke 24:29. But not until after the ascension was the gift re-
                    ceived in its fullness. Not until through faith and prayer the
                    disciples had surrendered themselves fully for His working was
                    the outpouring of the Spirit received. Then in a special sense the
                    goods of heaven were committed to the followers of Christ."—

          ANOTHER 14:18).
        COMFORTER
                      "Another Comforter" (John 14:16) was coming to take the
                   place of Jesus. Up to this time Jesus had been with the disciples
                   and been their Helper in every emergency. But now another
                   Person was coming to take His place.
                     The Greek word translated "Comforter" is a compound word
                   made up of "pare" which means "alongside," and "kidtos"
                   which means "one called." Thus parakletos means "one called
                   to stand alongside another," or one called to take his part to
                   help him in any emergency that arises. It has the meaning of
                   advocate or counselor. Further, the same verb form is trans-
                   lated "exhort."
                     "He is also an 'Exhorter.' In fact, this latter meaning is the
                   prominent feature of the work of the Spirit as outlined by John.
                   He will 'teach' and 'bring all things to . . . remembrance' (ch.
                   14:26). He will testify of Christ (ch. 15:26). He will 'reprove the
                   world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment' (ch. 16:8).
                   He will guide into all truth and show things to come (ch. 16:13).
                   He will glorify Christ and receive from Him and impart to the
                   disciples (ch. 16:14)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1037.
                     But it means even more than these words. It conveys the
                   thought of a helper always at hand with his counsel, his
                   strength, and his exhortation, or whatever form of help is
                   needed.

                        By what agency is Jesus Himself able to be with His follow-
                      ers continuously today? 1 John 3:24; 4:13.

                        The apostles and their fellow believers were not to be left
                      alone or without help after Jesus ascended to heaven. An all-
                      adequate Helper was to be with them. "By the Spirit, He said, He
                      would manifest Himself to them."—The Desire of Ages, p. 670.

          Part 6    What did Jesus say about His departure from the disciples
         A MORE and the Helper He would send them?
       ADEQUATE
         HELPER     "Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that
                 I go away: for if Igo not away, the Comforter will not come unto
                 you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you" (John 16:7).

                      Christ's departure would enrich the disciples, and all believ-
                    ers, rather than impoverish them. While on earth Jesus was
                    geographically limited to one particular place at a time. While
                    He was with the three disciples on the mountain, He could not
                    be with the others at the foot of the mountain. He was limited in
                    space as we are. But the Paraclete was not to be cumbered with
                    humanity or limited in space. Being omnipresent, the Spirit is
                    not confined by the limitation of a human body. He is equally
                    accessible to all everywhere.
                      "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
                    personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered
                    with humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally.
                    Therefore it was for their interest that He should go to the
                    Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. No one
                    could then have any advantage because of his location or his
                    personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be
                    accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if
                    He had not ascended on high."—The Desire of Ages, p. 669.

                     What was promised to Israel in Isaiah's time? Isa. 59:19.
                    How do we appropriate this promise? Gal. 3:14.

                       Literally this promise through the prophet Isaiah refers to the
                    help God would provide for His ancient people when they were
                    threatened by overwhelming destruction before an assaulting
                    enemy. But it is a promise to you and me today, as followers of
                    God, that He will send His Spirit to succor us in moments of
                    temptation.
                       "If we look to Jesus and trust in Him, we call to our aid a power
                    that has conquered the foe on the field of battle, and with every
                    temptation He will make a way of escape. When Satan comes in
                    like a flood, we must meet his temptations with the sword of the
                    Spirit, and Jesus will be our helper and will lift up for us a
                    standard against him."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 426.

       THE PROMISE ise to His disciples did He renew?
       OF THE SPIRIT
           RENEWED     "Being assembled together with them, commanded them
                     that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
                     promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.
                     For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
                     with the Holy Ghost not many days hence" (Acts 1:4, 5).

                       The words "promise of the Father" refer to the gift of the
                     Spirit that Jesus promised His disciples as recorded in John
                     14:16-26 and 16:7-13. The disciples were to remain or stay, or
                     even sit (Greek: kathizo, Luke 24:49) in Jerusalem, until the
                     promise was fulfilled.
                       The emphasis in the command to "wait" or "sit" is upon the
                     fulfillment of God's promise in due time. The waiting itself
                     would not bring the Spirit. The word translated promise—
                     epaggelia—as it is used in other parts of the New Testament
                     stresses God's grace rather than man's effort. The Spirit is
                     God's free gift in response to the believer's faith.

                       What would accompany the fulfillment of the promise of the
                     gift of the Spirit as far as the experience of the disciples was
                     concerned? Acts 1:8.

                        With the Spirit the disciples were to receive power. The bap-
                     tism of the Spirit is always given for the purpose of testimony
                     and service.
                        "Before one book of the New Testament was written, before
                     one gospel sermon had been preached after Christ's ascension,
                     the Holy Spirit came upon the praying apostles."—The Desire of

                        Unity is not obtained by talking about it. "No, that will only
                     cause differences. There are three simple things to observe:
                     First, be occupied with the Lord. .. . Second, be occupied for the
                     Lord. On the day before the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson took
                     Collingwood and Rotherham, who were at variance, to a spot
                     where they could see the foe opposed to them. 'Yonder,' said
                     the Admiral, 'are your enemies, shake hands and be friends like
                     good Englishmen.' Concentration of attention upon the
                     enemies of the Lord will mean their routing and our victory. The
                     old fable of the two earthen pots in the sea makes them say, 'If
                     we clash we are broken.' The daughter of dissension is dissolu-

                       While Jesus was still with His disciples, what had often been
                     their attitude and relationship toward one another? Mark 9:33,
                     34; Luke 22:24.

                       "Even the disciples, though outwardly they had left all for
                     Jesus' sake, had not in heart ceased to seek great things for
                     themselves. It was this spirit that prompted the strife as to who
                     should be greatest. It was this that came between them and
                     Christ, making them so little in, sympathy with His mission of
                     self-sacrifice, so slow to comprehend the mystery of
                     redemption."—The Desire of Ages, p. 409.

                       "Notice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect

                     that the Spirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All

           Part 3   "When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
             THE with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a
     PENTECOSTAL sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
     FULFILLMENT the house where they were sitting" (Acts 2:1, 2).

                      By Pentecost the disciples were living in complete harmony
                    with God's will and in complete harmony with one another. They
                    were thus ready for the infilling of the Spirit.

                      What occurrence in heaven was signified by the gift of the
                    Holy Spirit? Acts 2:33.

                      "Christ's ascension to heaven was the signal that His follow-
                   ers were to receive the promised blessing. For this they were to
                    wait before they entered upon their work. When Christ passed
                    within the heavenly gates, He was enthroned amidst the adora-
                   tion of the angels. As soon as this ceremony was completed, the
                   Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples in rich currents, and
                   Christ was indeed glorified, even with the glory which He had
                   with the Father from all eternity. The Pentecostal outpouring
                   was Heaven's communication that the Redeemer's inaugura-
                   tion was accomplished. According to His promise He had sent
                   the Holy Spirit from heaven to His followers, as a token that He
                   had, as priest and king, received all authority in heaven and on
                   earth, and was the Anointed One over His people."—The Acts of
                   the Apostles, pp. 38, 39.
                      Until this reenthronement in heaven had taken place, Jesus
                   had refused to accept the adoration of the welcoming angels in
                   heaven. "He waves them back. Not yet; He cannot now [at His
                   arrival in heaven at His ascension] receive the coronet of glory
                   and the royal robe. He enters into the presence of His Father....
                   Now He declares: Father, it is finished. I have done Thy will, 0
                   My God. I have completed the work of redemption. If Thy justice
                   is satisfied, 'I will that they also, whom Thou has given Me, be
                   with Me where I am.' John 19:30; 17:24.

                   satisfied."—The Desire of Ages, p. 834.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do you think that the reception of the Holy Spirit by His
                    people will be due primarily to the goodness of God or to the
                    virtue of His people?

    OF LANGUAGE abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded,
                 because that every man heard them speak in his own lan-
                 guage. And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one
                 to another, Behold, are not all these which speak
                 Galilaeans?" (Acts 2:5-7).

                      The infilling of the Holy Spirit leads the recipient to witness for
                   God. At Pentecost the Spirit-filled believers were given the abil-
                   ity to use other languages in order to accomplish their mission
                   more effectively.
                      "The Holy Spirit, assuming the form of tongues of fire, rested
                   upon those assembled. This was an emblem of the gift then
                   bestowed on the disciples, which enabled them to speak with
                   fluency languages with which they had heretofore been unac-
                   quainted. The appearance of fire signified the fervent zeal with
                   which the apostles would labor and the power that would attend
                   their work."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 39.
                      "Every known tongue was represented by those assembled.
                   This diversity of languages would have been a great hindrance
                   to the proclamation of the gospel; God therefore in a miracu-
                   lous manner supplied the deficiency of the apostles. The Holy
                   Spirit did for them that which they could not have accomplished
                   for themselves in a lifetime. They could now proclaim the truths
                   of the gospel abroad, speaking with accuracy the languages of
                   those for whom they were laboring. This miraculous gift was a
                   strong evidence to the world that their commission bore the
                    signet of Heaven. From this time forth the language of the
                   disciples was pure, simple, and accurate, whether they spoke in
                   their native tongue or in a foreign language."—The Acts of the
                   Apostles, pp. 39, 40.

                     When the Spirit later fell upon the believers at Caesarea and
                   Ephesus, how did lie manifest Himself among the recipients?
                   Acts 10:44-46; 19:1-6.

                      When the believers in Caesarea and Ephesus received the
                   Spirit, they also spoke with tongues. (See Acts 10:46; 19:6.)
                   Ellen G. White says about the Ephesus experience: "As Paul
                   'laid his hands upon them,' they received also the baptism of the
                   Holy Spirit, by which they were enabled to speak the languages
                   of other nations and to prophesy. Thus they were qualified to
                   labor as missionaries in Ephesus and its vicinity and also to go
                   forth to proclaim the gospel in Asia Minor."—The Acts of the
                   Apostles, p. 283.

                   apostles to speak other languages, or was it a gift of hearing?

                  (Acts 2:4, Jerusalem).

                     Not only were they given the gift of tongues, but their mes-
                   sage was also under the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit.

                     How was the deacon Philip directed in his work? Acts 8:26.
                     "While Philip was still in Samaria, he was directed by a
                   heavenly messenger to 'go toward the south unto the way that
                   goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza. . . . And he arose and
                   went.' He did not question the call, nor did he hesitate to obey;
                   for he had learned the lesson of conformity to God's will."—The
                   Acts of the Apostles, p. 107.

                     As Philip approached the Ethiopian, what did he find the
                   traveler doing? Acts 8:30.
                      "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light
                   and who was ready to receive the gospel, and today angels will
                    guide the footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy
                   Spirit to sanctify their tongues and refine and ennoble their
                    hearts. The angel sent to Philip could himself have done the
                   work for the Ethiopian, but this is not God's way of working. It is
                   His plan that men are to work for their fellow men."—The Acts of
                   the Apostles, p. 109.

                    What agency led Peter to a man who was seeking for truth?
                   Acts 10:19-22.
                     "In obedience to the directions just received from God, the
                   apostle promised to go with them. On the following morning he
                   set out for Caesarea, accompanied by six of his brethren. These
                    were to be witnesses of all that he should say or do while visiting
                   the Gentiles, for Peter knew that he would be called to account
                   for so direct a violation of the Jewish teachings."—The Acts of

The Promise Fulfilled       LESSON 5                                  ❑ Friday
                                                                    November 3
          Pad 6     Is there evidence that after Pentecost the apostles were still
      THE SPIRIT filled with the Holy Spirit?
          AFTER
      PENTECOST     "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
                 rulers of the people, and elders of Israel" (Acts 4:8).

                     The infilling of the Spirit experienced by the apostles at
                   Pentecost was not a momentary phenomenon, but a continuing
                   factor in their lives. This fact made the distinction between
                   Peter's behavior at this time and what happened at the trial of
                   Jesus. "In that very room and before some of those very men,
                   Peter had shamefully denied his Lord. This came distinctly to
                   his mind as he appeared for his own trial. He now had an
                   opportunity of redeeming his cowardice."—The Acts of the
                   Apostles, p. 62.
                     "With holy boldness and in the power of the Spirit Peter
                   fearlessly declared: 'Be it known unto you all, and to all the
                   people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
                   whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by
                   Him doth this man stand here before you whole.' "—The Acts of
                   the Apostles, p. 63.

                     As Peter and John, in the power of the Spirit, fearlessly
                   witnessed for Jesus, what did the priests recognize? Acts
                   4:13.

                     Other occasions in the apostolic church when the Spirit filled
                   the believers are recorded in Acts 4:31; 6:5; 7:55.

                     By whom was the preaching of the apostles seconded? Acts
                   5:32.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do I regard the infilling of the fullness of the Spirit as a
                   once-for-all experience or do I recognize it as an abiding or
                   continuous experience?

                     "The Lord did not lock the reservoir of heaven after pouring
                   His Spirit upon the early disciples. We also may receive of the
                   fullness of His blessing. Heaven is full of the treasures of His

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit               LESSON 6                       ❑ Sunday
                                                                           November 5
             Part 1   "Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart,
     CONVERSION AND and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and
         THE SPIRIT brethren, what shall we do?" (Acts 2:37).

                        (Compare Acts 9:5, 6; 16:30; John 16:8.)
                        God speaks to the unconverted through the Holy Spirit. Con-
                      cerning the apostles' preaching at Pentecost, we read: "The
                      Holy Spirit sent the arguments home to hearts with divine
                      power. The words of the apostles were as sharp arrows of the
                      Almighty, convicting men of their terrible guilt in rejecting and
                      crucifying the Lord of glory."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 45.

                         As they repented and were baptized as an outward Indica-
                      tion of their change of heart, what did they then receive,
                      according to Peter's statement? Acts 2:38.

                        "On that memorable occasion large numbers who had
                      heretofore ridiculed the idea of so unpretending a person as
                      Jesus being the Son of God, became thoroughly convinced of
                      the truth and acknowledged Him as their Saviour. Three
                      thousand souls were added to the church. The apostles spoke
                      by the power of the Holy Ghost. . . .
                        "The arguments of the apostles alone, although clear and
                      convincing, would not have removed the prejudice of the Jews
                      which had withstood so much evidence. But the Holy Ghost
                      sent those arguments home with divine power to their
                      hearts."—The Story of Redemption, p. 245.

                        What does the apostle Paul say about being baptized into
                      the church or into the body of Christ? 1 Cor. 12:13.

                         The word translated "by" in the above verse (KJV) may also be
                      translated "in" (as in NEB, etc.). Thus genuine believers are
                      baptized in one Spirit into the body of Christ (verse 12), which is
                      the church. Baptism in the Spirit or conversion ideally precedes
                      water baptism. Baptism in water is an outward demonstration of
                      the change that has already taken place in the heart. The true
                      believer is born by the Spirit (John 3:5, 6); the Spirit is the
                      sealing agent (Eph. 1:13, 14); and the Spirit has been given him
                      as an earnest (guarantee) and reminder that he belongs to God
                      (2 Cor. 5:5). No person is a Christian or a child of God at all if the
                      Spirit does not dwell in him (Rom. 8:9), or if he has not been
                      baptized by the Spirit.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is it possible for me to be a member of the church without
                     really being a member of the spiritual body of Christ, and
                     hence a recipient of His Spirit?

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit            LESSON 6                      ❑ Monday
                                                                       November 6
        Part 2    "Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every
 REPENTANCE AND one.of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
     THE SPIRIT sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts
                2:38).

                      Repentance is a change of mind about sin, about God, about
                    Jesus Christ, and consequently about the Spirit, the Third Per-
                    son of the heavenly trio. It is a change of mind from rebellion
                    against God and rejection of Jesus as our Lord and Saviour. A
                    person unwilling to let the Spirit abide within and rule one's
                    deeds, words, and thoughts changes through repentance and
                    becomes willing to accept the Spirit as an indwelling Guest. The
                    convert decides to let the Spirit direct him in all his decisions
                    and choices. No longer does he insist on having his own way,
                    but constantly he consults his Guest, who is the Ambassador of
                    King Jesus. Then he follows His suggestions. He does this, not
                    reluctantly, but gladly and willingly. It becomes his joy to accept
                    His promptings, as it is a joy for a lover to carry out the wishes of
                    his beloved.

                      What Bible personality is an apt illustration of a change from
                    obdurate rebelliousness against God to ready obedience?
                    Acts 9:6 (first part); Rom. 1:1; Phil. 3:7, 8.

                       In some of his epistles, Paul introduces himself as a servant.
                    This word is translated from the Greek word doulos which
                    means "one bound"; and hence a "bond-servant" or a "slave."
                       The apostle Paul, in designating himself a slave, does not
                    imply that he is an unwilling slave of Jesus. Rather, he is trying
                    to tell us that he has chosen to subordinate all his plans, wishes,
                    and desires to the will of God. When we fully yield ourselves to
                    God, we shall likewise let the Spirit rule in all we do.
                       "Through his long term of service, Paul had never faltered in
                    his allegiance to his Saviour. Wherever he was—whether before
                    scowling Pharisees, or Roman authorities; before the furious
                    mob at Lystra, or the convicted sinners in the Macedonian
                    dungeon; whether reasoning with the panic-stricken sailors on
                    the shipwrecked vessel, or standing alone before Nero to plead
                    for his life—he had never been ashamed of the cause he was
                    advocating. The one great purpose of his Christian life had been
                     to serve Him whose name had once filled him with
                     contempt."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 500.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Is there any unrepented or unforsaken sin or evil habit that
                    keeps me from being filled with the Holy Spirit?

                                                                        November 7
             Part 3   "We are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the
      OBEDIENCE AND Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him"
         THE SPIRIT (Acts 5:32).

                        As this text suggests, obedience is one of the prerequisites for
                     receiving the Holy Spirit. As long as a person knowingly and
                     willfully disobeys God, he cannot claim the baptism of the Holy
                     Spirit.
                        If he does make such a claim, it may be that he has received a
                     counterfeit spirit. A counterfeit is bewilderingly like the genuine
                     in appearance. As a matter of fact, many people are constantly
                     duped by counterfeits.

                       What happens when an individual has received the Spirit,
                     but then turns away from God in disobedience? 1 Sam. 16:14;
                     (Compare 1 Sam. 10:6, 9, 10; 11:6.)

                       When Saul was called to the kingly office in Israel and
                     anointed as king by Samuel, he had a humble opinion about
                     himself (1 Sam. 9:21). "Had he remained humble, seeking con-
                     stantly to be guided by divine wisdom, he would have been
                     enabled to discharge the duties of his high position with suc-
                     cess and honor. Under the influence of divine grace every good
                     quality would have been gaining strength, while evil tendencies
                     would have lost their power."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp.
                     632, 633.
                       "Saul turned away from the reproof sent him by God's Holy
                     Spirit.... He could not receive divine help or guidance until he
                     should return to God by confession of his sin."—Patriarchs and
                     Prophets, pp. 633, 634.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is it true that one little disregard of a "Thus saith the Lord" is
                     sufficient to stop the blessing of the Holy Spirit?

                       "Yet with the sin of Saul and its result before us, how many are
                     pursuing a similar course. While they refuse to believe and obey
                     some requirement of the Lord, they persevere in offering up to
                     God their formal services of religion. There is no response of the
                     Spirit of God to such service. No matter how zealous men may
                     be in their observance of religious ceremonies, the Lord cannot
                     accept them if they persist in willful violation of one of His
                     commands."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 634.
                       "Those who have put on Christ by baptism, by this act show-
                     ing their separation from the world and that they have
                     covenanted to walk in newness of life, should not set up idols in

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit            LESSON 6                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     November 8
           Part 4  What rhetorical question did the apostle Paul address to the
        FAITH AND Galatians?
       THE SPIRIT
                   "Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by
                  works of the law, or by hearing with faith?" (Gal. 3:2, RSV).

                      The Galatians had seen the fulfillment of the promise of Jesus
                    regarding the Spirit in their lives. This had been a result of their
                    faith.

                      How is living, saving faith recognized? Gal. 5:5, 6.

                       Faith according to the Bible is not mere theory, but a knowl-
                    edge of the truth implemented. The faith that results in receiving
                    the Spirit is faith in Jesus, because the Spirit is the gift of Jesus.
                    "Those who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him
                    into the heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that
                    Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received into the heart
                    by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal."—The Desire of
                    Ages, p. 388.
                       Of the occasion when the disciples were unable to heal the
                    demon-possessed boy, Ellen White wrote: "Instead of
                    strengthening their faith by prayer and meditation on the words
                    of Christ, they had been dwelling on their discouragements and
                    personal grievances. In this state of darkness they had under-
                    taken the conflict with Satan.
                       "In order to succeed in such a conflict they must come to the
                    work in a different spirit. Their faith must be strengthened by
                     fervent prayer and fasting, and humiliation of heart. They must
                     be emptied of self, and be filled with the Spirit and power of
                     God. Earnest, persevering supplication to God in faith—faith
                    that leads to entire dependence upon God, and unreserved
                     consecration to His work—can alone avail to bring men the Holy
                     Spirit's aid in the battle against principalities and powers, the
                     rulers of the darkness of this world, and wicked spirits in high
                     places."—The Desire of Ages, p. 431.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Is my faith so virile that it produces action, or is it so cheap
                    that it demands or costs nothing?

                       "Faith is trusting God—believing that He loves us and knows
                    best what is for our good."—Education, p. 253. It is taking God
                    at His word.
                       "By the Spirit every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer
                    is acceptable to God. Wherever a soul reaches out after God,
                    there the Spirit's working is manifest, and God will reveal Him-
                    self to that soul. For such worshipers He is seeking. He waits to
                    receive them and to make them His sons and daughters."—My

           Part 5    "The Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
       AN ILLUS- speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward."
      TRATION OF    "And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the
           FAITH Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that
                  night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
                  And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
                  the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their
                  right hand, and on their left" (Ex. 14:15, 21, 22).

                      The baptism of the Holy Spirit results from faith in Jesus. Only
                   the faith that controls the thoughts and actions is adequate to
                   the reception of the Spirit. The story of Israel at the Red Sea is an
                   illustration of the genuine faith required for the Spirit's baptism.

                      "The Hebrews were encamped beside the sea, whose waters
                   presented a seemingly impassable barrier before them, while
                   on the south a rugged mountain obstructed their further prog-
                   ress. Suddenly they beheld in the distance the flashing armor
                   and moving chariots betokening the advance guard of a great
                   army. As the force drew nearer, the hosts of Egypt were seen in
                   full pursuit. Terror filled the hearts of Israel. . . .
                      "True, there was no possibility of deliverance unless God
                   Himself should interpose for their [Israel's] release; but having
                   been brought into this position in obedience to the divine direc-
                   tion, Moses felt no fear of the consequences."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, pp. 283, 284.

                     What was the fate of the pursuing Egyptians? Ex. 14:27, 28.

                     To escape death the Israelites had to take God at His word and
                   go forward. To be eternally saved we shall also have to take God
                   at His word.

THINK IT THROUGH     What does faith mean to me? Is it possibly as simple as
                   taking God at His word?

                     "Often the Christian life is beset by dangers, and duty seems
                   hard to perform. The imagination pictures impending ruin be-
                   fore and bondage or death behind. Yet the voice of God speaks
                   clearly, 'Go forward.' We should obey this command, even
                   though our eyes cannot penetrate the darkness, and we feel the
                   cold waves about our feet. The obstacles that hinder our prog-
                   ress will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit.
                   Those who defer obedience till every shadow of uncertainty
                   disappears and there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will
                   never obey at all."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 290.

The Baptism of the Holy Spirit           LESSON 6                       ❑ Friday
                                                                     November 10
           Part 6     With what did the apostle Paul tell the Ephesian believers
    "FILLED WITH    that they ought to be filled?
      THE SPIRIT"
                      "Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with
                    the Spirit" (Eph. 5:18).

                      Paul's desire for the Ephesians is not an arbitrary command;
                    rather it is something within their own choice, something that
                    the apostle urges his converts to choose to comply with. He
                    urges that the Ephesians not be dominated or ruled by narcotic
                    intoxication, but that they be filled with the "spiritual en-
                    thusiasm of the human spirit energized by the Holy Spirit."—
                    SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1034.

                      With what other kind of spirits may a person also be filled
                    and directed? Matt. 8:16.

                      It depends on a person's choice by what power he is to be
                    ruled or directed.

                      With what was Jesus filled? Luke 4:1; Acts 10:38.

                      Of Jesus, Ellen G. White says: "Daily He received a fresh
                    baptism of the Holy Spirit"—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 139.1t is
                    evident from this statement that baptism here does not refer to
                    the initial infilling. It rather refers to a repeated endowment.
                    Throughout her writings Ellen White uses the phrase "baptized
                    with the Spirit" in the sense of being filled with the Spirit, as she
                    does in this reference about Jesus daily being baptized or filled
                    with the Spirit. To be filled with or daily baptized by the Spirit
                    demands complete submission on the part of the individual.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Do I personally have the assurance that the Spirit lives in
                    me and rules my life, my deeds, and my thoughts? Have I
                    yielded to Him? How completely?

                       "God desires to refresh His people by the gift of the Holy
                     Spirit, baptizing them anew in His love. There is no need for a
                     dearth of the Holy Spirit in the church. After Christ's ascension,
                     the Holy Spirit came upon the waiting, praying, believing disci-
                     ples with a fulness and power that reached every heart. In the
                     future the earth is to be . . . encircled with an atmosphere of
                     grace. The Holy Spirit is to work on human hearts, taking things
                     of God and showing them unto men."—Christian Service, p.
                     250.
                       "We are living in the time of the Holy Spirit's power. It is
                     seeking to diffuse itself through the agency of humanity, thus
                     increasing its influence in the world."—Christian Service, p.

7/sifts of the
Holm Spirit
LESSON 7 November 12-18                   The Spirit is one, but the gifts or the
                                       manifestations of the Spirit are many
                                       and diverse. These gifts of grace or
                                       charismata are presented primarily in
                                       three different passages in the Bible,
                                       namely, in Romans 12:4-8, First
                                       Corinthians 12 through 14, and
                                       Ephesians 4:7-13. Probably even these
                                       enumerations, taken together, are not
                                       exhaustive but rather illustrative of
  "Now concerning spiritual gifts,     spiritual endowments. These gifts
brethren, I would not have you         were vouchsafed to the church when
ignorant."                             Jesus ascended to heaven (Eph.
  "Now there are diversities of gifts, 8,11).
but the same Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:1, 4).    No one individual in the church
                                       should expect to receive all the gifts of
                                       the Spirit. Neither should all the
                                       members expect to receive the same
                                       and identical gift or gifts. The New
                                       Testament likens the church, in which
                                       the manifestations of the Spirit
                                       appear, to the human body.
                                         All the different organs and limbs in
                                       the body together compose the
                                       whole. So all the different gifts of the
                                       Spirit will be found in different church
                                       members who together make up the
                                       church.
                                         In the church of God a member,
                                       endowed with a specific gift of the
                                       Spirit, will not disdain or look down
                                       upon another member because he
                                       does not possess that same gift.
                                       "There are different ways of serving,
                                       but the same Lord is served. There are
                                       different abilities to .perform service,
                                       but the same God gives ability to
                                       everyone for their particular service.
                                       The Spirit's presence is shown in some
                                       way in each person for the good of all"
                                       (1 Cor. 12:5-7, TEV).
                                         All members in the church will work
                                       together in unity for the good of the
                                       whole church. "The animating Spirit
                                       of God, working through human

Spirit will be noted.
Gifts of the Holy Spirit         LESSON 7                                 ❑ Sunday
                                                                        November 12
            Part 1     "For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
     THE CHURCH      we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
     AS THE BODY     been all made to drink into one Spirit."
                       "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular"
                     (1 Cor. 12:13, 27).

                        Through the Spirit we have been born again and become
                     members of the body of Christ. Through the rite of baptism by
                     immersion we then joined a local church. However, the mem-
                     bers of the body of Christ, or of the church, are no more alike
                     than are the different organs of the body. Nevertheless, just as
                     all the organs are part of the same body and serve a very definite
                     purpose in it, the church we have joined will not be complete or
                     constitute a body without all its different members.

                       What different gifts does the apostle Paul mention are to be
                     found in the body of the church? 1 Cor. 12:4-11, 28.

                        "Christian unity is a mighty agency. It tells in a powerful
                     manner that those who possess it are children of God. It has an
                     irresistible influence upon the world, showing that man in his
                     humanity may be a partaker of the divine nature, having es-
                     caped the corruption that is in the world through lust. We are to
                     be one with our fellow men and with Christ, and in Christ one
                     with God. Then of us can be spoken the words, 'Ye are complete
                     in Him.' "—My Life Today, p. 276.

                       What Is the purpose for these different gifts in the church?
                     Eph. 4:12, 13.

                       "In the plan of redemption a place is allotted to every soul. To
                     each man is given his work.... The work of God's people may
                     and will be varied, but one Spirit is the mover in it all. All the work
                     done for the Master is to be connected with the great whole. The
                     workers are to labor together in concert, each one controlled by
                     divine power, putting forth undivided effort to draw those
                     around them to Christ. All must move like parts of a well-
                     adjusted machinery, each part dependent on the other part, yet
                     standing distinct in action. And each one is to take the place
                     assigned him and do the work appointed him. God calls upon
                     the members of His church to receive the Holy Spirit, to come
                     together in unity and brotherly sympathy, to bind their interests
                     together in love."—My Life Today, p. 276.

THINK IT THROUGH       How clearly do I recognize that all the members of God's
                     church are part of the body of Christ and essential to its
                     unimpaired completeness?

Gifts of the Holy Spirit      LESSON 7                                ❑ Monday
                                                                    November 13
           Part 2    "For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
        WISDOM, another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another
     KNOWLEDGE, faith by the same Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:8, 9 first part).
       AND FAITH
                     In mass production manufacturing many of one kind of article
                  are made. Each one of a certain model looks like others of the
                  same model. It is easier to do this than to make each one
                  different. God, on the other hand, makes no two things alike. Of
                  the thousands of leaves on a tree the botanist tells us that every
                  leaf is different. Of the untold millions or billions of snow crys-
                  tals, beautifying the snowscape on a crisp, moonlit winter night,
                  no two are alike. They are all different. God uses no assembly
                  lines. His creative capability is sufficient to make each thing
                  different. Man on the other hand prefers the assembly line, not
                  only because it reduces the cost of production but because it's
                  much easier than thinking up new forms. God is limited neither
                  by lack of ideas or cost.
                     On a small scale God follows this pattern in His dealings with
                  His church. He does not give all members the same gifts; He
                  gives them different gifts but by the same Spirit.

                      What contrasting kinds of wisdom does Paul point out?
                    1 Cor. 2:5-7

                      In Athens Paul had tried to meet "eloquence with eloquence,
                    philosophy with philosophy, and logic with logic; but he failed
                    to meet with success he had hoped for. His aftersight led him to
                    understand that there was something needed above human
                    wisdom.... In order to convict and convert sinners, the Spirit of
                    God must come into his work and sanctify every spiritual
                    development."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                    mentary, vol. 6, p. 1084.
                       The wisdom Paul consequently refers to in First Corinthians
                    2:7 is identified as acquaintance with the plan of salvation;
                    knowledge is used in the traditional Hebrew meaning of obe-
                    dient acknowledgment of God's will. Both endowments—
                    wisdom and knowledge in this sense—are gifts of the Spirit.
                       Faith, as a gift of the Spirit, is complete trust in God and His
                    bidding, with consequent surrender or committal to God's plan
                    for salvation.
                       "The Holy Spirit ... takes the things of God and reveals them
                    to every soul that has an implicit faith in Christ.... As we study
                    the Scriptures, we should pray for the light of God's Holy Spirit
                    to shine upon the word, that we may see and appreciate its
                    treasures."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 113.

Gifts of the Holy Spirit         LESSON 7                              ❑ Tuesday
                                                                      November 14
             Part 3  "To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom . . . ; to
          MIRACLES another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the
       AND HEALINGS working of miracles" (1 Cor. 12:8-10).

                         The gifts of the Spirit will remain in the church until Jesus
                      returns. This includes the gift of healing, as well as the gift of
                      working of miracles. Since man's extremity is God's opportun-
                      ity, we do not regard it as appropriate for a Christian to refuse
                      medical help, expecting God to heal a person's disease by a
                      miracle without his having done anything to remedy the condi-
                      tion. God does not use miracles extravagantly or uselessly.
                      "What human power can do divine power is not summoned to
                      do."—The Desire of Ages, p. 535.

                       By what power did Jesus perform His miracles of healing?
                      Matt. 12:28.

                         "Physical healing is bound up with the gospel commission.
                       When Christ sent His disciples out on their first missionary
                       journey, He bade them, 'As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom
                      of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
                      dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.'
                      Matthew 10:7, 8."—Counsels on Health, p. 497.
                         Concerning the exhibition of miracles of healing just prior to
                      Jesus' return, Ellen White says: "Servants of God, with their
                      faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration, will hasten
                      from place to place to proclaim the message from heaven. By
                      thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be
                      given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and
                      signs and wonders will follow the believers."—The Great Con-
                      troversy, p. 612.

                        How are God's true followers to know if the miracles ema-
                      nate from God or from the evil one? 1 John 4:1; Isa. 8:20.

                         In certain quarters of Christendom miracles and the gift of
                      tongues are considered indispensable evidence that a believer
                      is a child of God or has been baptized with the Spirit. But the
                      Bible nowhere affirms that the gift of tongues, the working of
                      miracles, or other signs must necessarily be the evidence of
                      faith. Holiness alone is the one biblical indispensable for seeing
                      God (Heb. 12:14). Holiness is not an option. It is essential.
                      Seeing the Lord depends on holiness or conformity to God's
                      will, not on one's ability to perform miracles.

THINK IT THROUGH        In the near future, as miracles are performed by persons
                      who reject and deny biblical truth, will I still remain loyal to
                      God's word, or will I be overwhelmed by the evidence of my
                      senses?

Gifts of the Holy Spirit      LESSON 7                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  November 15
          Part 4   "God has appointed in the church ... prophets ... adminis-
   PROPHECY AND trators" (1 Cor. 12:28, RSV).
    GOVERNMENT
                   (Compare verse 10; Eph. 4:11; Romans 12:6-8.)
                   A prophet is a spokesman for God. Even after ancient Israel
                 became a monarchy, it was the prophet who received messages
                 and instruction from God. These he was to convey to the king.
                 The prophet consequently is God's spokesman to the people, as
                 the priest is man's spokesman to God. The content of his mes-
                 sage is not primarily predictive, but may be any message which
                 God desires to give His people at any particular time, whether it
                 pertains to the past, the present, or the future. The church of
                 God today, as in days of old, needs instruction from God. The
                 principal agent by which this instruction is given is the prophet.
                 We believe this gift was manifested in Ellen G. White.

                      In addition to prophets who receive Instruction from God,
                    what is needed in the church to execute the relayed divine
                    plans in efficient administration? 1 Cor. 12:28.

                      The Revised Standard Version translates "administrators"
                    instead of "governments." Although the gospel work is God's,
                    some human agent must direct it under God's guidance.

                     What instances in the apostolic church indicate that God
                    works through appointed agencies in His organized church?
                    Acts 13:1-3; 9:10-17.

                      "The circumstances connected with the separation of Paul
                    and Barnabas by the Holy Spirit to a definite line of service show
                    clearly that the Lord works through appointed agencies in His
                    organized church. Years before, when the divine purpose con-
                    cerning Paul was first revealed to him by the Saviour Himself,
                    Paul was immediately afterward brought into contact with
                    members of the newly organized church at. Damascus.. .. And
                    now, when the divine commission given at that time was to be
                    more fully carried out, the Holy Spirit, again bearing witness
                    concerning Paul as a chosen vessel to bear the gospel to the
                    Gentiles, laid upon the church the work of ordaining him and his
                    fellow laborer."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 162, 163.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why has God committed the direction of His work on earth to
                    His church rather than primarily laying the burden on solitary
                    individuals?

                      "God has made His church on the earth a channel of light, and
                    through it He communicates His purposes and His will."—The

Gifts of the Holy Spirit      LESSON 7                              ❑ Thursday
                                                                   November 16
          Part 5    "To one is given by the Spirit ... divers kinds of tongues; to
       TONGUES another the interpretation of tongues" (1 Cor. 12:8-10).
      AND THEIR
INTERPRETATIONS    The author of these lessons believes that "tongues" here
                 denotes foreign languages, since that was clearly the way the
                 gift was manifested at Pentecost and on subsequent recorded
                 occasions. (See Acts 2; 10:44-46; 11:15; 19:6.)

                     What did God miraculously give to the apostles at Pentecost
                   and afterward? Acts 2:46.

                      In the early church there was a need for the gift of tongues, or
                   a mastery of foreign languages. The gospel had to be communi-
                   cated to the world, and most of the post-ascension Christians
                   did not possess a command of foreign languages.
                      "The Jews had been scattered to almost every nation, and
                   spoke various languages.... This diversity of languages was a
                   great obstacle to the labors of God's servants in publishing the
                   doctrine of Christ to the uttermost parts of the earth. That God
                   should supply the deficiency of the apostles in a miraculous
                   manner was to the people the most perfect confirmation of the
                   testimony of these witnesses for Christ."—The Story of Re-
                   demption, pp. 242, 243.
                      "From this time forth the language of the disciples was pure,
                   simple, and accurate in word and accent, whether they spoke
                   their native tongue or a foreign language. These humble men,
                   who had never learned in the school of the prophets, presented
                   truths so elevated and pure as to astonish those who heard
                   them."—The Story of Redemption, p. 246.

                     Who spoke more often in tongues than anyone else? 1 Cor.
                   14:18.

                      In his evangelization among the heathen Paul constantly had
                   to use a tongue other than his native Aramaic—the common
                   language of the Jews in the day of Jesus and the apostles.
                      Corinth was a large seaport and commercial city with people
                   from many parts of the Roman Empire. In the view of the author
                   there were some in the Corinthian Church who boastfully used
                   languages that some other members could not readily under-
                   stand. Paul admonished them not to do so, unless they had an
                   interpreter, since no one in the congregation, other than the
                   speaker, could be edified by it. (See 1 Cor. 14:4.)

THINK IT THROUGH     Do I covet someone else's gift rather than being willing to
                   utilize my own to God's glory?

          Part 6    "God has appointed in the church ... helpers" (1 Cor. 12:28,
       HELPS OR RSV).
      "HELPERS"
                    "This gift is generally understood to be the ability conferred
                 on those who perform the office of a deacon in the church,
                 particularly as that office calls for ministering to the needs of the
                 poor and the sick. This is a work that may not be given as much
                 publicity as some of the other gifts, but it is nonetheless an
                 important phase of church life. To be able to visit the sick and
                 give them real sympathetic, understanding help, both physi-
                 cally and spiritually, is a powerful means of turning hearts to the
                 Saviour. Caring for the poor and needy by relieving their mate-
                 rial lack can be done satisfactorily only by those who are led by
                 the Spirit. This is a most fruitful ministry."—SDA Bible Com-
                 mentary, vol. 6, p. 776.
                    This gift of the Spirit may appear unimportant. Nevertheless
                 God has appointed it as essential for the well-being of the
                 church and community and as a manifestation that His Spirit
                 directs the activities of the church.

                      How do the prophet Isaiah and the apostle James Indicate
                    the importance of this work? Isa. 58:6, 7; James 1:27.

                       "The reason why God's people are not more spiritually
                    minded, and have not more faith, I have been shown, is because
                    they are narrowed up with selfishness. The prophet is address-
                    ing Sabbathkeepers, not sinners, not unbelievers, but those
                    who make great pretensions to godliness. It is not the abun-
                    dance of your meetings that God accepts. It is not the numerous
                    prayers, but the rightdoing, doing the right thing and at the right
                    time. It is to be less self-caring and more benevolent. Our souls
                    must expand."—Testimonies, vol. 2. p. 36.

THINK IT THROUGH      Would I rather be head elder or Sabbath School superin-
                    tendent in the church than a member of the welfare team? If
                    so, why is one position more dignified and elevated In my
                    eyes?

                      "At the last day the final decision by the Judge of all the earth
                    will turn upon our interest in, and practical labor for, the needy,
                    the oppressed, the tempted. You cannot always pass these by
                    on the other side and yourselves find entrance as redeemed
                    sinners into the city of God. 'Inasmuch,' says Christ, 'as ye did it

  "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness,
temperance: against such there is no
law' (Gal. 5:22, 23).
   The fruit of the Spirit is God's gift to
the church. But the Spirit Himself is
God's great gift to the believer. "All
'_good things' are comprised in this.
The Creator Himself can give us
nothing greater, nothing
better."—Thoughts From the Mount

manifests Himself in Christian
character traits. The apostle speaks of
them in the singular as "fruit" .rather

                          "What a wonderful portrayal! The paramount fruit of the Spirit
                       is love. All that follow are but aspects of this divine quality. Just
                       as various colors make up sunlight, so these graces together

                          A deciduous, live tree in the temperate zone inevitably and
                       spontaneously produces leaves in the spring as the sap begins
                       to rise in the trunk and reaches out into, every branch and twig.
                       In the same way a live Christian, filled with the Spirit, will pro-
                       duce the fruit of the Spirit—love.

                         What is found in Christ's followers as Jesus lives out His life
                       in them? John 15:4, 5; 17:26.

                          Jesus is God. As there is no life apart from God, so there is no
                       love or virtue apart from God. If man is going to possess and
                       manifest divine love, he must receive it from God. There is no
                       other source. "As the moon and the stars [planets] of our solar
                       system shine by the reflected light of the sun, so, as far as their

                       the Sun of Righteousness. Every gleam of thought, every flash
                       of the intellect, is from the Light of the world ."—Education,

                        By what agency does the apostle Paul in his letter to the
                       Romans say we become possessors of love? Rom. 5:5.

THINK IT THROUGH         What is my concept of perfect love? Is my love so unselfish
                       that It claims nothing in return, or does it demand mutuality or
                       a desire for love in return?

                          "How many are deficient in love! 0, that love might eradicate
                       from the heart hatred, emulation, and strife, and the root of
                       bitterness, whereby many are defiled. Never can the love of
                       Jesus be received and shed abroad in the heart until envious
                       feelings, hatred, jealousies, and evil surmisings are put away....
                         "Pure love is simple in its operations, and separate from every
                       other principle of action. When combined with earthly motives
                       and selfish interests, it ceases to be pure. God considers more
                       with how much love we work, than the amount we do. Love is a
                       heavenly attribute. The natural heart cannot originate it. This
                       heavenly plant only flourishes where Christ reigns supreme.
                       Where love exists, there is power and truth in the life. Love does
                       good, and nothing but good. Those who have love bear fruit

                                                                    November 20
          Part 2     "The fruit of the Spirit is love, Joy, peace" (Gal. 5:22).
        JOY AND
          PEACE      Joy is exulting love while peace is love in repose. Both as-
                   pects of love will be found in the genuine Christian.

                     As the apostles were filled with the Spirit, how did they
                   regard even persecution and beatings for Christ's sake? Acts
                   5:40, 41. (See also 4:31.)

                     When we suffer some inconvenience for being followers of
                   God or for our obedience to Him, how do we react? Do we
                   complain about the discriminations we are exposed to, or do we
                   rejoice? The apostles even thanked God that they were ac-
                   counted worthy to suffer beatings for their loyalty to Jesus. Is it
                   possible that our complaints and murmurings are symptomatic
                   of our lack of the infilling of the Spirit? Do you want your life to
                   be filled with joy? As under the influence of the Spirit you
                   cultivate thankfulness, you will discover that gratitude and
                   thankfulness compose the soil out of which joy grows.

                     What other quality, mentioned next after joy, characterizes
                   a believer in whom the Spirit abides? Gal. 5:22.

                      Peace does not depend on externals. If our peace depends on
                   circumstances and environment, then we may be continuously
                   victimized. There is no true peace for such a person. A Chris-
                   tian's peace is based on his oneness with God. Ellen White
                   writes concerning Jesus:
                      "In the heart of Christ, where reigned perfect harmony with
                   God, there was perfect peace. He was never elated by applause,
                   nor dejected by censure or disappointment. Amid the greatest
                   opposition and the most cruel treatment, He was still of good
                   courage."—The Desire of Ages, p. 330.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can I enjoy both peace and joy even when I occasion-
                   ally suffer abuse for being a follower of Jesus?

                     "Like love, 'joy' . . . has to do with God when we are glad
                   because of His divine mercy and even in the midst of the world's
                   storms praise and bless the Lord in the fiery furnace day and
                   night. But it has to do with our neighbor when we are not
                   envious of his goods but wish him joy in them as though they
                   were our own and praise the gifts of God that he has."—Luther,
                   Luther's Works, vol. 27, p. 374.
                     "Wherever His Spirit reigns, there peace abides. And there
                   will be joy also, for there is a calm, holy trust in God."—The

          Part 3   "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering"
  LONG-SUFFERING (Gal. 5:22).

                      Long-suffering is untiring love and manifests itself in the
                   Christian's relationship with other people.
                      "Long-suffering bears something, yea, many things, without
                   seeking to be avenged by word or act.
                      "'Long-suffering' is patience with offence; long endurance.
                   If you are long-suffering, you will not impart to others your
                   supposed knowledge of your brother's mistakes and errors.
                   You will seek to help and save him. because he has been pur-
                   chased with the blood of Christ.... To be long-suffering is not to
                   be gloomy and sad, sour and hardhearted; it is to be exactly the
                   opposite."—My Life Today, p. 52.
                      Long-suffering is rooted in complete confidence that God
                   loves us and is leading us to the goal of ultimate salvation in His
                   kingdom. Thus we are able even to endure wrongs without any
                   thought of personal vengeance.

                    Who is ultimately the source of our long-suffering? Ex. 34:6;
                   Rom. 2:4.

                      "The God whom we serve is long-suffering; 'His compassions
                   fail not.' Lamentations 3:22. Throughout the period of pro-
                   bationary time His Spirit is entreating men to accept the gift of
                   life."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 325, 326.

                     What does the development of long-suffering on the part of
                   the Christian presuppose? Col. 1:10-12.

                      "Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, faith and char-
                   ity are the elements of the Christian character. These precious
                   graces are the fruits of the Spirit. They are the Christian's crown
                   and shield. . . . Nothing can give more perfect content and
                   satisfaction."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 32.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is there a limit to God's long-suffering? If so, what brings it
                   about?

                      "When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabi-
                   tants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in
                   the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The restraint
                   which has been upon the wicked is removed, and Satan has
                   entire control of the finally impenitent. God's long-suffering has
                   ended. The world has rejected His mercy, despised His love, and
                   trampled upon His law. The wicked have passed the boundary
                   of their probation; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has
                   been at last withdrawn."—The Great Controversy, p. 614.

           Part 4    "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
     GENTLENESS gentleness, goodness" (Gal. 5:22).
   AND GOODNESS
                     "We want a spirit of gentleness. We cannot live right in the
                  family circle without it. In order to have the proper control of our
                  children, we must manifest a spirit of gentleness and of meek-
                  ness and of long-suffering. We do not want to have a faultfind-
                  ing, fretful, scolding spirit. If we teach them to have a spirit of
                  gentleness, we must have a spirit of gentleness ourselves. . . .
                  But at the same time there need be no weakness or unwise
                  indulgence on the part of parents. The mother must have firm-
                  ness and decision. She must be as firm as a rock, and not swerve
                  from the right. Her laws and rules should be carried out at all
                  times and under all hazards, but she can do this with all gentle-
                  ness and meekness."—My Life Today, p. 53.

                       How did Jacob, on his return to Canaan, show gentleness
                     toward the members of his family and toward his flocks? Gen.
                     33:14.

                        It would have been both safer and more convenient for Jacob
                     and his caravan to travel with Esau and his 400 men of war. After
                     all, they were traveling through a country infested with robbers.
                     But Jacob declined Esau's offer, not because he was thinking
                     primarily of his own welfare, convenience, and safety, but be-
                     cause he remembered the young children as well as the cattle,
                     which could not endure such strenuous marches as could the
                     soldiers and the men. Jacob was gentle with them.

                      What facet in the fruit of the Spirit does the apostle Paul
                     mention as following gentleness? Gal. 5:22.

                       The apostle, in enumerating the facets of the fruit of the Spirit,
                     does not list them in any succession of development, as does
                     Peter in his enumeration of Christian virtues in Second Peter
                     1:5-7. If they were to be enumerated in developmental se-
                     quence, gentleness would logically spring from goodness and
                     thus be listed after goodness rather than before.
                       "True goodness is accounted of Heaven as true greatness.
                     The condition of the moral affections determines the worth of
                     the man. A person may have property and intellect, and yet be
                     valueless, because the glowing fire of goodness has never
                     burned upon the altar of his heart."—My Life Today, p. 54.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is It possible to be good and kind but not gentle? Have we as

                       "Faith" and "belief" or "believe" are basically translated
                   from the same original Greek root. Faith and belief are always
                   used in the singular form, never in the plural. Faith involves
                   complete trust that leads to unreserved surrender or commit-
                   ment to the one loved and to his plans. This faith or trust is
                   illustrated in the marital union of two people, where faith or trust
                   leads each to surrender his individual will for the benefit of the
                   other. So faith—living faith—in God will lead to surrender to
                   Him and to His will and plans.
                       Faith is the spontaneous result of love or, as part of the fruit of
                   the Spirit, it is one aspect of love. Faith is love in confidence.

                     What does the apostle Paul say about the relationship of
                   faith to love In his great chapter on love? 1 Cor. 13:13.

                      Love—charity—is greater than faith, because love is the
                   foundation of faith. There can be no true living faith without an
                   underpinning of love.
                      An alleged faith that does not lead to surrender to God's will is
                   not genuine but Satan's counterfeit for faith. No living or saving
                   faith is merely theoretical. Rather it is always experimental and
                   leads to action.

                     How does faith "work" according to Paul? Gal. 5:6.

                     "The only true faith is that which 'worketh by love' (Galatians
                   5:6) to purify the soul. It is as leaven that transforms the
                   character."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 53.

                     Does the great faith chapter present abstract and theoreti-
                   cal faith or experimental faith? Read Hebrews 11.

                      "It was Caleb's faith that gave him courage, that kept him
                   from the fear of man, and enabled him to stand boldly and
                   unflinchingly in the defense of the right. Through reliance on
                   the same Power, the mighty General of the armies of heaven,
                   every true soldier of the cross may receive strength and courage
                   to overcome the obstacles that seem insurmountable."—Ellen
                   G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1113.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do I dare scrutinize the genuineness of my faith by my
                   readiness, or unwillingness, to surrender my life with all my
                   plans to God? (Read Steps to Christ, pp. 69, 70.)

The Fruit of the Holy Spirit       LESSON 8                          ❑ Friday
                                                                  November 24
         Part 6  "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
   MEEKNESS AND gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance" (Gal.
    TEMPERANCE 5:22, 23).

                     "Meekness" does not imply that the person possessing this
                   quality is to be a doormat for everyone to walk on. Rather
                   meekness describes one who has learned discipline or is able to
                   submit to and follow a master's directions. The biblical exam-
                   ples of meekness—Moses and Jesus among others—rightly
                   refute a cowardly definition of meekness.

                    Who does the book of Numbers declare to have been the
                   meekest of men? Numbers 12:3.

                      "Moses was a humble man; God called him the meekest man
                   on earth. He was generous, noble, well-balanced.. .. He could
                   successfully exhort his fellow-men, because his life itself was a
                   living representation of what man can become and accomplish
                   with God as his helper."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1113.
                      "Moses was the greatest man who ever stood as leader of the
                   people of God. He was greatly honored by God, not for the
                   experience which he had gained in the Egyptian court, but
                   because he was the meekest of men. God talked with him face to
                   face, as a man talks with a friend. If men desire to be honored by
                   God, let them be humble. Those who carry forward God's work
                   should be distinguished from all others by their humility."—
                   Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p.
                   1113.

                     How did Jesus demonstrate true meekness both In heaven
                   and on earth? Phil. 2:5-8; John 13:1-17.

                     What Is the last of the items mentioned by Paul as being part
                   of the fruit of the Spirit? Gal. 5:23.

                     Most modern Bible versions translate the Greek word ren-
                   dered "temperance" in the King James Version as "self-
                   control." Self-control embraces a wider facet of human charac-
                   ter than does temperance. Temperance is included in self-
                   control. Self-control is, in a sense, the capsheaf of character
                   building. When a person's self-control is placed under the di-
                   rection of the Spirit, the individual becomes Christlike.

THINK IT THROUGH     "Discipline and control the mental faculties. Self-control is a
                   power that all may possess. It is gained by placing the will
                   wholly on the side of God, taking the will of God for your
                   will."—Our High Calling, p. 219.

           Part 1     "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
      THE SPIRIT,   will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
         A GUIDE    all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
                    you" (John 14:26).
                      As an ambassador speaks in the name of his home govern-
                    ment to a foreign government, so the Spirit will speak to man in
                    Jesus' name and with His authority. Jesus has perpetuated His
                    earthly teaching ministry through the Spirit. "The Lord Jesus
                    acts through the Holy Spirit."—Sons and Daughters of God, p.
                    282.

                      In addition to teaching what will the Spirit do? John 14:26
                    (second part).
                      "It was not until after Christ's ascension to His Father, and the
                    outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the believers, that the disci-
                    ples fully appreciated the Saviour's character and mission. After
                    they had received the baptism of the Spirit, they began to realize
                    that they had been in the very presence of the Lord of glory. As
                    the sayings of Christ were brought to their remembrance, their
                    minds were opened to comprehend the prophecies, and to
                    understand the miracles which He had wrought.... His lessons,
                    which they had but dimly understood, now came to them as a
                    fresh revelation. The Scriptures became to them a new
                    book."—The Desire of Ages, p. 507.

                      How does Jesus reiterate this teaching ministry of the Holy
                    Spirit? John 16:12, 13.
                      The Spirit is a living, personal teacher. Every time we open the
                    Bible, it is possible to have the Spirit unveil to us the true
                    meaning of what we read. Many of us have listened to a capable
                    teacher, and then said to ourselves, "If I only could have that
                    teacher instruct me, then I believe I could learn." But stop for a
                    moment. Anyone of us can have a more competent teacher
                    every day than any human instructor. The Spirit is the peerless
                    Teacher. "God can teach you more in one moment by His Holy
                    Spirit than you could learn from the great men of the earth."—

                    heed His suggestions?
                      Read Ephesians 1:17-19. After quoting this passage Ellen
                    White says, "The ministry of the divine Spirit in enlightening the
                    understanding and opening to the mind the deep things of

          Part 2   "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
     ACCEPTING who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom. 8:4).
    THE SPIRIT'S
      GUIDANCE     The Christian chooses not to follow his own impulses and
                 gratify his own inclinations, but to follow instead the biddings of
                 the Spirit. The dedicated follower of Jesus will never do any-
                 thing without seeking the advice and guidance of God. "Lord,
                 what do you want me to do?" is the question the Christian
                 continually asks. (See Acts 22:10.)
                   Neither is the Christian to dwell in the realm of mere belief or
                 theoretical faith. His faith will be experimental rather than
                 theoretical. Under the guidance of the Spirit the heavenly
                 mind-set of belief will be poured into the earthly mold of action
                 and behavior.

                    How may we know whether or not we are truly children of
                   God? Rom. 8:14; Matt. 12:50.

                     Profession or pretense does not make us children of God. But
                   willing obedience to God's will demonstrates that our faith is
                   genuine. "Every man, woman, and child that is not under the
                   control of the Spirit of God is under the influence of Satan's
                   sorcery."—Messages to Young People, p. 278.

                     What will characterize those who will finally live with God
                   and the angels? Isa. 1:19; 2 Tim. 4:7, 8; 1 Chron. 28:9.

                      Obedience to God's will, as good and commendable as it may
                   be, will not make us fit for heavenly society. "Love to God is the
                   very foundation of religion. To engage in His service merely
                   from hope of reward or fear of punishment would avail nothing.
                   Open apostasy would not be more offensive to God than hypoc-
                   risy and mere formal worship."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
                   523.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do I gladly and lovingly serve God, or do I serve Him grudg-
                   ingly? Am I happy to do what He asks? to pay my honest tithe?
                   to keep the Sabbath hours sacred unto the Lord as long as
                   they last?

                     "It may take time to attain perfect submission to God's will,
                   but we can never stop short of it and be fitted for heaven. True
                   religion will lead its possessor on to perfection. Your thoughts,
                   your words, and your actions, as well as your appetites and
                   passions, must be brought into subjection to the will of God.

           Part 3     "Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
       THE SPIRIT    which is the word of God" (Eph. 6:17).
 GUIDES THROUGH
       THE WORD        The Word of God is here called the sword of the Spirit. It was
                     the Spirit that inspired the written revelation, since "holy men of
                     God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter
                     1:21).

                      What agent or medium does the Spirit use to bring truth to
                     man? John 17:17; 1 Peter 1:2.

                        John Calvin admonishes: "We ought zealously to apply our-
                     selves both to read and to hearken to Scripture if indeed we
                     want to receive any gain and benefit from the Spirit of God."
                        Calvin then goes on to point out that even the impressions of
                     the Holy Spirit must be tested by the Bible. This is doing Him no
                     injustice, since He is the author of the Bible. "Nevertheless, he is
                     thus put to a test, I confess, but a test by which it pleased him to
                     establish his majesty among us.... But lest under his sign the
                     Spirit of Satan should creep in, he would have us recognize him
                     in his own image, which he has stamped upon the Scriptures.
                     He is the Author of the Scriptures: he cannot vary and differ
                     from himself. Hence he must ever remain just as he once re-
                     vealed himself there."—John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian
                     Religion I, 9:2 (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1960). Used by
                     permission.
                        "There is full assurance of hope in believing every word of
                     Christ, believing in Him, being united to Him by living faith.
                     When this is his experience, the human being is no longer under
                     the law, for the law no longer condemns his course of action....
                        "To them that believe, Christ is precious. His Spirit moving
                     upon the mind and heart of the believer is in perfect agreement
                     with that which is written in the Word. The Spirit and the Word
                     agree perfectly. Thus the Spirit beareth witness with our spirit
                     that we are born of God."—In Heavenly Places, p. 144.

    PERSECUTION
                    In the sunset hours of the world's history before Jesus returns
                 to gather His elect, His faithful followers will face adversity and
                 even persecution (see Rev. 13:11-18). Dragged before courts,
                 those arraigned will "make a strong vindication of the truth, and
                 some who hear them are led to take their stand to keep all the
                 commandments of God. Thus light will be brought before
                 thousands who otherwise would know nothing of these
                 truths."—The Great Controversy, p. 607.

                     When Christ's witnesses are brought before legal au-
                   thorities, who will guide them in their speech?

                     "When they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
                   shall speak: for it shall be given you in the same hour what ye
                   shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your
                   Father which speaketh in you" (Mall. 10:19, 20).

                     Will your courage fail under such conditions? Will your
                   tongue refuse to speak under such harassment? Without divine
                   aid, this might well be the case. But as God's witnesses we can
                   expect that He Himself will be our Helper.
                     "Persecution will spread the light. The servants of Christ will
                   be brought before the great men of the world, who, but for this,
                   might never hear the gospel.... God's grace will be dispensed
                   to His servants to meet the emergency. 'It shall be given you,'
                   says Jesus, 'in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye
                   that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.'
                   As the Spirit of God illuminates the minds of His servants, the
                   truth will be presented in its divine power and
                   preciousness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 354.

       THE SPIRIT'S
         GUIDANCE     "Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
                    Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for
                    the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
                    And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
                    not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he
                    came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents
                    brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the
                    law, then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and
                    said, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, ac-
                    cording to thy word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation"
                    (Luke 2:25-30).

                        Simeon enjoyed such an intimate relationship with God that
                      the Spirit told him to go to the temple on the day the child Jesus
                      was being dedicated. From among the several boys who were
                      being dedicated to God that day he was led to choose Jesus.
                      The officiating priest did not recognize Jesus as the promised
                      Messiah, since He was not susceptible to the promptings of the
                      Spirit. But Simeon recognized Him because God showed him
                      who was "the Lord's Christ." Some of the other boys whom
                      Simeon bypassed might also have been born in Bethlehem as
                      the firstborn child to mothers who were of the tribe of Judah.
                      But only Simeon's intimate acquaintance and communion with
                      God through the Spirit enabled Him to interpret the factual
                      prophetic pieces of information and recognize in Jesus the
                      Promised One of God. Simeon—like Abraham centuries
                      earlier—knew his Master's voice.

                        Who, on the same occasion, recognized in the baby Jesus
                      the coming Messiah? Luke 2:36-38.

                        "Anna also, a prophetess, came in and confirmed Simeon's
                      testimony concerning Christ. As Simeon spoke, her face lighted
                      up with the glory of God, and she poured out her heartfelt
                      thanks that she had been permitted to behold Christ the

      THE SPIRIT shew it unto you" (John 16:14).
         GUIDES
       TO JESUS    The work and purpose of the Spirit is Christocentric. He does
                 not call attention to Himself, but He directs the attention of all to
                 Jesus. The litmus test of any alleged workings of the Spirit in
                 believers or organizations is the place they accord Jesus. If they
                 call attention to and glorify self or man, and even magnify man's
                 spiritual experience, they lack the insignia of the Spirit.

                     What are we admonished to do with spirits that confront us
                   as Christians? 1 John 4:1.

                     A Christian must not accept every spiritual activity or spirit as
                   coming from God. A Christian must not be gullible. There are
                   other spirits, and God has made provision that a Christian will
                   be able to distinguish between the spirits. This is one of the gifts
                   of the Spirit according to First Corinthians 12:10. To verify that a
                   prompting is of the Spirit, it must be tested by the Word. The
                   Spirit never leads contrary to the Word.
                      "Even the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is to be tested
                   by the Word of God. The Spirit which inspired the Scriptures,
                   always leads to the Scriptures."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p.
                   43.

                     Whom does the Spirit glorify? John 16:13 (middle part);
                   15:26 (last part).

                     The Spirit was not to present His own ideas or notions, but
                   only what Jesus taught. Jesus said, "He shall receive of mine,
                   and shall shew it unto you" (John 16:14).
                      Being the Spirit of truth, He will especially bear witness to
                   Jesus, who is the truth. (See John 14:6.) And it is only through
                   the Spirit's speaking directly to our hearts that we ever come to
                   a true and living knowledge of Jesus Christ. (See 1 Cor. 12:3.)

THINK IT THROUGH      The Spirit's objective is to turn the attention of men and
                    women to Jesus and to glorify Him. Whose glory are you and I
                    seeking?

                     Concerning the statement in John 16:14 that reads "He [the
                   Spirit] shall glorify me," Ellen G. White says: "In these words
                   Christ declares the crowning work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit
                   glorifies Christ by making Him the object of supreme regard,
                   and the Saviour becomes the delight, the rejoicing, of the

            IS LIFE
                       The only way Christ can live in man is through His Spirit. Jesus
                    infiltrates our minds by the Holy Spirit. The operations of God, in
                    and for man, are through His Spirit.

                        Since our new life was brought about by the Word, how does
                      the Spirit design it to be sustained? 1 Peter 2:2.

                         Physical life cannot be sustained without food. Neither can
                      spiritual life be sustained without nourishment. Man's spiritual
                      food is the Word accompanied to the heart by the Spirit. To gain
                      spiritual strength we must of necessity "eat," read and study,
                      the Word through the Spirit's guidance. Its principles will then

                      begin to react spontaneously to situations and make daily life
                      decisions in conformity with its divinely inspired teachings.
                      Because the Spirit lives and rules within us in accordance with
                      His teachings in the Word, it can be said that "the Bible and the
                      soul were made one for the other."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the
                      Times, August 20, 1894.
                         No man can have insight into the word of God without the
                      illumination of the Holy Spirit. . . .

                         Since we were born into the kindgom of God as babes, what
                      is God's—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit's—desire for us?

                     Through what means or medium does the Spirit impart to us
                   this new divine life? John 6:63 (second part).

                      Today's English Version renders this text as follows: "What

                   words I have spoken to you bring God's life-giving Spirit." The
                   truths spoken by Jesus, received into the heart by faith through
                   the ministry of the Spirit, constitute the reception of spiritual

                   of the word of God is the power, the very life of God, by which
                   the command may be fulfilled and the promise realized. He who
                   by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
                   of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 38.

                     How did Jesus reinforce the concept that life is in His word?
                   John 12:50 (first part).

                     This phrase in The New English Bible is rendered: "I know
                   that his commands are eternal life."
                     "Eternal life is the receiving of the living elements in the
                   Scriptures and doing the will of God. This is eating the flesh and
                   drinking the blood of the Son of God. To those who do this, life
                   and immortality are brought to light through the gospel, for
                   God's Word is verity and truth, spirit and life.... The Holy Spirit's
                   influence renders that Word, the Bible, an immortal truth, which
                   to the prayerful searcher gives spiritual sinew and muscle.

                     "The creative energy that called the worlds into existence is in
                   the word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life. Every

      "BORN OF thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
     THE SPIRIT" of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born
                 when he Is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's
                 womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto
                 thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
                 cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the
                 flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"
                 (John 3:3-6).

                     The new birth is a regeneration and a partaking of the divine
                   nature. The divine nature is imparted or mediated by the Spirit
                   through the Word. "Born again" in John 3 in its deepest mean-
                   ing really means "born from above." Regeneration is therefore
                   not our natural life brought up to the highest level of attainment,
                   but rather divine life imparted to us "who were dead in tres-
                   passes and sins" (Eph. 2:1).
                     "Nicodemus had come to the Lord thinking to enter into a
                   discussion with Him, but Jesus laid bare the foundation princi-

                     According to Paul's letter to Titus, how is this new life
                   brought about? Titus 3:5.

                     "Every time a soul is converted, and learns to love God and
                   keep His commandments, the promise of God is fulfilled, 'A new

                   Ezek. 36:26. The change in human hearts, the transformation of
                   human characters, is a miracle that reveals an ever-living
                   Saviour, working to rescue souls. A consistent life in Christ is a
                   great miracle. In the preaching of the word of God, the sign that

                   the old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self

          Part 4     "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
        THE NEW    things are passed away; behold, all things are become new"
            LIFE   (2 Cor. 5:17).

                     How does man become a new creature? Rom. 8:9-11.

                     "To the heart that has become purified, all is changed. Trans-
                   formation of character is the testimony to the world of an in-
                   dwelling Christ. The Spirit of God produces a new life in the
                   soul, bringing the thoughts and desires into obedience to the
                   will of Christ; and the inward man is renewed in the image of
                   God. Weak and erring men and women show to the world that
                   the redeeming power of grace can cause the faulty character to
                   develop into symmetry and abundant fruitfulness."—Prophets
                   and Kings, p. 233.

                     What does man possess through Jesus? 1 John 5:11, 12.

                      Christians now possess eternal life. Late one evening Father
                   returned from a trip. Five-year-old Tom eagerly waited for Fa-
                   ther's return. As usual Father brought a little gift for each child.
                   For Tom, Dad had a big red apple and told Tom so. Almost
                   immediately after Dad had told the children about their gifts,
                   tired Tom went to bed.
                      The next morning Tom got up and started happily telling his
                   brothers and sisters that he had an apple. But so far his father
                   had not given it to him. Johnny, about 12 years old, decided to
                   tease his little brother, so he said to him, "You don't have any
                   apple. If you do have one, show it to me." Tom got a little ruffled,
                   but he still insisted he had an apple. Finally, when his brother
                   did not stop teasing and annoying him, Tom went to his father
                   and asked, "John says I have no apple, but, Daddy, don't I have
                   an apple?" His father assured him that he did have an apple.
                      All committed believers are possessors of eternal life through
                   Jesus. "The Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the
                   beginning of the life eternal."—The Desire of Ages, p. 388.
                      "Those who seek Christ in His true character have within
                   them the elements of everlasting life, because they are partak-
                   ers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruptions that are

          Part 5     "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
        NEW LIFE   free from the law of sin and death" (Rom. 8:2).
       OUSTS SIN      It is only through the indwelling of the Spirit that man is
                   delivered from sin and preserved from eternal death.
                      "If his [God's] Spirit abides in the heart, sin cannot dwell
                   there. . . .
                      "Let us open the door of our hearts, that Jesus may come in
                   and that sin may go out."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald,
                   March 16, 1886.
                      Some leafy trees stubbornly retain their faded leaves
                   throughout the long winter. But with spring the sap begins to
                   flow. As it ascends the trunk and pushes out into every branch
                   and tiny twig, it crowds off the dead leaves which have clung to
                   the tree throughout the long winter despite frost and storms. So
                   does the Spirit within us, when allowed full control, subdue and
                   expel sin from our nature.

                     How only may we have this eternal or new life within us?
                   1 John 5:12.
                     It is only through the Spirit that we have the Son. "Through
                   the Spirit, Christ was to abide continually in the hearts of His
                   children."—Steps to Christ, p. 75.

                     If Christ does not abide in man through the Spirit, what
                   possesses him? Rom 7:20.
                     There is no more possibility of a vacuum in the human heart
                   than there is in nature or the physical world. Nature will of
                   necessity hastily fill a vacuum. That is the way hurricanes, tor-
                   nadoes, and typhoons arise.

                     What parable did Jesus tell to show the spiritual disaster of
                   not letting the Spirit fill our hearts and lives? Matt. 12:43-45.
                      "The parable of the man from whom an evil spirit had been
                   cast out, who did not fill the soul with the love of Christ, illus-
                   trates the necessity of not only emptying the heart, but of sup-
                   plying the vacuum with the divine occupant.... It is not enough
                   to make the heart empty; we must have the vacuum filled with
                   the love of God. The soul must be furnished with the graces of
                   the Spirit of God. We may leave off many bad habits, and yet not
                   be truly sanctified, because we do not have a connection with
                   God. We must unite with Christ."—Ellen G. White, Review and
                   Herald, January 24, 1893.

                 the agency of the Holy Spirit (see John 16:8). Herein lies the
                 difference between the ineffective righteousness man seeks
                 through works and the effective righteousness that comes
                 through faith. In the former the Spirit has no part, for the effort is
                 purely human and thus independent of divine grace."—SDA

                    The means employed by God for effecting this transformation
                 is the Word made fruitful through the ministry of the Spirit.
                 "Higher education is an experimental knowledge of the plan of
                 salvation, and this knowledge is secured by earnest and diligent
                 study of the Scriptures. Such an education will renew the mind
                 and transform the character, restoring the image of God in the
                 soul."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 11.

                       Whom has God in His foreknowledge ordained that we
                     should be like? Rom. 8:29.

                       God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:27). It still is His
                     purpose that His plan be fulfilled.
                       "As they [God's people] feed upon His word, they find that it is
                     spirit and life. The word destroys the natural, earthly nature, and
                     imparts a new life in Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit comes to the
                     soul as a Comforter. By the transforming agency of His grace,
                     the image of God is reproduced in the disciple; he becomes a
                     new creature. Love takes the place of hatred, and the heart
                     receives the divine similitude."—The Desire of Ages, p. 391.

                        What is God's plan for man through sanctification and how
                     is it to be accomplished? 2 Peter 1:4; Rom. 15:16.

                        Sanctification is the impartation of God's own nature to all
                     who are born again. The mind, feelings, and will of all of us have
                     been perverted by sin. Through the new birth and sanctification
                     our natures are changed into conformity with the will of God
                     because His Spirit has become our spirit. (See 1 Cor. 2:10-12.)
                        "He [God] is able to take those who are dead in trespasses

       MAN CREATED created he him; male and female created he them" (Gen.
     IN GOD'S IMAGE 1:27).

                      Although man was created in God's own image, it did not
                    mean that he could not grow spiritually. His character was to
                    grow and develop.
                      "When Adam came from the Creator's hand, he bore, in his
                    physical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker.
                    'God created man in His own image' (Genesis 1:27), and it was
                    His purpose that the longer man lived the more fully he should
                    reveal this image—the more fully reflect the glory of the Creator.
                    All his faculties were capable of development; their capacity
                    and vigor were continually to increase."—Education, p. 15.

                    this say about the reason why God created man?

                       "Infinite love—how great it is! God made the world to enlarge
                    heaven. He desires a larger family of created intelligences."—

                    1081.
                       According to God's plan, children are conceived as the result
                    of love between husband and wife. Man in the beginning also
                    came into existence because of God's love. Parents who al-
                    ready have several children of their own sometimes adopt
                    another child because they wish another person to share and
                    enjoy their happiness.
                       God probably has many worlds throughout the immensity of
                    space inhabited by happy, peaceful, intelligent beings. But He
                    wished to enlarge His family; He desired more free-willed intel-
                    ligences to share His and their joy. Thus He created Adam and
                    Eve and endowed them with procreative powers that the whole
                    earth might ultimately be populated.

                      What did God give Adam and Eve as a perpetuator of life
                    and happiness? Gen. 2:9.

                      "The tree of life is a representation of the preserving care of
                    Christ for His children. As Adam and Eve ate of this tree, they
                    acknowledged their dependence upon God. The tree of life
                    possessed the power to perpetuate life, and as long as they ate
                    of it, they could not die."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

The Restorer
of the Image of God in Man           LESSON 11                       ❑ Monday
                                                                    December 11
         Part 2   "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
     MAN'S FREE obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin
        CHOICE unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?" (Rom.
                6:16).

                     This text presents a sobering thoUght. We may not often
                   think, or like to admit, that we are servants or slaves; neverthe-
                   less the Scriptures reveal to us that we are, and we each choose
                   whom we serve. Am I a servant of lust, of appetite, of sinful
                   thoughts? Or do I choose to serve God? I may learn what I am
                   by examining my thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and actions.

                    How did Satan make first Eve and then Adam his servants?
                   Gen. 3:1-6.

                     Through eating of the forbidden fruit the status of Adam and
                   Eve changed from being stewards of the garden under God to
                   being servants of Satan. By obeying Satan they surrendered to
                   him their God-entrusted stewardship. From now on Adam, the
                   son of God (according to Luke 3:38), no longer represented this
                   earth in the Congress of the Universe. As it convened, Satan, to
                   whom Adam had yielded his rulership, took his place with the
                   other sons of God. (See Job. 1:6, 7.)
                     "Through yielding to satanic influences, men will be trans-
                   formed into fiends; and those who were created in the image of
                   God, who were formed to honor and glorify their Creator, will
                   become the habitation of dragons, and Satan will see in an
                   apostate race his masterpiece of evil—men who reflect his own
                   image."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 7, p. 974.

THINK IT THROUGH     Through my moment-by-moment choices I Indicate whose
                   servant I am. Am I a servant of the evil one following his
                   suggestions, or am I a servant of God following His will?

                     "In the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No exter-
                   nal force is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of God,
                   man is left free to choose whom he will serve. In the change that
                   takes place when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is the
                   highest sense of freedom. The expulsion of sin is the act of the
                   soul itself. True, we have no power to free ourselves from Sa-
                   tan's control; but when we desire to be set free from sin, and in
                   our great need cry out for a power out of and above ourselves,
                   the powers of the soul are imbued with the divine energy of the
                   Holy Spirit, and they obey the dictates of the will in fulfilling the
                   will of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 466.

           Part 3     What was God's intended purpose for man's existence?
      CREATED TO
     GLORIFY GOD      "I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I
                    have made him" (Isa. 43:7).

                       God created Adam and Eve that they and their posterity might
                    bring glory to His name. "Vast was the scope offered for their
                    exercise, glorious the field opened to their research. The mys-
                    teries of the visible universe—the 'wondrous works of Him
                    which is perfect in knowledge' (Job. 37:16)—invited man's
                    study. Face-to-face, heart-to-heart communion with his Maker
                    was his high privilege. Had he remained loyal to God, all this
                    would have been his forever. Throughout eternal ages he would
                    have continued to gain new treasures of knowledge, to discover
                    fresh springs of happiness, and to obtain clearer conceptions of
                    the wisdom, the power, and the love of God. More and more fully
                    would he have fulfilled the object of his creation, more and more
                    fully have reflected the Creator's glory."—Education, p. 15.

                      What does the revelator indicate as being one of God's
                    purposes for man's creation? Rev. 4:11.

                       The only way man can bring God pleasure is for man to fulfill
                    the purpose for which God created him. And, since the Fall, this
                     purpose can be achieved only through the Spirit.
                       "The whole heart must be yielded to God, or the change can
                    never be wrought in us by which we are to be restored to His
                    likeness. By nature we are alienated from God. The Holy Spirit
                    describes our condition in such words as these. 'Dead in tres-
                    passes and sins;' the whole head is sick, and the whole heart
                    faint;' no soundness in it.' We are held fast in the snare of
                    Satan; 'taken captive by him at his will.' Ephesians 2:1; Isaiah
                    1:5, 6; 2 Timothy 2:26. God desires to heal us, to set us free. But
                    since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our
                    whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him."—Steps
                    to Christ, p. 43.

THINK IT THROUGH      In the sunset hours of earth's history, what is still God's
                    purpose for man? (See Rev. 14:7.) How are we daily to relate to
                    this as members of God's family on earth?

                       "Created to be 'the image and glory of God' (1 Corinthians
                    11:7), Adam and Eve had received endowments not unworthy of
                    their high destiny. . . . They bore in outward resemblance the
                    likeness of their Maker. Nor was this likeness manifest in the
                    physical nature only. Every faculty of mind and soul reflected
                    the Creator's glory."—Education, p. 20.

The Restorer
of the Image of God in Man          LESSON 11                .   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  December 13
          Part 4   What does the parable of the tares teach about how Satan
        SATAN'S tries to nullify God's plan?
       PURPOSE
       FOR MAN     "Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The king-
                 dom of heaven Is likened unto a man which sowed good seed
                 in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed
                 tares among the wheat, and went his way" (Matt. 13:24, 25).

                     (Read also verses 26-30, 36-43.)
                     "As soon as the Lord through Jesus Christ created our world,
                   and placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, Satan an-
                   nounced his purpose to conform to his own nature the father
                   and mother of all humanity, and to unite them with his own
                   ranks of rebellion. He was determined to efface the image of
                   God from the human posterity, and to trace his own image upon
                   the soul in place of the divine image."—Ellen G. White, Review
                   and Herald, April 14, 1896.
                      There will be tares. Not because God wills it, but because
                   Satan wills it, and men have chosen to follow Satan's design. It
                   is not God's will that tares exist, but man's choice.

                      In the parable of the four soils, what is taught about the good
                   seed and the stands of wheat among the thorns? Matt. 13:
                   7, 22.

                      Although wheat has been sown and sprouted and started
                   growing, the garden of the heart demands constant cultivation
                   lest the wheat be choked. Classified among the thorns is one
                   that is particularly deceptive and dangerous to diligent
                   Seventh-day Adventists—the cares of this life. This is a respect-
                   able virtue. But, unless it is weeded out, it may become a thorn
                   of destruction to spiritual life.
                      "The thorns of sin will grow in any soil; they need no cultiva-
                   tion; but grace must be carefully cultivated. The briers and
                   thorns are always ready to spring up, and the work of purifica-
                   tion must advance continually. If the heart is not kept under the
                   control of God, if the Holy Spirit does not work unceasingly to
                    refine and ennoble the character, the old habits will reveal
                   themselves in the life."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 50.

                   can be done to eliminate them?

                      "The Lord does not now work to bring many souls into the
                   truth, because of the church members who have never been
                   converted and those who were once converted but who have

                                                                     December 14
             Part 5   "God said, Let us make man in our Image, after our likeness:
       GOD'S HONOR and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
          AT STAKE the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth,
                    and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth"
                    (Gen. 1:26).

                        God did not merely purpose to make man in His image; He did
                      actually make him in His likeness. Genesis 5:1 adds: "In the day
                      that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him."
                        At the completion of His creative work God looked upon what
                      He had done and declared it "very good"—including man. But it
                      did not remain such. Through Satan's machinations it deterior-
                      ated to the point that God is said to have "repented" that He had
                      brought the world and man into existence. (See Gen. 6:6.)


                        How did Jesus in His teaching express the thought that a
                      man should count the cost of a project before he launches out
                      on it? Luke 14:28-32.

                         Before God created man as a free-willed being, He counted
                      the cost. Free will on the part of an intelligent creature em-
                      braced the possibility of his departing from the Creator's plan.
                      God knew this. And He made adequate preparation for the
                      remedy of such a disastrous possibility. His honor is involved in

                        When the plan of salvation is completed and Jesus comes
                     to gather His own, what will the result be as far as God's glory
                     is concerned? 2 Thess. 1:10.

                     would send into the world, that changes our character into the
                     image of Christ; and when this is accomplished, we reflect, as in
                     a mirror, the glory of the Lord."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                     "The old nature, born of blood and the will of the flesh, cannot
                   inherit the kingdom of God. The old ways, the hereditary tend-

                   inherited. The new birth consists in having new motives, new
                   tastes, new tendencies. Those who are begotten unto a new life
                   by the Holy Spirit, have become partakers of the divine nature,
                   and in all their habits and practices they will give evidence of
                   their relationship to Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

                     Characterwise how is this new nature revealed? Eph. 4:24.

                   hands of God. In this newness of life he has acquired a new set
                   of standards. He no longer judges things by the standards the
                   world uses."—William Barclay, The Letters to the Corinthians

                   force or self-interest, but by love, they show the working of an
                   influence that is above every human influence. Where this one-
                   ness exists, it is evidence that the image of God is being re-
                   stored in humanity, that a new principle of life has been im-

12/The Sin
Against the
Holy Spirit
LESSON 12 December 17-23     Sin is alien to the plan of God. Its
                           essence is separation from God. This
                           was illustrated in the experience of
                           Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

                       "They gathered themselves together against Moses and
                     against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon
                     you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them,
                     and the Lord is among them: wherefore then lift ye up your-
                     selves above the congregation of the Lord?" (Num. 16:3).

                       The Israelites forgot that their real leader was Christ Himself.
                     Moses was only His adjutant, carrying out His orders in leading
                     His people.

                      What was the final fate of the rebels after they had resisted
                     Moses' appeal to repentance? Num. 16:28-33.

                        "Moses made no effort at self-vindication. He solemnly ap-
                     pealed to God, in the presence of the congregation, as a witness
                     to the purity of his motives and the uprightness of his conduct,
                     and implored Him to be his judge."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     p. 399.

                     But their stubborn persistence sealed their doom."—Patriarchs
                     and Prophets, p. 401.

THINK IT THROUGH       Have I ever criticized a leader because I aspired to his
                     position? This incident from the history of Israel shows Its
                     danger.

                       "Korah and his companions rejected light until they became
                     so blinded that the most striking manifestations of His [God's]
                     power were not sufficient to convince them; they attributed
                     them all to human or satanic agency. . . . It was this act that
                     sealed their doom. They had committed the sin against the Holy
                     Spirit, a sin by which man's heart is effectually hardened against
                     the influence of divine grace.... It is through the agency of the
                     Holy Spirit that God communicates with man; and those who
                     deliberately reject this agency as satanic, have cut off the chan-
                     nel of communication between the soul and Heaven.
                       "God works by the manifestation of His Spirit to reprove and
                     convict the sinner; and if the Spirit's work is finally rejected,
                     there is no more that God can do for the soul."—Patriarchs and

           Part 2     "And it was so, that when he [Saul] had turned his back to go
       KING SAUL    from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs
                    came to pass that day. And when they came thither to the hill,
                    behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God
                    came upon him, and he prophesied among them" (1 Sam.
                    10:9, 10).

                       "As Saul united with the prophets in their worship, a great
                    change was wrought in him by the Holy Spirit. The light of divine
                    purity and holiness shone in upon the darkness of the natural
                    heart. He saw himself as he was before God. He saw the beauty
                    of holiness. He was now called to begin the warfare against sin
                    and Satan, and he was made to feel that in this conflict his
                    strength must come wholly from God. . . . The Lord endowed
                    him with courage and wisdom for his high station. He revealed
                    to him the Source of strength and grace, and enlightened his
                    understanding as to the divine claims and his own duty."—

                       In a later crisis when Samuel failed to appear, what preroga-
                    tive did Saul usurp? 1 Sam. 13:8, 9.

                      "With growing impatience he awaited the arrival of Samuel
                    and attributed the confusion and distress and desertion of his
                    army to the absence of the prophet. The appointed time came,
                    but the man of God did not immediately appear. God's provi-
                    dence had detained His servant. But Saul's restless, impulsive
                    spirit would no longer be restrained. Feeling that something
                    must be done to calm the fears of the people, he determined to
                    summon an assembly for religious service, and by sacrifice
                    entreat the divine aid."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 618.

                      To what did Saul's rebelliousness finally lead? 1 Sam. 16:14.


THINK IT THROUGH      Do I personally neglect God's warnings and reproofs? How
                    long can this go on until it becomes irreversible?

                      "It is a perilous step to slight the reproofs and warnings of
                    God's word or of His Spirit. Many, like Saul, yield to temptation
                    until they become blind to the true character of sin. They flatter
                    themselves that they have had some good object in view, and
                    have done no wrong in departing from the Lord's requirements.
                    Thus they do despite to the Spirit of grace, until its voice is no

      THE JEWISH hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out
        LEADERS devils" (Mark 3:22).

                     (Read also verses 23-27 and Matthew 12:24-28.)
                       "Christ told them [the Pharisees] plainly that in attributing the
                   work of the Holy Spirit to Satan, they were cutting themselves
                   off from the fountain of blessing. Those who had spoken
                   against Jesus Himself, not discerning His divine character,
                   might receive forgiveness; for through the Holy Spirit they
                   might be brought to see their error and repent. Whatever the sin,
                   if the soul repents and believes, the guilt is washed away in the
                   blood of Christ; but he who rejects the work of the Holy Spirit is
                   placing himself where repentance and faith cannot come to
                   him."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 321, 322.

                      What did Jesus warn them that they might do if they con-
                   tinued to attribute His work to Satan? Mark 3:28-30; Matthew
                   12:31, 32.
                      According to the words of Jesus recorded here, those who
                   reject increasingly clear evidence of His divinity and falsely
                   attribute it to the power of the devil, by choosing their own
                   course of action rather than the divine, will commit blasphemy
                   against the Holy Spirit.
                      "It is by the Spirit that God works upon the heart; when men
                   willfully reject the Spirit, and declare It to be from Satan, they
                   cut off the channel by which God can communicate with them.
                   When the Spirit is finally rejected, there is no more that God can
                   do for the soul."— The Desire of Ages, p. 322

THINK IT THROUGH      What Is my usual response as I feel or hear the promptings
                   of the Spirit in my soul?
                      "The Pharisees to whom Jesus spoke this warning did not

                   was not one of those dignitaries but had felt drawn toward the
                   Saviour. They had heard the Spirit's voice in their own hearts
                   declaring Him to be the Anointed of Israel, and urging them to
                   confess themselves His disciples. In the light of His presence
                   they had realized their unholiness, and had longed for a righ-
                   teousness which they could not create. But after their rejection
                   of Him it would be too humiliating to receive Him as the Mes-

                   followed them, and they had to build up many barriers in order
                   to withstand its power. The mightiest agency that can be

                                                                    December 20
          Pad 4   "Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to Ile
     ANANIAS AND to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the
       SAPPHIRA land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it
                was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou con-
                ceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men,
                but unto God" (Acts 5:3, 4).

                    What had Ananias done to bring about Peter's accusation?
                   Acts 5:1, 2.

                      "Deep conviction had rested upon all present, and under the
                   direct influence of the Spirit of God, Ananias and Sapphira had
                   made a pledge to give to the Lord the proceeds from the sale of
                   certain property."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 71, 72.

                     Did the sin consist in withholding part of the sales price or in
                   pretending to give all, when they only gave part? Acts 5:4 (last
                   part).

                     "God hates hypocrisy and falsehood. Ananias and Sapphira
                   practiced fraud in their dealing with God; they lied to the Holy
                   Spirit, and their sin was visited with swift and terrible
                   judgment."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 72.

                     Were there others who also resisted the Spirit in the days of
                   the apostles? Acts 7:51.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is there any unreprented sin in my life that the Spirit is
                   pointing out? If so, what should I do about it?

                     The Spirit enables men to recognize God's truth when it
                   enters their lives. But if a man refuses to respond to any God-
                   given insight he will ultimately lose it, just as the blind cave fish
                   has lost it's sight from living in the dark.
                     There is one condition of forgiveness and that is repentance.
                   "But if a man, by repeated refusals of God's guidance, has lost
                   the ability to recognize goodness when he sees it, if he has got
                   his moral values inverted until evil to him is good and good to
                   him is evil, then, even when he is confronted by Jesus, he is
                   conscious of no sin; he cannot repent and therefore he can
                   never be forgiven. That is the sin against the Holy Spirit."—

           Part 5     "The Son of man Is come to seek and to save that which was
   JESUS CAME TO    lost" (Luke 19:10).
      FORGIVE SIN
                       Jesus left His home above and came down to earth because
                    He knew that man, if left to himself, was hopelessly and irre-
                    trievably lost. There was no hope for him apart from a divine
                    Saviour. Jesus came to save sinners.
                       Jesus' great power to save is illustrated in the case of Mary
                    Magdalene. Luke 7:36-38; John 11:2. (See The Desire of Ages,
                    pp. 568, 788.)
                       "Simon questioned whether the Saviour were a prophet. Be-
                    cause Christ allowed this woman to approach Him, because He
                    did not indignantly spurn her as one whose sins were too great
                    to be forgiven, because He did not show that He realized she
                    had fallen, Simon was tempted to think that He was not a
                    prophet. Jesus knows nothing of this woman who is so free in
                    her demonstrations, he thought, or He would not allow her to
                    touch Him."—The Desire of Ages, p. 566.

                      How widely was a knowledge of this woman's salvation to
                    be broadcast? Matt. 26:13; Mark 14:9.

                       "When to human eyes her case appeared hopeless, Christ
                    saw in Mary capabilities for good. lie saw the better traits of her
                    character. The plan of redemption has invested humanity with
                    great possibilities, and in Mary these possibilities were to be
                    realized. Through His grace she became a partaker of the divine
                    nature. The one who had fallen, and whose mind had been a
                    habitation of demons, was brought very near to the Saviour in
                    fellowship and ministry.... Mary stood beside the cross, and
                    followed Him to the sepulcher. Mary was first at the tomb after
                    His resurrection. It was Mary who first proclaimed a risen
                    Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, p. 568.

                      Which promises especially emphasize Jesus' ability to save
                    to the uttermost? 1 John 1:9; Heb. 7:25; 1 Cor. 6:9-11.

                       The commission of crime or sin is no permanent obstacle to
                    salvation. Jesus can save anyone who is willing to accept salva-
                    tion. He is not primarily concerned with anyone's dismal past.
                    Any sin and shortcoming may be blotted out through His shed
                    blood.

The Sin Against the Holy Spirit            LESSON 12                     ❑ Friday
                                                                      December 22
            Part 6     What has God in His mercy provided so that a sinner might
   CONVICTION OF     recognize his sinfulness?
   SIN NECESSARY
                       "When he [the Spirit] comes, he will convince the world of
                     sin and of righteousness and of judgment: of sin, because
                     they do not believe in me" (John 16:8, 9, RSV).

                       In order to qualify as a candidate for salvation, a person must
                     recognize that he is a sinner. No person asks for help of the
                     Saviour unless he senses his need. One of our greatest needs is
                     a personal conviction of sin. Man cannot bring this about; it is
                     the Spirit's prerogative and office work to convict men of sin.
                     His very first work is to make the sinner aware of his sinfulness,
                     and hence his lost condition. The Spirit is not merely the Com-
                     forter. He is also—and first—the Convictor of sin. He becomes
                     the Comforter to those who have made peace with God by
                     admitting and confessing their sins.

                       What dramatic illustration demonstrates the Spirit's power
                     to convince of sin? Luke 19:8, 9.

                       How did Jesus illustrate the availability of salvation for a
                     contrite sinner, while at the same time pointing out the
                     hopelessness of a person who thinks he is righteous? Luke
                     18:10-14.

                       "We must have a knowledge of ourselves, a knowledge that
                     will result in contrition, before we can find pardon and peace.
                     The Pharisee felt no conviction of sin. The Holy Spirit could not
                     work with him. His soul was encased in a self-righteous armor
                     which the arrows of God, barbed and true-aimed by angel
                     hands, failed to penetrate. It is only he who knows himself to be
                     a sinner that Christ can save."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 158.
                       When a person receives a vision of the righteousness and
                     holiness of God, like the prophet Isaiah (see Isa. 6: 5, 6), then he
                     also becomes convinced that he is sinful, and nothing but
                     judgment and utter destruction will await him in the presence of
                     a holy God unless Jesus intervenes to save him.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do you ever pray for the Spirit to convict you of sin?

                        "He who rejects the work of the Holy Spirit is placing himself
                     where repentance and faith cannot come to him."—The Desire

                        "Every impure thought defiles the soul, impairs the moral
                     sense, and tends to obliterate the impressions of the Holy
                     Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, p. 302.

     AND UNDER
     THE JUDGES     Moses was a prophet, and a great prophet. At times God
                  spoke to him face-to-face (see Num. 12:7, 8), as when He gave
                  him the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. But probably the
                  major portions of the Pentateuch—the first five books of the
                  Bible—and Job were given to Moses in the same way that God
                  customarily spoke to the other prophets.

                     How did God ordinarily speak toPthe prophets? 2 Peter 1:21.

                      The Scriptures were given through the agency of the Spirit. (It
                   is interesting to note, however, that in Hebrews 1:1 prophetic
                   inspiration is attributed to God. This is another indication that
                   God and the Spirit are one in purpose, mind, and motive.)

                     What did the Spirit specifically do at the time of the Exodus?
                   Ex. 31:3.

                     "The Holy Spirit would impart to Bezaleel . . . discernment,
                   sound judgment, and discretion. In addition he was to receive
                   additional skill in 'workmanship.' "—SDA Bible Commentary,
                   vol, 1, p. 661.

                     In what did the Spirit-ministry especially consist during the
                   time of the judges? Judges 3:10.

                     God gives through the Spirit the specific gift needed for the
                   accomplishment of His work among men. During the Exodus
                   craftsmen needed manual skill for the building of the taberna-
                   cle. During the time of the judges God's people, and especially
                   their leaders, needed courage. Israel was oppressed and the
                   people were discouraged. Thus the need for Israel and their
                   leaders at this particular time was courage to arise and throw off
                   the yoke of the oppressors. In the seven instances where the
                   Spirit is mentioned in the book of Judges (3:10; 6:34; 11:29;
                   13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14), He imparts courage and fortitude to the
                   leaders of God's people.

THINK IT THROUGH     Can I personally go to God and ask Him for skill, ability,
                   wisdom, and courage to do my work acceptably before Him?

                     Second Timothy 1:7 in Today's English Version reads, "For
                   the Spirit that God has given us does not make us timid; instead,
                   his Spirit fills us with power, love, and self-control."

                      "Elisha asked not for worldly honor, or for a high place
                   among the great men of earth. That which he craved was a large
                   measure of the Spirit that God had bestowed so freely upon the
                   one about to be honored with translation. He knew that nothing
                   but the Spirit which had rested upon Elijah could fit him to fill
                   the place in Israel to which God had called him, and so he asked,
                   'I pray thee, let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me.' "—

                     Filled with a double portion of the Spirit, what miracles of
                   healing did Elisha perform? 2 Kings 4:32-36; 5:1, 10, 14.

                      "Like the Saviour of mankind, of whom he was a type, Elisha
                   in his ministry among men combined the work of healing with
                   that of teaching. Faithfully, untiringly, throughout his long and
                   effective labors, Elisha endeavored to foster and advance the
                   important educational work carried on by the schools of the
                   prophets. In the providence of God his words of instruction to
                   the earnest groups of young men assembled were confirmed by
                   the deep movings of the Holy Spirit, and at times by other
                   unmistakable evidences of his authority as a servant of
                   Jehovah."—Prophets and Kings, p. 240.

                     What miracle of feeding hungry people did Elisha perform in
                   a time of famine? 2 Kings 4:42-44.

                     "The lesson is for God's children in every age. When the Lord
                   gives a work to be done, let not men stop to inquire into the
                   reasonableness of the command or the probable result of their
                   efforts to obey."—Prophets and Kings, p. 243.

THINK IT THROUGH     Elisha was constantly led and enabled by the Spirit. What
                   might we do through God's enabling power, if we were fully
                   under the daily direction of the Spirit?

                     "A fuller sense of God's relationship to those whom He has
                   purchased with the gift of His Son, a greater faith in the onward
                   progress of His cause in the earth—this is the great need of the
                   church today. Let none waste time in deploring the scantiness
                   of their visible resources. The outward appearance may be
                   unpromising; but energy and trust in God will develop re-
                   sources. The gift brought to Him with thanksgiving and with
                   prayer for His blessing, He will multiply."--Prophets and Kings,
                   p. 243.

A Spirit-Directed People          LESSON 13                           ❑ Tuesday
                                                                     December 26
            Part 3   What was the apostles' relationship to the Spirit after
         THE POST- Pentecost as indicated by Peter's experience?
      PENTECOSTAL
          CHURCH     "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
                   rulers of the people, and elders of Israel" (Acts 4:8).

                      Being filled with the Spirit, what was the attitude of the early
                    Christians despite persecution unto death? Acts 4:31; 7:55-
                    60; 13:52.

                       "As priests and rulers combined against them, and they were
                    brought before councils and thrust into prison, the followers of
                    Christ rejoiced 'that they were counted worthy to suffer shame
                    for His name.' Acts 5:41. They rejoiced to prove, before men and
                    angels, that they recognized the glory of Christ, and chose to
                    follow Him at the loss of all things."—The Desire of Ages, p. 508.
                      Being filled with the Spirit, and discouragement, are mutually
                    exclusive. It is Satan who fills us with discouragements. "De-
                    spondency is sinful and unreasonable."—Prophets and Kings,
                    p. 164. God through His Spirit imparts courage.

                      What qualification was required for election to leadership in
                    the post-Pentecostal church? Acts 6:3, 5.

                      "The path of men who are placed as leaders is not an easy
                    one. But they are to see in every difficulty a call to prayer. Never
                    are they to fail of consulting the great Source of all wisdom."—
                    Prophets and Kings, p. 31.

                      How did the leaders in the post-Pentecostal church arrive at
                    decisions as to what to do? Acts 13:1, 2, 4; 15:28; 16:6, 7.

                      The post-Pentecostal church was Spirit-directed. It was the
                    Spirit that made the decisions, and the leaders accepted those
                    decisions.

                       How did the gospel spread under the direction of the Spirit-
                    filled church? Col. 1:23; Rev. 6:2.

                       "Your energy and efficiency in the upbuilding of My kingdom,
                    Jesus says, depend upon your receiving of My Spirit. You must
                    be partakers of My grace, in order to be a savor of life unto
                    life."—The Desire of Ages, p. 439.

THINK IT THROUGH      What was the reason for the rapid spread of the gospel in
                    apostolic times? Was It due to the educational attainments,
                    the financial resources, and administrative skills of the early
                    Christians, or was it the result of their willingness to be di-
                    rected by the Spirit?

                                                                    December 27

      IN THE END   "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Heb. 13:5).
            TIME
                   "The Holy Spirit is to be continually present with the believer.
                 We have need more carefully to consider the fact that the Com-
                 forter is to abide with us. If we individually comprehended this
                 truth, we should never feel alone."—The Faith 1 Live By, p. 57.

                      How does God plan to sanctify us as members of the rem-
                    nant church, and whom has God given us as a sign of His
                    ownership? 2 Thess. 2:13; 1 Thess. 4:8.

                      "Christ ... can and will, if we submit to Him, fill the chambers
                    of the mind and the recesses of the soul with His Spirit. Then our
                    will will be in perfect harmony with the Divine will. Our spirit and
                    will may be so identified with His Spirit and will that in thought
                    and aim we shall be one with Him."—Our High Calling, p. 219.

                      How long will the Spirit and His gifts remain among the
                    believers? Eph. 4:10-13.

                      "To the end of time the presence of the Spirit is to abide with
                    the true church."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 55.

                      What special help is provided for us as we face our great
                    enemy in the final battle? Eph. 6:11, 12.

                      "The Holy Spirit, the representative of the Captain of the
                    Lord's host, comes down to direct the battle. Our infirmities may
                    be many, our sins and mistakes grievous; but the grace of God is
                    for all who seek it with contrition. The power of Omnipotence is
                    enlisted in behalf of those who trust in God."—The Desire of
                    Ages, p. 352.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can I be assured so that, in the crisis hours just before
                    us, I can enjoy the Spirit's minute directions?

                      "The time has come when we must expect the Lord to do
                    great things for us. Our efforts must not flag or weaken. We are
                    to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord. Before the
                    work is closed up and the sealing of God's people is finished, we
                    shall receive the outpouring of the Spirit of God. Angels from
                    heaven will be in our midst. The present is a fitting-up time for
                    heaven when we must walk in full obedience to all the com-
                    mands of God."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 111.

A Spirit-Directed People         LESSON 13                             ❑ Thursday
                                                                      December 28
          Part 5   "Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
      THE LATTER Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
           RAIN to every one grass in the field" (Zech. 10:1).

                      The terms "rain," "early rain," and "latter rain" were bor-
                   rowed by the Hebrew writers from their agricultural seasons.
                   The former or early rain fell in the seventh month, usually just
                   after the Feast of Tabernacles. This corresponds to our autumn
                   or to September-October. For the Israelites it was the season for
                   the plowing of the fields and the sowing of barley and wheat.
                   The latter rain fell shortly before the grain harvest in March and
                   early April. This rain enabled the grain to fill out and ripen for
                   harvest.
                      These terms are used by the Bible writers to symbolize great
                   periods of spiritual refreshing in connection with the preaching
                   of the gospel.
                      "Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of
                   spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming
                   of the Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the
                   falling of the latter rain."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 55.
                     "The latter rain, ripening earth's harvest, represents the
                   spiritual grace that prepares the church for the coming of the
                   Son of man. But unless the former rain has fallen, there will be
                   no life."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 506.

                     What prophecy did Peter refer to as being fulfilled at Pente-
                   cost? Acts 2:16-18. (See also Joel 2:28, 29.)

                      "The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was the
                   'former rain,' and glorious was the result. But the 'latter rain' will
                   be more abundant."—The Desire of Ages, p. 827.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I expecting the latter rain to fall on me Just as a shower of
                   rain; or do I believe that something on my part is required to
                   attract it to me personally?

                      "Unless we are daily advancing in the exemplification of the
                   active Christian virtues, we shall not recognize the manifesta-
                   tions of the Holy Spirit in the latter rain. It may be falling on
                   hearts all around us, but we shall not discern or receive it"—
                   Testimonies to Ministers, p. 507.
                      "He who does nothing, but waits to be compelled by some
                   supernatural agency, will wait on in lethargy and darkness."—

         Part 6   "Repent therefore, and turn again [be converted, KJV], that
       THE LOUD your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may
           CRY come from the presence of the Lord" (Acts 3:19, RSV).

                      "Peter's statement (v. 19), taken as a whole, contains a most
                   definite temporal element. Evidently, Peter, speaking by inspi-
                   ration, and thus beyond his own finite understanding, is refer-
                   ring, tersely, to two great events of earth's last days—(1) the
                   mighty outpouring of God's Spirit, and (2) the final blotting out
                   of the sins of the righteous—which are tied to a third climactic
                   event, the second advent of Christ."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 6, p. 160.
                      Conversion precedes the time of refreshing. It is ac-
                   complished "by the sweet influences of the Holy Spirit, which
                   operate quietly yet surely in transforming and developing
                   character. It is the still, small voice of the Spirit of God that has
                   power to change the heart."—Prophets and Kings, p. 169.

                     How far-reaching will the loud cry be? Rev. 18:1.

                      "Angels were sent to aid the mighty angel from heaven, and I
                   heard voices which seemed to sound everywhere, 'Come out of
                   her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
                   receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto
                   heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.' "—Early
                   Writings, p. 277.
                      "During the loud cry, the church, aided by the providential
                   interpositions of her exalted Lord, will diffuse the knowledge of
                   salvatiOn so abundantly that light will be communicated to
                   every city and town. The earth will be filled with the knowledge
                   of salvation. So abundantly will the renewing Spirit of God have
                   crowned with success the intensely active agencies, that the
                   light of present truth will be seen flashing everywhere."—
                   Evangelism, p. 694.
                      "Let the work of proclaiming the gospel of Christ be made
                   efficient by the agency of the Holy Spirit.... The living Word is
                   the sword of the Spirit."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald,
                   October 13, 1904.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I willing to have the Spirit dwell within me? If so, how
                   must I respond to His suggestions to me through the Bible and
                   the Inspired counsel?

                     "We must not wait for the latter rain. It is coming upon all who
                   will recognize and appropriate the dew and showers of grace
                   that fall upon us. When we gather up the fragments of light,
                   when we appreciate the sure mercies of God, who loves to have
                   us trust Him, then every promise will be fulfilled."—Ellen G.
