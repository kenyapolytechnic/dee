    Jesus Foretells His Death; Provides Tribute
             Money; Teaches Humility
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matt. 17:22 to 18:10; Mark 9:31-50; Luke 9:46-48.
MEMORY VERSE: "Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
  that one of these little ones should perish." Matt. 18:14.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 432-442.
PLACES: Galilee; Capernaum, Sea of Galilee; a house in Capernaum.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples, Peter especially mentioned; tax collectors; a
  little child.
                                   THE LESSON

                   The Shadow of Coming Events
    1. While Jesus and His disciples were in Galilee, what events did He
foretell? Matt. 17:22, 23.
    2. What prevented the disciples from understanding His words?
Luke 9:45, 46.
   NoTE.—"On the journey through Galilee,Christ had again tried to prepare
the minds of His disciples for the scenes bf
                                           ore Him. He told them that He
was to go up to Jerusalem to be put to death and to rise again. And He added
the strange and solemn announcement that He was to be betrayed into the
hands of His enemies. The disciples did not even now comprehend His words.
Although the shadow of a great sorrow fell upon them, a spirit of rivalry
found a place in their hearts. They disputed among themselves which should
be accounted greatest in the kingdom. This strife they thought to conceal
from Jesus, and they did not, as usual, press close to His side, but loitered
behind, so that He was in advance of them as they entered Capernaum."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 432.
    It was because the disciples were at strife among themselves as to who
should be greatest, that the real truth concerning the events to occur at
Jerusalem was hidden from them. They might have known, but they still
held to the Jewish idea that the Messiah must establish a temporal kingdom
at Jerusalem. They were so busy with anticipation as to their own future
place of authority in the new administration of affairs, that they had no
desire for the unwelcome truth Jesus began to unfold to them regarding His
sufferings and death.
               Collectors of Tribute Interview Peter
   3. What question was Peter asked when Jesus and His disciples came
to Capernaum? Matt. 17:24.
   Nora.—"This tribute was not a civil tax, but a religious contribution,
which every Jew was required to pay annually for the support of the temple.
                                     [3)
A refusal to pay the tribute would be regarded as disloyalty to the temple,—in
the estimation of the rabbis a most grievous sin."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 432, 433.
    4. What was Peter's prompt answer to the question? What question
did Jesus ask Peter a little later? Verse 25.
    NOTE.—"Peter saw in the collector's question an insinuation touching
Christ's loyalty to the temple. Zealous for his Master's honor, he hastily
answered, without consulting Him, that Jesus would pay the tribute. But
Peter only partially comprehended the purpose of his questioner. There were
some classes who were held to be exempt from the payment of the tribute. . . .
In the days of Christ the priests and Levites were still regarded as especially
devoted to the temple, and were not required to make the annual contribution
for its support. Prophets also were exempted from this payment. In requir-
ing the tribute from Jesus, the rabbis were setting aside His claim as a prophet
or teacher, and were dealing with Him as with any commonplace person. A
refusal on His part to pay the tribute would be represented as disloyalty to
the temple; while, on the other hand, the payment of it would be taken as
justifying their rejection of Him as a prophet.
    "Only a little before, Peter had acknowledged Jesus as the Son of God;
but he now missed an opportunity of setting forth the character of his Master.
By his answer to the collector, that Jesus would pay the tribute, he had
virtually sanctioned the false conception of Him to which the priests and
rulers were trying to give currency."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 433.
    5. What principle was Peter led to understand? What motive led
Jesus to pay the tribute money? How was it provided? Verses 26, 27.
   NoTE.—"While Jesus made it plain that He was under no obligation to
pay the tribute, He entered into no controversy with the Jews in regard to
the matter; for they would have misinterpreted His words, and turned them
against Him. Lest He should give offense by withholding the tribute, He did
that which He could not justly be required to do. This lesson would be of
great value to His disciples."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 434.

                        The Grace of Humility
   6. What question was uppermost in the minds of the disciples? Matt.
18:1; Mark 9:33, 34.
    7. In seeking to be first and great, whose example does one follow?
Isa. 14:12-14.
    NoTE.—Self-seeking, born of selfishness, is sure to cause offense. Christ's
example condemns this spirit in all His followers. "In honor preferring one
another," is the standard for the Christian believer, "Lucifer had said, will
be like the Most High ;' and the desire for self-exaltation had brought strife
into the heavenly courts, and had banished a multitude of the hosts of God.
Had Lucifer really desired to be like the Most High, he would never have
deserted his appointed place in heaven; for the spirit of the Most High is
manifested in unselfish ministry. Lucifer desired God's power, but not His
character. He sought for himself the highest place [the very thing the disciples
at this time were doing], and every being who is actuated by his spirit will
do the same. Thus alienation, discord, and strife will be inevitable."—"The
Desire of Ages," pp. 435, 436.
                                      [4]
    8. Who has set the example in true humility? What facts are especially
mentioned as evidence of this? Phil. 2:5-8.
    NOTE.—In Philippians 2:5-8. the apostle presents a wonderful truth. The
statement that Jesus Christ "thought it not robbery to be equal with God"
(verse 6), takes on new beauty when the text is read in the original language
in which it was written by the apostle. The idea expressed in the Greek is
that the Son, though on an equality with the Father as Cocreator, did not
think that equality something to be selfishly retained, or clung to, but cheerfully
surrendered His high position with the Father without surrendering His
divine character. "The Expositor's Bible," by R. A. A. Kennedy, renders the
phrase in this helpful way: "Did not look upon His equality with God as a
prize to be clutched." In the American Revised 'Version there is a similar
rendering.
     9. What object lesson did Jesus give in answer to the direct question
which the disciples asked? What are we to learn from a little child?
Matt. 18:2, 3.
    NorE.—"The simplicity, the self-forgetfulness, and the confiding love of
a little child are the attributes that Heaven values. These are the characteristics
of real greatness."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 437.
     "The ideal childhood is exemplified by the childhood of Jesus Himself.
These qualities are: (1) humility; (2) freedom from ambition, rivalry, or
jealousy; (3) tender and gracious affection; (4) perfect trust; (5) obedience;
(6) a teachable spirit; (7) unworldliness; (8) indifference to the distinction
of rank and wealth. Without these they not only could not be first, as they
were seeking to be, but could not even enter the kingdom."—Peloubet.

                       Causing Others to Stumble
   10. What promise is made to those who receive a little child in Jesus'
name? What is said about the offense of causing another to stumble?
Verses 5, 6.
   NorE.—The word "offend" used here and elsewhere means "cause to
stumble," and is so rendered in the Revised Version. It means literally the
placing of an impediment or trap before the feet so as to cause one to stumble
and fall.
   11. Though offenses must come, what does Jesus say of him who causes
them? Verse 7.
    12. How does Jesus emphasize the importance of believers putting
away every cause of offense? Verses 8, 9.
   NOTE.—"Any habit or practice that would lead into sin, and bring dis-
honor upon Christ, would better be put away, whatever the sacrifice. That
which dishonors God cannot benefit the soul. The blessing of heaven cannot
attend any man in violating the eternal principles of right. And one sin
cherished is sufficient to work the degradation of the character, and to mislead
others. If the foot or the hand would be cut off, or even the eye would be
plucked out, to save the body from death, how much more earnest should we
be to put away sin, that brings death to the soul."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 439.
    "The surrender of the will is represented as plucking out the eye or cutting
off the hand. Often it seems to us that to surrender the will to God is to consent
                                       [5]

to go through life maimed or crippled. But it is better, says Christ, for self
to be maimed, wounded, crippled, if thus you may enter into life."—"Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing," pp. 95, 96.
    Men are often willing to part with some member of the body at the
discretion of a surgeon, that life may be prolonged for a time. We ought to
 be willing to forgo that which causes us to sin, even though it be very dear to
us, if it endangers our eternal life.
                                      {6]
   13. What caution is given concerning the "little ones"? How are even
these represented in heaven? Verse 10.
      NoTE.—"A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These
heavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of the wicked one.

—"The Great Controversy," pp. 512, 513.
                          THINK ON THESE THINGS
   The reason why the understanding of the disciples was darkened when
Jesus was revealing important truths.
   The motive that caused Jesus to pay the tribute money.

Gaining Thy Brother; The Measure of Forgiveness
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 18:15-35.
MEMORY VERSE: "Hoye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
  also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
  Father forgive your trespasses." Matt. 6:14, 15.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of-Ages," pp. 440-442; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
  pp. 243-251.
PLACE: Capernaum.
PERSONS: Jesus; Peter and probably all the other disciples.

                                  THE LESSON

                           Gaining Thy Brother
    1. What instruction did Jesus give as to what we should do when a
brother wrongs us? What is the result if he hears us? Matt. 18:15.
    2. If our first effort toward reconciliation fails, what should we then
do? Verse 16.
    NoTE.—Evidently the Lord desires that estrangement between brethren
and all difficulties in the church should be kept within as small a circle as
possible.
   "An earnest effort should be made in every church to put away evil
speaking and a censorious spirit as among the sins productive of the greatest
evils in the church. Severity and faultfinding must be rebuked as the workings
                                       C 7]
   of Satan. Mutual love and confidence must be encouraged and strengthened
   in the members of the church. Let all, in the fear of God and with love to their
   brethren, close their ears to gossip and censure. Direct the talebearer to the
   teachings of God's word. Bid him obey the Scriptures, and carry his com-
   plaints directly to those whom he thinks in error. This united action would
   bring a flood of light into the church, and close the door to a flood of evil.
   Thus God would be glorified, and many souls would be saved."—"T.esti-
   monies," vol. 5, pp. 609, 610.
       "If a brother is supposed to have erred, his brethren and_ sisters should
   not whisper it among themselves and comment upon it, magnifying these
   supposed errors and faults. Much of this work is done, and the result is, the
V displeasure of God rests upon those who do it, and Satan exults that he can
   weaken and annoy those who might be strong in the Lord."—"Testimonies,"
   vol. 5, p. 615'.
       3. Under what circumstances should appeal be made to the church?
   If the judgment of the church is not heeded, how should the person be
   regarded? Verse 17.
       4. If we follow the instruction the Lord has given, what will be done
   in heaven? Verse 18.
       NoTE.—If the church on earth follows the instruction of Christ in dealing
   with offenses, we are assured that the decision will be ratified in heaven. This
   is a serious thought for the church itself as well as for the offending members.
   The Lord clearly teaches the necessity of maintaining the ptirity and order
   of the church. When members have been separated from the church, ctur duty
   then, as Christians, is to continue to labor for their conversion, that they
   may again be brought into the church from which they have been separated.
       "We should not think that unless those who have injured us confess the
   wrong, we are justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. It is their
   part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and confession; but we
   are to have a spirit of compassion toward those who have trespassed against
   us, whether or not they confess their faults. However sorely they may have
   wounded us, we are not to cherish our grievances, and sympathize with our-
   selves over our injuries; but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses
   against God, we are to pardon all who have done evil to us."—"Thoughts
   From the Mount of Blessing," p. 166.
      5. What precious promise is given concerning the petition of two or
   more who are agreed? Whose presence graces the assembly of two or
   three who meet in the name of Jesus? Verses 19, 20.

                 How Often Shall I Forgive My Brother?
        6. What question concerning forgiveness did Peter ask Jesus? What
   answer did he suggest to his own question? How far from correct was his
   idea? Verses 21, 22; Luke 17:3, 4.
       NoTE.—"The rabbis limited the exercise of forgiveness to three offenses.
   Peter, carrying out, as he supposed, the teaching of Christ, thought to extend
   it to seven, the number signifying perfection. But Christ taught that we are
   never to become weary of forgiving. Not, 'Until seven times,' He said, 'but,
   Until seventy times seven.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 243.
       "How oft [shall I forgive]? a countable number of times? No, an un-
   countable number of times! Therein is the discipline most severe. Why, then,
                                         [8 ]
does the text rejoice me? In this way; because if God asks so much from me,
what will He be prepared to be and to do Himself in reference to my re-
pentance?"—"The People's Bible," vol. 20, pp. 58, 59.
    "A story is told of an incorrigible soldier who had been punished so often
for so many offenses, without avail, that his commanding officer despaired of
the man's amendment. Again he was under arrest, and the officer spoke hope-
lessly of him, asking what more could be done to save him from his own
undoing. A fellow officer suggested, 'Try forgiving him.' The man was brought
in and asked what he had to say for himself. He replied: 'Nothing, except
that I'm very sorry.' Well,' said the officer, 'we have decided to forgive you.'
The man stood dazed for a moment, and then burst into tears, saluted, and
went out to become the best and bravest soldier in the command."-=-Sunday
School Times.

                          The Lesson in Parable
    7. To make the subject of forgiveness still clearer, to what did Jesus
liken the kingdom of heaven? In what condition was the account of one
servant found to be? Matt. 18:23, 24.
   NOTE.—"There are many who hope by their own works to merit God's
favor. They do not realize their helplessness. They do not accept the grace
of God as a free gift, but are trying to build themselves up in self-righteousness.
Their own hearts are not broken and humbled on account of sin, and they are
exacting and unforgiving toward others. Their own sins against God, com-
pared with their brother's sins against them, are as ten thousand talents to
one hundred pence,—nearly one million to one."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
pp. 245-247.
    8. Since the debtor could not pay, what did the king command?
Verse 25.
    NorE.—Jesus here refers to an ancient custom among the Hebrew people
of selling a man and his entire family to make payment of debts.
   9. What plea did the servant then offer? 'What impossible promise did
he make? What did this appeal cause the king to do? Verses 26, 27.
   Nork.—The king granted much more than his servant asked. The servant
desired time only that he might pay, but the king in his compassion forgave
the entire debt.
   10. How was this experience repeated? In what respect did it differ
from the first? Verses 28-30.
   11. How did the king learn all that had occurred? Verse 31.
   12. 'What followed as a result of the unforgiving spirit of the first
servant? Verses 32-34.
   13. What lesson does our Lord design that we should learn from this
parable? Verse 35.
   NOTE.—"The great lesson of the parable lies in the contrast between God's
compassion and man's hardheartedness; in the fact that God's forgiving
mercy is to be the measure of our own. `Shouldst not thou also have had
compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee?' "—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 251.

  Test of Discipleship; The Seventy Sent Forth;
               Upbraiding the Cities
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 9:57 to 10:21; Matt. 8:19-22; 11:20-24.
MEMORY VERSE: "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the
  Son of man hath not where to lay His head." Luke 9:58.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 489-496.
PLACES: Incident took place probably in or near Capernaum; cities mentioned in
  text are Sodom; Chorazin; Bethsaida; Tyre and Sidon; Capernaum.
PERSONS: Jesus; the twelve; one man of the twelve identified as Judas Iscariot in
  "The Desire of Ages," page 293; two unidentified men; the seventy.
                                THE LESSON

           Three Interviews With Prospective Followers
    1. Upon one occasion what did a certain man express a desire to do?
What reply did Jesus make? Luke 9:57, 58.
    NOTE.—"While Jesus was preparing the disciples for their ordination, one
who had not been summoned, urged his presence among them. It was Judas
Iscariot, a man who professed to be a follower of Christ. He now came for-
ward, soliciting a place in this inner circle of disciples. With great earnestness
and apparent sincerity he declared, 'Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever
Thou goest.' Jesus neither repulsed nor welcomed him, but uttered only the
mournful words: 'The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests;
but the Son of man hath not where to lay His head.' Judas believed Jesus
to be the Messiah; and by joining the apostles, he hoped to secure a high
position. in the new kingdom. This hope Jesus designed to cut off by the
statement of His poverty.
   "The disciples were anxious that Judas should become one of their
number. ,He was of commanding • appearance, a, man of keen discernment
and executive ability, and they commended him to Jesus as one who would
greatly assist Him in His work. They were surprised that Jesus received
him so coolly."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. ,293, 294.
    2. What invitation did Jesus extend to another man? What excuse was
given for declining the• invitation? How did Jesus further urge him?
Verses 59, 60.
    NorE.—In the East burial follows almost immediately after death. There
                                       r 10 I
is no long delay. If the man's father had been dead at that time, he would
have been attending to his father's burial, instead of being there. The man
was really asking for permission to wait an indefinite time before taking hold
of the Lord's work. It amounted to asking to be excused until after his
father should die, and he could have an opportunity to settle up his affairs.
How many whom Christ is calling now are saying the same thing ! Their
temporal affairs must all be attended to before they can enter the Lord's
service. To such He says, "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and
preach the kingdom of God."
    3. What did another man desire to do before answering .the call of
Jesus? In reply what principle did Jesus set forth? Verses 61, 62.

                      Instructing the Seventy
   4. How many additional helpers did Jesus appoint? In what manner
were they organized? Where were they to go? Luke 10:1.
   5. What did Jesus tell them concerning the harvest? For what were
they to pfay? Verse 2.
    6. As the seventy went forth in their work, to what were they likened?
What things usually regarded by travelers as necessities were they not to
take? How were they to save time? Verses 3, 4.
    NOTE.—He who sent out these workers would provide and care for them..
To have carried money would have invited violence and robbery. To have
provided food in their scrip and extra clothing would have encumbered them
in their labors. In Eastern countries, the forms of greeting passed between
travelers meeting on a journey involve so many question, repeated expres-
sions of welcome, and tedious forms, as to cause much delay.
    7. What were these workers to do upon entering a house? What were
they to do if they were made welcome? What further instruction did Jesus
give them? Verses 5-8.
    8. What work were they to do in the cities? What was to be the key-
note of their message? Verse 9.
    9. What were they to do in places where they were not received? What
were they privileged to say? Verses 10, 11.
    10. What comparison did Jesus make between some of the wicked
cities of old and the cities which had witnessed His mighty works? Verses
12-15.
    NorE.—Worse than Sodom! And why? Because they rejected the
message of salvation sent to them. No more forceful statement could be
made of the terrible consequences of failing to receive the gospel and to
walk in the light.
    Chorazin—an ancient town in Galilee, about two miles from Capernaum.
    Bethsaida—a city in Galilee on the shore of the lake, a place frequently
visited by Jesus.
    Tyre and Sidon—cities on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. They
were noted for the riches, pride, and idolatry of the people.
    Capernaum—an important city on the Sea of Galilee, where, it seems,
 Jesus spent more time during His ministry than in any other one place.
Many miracles were wrought there.

    11. How fully did Jesus identify Himself with His disciples? Verse 16.
    12. When the seventy returned to Jesus, what did they report with
rejoicing? Verse 17.
    13. What did the relation of their experience bring to the mind of
Jesus? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—Study 2 Peter 2:4; Rev. 12:7-9; John 12:31; Rev. 20:10; 5:13.
"The scenes of the past and the future were presented to the mind of Jesus.
He beheld Lucifer as he was first cast out from the heavenly places. He
looked forward to the scenes of His own agony, when before all the worlds
the character of the deceiver should be unveiled. He heard the cry, 'It is
finished,' announcing that the redemption of the lost race was forever made
certain, that heaven was made eternally secure against the accusations, the
deceptions, the pretensions, that Satan would instigate.
    "Beyond the cross of Calvary, with its agony and shame, Jesus looked
forward to the great final day, when the prince of the power of the air will
meet his destruction in the earth so long marred by his rebellion. Jesus beheld
the work of evil forever ended, and the peace of God filling heaven and
earth."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 490.
    14. What encouragement did Jesus give to His workers? What would
be a greater cause of rejoicing than victory over evil spirits? Verses 19, 20.
    15. Knowing that the seventy had responded to the spirit of His instruc-
t-ion, how did Jesus express His thankfulness? Verse 21.
                       THINK ON THESE THINGS
   The "cost" of 'following Jesus.
   How opportunities increase responsibility.
   The danger of "looking back."
   The true cause of real rejoicing.

              Jesus Prays; Ten Lepers Cleansed
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matt. 11:25-30; Luke 17:11-19.
MEMORY VERSE: "Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There
  are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger." Luke 17:17,18.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 328-332, 347, 348, 488; "Testimonies,"
  vol. 3, pp. 179, 180.
PLACES: Through Samaria and Galilee on the way to Jerusalem.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; ten lepers, one of whom was a Samaritan.
                                   THE LESSON
                        A Prayer of Thankfulness
   1. After pronouncing woes upon certain cities because of their unbelief,
for what did Jesus thank the Father? Matt. 11:25.
                                        { 121
    NOTE.—Self-satisfied, and occupied with their own ambitions and pursuits,
the worldly class is a difficult one to reach with the gospel. God does not
refuse spiritual things to the so-called "wise and prudent," but they think
themselves too wise to listen to Him, and they close their ears and eyes to His
word. It is only to the humble and to those who consider themselves babes
in understanding that the Lord can impart His light and knowledge.
   2. What did Jesus say that shows His perfect agreement with the
Father? Verse 26.
  3. What has the Father given into the hands of His Son? How only
may we become acquainted with the Father? Verse 27.

                         A Gracious Invitation
    4. How many are invited to come to Jesus? What promise is given to
all who accept Him? Verse 28.
    NOTE.—"In these words, Christ is speaking to every human being. Whether
they know it or not, all are weary and heavy-laden. All are weighed down
with burdens that only Christ can remove. The heaviest burden that we bear
is the burden of sin. If we were left to bear this burden, it would crush us.
But the Sinless One has taken our place. 'The Lord hath laid on Him the
iniquity of us all.' He has borne the burden of our guilt. He will take the load
from our weary shoulders. He will give us rest. The burden of care and
sorrow also He will bear. He invites us to cast all our care upon Him; for
He carries us upon His heart."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 328, 329.
    5. What are we to take? What are we to find? Verse 29.
    NOTE.—"The yoke is an instrument of service. Cattle are yoked for labor,
and the yoke is essential that they may labor effectually. By this illustration,
Christ teaches us that we are called to service as long as life shall last. We are
to take upon us His yoke, that we may be co-workers with Him.
    "The yoke that binds to service is the law of God. The great law of love
revealed in Eden, proclaimed upon Sinai, and in the new covenant written in
the heart, is that which binds the human worker to the will of God. If we
were left to follow our own inclinations, to go just where our will would lead
us, we should fall into Satan's ranks and become possessors of his attributes.
Therefore God confines us to His will, which is high, and noble, and elevating.
He desires that we shall patiently and wisely take up the duties of service."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 329.
    6. What does Jesus say of His yoke and of His burden? Verse 30.
    NOTE.—"The yoke is placed upon the oxen to aid them in drawing the load,
to lighten the burden. So with the yoke of Christ. When our will is swallowed
up in the will of God, and we use His gifts to bless others, we shall find life's
burden light. He who walks in the way of God's commandments is walking
in company with Christ, and in His love the heart is at rest."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 331.
   7. Continuing His journey toward. Jerusalem, through what countries
did Jesus pass? Luke 17:11.
   8. As He entered into a certain village, who met Him? Where did these
men stand? Why? Vere 12.
                                   1131
                         The Story of Ten Men
    NOTE.—The law of Israel required that a leper should not enter a city,
that he should not approach anyone, but should cover his face and cry,
"Unclean, unclean," if anyone drew near. A description of this scene is
portrayed by Cunningham Geikie:
    "Ten men, hideous with leprosy, ranged themselves at a distance from the
road, as similar sufferers still do, before their huts at the Zion Gate at Jeru-
salem. It was a law in Samaria that no leper could enter a town, and hence
the unfortunate creatures accosted Jesus while He was still outside the village.
Misery had broken down all prejudice of race or faith, and had brought
together even Jew and Samaritan. . . . The ten had heard of Jesus, and
the wonderful cures He had performed on such as they, and no sooner saw
Him than they broke out with the common cry, 'Tame! Tame! Unclean!
unclean ! Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.' It was a sight that might have
touched any heart, for it must have been like that which still repeats itself to
passers-by at the leper quarters elsewhere—a crowd of beggars without eye-
brows, or hair on their faces or heads; the nails of their hands and feet, and
even a hand or a foot itself, gone from some; the nose, the eyes, the tongue,
the palate, more or less wanting in others. As they stood afar off, their lips
covered with their abbas, like mourners for the dead,—for they were smitten
with a living death, which cut them off from intercourse with their fellows
the pity of Jesus was excited, and without even waiting to come near, sent
hope to them in the words, 'Go, show yourselves to the priests.'"—"The Life
and Words of Christ," vol. 2, p. 268.
    9. What did these men do as Jesus came within sound of their voices?
Verse 13.
    10. What answer did Jesus make to them? As the men obeyed, what
came to pass? Verse 14.
    NoTE.—These lepers might naturally have objected to starting to the priests
until the miracle of healing had been experienced, but their faith led them to
obey, and in the act of obeying, the blessing came.
    "They [the lepers] knew what the command meant, for no one who was
 not cleansed could approach a priest, and as they moved off, the disease left
them. The Samaritan would have to show himself to a Samaritan priest ;
the nine Jews needed to go up to the temple at Jerusalem for an official
certificate of health."—"The Life and Words of Christ," Geikie, vol. 2, p. 268.
    11. What did one of the healed men do? What degree of earnestness
did he show? Of what nationality was he? Verses 15, 16.
    12. What two questions did Jesus then ask? Verse 17.
    13. How did Jesus refer to the Samaritan? What cheering words did
He speak to the stranger? Verses 18, 19.
   NOTE.—"Here is a lesson for us all. These lepers were so corrupted by
disease that they had been restricted from society lest they should contaminate
others. Their limits had been prescribed by the authorities. Jesus comes
within their sight, and in their great suffering, they cry unto Him who alone
has power to relieve them. Jesus bids them show themselves to the priests.
They have faith to start on their way, believing in the power of Christ to heal
them. As they go on their way, they realize that the horrible disease has left
them. But only one has feelings of gratitude, only one feels his deep indebted-
                                      [141
ness to Christ for this great work wrought for him. This one returns praising
God, and in the greatest humiliation falls at the feet of Christ, acknowledging
with thankfulness the work wrought for him. And this man was a stranger;
the other nine were Jews.
    "For the sake of this one man, who would make a right use of the blessing
of health, Jesus healed the whole ten. The nine passed on without 'appreciating
the work done, and rendered no grateful thanks to Jesus for doing the work."
—"Testimonies," vol. 3, pp. 179, 180.
     14. In what spirit should our requests be made known unto God?
Phil. 4:6.
     NOTE.—"It is a law of nature that our thoughts and feelings are encouraged
and strengthened as we give them utterance. While words express thoughts,
it is also true that thoughts follow words. If we would give more expression
to our faith, rejoice more in the blessings that we know we have,—the great
mercy and love of God,—we should have more faith and greater joy. No
tongue can express, no finite mind can conceive, the blessing that results from
appreciating the goodness and love of God."—"The Ministry of Healing,"
pp. 251-253.
                          THINK ON THESE THINGS
     The words of comfort in Matthew 11:28-30.
     The ease of His yoke.
     The sin of ingratitude.
     What the utterance of right words does for us.

          Healing a Blind Man on the Sabbath
LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 9.
MEMORY VERSE: "I must work the works of Him that sent Me, while it is day:
  the night cometh, when no man can work." John 9:4.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 470-475.
PLACE: Jerusalem.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; a blind man; parents of the blind man; Phari-
  sees; the people.
                               THE LESSON
                     An Error in Belief Corrected
    1. Whom did Jesus see as He was passing along the streets of Jeru-
salem? John 9:1.
    NOTE.—It is well to consider the setting of this lesson. Jesus had been
teaching in the temple. He had drawn a sharp contrast between the unbelief
of the Jews and the faith of their father Abraham. He had solemnly announced,
"Before Abraham was, I am." The priests and rabbis had cried out against
Him as a blasphemer, and were about to stone Him. Jesus hid Himself from
them, went out of the temple, and passed by them in safety. Then follows
                                       [15 1
the story of the healing of the blind man, a miracle of much importance as
indicated by the fact that the story is told with much detail.
     2. By what questipn did the disciples reveal the prevailing idea of
their time concerning sin and suffering? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"It was generally believed by the Jews that sin is punished in this
life. Every affliction was regarded as the penalty of some wrongdoing, either
of the sufferer himself or of his parents. It is true that all suffering results
from the transgression of God's law, but this truth had become perverted.
Satan, the author of sin and all its results, had led men to look upon disease
and death as proceeding from God,—as punishment arbitrarily inflicted on
account of sin. Hence one upon whom some great affliction or calamity had
fallen, had the additional burden of being regarded as a great sinner."—"The
Desire of Ages," pp. 470, 471.
    3. How did Jesus reply to the question? What purpose would the man's
blindness be made to serve? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"The belief of the Jews in regard to the relation of sin and suffering
was held by Christ's disciples. While Jesus corrected their error, He did not
explain the cause of the man's affliction, but told them what would be the
result."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 471.
    4. What did Jesus then say He must do? What did He declare Himself
to be? Verses 4, 5.
                                The Miracle
   5. In what manner was the sight of the blind man given to him?
Verses 6, 7.
   6. What three questions did the neighbors ask? What reply did the
man make to each question? Verses 8-12.

                    Brought Before the Pharisees
     7. Before whom was the man then taken for examination? Upon what
day of the week was the miracle wrought? What conversation took place
between the Pharisees and the man whose sight had been restored?
Verses 13-15.
     8. What conflicting opinions were expressed concerning Jesus? Verses
16, 17.
    NOTE.—The Pharisees were zealous for what they conceived to be the
proper observance of the Sabbath, yet they were planning murder on that very
day. They had abundant ground for a charge against Jesus, according to their
man-made laws. The making of clay, or the application of a remedy where
life or an organ was not in danger, was considered as Sabbathbreaking. "It was
not lawful to wash the eyes with spittle medicinally on the Sabbath day, much
less to go to a pool of water to wash them."—Henry and Scott's Commentary.
                           The Parents Called
    9. What further effort did the Jews make to discredit the account of
the miracle? Verse 18.
   10. To what facts did the parents bear witness? What did they claim
not to know? What caused them to fear to reveal the truth? Verses 19-23.
                                   {161
                            HEALING A- BLIND MAN

   NOTE.—"Put out of the synagogue." Edersheim states that among the Jews
there were three kinds of "excommunication." The first and lightest was a
rebuke. Ordinarily the period of disapproval lasted for seven days, but if pro-
nounced by the head of the Sanhedrin, it continued for thirty days. The second
degree of excommunication lasted for thirty days; and at the end of that
term, "a second admonition" was given, which extended the time thirty days
longer. This could be pronounced only in an assembly of ten, and was accom-
panied by curses, and sometimes proclaimed with a blast of the horn. The
final excommunication placed a ban of indefinite duration on a man. "Hence-
forth he was like one dead. He was not allowed to study with others, no
intercourse was to be held with him, he was not even to be shown the road.
He might, indeed, buy the necessaries of life, but it was forbidden to eat or
drink with such an one."
              Cross-Questioning the Man Born Blind
     11. After again calling the son who had been blind, what demand did
the Pharisees make? What did they say they knew? Verse 24.
     NorE.—In saying "Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner,"
the Pharisees really meant, Do not say again that this man gave you sight;
it is God who has done this.
                                     [ 17 1
     12. Being pressed with further queries, how did the healed man taunt
his questioners? Verses 25-27.
     NOTE.—"The man was made of sturdier stuff than his parents. He was
not to be overawed by their authority, or knocked down by their assertions.
. . . 'We know,' the Pharisees had said, 'that this man is a sinner.' Whether
He is a sinner,' the man replied, 'I do not know; one thing I do know, that,
being blind, now I see.' Then they began again their weary and futile cross-
examination. 'What did He do to thee? How did He open thine eyes?' But-
the man had had enough of this. 'I told you once, and ye did not attend. Why
do ye wish to hear again? Is it possible that ye too wish to be His disciples?'
Bold irony this—to ask these stately, ruffled, scrupulous Sanhedrists, whether
he was really to regard them as anxious and sincere inquirers about the claims
of the Nazarene Prophet ! Clearly here was a man whose presumptuous honesty
would neither be bullied into suppression nor corrupted into a lie."—"Life of
Christ," Farrar, p. 398.
     13. Whose disciples did the Pharisees claim to be? What profession of
ignorance concerning Jesus did they make? What unanswerable statement
did the man make in reply? Verses 28-33.
     14. How did the Jews show their hatred of Jesus and also of the man
He had healed? Verse 34.
     NOTE.—" 'And they cast him out.' They immediately excommunicated him,
as the margin properly reads—drove him from their assembly with disdain,
and forbade his further appearing in the worship of God. Thus a simple man,
guided by the Spirit of truth, and continuing steady in his testimony, utterly
confounded the most eminent Jewish doctors. When they had no longer
either reason or argument to oppose to him, as a proof of their discomfiture and
a monument of their reproach and shame, they had recourse to the secular arm,
and thus silenced by political power a person whom they had neither reason
nor religion to withstand. They have had since many followers in their crimes.
A false religion, supported by the state, has, by fire and sword, silenced those
whose truth in the end annihilated the system of their opponents."—Clarke's
Commentary.
    15. When Jesus heard that the healed man had been cast out of the
synagogue, what did He dp? How clearly did Jesus make Himself known
to this man? What response did the man make? Verses 35-38.
    16. What did these things lead Jesus to say? How* did the Pharisees
make application of His words? What was Jesus' answer? Verses 39-41.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
    The danger of willful blindness. "Every soul that refuses to give himself
to God, is under the control of another power."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 466.
   The effect of fear. The temptation to shift responsibility.

 SUNDAY   MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY         SABBATH



                        The Good Shepherd
LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 10:1-21.
MEMORY VERSE: "I am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd giveth His life
  for the sheep." John 10:11.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 476-484.
PLACE: Jerusalem, probably in or near the temple. Most commentators think that
  this chapter follows immediately after the events recorded in John 9.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; Pharisees; people.

                                 THE LESSON

          Distinction Between the Shepherd and a Thief
    1. What beautiful illustration did Jesus give of His relation to His
followers? John 10:11.
    2. What contrast is there in the manner of the shepherd and a robber
when entering the sheepfold? Verses 1, 2.
    3. How else is the shepherd distinguished from the robber? Why will
the sheep not follow a stranger? Verses 3-5.
    NoTE.—We shall be saved "not as a man, or some one of mankind, led forth
by his Lord in the general flock, but as the Master's dear Simon, or James, or
Alphaeus, or Martha, whose name is so recorded in the Lamb's book of life."—
Bushnell.
                            Jesus Also the Door
    4. In explaining the parable, what did "Jesus say of Himself? What
did He say of those who came before Him? Verses 6-8.
    NOTE.—"The Pharisees had not entered by the door. They had climbed
into the fold by another way than Christ, and they were not fulfilling the work
of the true shepherd. The priests and rulers, the scribes and Pharisees, destroyed
the living pastures, and defiled the wellsprings of the water of life."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 478.
    Not only is Jesus a door, or entrance, to life and safety, but the only one.
All those who at any time•teach any other way than the merits of Christ for
salvation, whether they be Jewish leaders, heathen philosophers, or professed
Christian teachers, are thieves and robbers; "for there is none other name
under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
    5. What is the reward of those who enter in by the door? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—The parable has a double application. in meaning: Jesus is the
shepherd; He is also the door to the fold.
    "Christ is both the door and the shepherd. He enters in by Himself. It is
through His own sacrifice that He becomes the shepherd of the sheep."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 478.
    Through the shepherd only can we enter into the peace, the safety, that
a fold signifies,—safety from the beasts of prey representing sin, peace because
of our faith in the protection provided.
                                      [ 191
              Purpose of the Thief —Of the Shepherd
   6. For what purpose does th6 thief enter the sheepfold? For what did
the Saviour say He had come? How great a sacrifice does the shepherd's
love lead him to make? Verses 10, 11.
   7. In contrast, what does the hireling do in time of danger? Why does
he desert his flock? Verses 12, 13.
                    The Sheep Know the Shepherd
    8. What intimate relation exists between Christ and those who are
His? Verses 14, 15.
    Nom.—Different writers offer descriptions of Eastern customs that strongly
appeal to the heart in this connection:
    The shepherd "depends upon the sheep to follow, and they in turn expect
him never to leave them. They run after him if he appears to be escaping
from them, and are terrified when he is out of sight, or any stranger appears
instead of him. He calls them from time to time to let them know that he is
at hand. The sheep listen and continue grazing, but if anyone else tries to pro-
duce the same peculiar cries and gutteral sounds, they look around with a
startled air and begin to scatter."—Mackie.
    "A Scottish traveler changed clothes with a shepherd, and, thus disguised,
began to call the sheep. They remained motionless. Then the true shepherd
raised his voice, and they all hastened toward him, in spite of his strange
garments."—Century Bible.
    "It is one of the most interesting spectacles to see a number of flocks of
thirsty sheep watered at a fountain. Each flock, in obedience to the call of
its own shepherd, lies down, awaiting its,turn. The shepherd of one flock calls
his sheep in squads, and, when the squad has done drinking, orders it away by
sounds which the sheep perfectly understand, and calls up another squad. The
sheep never make any mistake as to who whistles to them or calls them."—
Hasting's Bible Dictionary.. •
                    The Sheep Are Now Scattered
    9. What desire did Jesus express for His scattered sheep? Verse 16.
   NoTE.—"Jesus thought upon the souls all over the earth who were misled
by false shepherds. Those whom He longed to gather as the sheep of His pasture
were scattered among wolves, and He said, 'Other sheep I have, which are
not of this fold.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 483.
    10. What does an ancient prophecy say of the accomplishment of this
work? Isa. 56:8.
    11. What does Jesus say of His Father's love for Him? John 10:17.
    NoTE.—"That is, My Father has so loved you, that He even loves Me more
for giving My life to redeem you. In becoming your substitute and surety, by
surrendering My life, by. taking your liabilities, your transgressions, I am
endeared to My Father. . . . While as a member of the human family He
was mortal, as God He was the fountain of life for the world. He could have
withstood the advances of death, and refused to come under its dominion; but
voluntarily He laid down His life, that He might bring life and immortality
to light. He bore the sin of the world, endured its curse, yielded up His life as
a sacrifice, that men might not eternally die."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 483, 484.
                                      { 20)
    12. What assurance is given that Christ's sacrifice for lost humanity
was a willing one? By whose power did Jesus rise from the dead? Verse 18.
   NorE.—It is repeatedly stated that the Father raised Jesus from the dead.
See Acts 2:24; 3:15; 4:10; 5:30; 10:40; 13:30-37; 1 Thess. 1:10; Rom. 4:24,
25; 6:4; 8:11. On the other hand, Jesus speaks of it as His own act. John 2:19;
10:17, 18. There is no contradiction in these texts. Both statements are true,

you. 'I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold,.I am alive forevermore.'
I have endured your sorrows, experienced your struggles, encountered your
temptations. .I know your tears; I also have wept. The griefs that lie too deep
to be breathed into any human ear, I know. Think not that you are desolate
and forsaken. Though your pain touch no responsive chord in any heart on
earth, look unto Me, and live."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 483:

                        The Good Samaritan
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 10:25-37.
MEMORY VERSE: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
  all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as
  thyself." Luke 10:27.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 497-505; "Christ's Object Lessons," pp.
  376-389 (new edition, pp. 381-395).
PLACE: Not certainly known.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; a lawyer; the multitude; mention is made of a
  priest, a Levite, and a Samaritan.

                                  THE LESSON

                           A Lawyer's Question
    1. While Jesus was teaching the people, how was He once interrupted?
Luke 10:25.
   NorE.—"Lawyers, men who devoted themselves to the study and explana-
tion of the Jewish law, particularly of the traditionary, or. oral law. They
                                   1 21 )
                   THE SAMARITAN HAD COMPASSION ON HIM.


 belonged mostly to the sect of the Pharisees, and fell under the reproof of
 our Saviour for having taken from the people the key of knowledge."—Bible
,Pictionary. See Luke 11:52.
     This particular lawyer is described as "not satisfied with the position and
 works of the Pharisees. He had been studying the Scriptures with a desire
 to learn their real meaning. He had a vital interest in the matter, and had
 asked in sincerity, 'What shall I do?' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 497.
     2. What did Jesus say that required the lawyer to answer/ his own
 question? How did he answer it? Verses 26, 27.
     3. What words of approval did Jesus speak? Verse 28.

                            Another Question
    4. What further question did the lawyer ask? What motive prompted
him? Verse 29.
    NoTE.—"The lawyer knew that he had kept neither the first four nor the
last six commandments. He was convicted under Christ's searching words,
but instead of confessing his sin, he tried to excuse it. Rather than acknowledge
the truth, he endeavored to show how difficult of fulfillment the command-
ment is. Thus he hoped both to parry conviction and to vindicate himself in
the eyes of the people."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 378, 379.
    "He [the lawyer] put another question, saying, 'Who is my neighbor?'
Among the Jews this question caused endless dispute. They had no doubt
as to the heathen and the Samaritans; these were strangers and enemies. But
                                      t 22 1
where should the distinction be made among the people of their own nation,
and among the different classes of society? Whom should the priest, the
rabbi, the elder, regard as neighbor? They spent their lives in a round of
ceremonies to make themselves pure. Contact with the ignorant and careless
multitude, they taught, would cause defilement that would require wearisome
effort to remove. Were they to regard the 'unclean' as neighbOrs?"—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 498.
                        A Story Told in Reply
    5. In reply, what experience did Jesus begin to relate? Verse 30.
    NOTE.—"Jerusalem is on the tableland of Judea, and Jericho, twenty miles
distant, is in the deep gorge of the Jordan valley, nine hundred feet below sea
level. The road was narrow as well as steep, with hills and narrow gullies
and caves on either side. The tract was uninhabited, and notorious for such
brigands as the parable mentions."—Tarbell.
     6. Who first came along the road where the wounded man was lying?
How did he show indifference to the man in need of help? Verse 31.
    NOTE.—A priest "passed by." Those who•belonged to the priesthood were
regarded as the most holy among the Jews. Many priests lived in Jericho.
Peloubet suggests of this one: "Possibly he thought that the robbers were
still in the neighborhood, and he would be in danger from them. He had
excuses enough, we may be sure,—such as they were."
     7. Who was the next passer-by? How far did his curiosity lead him to
go? What decision did he evidently make? Verse 32.
     NOTE.—"The care of the temple, the oversight of the poor, the doing of
 works of charity and mercy," were the specially named duties of the Levites.
 Like the priest, the Levite no doubt had excuses which he thought sufficient
 to relieve him from any responsibility in the matter.
     The story told by Jesus "was no imaginary scene, but an actual occurrence,
 which was known to be exactly as represented. The priest and the Levite who
 had passed by on the other side were in the company that listened to Christ's
 words."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 499.
                            A Stranger Helps
   8. Who next journeyed along the same road? What did his pity for the
wounded man lead him at once to do? Verses 33, 34.
   9. What provision did this stranger make for further care of the
wounded man? Verse 35.
   10. After relating this experience, what question did Jesus ask the
lawyer? Verse 36.
                        The Cta,estion Answered
    11. What answer did the lawyer make? What did Jesus then say to
 him? Verse 37.
                            The Lesson for Us
     12. What revelation of His own mission did Jesus give in the story of
 the good Samaritan? Luke 19:10.
     NOTE.—"In the story of the good Samaritan, Jesus gave a picture of Him-
 self and His mission. Man had been deceived, bruised, robbed, and ruined by
                                    t 23 1
Satan, and left to perish; but the Saviour had compassion on our helpless
condition. He left His glory, to come to our rescue. He found us ready to die,
and He undertook our case. He healed our wounds. He covered us with His
robe of righteousness. He opened to us a refuge of safety, and made complete
provision for us at His own charges. He died to redeem us."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 503.
     13. What experience told in olden times is frequently repeated in these
days? Ps. 69:20.
     NOTE.—"The lesson is no less needed in the world today than when it fell
from the lips of Jesus. Selfishness and cold formality have well-nigh ex-
tinguished the fire of love, and dispelled the graces that should make fragrant
the character. Many who profess His name have lost sight of the fact that
Christians are to represent Christ."—"The Deiire of Ages," p. 504.
     "We should anticipate the sorrows, the difficulties, the troubles of others.
. . . All around us are poor, tried souls that need sympathizing words and
helpful deeds. There are widows who need sympathy and assistance. There
are orphans whom Christ has bidden His followers receive as a trust from
God. Too often these are passed by with neglect."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
p. 386.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
    Someone has counted twelve things that the Samaritan did. You count
them.
    How one may unthinkingly pass by "on the other side."
    The real answer to the question, "Who is my neighbor?"
    NoTE.—"Thus the question, 'Who is my neighbor?' is forever answered.
Christ has shown that our neih bor does not mean merely one of the church
or faith to which we belong. It has no reference to race, color, or class distinc-
tion. Our neighbor is every person who needs our help. Our neighbor is every
soul who is wounded and bruised by the adversary. Our neighbor is everyone
who is the property of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 503.

    At the Home of Mary and Martha; Dining
                With a Pharisee
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 10:38-42; 11:37-54.
MEMORY VERSE: "But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,
  which shall not taken away from her." Luke 10:42.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 524, 525, 616-620.
PLACES: A house in Bethany, and probably Jerusalem.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; two sisters, Mary and Martha; a Pharisee, and
  probably dinner guests.
                                THE LESSON

                           At a Friendly Home
  1. During His travels, in whose home did Jesus one day seek rest?
How did Mary show her interest in Jesus' words? Luke 10:38, 39.
                                 [24 ]
                           MARY SAT AT JESUS' FEET.


    NOTE.—"The Saviour had no home of His own; He was dependent on the
hospitality of His friends and disciples; and often, when weary, thirsting for
human fellowship, He had been glad to escape to this peaceful household,
away from the suspicion and jealousy of the angry Pharisees. Here He found
a sincere welcome, and pure, holy friendship. Here He could speak with
simplicity and perfect freedom, knowing that His words would be understood
and treasured. Our Saviour appreciated a quiet home and interested listeners.
He longed for human tenderness, courtesy, and affection."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 524.
    2. What complaint did Martha make? Verse 40.
    3. With what kind words did Jesus gently rebuke Martha? What did
He say of Mary? Verses 41, 42.
    Nom—Hospitality is a Christian grace, and Martha was giving the highest
proof of liberality and benevolence in her entertaining. In trying to fill the
part of a true hostess, she did what many are now doing by being "careful and
troubled about many things,"—unnecessary care and trouble. Much of this
is seen in home life today. Where a few simple things would suffice, many
things are added, and in consequence, the heart .is filled with care, the spirit
annoyed, and the mind in unrest.
    "The 'one thing' that Martha needed was a calm, devotional spirit, a deeper
anxiety for knowledge concerning the future, immortal life, and the graces
necessary for spiritual advancement. She needed less anxiety for the things
which pass away, and more for those things which endure forever. Jesus
would teach His children to seize every opportunity of gaining that knowledge
which will make them wise unto salvation. .The cause of Christ needs careful,
                                      f 25 I
energetic workers. There is a wide field for the Marthas, with their zeal
in active religious work. But let them first sit with Mary at the feet of Jesus.
Let diligence, promptness, and energy be sanctified by the grace of Christ ;
then the life will be an unconquerable power for good."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 525.
                        The Guest of a Pharisee '
     4. With whom did Jesus dine on a certain occasion? What caused His
host to wonder? Luke 11:37, 38.
    NorE.—Reference is not made to the washing of hands to cleanse them,
but to the ceremonial washing which was a religious form. Edersheim states
that in the ceremony of hand-washing before eating, the water was poured on
both hands, the hands then lifted so that the water would run to the wrist,
but the water "polluted" thus by the hand, must not again run down the
fingers. Great importance was attached to this rite which Jesus had failed
to perform.
     5. How did Jesus reply to the unspoken thought of the Pharisee?
Verse 39.
     6. How did Jesus still further. rebuke the Pharisees? What substitute
did Jesus suggest for ceremonial purification? Verses 40, 41.            •
     7. In what obligation were the Pharisees particularly faithful? But
what did they disregard? What did Jesus say they should have done?
Verse 42.
    NorE.—"In these words Christ again condemns the abuse of sacred obliga-
tion. The obligation itself He does not set aside. The tithing system was
ordained by God, and it had been observed from the earliest times. . . . All
that God commands is of consequence. Christ recognized the payment of
tithes as a duty; but He showed that this could not excuse the neglect of
other duties."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 616, 617.
     8. For what other reason did Jesus pronounce a woe upon the Pharisees?
Verse 43.
    NOTE.—The "uppermost seats" were seats of honor provided for the elders
of the synagogues. "They were placed in front of the ark, which contained
the law, in the uppermost part of the synagogue, at the 'Jerusalem end.' Those
who occuoied them sat with their faces to the people. These seats were
considered positions of great honor, and were eagerly sought by the ambitious
scribes and Pharisees."—"Bible Manners and Customs."
     9. As Jesus continued His talk, what did He say the scribes and
Pharisees were like? Verse 44.
     NorE.—"In Matthew 23:27, our Lord tells them that they exactly re-
sembled whitewashed tombs; they had no fairness but on the outside; but
here He says they are like hidden tombs, graves which were not distinguished
by any outward decorations, and were not elevated above the ground, so that
those who walked over them did not consider what corruption was within;
so they, under the veil of hypocrisy, covered their iniquities, so that those who
had any intercourse or connection with them did not perceive what accom-
 plished knaves they had to do with."—Adam Clarke.
     10. What did one of the lawyers say Jesus had done in pronouncing
these woes? What reply did Jesus make? Verses 45, 46.
                                      [26)
    11. How did the monuments to the prophets bear witness against them?
Verses 47, 48; Matt. 23:29-32.
    NOTE.—By building these tombs they pretended to honor the prophets
that their forefathers had put to death, but their other actions showed them
to be possessed of the same spirit as that which led their fathers to kill the
prophets.
    12. What did Jesus say would be charged to that generation? Luke
11 : 49, 50.
    13. From what period did Jesus say the blood of the martyrs would
be required of that generation? Verse 51.
    14. What effect did the teachings of these-Jewish leaders really have
upon themselves? Upon others? Verse 52.
    15. What did the words of Jesus lead the scribes and Pharisees to do?
What was their purpose in this? Verses 53, 54:
    NoTE.—"Christ's indignation was directed against the hypocrisy, the gross
sins, by which men were destroying their own souls, deceiving the people, and
dishonoring God. In the specious, deceptive reasoning of the priests and rulers,
He discerned the working of Satanic agencies. Keen and searching had been
His denunciation of sin; but He spoke no words of retaliation. He had a holy
wrath against the prince of darkness; but He manifested no irritated temper.
So the Christian who lives in harmony with God, possessing the sweet attributes
of love and mercy, will feel a righteous indignation against sin; but he will
not be roused by passion to revile those who revile him. Even in meeting
those who are moved by a power from beneath to maintain falsehood, in
 Christ he will still preserve calmness and self-possession."—"The Desire of
 Ages," pp. 619, 620.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
    The requirements of true hospitality.
    Hypocrisy as one of the worst forms of evil.
    Possibility of hindering others in Christian experience.
    Significance of the word "ought."

MEMORY VERSE: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." Luke
  12 :34.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," p. 408; "Christ's Object Lessons," pp.

                                ,       Multitude
  • 1. What shows the great interest , of the people to hear Jesus? Within
the hearing of the people, what warning did. He give His disciples? Luke
12:1.
    NOTE.—"The religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God's glory is
the motive implanted by the Holy Spirit; and only the effectual working of
the Spirit can implant this motive. Only the power of, God can banish self-
seeking and hypocrisy. This change is the sign of. His working. When the
faith we accept destroys selfishness and pretense, when it leads us to seek
God's glory and not our own, we may know that it is of the right order."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 409.
     2. How fully will all hypocrisy be exposed? What is said of words
spoken with great secrecy? Verses 2, 3.
    NOTE.—The expression "proclaimed upon the housetops" is suggestive of
the customs of the governors of the country districts in Palestine. The public
crier' ascends a high roof, and lifts up his voice in a long-drawn call upon all
faithful subjects to give ear and obey. He then announces, in a set form, what
is the will of their master, and demands obedience there10.
    3. Of whom should no one be afraid? What is the worst an enemy
can do? Whom should we fear? Verses 4, 5.
    NoTE.—Jesus is not here referring to that Christian virtue, fear to displease
God, but to the physical fear which is inspired by a sense of God's justice.
When God, amid the earthquake; thunder, and lightning of Mount Sinai,
pronounced His holy law, all Israel trembled, and said, "Let not God speak
with us, lest we die." Ex. 20:19. Even Moses, during the experiences at Mount
Sinai, said, "I exceedingly fear and quake," and at the burning bush it is
recorded that he feared to look upon God. If the Lord's faithful servant
trembled thus, how much more should the hardened sinner fear the righteous
 judgments of a just and holy God.

                     God's Care for His Children
   4. What two illustrations did Jesus give to show the Father's care for
His individual children? Verses 6, 7.

                          Confessing—Denying
    5. What will be the experience of those who confess Christ before men?
Verse 8.
   NOTE.—"He who would confess Christ, must have Christ abiding in him.
He cannot communicate that which he has not received. The disciples might
speak fluently on doctrines, they might repeat the words of Christ Himself;
but unless they possessed Christlike meekness and love, they were not con-
fessing Him. A spirit contrary to the spirit of Christ would deny Him, what-
ever the profession."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 357.
    6. What is awaiting those who deny Him? Verse 9.
   NorE.—"Men may deny Christ by evil-speaking, by foolish talking, by
words that are untruthful or unkind. They may deny Him by shunning We's
burdens, by the pursuit of sinful pleasure. They may deny Him by conforming
                                      [ 28 ]
to the world, by uncourteous behavior, by the love of their own opinions, by
justifying self, by cherishing doubt, borrowing trouble, and dwelling in dark-
ness. In all these ways they declare that Christ is not iri them."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 357.
                             The Holy Spirit
    7. What sin cannot be forgiven? Why? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—It is possible to drive the Spirit from us so that its pleading voice
cannot be heard. "Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts,"
for "the sin against the Holy Ghost is the sin of persistent refusal to respond
to the invitation to repent."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, June
29, 1879.
    8. What should not trouble us when we are brought to trial for our
faith? What special help is promised for such a time? Verses 11, 12.

               A Request From One of the Company
    9. What request concerning an inheritance was made of Jesus by one
of the company? How did Jesus reply to the request? Verses 13, 14.
    NOTE.—"Jesus could have told this man just what was right. He knew
the right in the case; but the brothers were in a quarrel because both were
covetous. Christ virtually said, It is not My work to settle controversies of
this kind. He came for another purpose, to preach the gospel, and thus to
arouse men to a sense of eternal realities."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 254.
    10. What instruction did this incident lead Jesus to give? Verse 15.
    NOTE.—"The only remedy for the sins and sorrows of men is Christ. The
gospel of His grace alone can cure the evils that curse society. The injustice •
of the rich toward the poor, the hatred of the poor toward the rich, alike have
their root in selfishness, and this can be eradicated only through submission
to Christ. He alone, for the selfish heart of sin, gives the new heart of love."--
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 254.
   11. In the parable which Jesus gave to illustrate His teaching, what
troubled the rich man? Verses 16, 17.
    12. What did he decide to do with his goods? How did he further
comfort his covetous soul? Verses 18, 19.
    NOTE.—"The rich man was in perplexity as to what he should do with his
produce. His barns were full to overflowing, and he had no place to put the
surplus of his harvest. He did not think of God, from whom all his mercies
had come. He did not realize that God had made him a steward of His goods,
that he might help the needy. He had a blessed opportunity of being God's
almoner, but he thought only of ministering to his own comfort.
    "The situation of the poor, the orphan, the widow, the suffering, the
afflicted, was brought to this rich man's attention; there were many places in
which to bestow his goods. He could easily have relieved himself of a portion
of his abundance, and many homes would have been freed from want, many
who were hungry would have been fed, many naked clothed, many hearts
made glad, many prayers for bread and clothing answered, and a melody of
praise would have ascended to heaven. The Lord had heard the prayers of
the needy, and of His goodness He had prepared for the .poor. Abundant
provision for the wants of many had been made in the, blessings bestowed
                                     ( 29 ]
               "I WILL PULL DOWN MY BARNS, AND BUILD GREATER."

upon the rich man. But he_closed his heart to the cry of the needy."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 256.
    13. What did God say to the rich man? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—How prone man is to trust in uncertain riches (1 Tim. 6:17), and
selfishly to hoard God's gifts which were meant to be used to bless humanity
and for the glory of God!
    "To live for self is to perish. Covetousness, the desire'of benefit for self's
sake, cuts the soul off from life. It is the spirit of Satan to get, to draw to
self. It is the spirit of Christ to give, to sacrifice self for the good of others."
—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 259.
    14. Who are like the foolish rich man? Verse 21.
    NoTE.—It is not a sin to have worldly possessions. The Lord expects us
to be diligent and saving that we may not only support ourselves, but be
able to help the needy and to give liberally to His work. The use we make of
what we have in this selfish-covetous age, is a good test of our Christian ex-
perience. " 'So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward
God.' The picture is true for all time. You may plan for merely selfish good,
you may gather together treasure, you may build mansions great and high,
as did the builders of ancient Babylon; but you cannot build wall so high or
gate so strong as to shut out the messengers of doom."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," pp. 258, 259.

                                 THE LESSON

                       Some Are Called "Blessed"
    1. What does Jesus say of His servants who are watching for His
second coming? What honor will He show them? Luke 12:37.
    NOTE.—This verse looks forward to that glorious event when Jesus will
invite His guests to partake of the supper prepared for them. The servant of
God, having been shown this scene in vision, says:
    "Oh, that 1 could talk in the language of Canaan, then could I tell a little
of the glory of the better world. I saw there tables of stone in which the
names of the 144,000 were engraved in letters of gold. After we beheld the
glory of the temple, we went out, and Jesus left us, and went to the city. Soon
we heard His lovely voice again, saying, 'Come, My people, You have come
out of great tribulation, and done My will; suffered for Me; come in to
supper, for I will gird Myself, and serve you.' We shouted, 'Alleluia! glory !'
and entered into the city. And I saw a table of pure silver; it was many miles
in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the fruit of the tree of life,
the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes, and many other kinds of
fruit."—"Early Writings," p. 19.
    2. What indicates that the exact time of His coming is not known?
Verse 38.
    NorE.—The time of watching and waiting referred to in this lesson is
helpfully commented on in "Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 190, 191:
    "What time is here referred to? Not to the revelation of Christ in the
clouds of heaven to find a people asleep. No ; but to His return from His
ministration in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, when He lays
off His priestly attire, and clothes Himself with garments of vengeance, and
when the mandate goes forth, 'He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and
he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be
righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.'

                        We Know Not the Hour
   3. How did Jesus illustrate the importance of continual watchfulness?
Verse 39.
  NOTE.—"Every moment that we are not on our watch we are liable to be
                                      f 31
 beset by the enemy, and are in great danger of being overcome by the powers
 of darkness. Satan commissions his angels to be vigilant, and overthrow all
 they can; to find out the waywardness and besetting sins of those who profess
 the truth, and throw darkness around them, that they may cease to be watch-
  ful, take a course that will dishonor the cause they profess to love, and bring
 sorrow upon the church. The souls of these misguided, unwatchful ones grow
 darker, and the light of heaven fades from them. They cannot discover their
 besetting sins, and Satan weaves his net about them, and they are taken in his
 snare."—"Early Writings," p. 105.
      4. What exhortation should now be heeded? Why is this necessary?
 Verse 40.
     NOTE.—"When Jesus ceases to plead for man, the cases of all are forever
decided. This is the time of reckoning with His servants. To those who have
neglected the preparation of purity and holiness, which fits them to be waiting
 ones to welcome their Lord, the sun sets in gloom and darkness, and rises
not again. Probation closes; Christ's intercessions cease in heaven. This time
 finally comes suddenly upon all, and those who have neglected to purify their
souls by obeying the truth, are found sleeping. They became weary of waiting
and watching. . . . The Master anticipating all this, gives them timely warning
in the command to watch. He distinctly states the suddenness of His coming.
 He does not measure the 'time, lest we shall neglect a momentary preparation,
and in our indolence look ahead to the time when we think He will come,
and defer the preparation. 'Watch ye therefore; for ye know not.' Yet this
 foretold uncertainty, and' suddenness at last, fails to rouse us from stupidity
to earnest wakefulness, and to quicken our watchfulness for our expected
Master. Those not found waiting and watching, are finally surprised in their
unfaithfulness. The Master comes, and instead of their being ready to open
 unto Him immediately, they are locked in worldly slumber, and are lost at
last."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 191,
                   Peter's Qgestion and the Answer
    5. What question did one of the twelve ask? In reply what did Jesus
say the faithful would be doing? Verses 41, 42.
    NoTE.—"Those who are watching for the Lord, are purifying their souls
by obedience to the truth. With vigilant watching they combine earnest work-
ing. Because they know that the Lord is at the door, their zeal is quickened to
co-operate with the divine intelligences in working for the salvation of souls.
These are the faithful and wise servants who give to the Lord's household
`their portion of meat in due season.' They are declaring the truth that is
now specially applicableyAs Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses each declared
the truth for his time, so will Christ's servants now give the special warning for
their generation."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 634.
    6. What promise is made to those who are faithful? Verses 43, 44.

                   What Some Say in Their Hearts
    7. What will some of the servants say? What will these begin to do?
What will be the experience of the unfaithful servant? Verses 45, 46.
   NOTE.—"The evil servant says in his heart, 'My Lord delayeth his coming.'
He does not say that Christ will not come. He does not scoff at the idea of
His second coming. But in his heart and by his actions and words he declares
                                     32
 that the Lord's coming is delayed. He banishes from the minds of others the
 conviction that the Lord is coming quickly. His influence leads men to pre-
 sumptuous, careless delay. They are confirmed in their worldliness and stupor.
 Earthly passions, corrupt thoughts, take possession of the mind. The evil
•servant eats and drinks with the drunken, unites with the world in pleasure
 seeking. He smites his fellow servants, accusing and condemning those who
 are faithful to their Master."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 635.

                    The Measure of Responsibility
    8. Who is most responsible among the Lord's servants? Who will
receive the greater punishment? Verses 47, 48.
    NOTE.—As many prophets and kings had desired to witness the events
connected with Jesus' first coming (Luke 10:24), so the prophets have spoken
of, and looked forward to, the consummation of the Christian's hope (Acts
3:21) at His-second coming. We are living in the last generation, with the
light of all generations focused upon our pathway. To us much has been
given, and of us much will be required.
    "The Lord measures with exactness every possibility for service. The
unused capabilities are as much brought into account as are those that are
improved. For all that we might become through the fight use of our talents
God holds us responsible. We shall be judged according to what we ought to
have done, but did not accomplish because we did not use our powers to
glorify God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 363.

                Effect of the Preaching of the Gospel
     9. What did Jesus say He had come to send on the earth? Verse 49.
     10. What reference did He make to the suffering awaiting Him?
 Verse 50, margin.
     11. What sometimes results from the preaching of the gospel? Verses
51-53; Matt. 10:34-36.
     NoTE.—The gospel is a gospel of peace (Eph. 6:15), peace in the individual
 heart, and peace in society as far as its principles are received. But sin and ✓
 righteousness are in deadly conflict, and those who accept the gospel are
 often opposed by those who do not, just as Cain was opposed to Abel "because
 his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous." 1 John 3:12.

                    Signs That May Be Understood
     12. What did Jesus say concerning men's understanding of the signs
 in nature? Luke 12:54, 55.
     13. What is of far greater importance? Verse 56.
     NoTE.—"Everything in the world is in agitation. The signs of the times
 are ominous. Coming events cast their shadows before. The Spirit of God
 is withdrawing from the earth, and calamity follows calamity by sea and by
 land. There are tempests, earthquakes, fires, floods, murders of every grade.
 Who can read the future? Where is security? There is assurance in nothing
 that is human or earthly. . . .
     "The crisis is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the heavens,
 passing over its usual round, and the heavens still declare the glory of God.
 Men are still eating and drinking, planting and building, marrying, and giving
                                      [ 33 1
in marriage. Merchants are still buying and selling. Men are jostling one
against another, contending for the highest place. Pleasure lovers are still
crowding to theaters, horse races, gambling hells. The highest excitement
prevails, yet probation's hour is fast closing, and every case is about to be
eternally decided. Satan sees that his time is short. He has set all his agencies
at work that men may be deceived, deluded, occupied, and entranced, until
the day of probation shall be ended, and the door of mercy be forever shut."
—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 635, 636.
    14. What figure did Jesus use to emphasize the necessity of accepting
the provisions of reconciliation? Verses 57-59. '
                             THINK ON THESE THINGS
    The evidences of the nearness of the end.
    The proper "waiting" attitude.
    The danger of indifference.

 A Barren Fig Tree; Healing the Infirm Woman
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 13:1-17.
MEMORY VERSE: "If it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut
  it down." Luke 13:9.
STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 212-218 (new edition, pp. 215-221).
PLACE: Thought to be in one of the synagogues in Peres, east of Jordan.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; Jewish rulers and people; the infirm woman.
                                       THE LESSON

                     Jesus Corrects Mistaken Ideas
    1. What occurrence was related to Jesus by some who were listening
to His teaching? Luke 13:1.
    2. What error in the minds of the Jews did Jesus seek to correct?
Verse 2.
    NoTE.—Recall the question of the disciples concerning the blind man by
the wayside: "Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born
blind?" John 9: 2. Now again Jesus tried to impress upon them that physical
injuries or great misfortunes were not always the direct results of personal sins.
    3. What warning did He give in this connection? Verse 3.
    4. What further illustration did Jesus use to show that affliction and
calamity are not always results of our sins? Verse 4.
    5. What warning is repeated? Verse 5.
   6. How was this prediction terribly to be fulfilled in thr history of the
Jewish nation? Luke 19:43, 44.
                                           [ 34 )
    NOTE.—"As Jesus talked with the disciples and the multitude, He looked
forward with prophetic glance, and saw Jerusalem besieged with armies. He
heard the tramp of the aliens marching against the chosen city, and saw the
thousands upon thousands perishing in the siege. Many of the Jews were,
like those Galileans, slain in the temple courts, in the very .act of offering
sacrifice. The calamities that had fallen upon individuals were warnings
from God to a nation equally guilty. 'Except ye repent,' said Jesus, 'ye shall
all likewise perish.' For a little time the day of probation lingered for them.
There was still time for them to know the things that belonged to their peace."
—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 213, 214.

                          A Fruitless Tree
   7. In the parable of the fig tree, what disappointment did the owner
experience? Luke 13:6.
   8. What did he say to the gardener? Verse 7.
    9. How is the long-suffering patience of God illustrated in this parable?
Verses 8, 9.
    NOTE.—"The gardener does not refuse to minister to so unpromising a
plant. He stands ready to give it still greater care. He will make its surround-
ings most favorable, and will lavish upon it every attention.
    "The owner and the dresser of the vineyard are one in their interest in the
fig tree. So the Father and the Son were one in their love for the chosen
people. Christ was saying to His hearers that increased opportunities would
be given them. Every means that the love of God could devise would be put
in operation that they might become trees of righteousness, bringing forth
fruit for the blessing of the world. Jesus did not in the parable tell the result
of the gardener's work. At that point His story was cut short. Its conclusion
rested with the generation that heard His words. . .
    "The warning sounds down along the line to us in this generation. Are
you, 0 careless heart, a fruitless tree in the Lord's vineyard? Shall the words
of doom erelong be spoken of you? How long have you received His gifts?
How long has He watched and waited for a return of love? . . .
    "The barren tree receives the rain and the sunshine and the gardener's
care. It draws nourishment from the soil. But its unproductive boughs only
darken the ground, so that fruit-bearing plants cannot flourish in its shadow.
So God's gifts, lavished on you, convey no blessing to the world. You are
 robbing others of privileges that, but for you, might be theirs. You realize,
though it may be but dimly, that you are a cumberer of the ground. Yet in
His great mercy God has not cut you down. He does not look coldly upon
you. He does not turn away with indifference, or leave you to destruction. . . .
The pitying Saviour is saying concerning you, Spare it this year also, till I
shall dig about it and dress it."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 216-218.

                        A Great Sufferer Healed
    10. Who was present on one occasion as Jesus was teaching in a syna-
gogue? What day of the week was this? How long had this woman been
ill? Verses 10, 11.
    11. How was this woman healed? To whom did she givepraise? Verses
12, 13.
                                [ 35 1
    12. How did the ruler of the synagogue regard the miracle? What did
he say to the people? Verse 14.
    13. How did Jesus address the ruler? How did He show the incon-
sistency of the Jews? Verses 15, 16.
    NorE.—Note the statements of Jesus in contrasting His act in healing the
woman with the acts of the Jews in supplying the needs of their cattle:
    First, the woman was "a daughter of Abraham,"—one of the Israel of God,
vastly more important than the cattle.
    Second, she was bound by Satan,—under the power of one who would
do her all possible harm, in contrast with the kindly master of the cattle.
    Third, she had suffered for eighteen years, in contrast with the ordinary
thirst of the cattle.
    The argument was quite complete. Every reason for their action in caring
for the cattle had tenfold force as applied to what Jesus had done.
    14. How did these words affect the adversaries of Jesus? How did they
affect the people? Verse 17.
    NOTE.—The people in this country place were not so afraid of their religious
leaders as were the people in Galilee and Judea. Here they openly rejoiced in
the working of the power of God in healing one of their number.
                         THINK ON THESE THINGS
   Results "except ye repent."
   The patience of the gardener.
   Praise God for individual blessings.

                   Jesus Teaching the People
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 13:22-35.
MEMORY VERSE: "0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
  stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
  together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"
  Matt. 23:37.
STUDY HELPS: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pp. 198-210; "The De-
  sire of Ages," pp. 587, 588, 825-828.
PLACE: On the way to Jerusalem.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; Pharisees and the people; Herod mentioned.
                                  THE   LESSON
                         An Important Question
  1. While Jesus and His disciples were journeying toward Jerusalem,
what question was asked Him? Luke 1:3:22, 23.
                                         36
    2. What admonition did Jesus give in reply? Verse 24.
    NOTE.—"In the road to death the whole race may go, with all their world-
liness, all their selfishness, all their pride, dishonesty, and moral debasement.
There is room for every man's opinions and doctrines, space to follow his
inclinations, to do whatever his self-love may dictate. In order to go in the
path that leads to destruction, there is no need of searching for the way; for
the gate is wide, and the way is broad, and the feet naturally turn into the
path that ends in death."—"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pp.
198, 199.
                           "I Know You Not"
    3. What striking picture did Jesus present of the future experience of
a certain class of persons? What will the Lord say to them? Verse 25.
    4. Finding the door closed, what claims do they make to gain entrance?
Verse 26.
    5. What sorrowful but final answer do they receive? Verse 27.
    NoTE.—"The test of sincerity is not in words, but in deeds."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 272.
    "Saddest of all words that ever fell on mortal ear are those words of doom,
`I know you not.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 413.
    The class of persons described in Luke 13:25-27 are those who profess to
love God, and show great activity in good works, as many of the Jews did,
yet do not repent of their sins and obey the word of the Lord.
                 Birth or Position no Guarantee
   6. To what patriarchs did Jesus refer? How did He again remind the
Jews that natural descent from these did not secure admission to the
kingdom? Verse 28.
   7. Whence will those come who are saved? Verse 29.
    8. What shows that human calculations and reckonings will be re-
versed? Verse 30; Eccl. 9:11.
   Nors.—"The Jews had been first called into the Lord's vineyard ; and
because of this they were proud and self-righteous. Their long years of service
they regarded as entitling them to receive a larger reward than others. Nothing
was more exasperating to them than an intimation that the Gentiles were to
be admitted to equal privileges with themselves in the things of God. Christ
warned the disciples who had been first called to follow Him, lest the same
evil should be cherished among them."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 400.

                       A Warning of Danger
   9. Of what was Jesus warned by certain of the Pharisees? Luke 13:31.
   NOTE.—"Jesus had now been for some time in Perea, in the territory of
Antipas, the murderer of John. The intense unpopularity of the crime had,
doubtleSs, been a protection to Him; but, besides the fact that Antipas per-
sonally feared the great Miracle Worker, thinking He was perhaps the
murdered Baptist, risen from the dead, there were many other reasons why
he should wish Him fairly out of his dominions. Unwilling to appear in the
matter, he used the Pharisees, counting on their readiness to further his end.
                                        37 )
Some of their number, therefore, came to Christ, with the air of friends anxious
for His safety, and warned Him that it would be well for Him to leave Perea
as quickly as possible, as Herod desired to kill Him."—"Life and Words of
Christ," Geikie, vol. 2, p. 343.
    10. How did Jesus reply? Verses 32, 33.
   NorE.—"Jesus at once saw through the whole design, as a crafty plan of
Herod for His expulsion. But He was on His way to Jerusalem, and contented
Himself with showing that He gave no ground for political suspicion, and
that He quite well understood how little friendship there was in the advice the
Pharisees had given Him."—"Life and Words of Christ," Geikie, vol. 2, p. 343.
    11. 'What terrible crime did Jesus again connect with the history of
Jerusalem? Verse 33, last part.
                     Jesus Mourns Over Jerusalem
    12. What expression of sorrow did the memory of such things bring
from Jesus? What had He longed to do for the Jewish people? Verse 34.
    NOTE.—Jesus wept over Jerusalem, the capital city of the Jewish people.
He thought of the beautiful temple in which sacrifices were offered daily to
show the faith of the people in a Saviour for whom they were mistakenly still
looking. While they were still doing these things, He, the Lamb of God, the
Saviour of the world, was among them healing their sick, forgiving their sins,
and pointing out to them the way to heaven. But the saddest part of it all
was that they would not believe in Him, and were even then planning to put
Him to death. As Jesus thought of these things, His heart was overcome with
sorrow, and He cried out in anguish the words of Scripture used as the
memory verse for this lesson.
    13. Having rejected Jesus, in what condition would be the temple
when He should enter it no more? When would they next see Him?
Verse 35.
    NoTE.—"Your house." Jesus does not now speak of it as "My house," as
He had previously.
    The words, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord," were
spoken at the time of His triumphal entry into the city of Jerusalem. Another
time, yet future, when the wicked of earth will repeat those words, is mentioned
in "Early Writings," page 292: "All are seeking to hide in the rocks, to shield
themselves from the terrible glory of Him whom they once despised. And,
overwhelmed and pained with His majesty and exceeding glory, they with
one accord raise their voices, and with terrible distinctness exclaim, 'Blessed
is He that cometh in the name of the Lord I'"
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
      What makes the gate and pathway leading to heaven so narrow?
      Why some are denied entrance.
      What would make an earthly home "desolate"?
      The privilege of choice.

    Not since 1930 have the Sabbath schools given an "extra" mission offering
to South America. Then the "overflow" amounted to $1,873.29. In 1928 there
was an overflow for the Indian work of $22,732.50. Remember the needs of
South America next Sabbath by a generous Thirteenth Sabbath Offering.

                     The Quarter's Lessons
    Lesson 1.—Jesus tells the disciples of His coming, betrayal, and death.
He performs a miracle to provide tribute money for Himself and Peter.
He taught the disciples a lesson in humility, using a little child as an
illustration.
    Lesson 2.—Jesus sets forth the divine plan to be followed when there
is difficulty between brethren. He answers Peter's question concerning for-
giveness.
    Lesson 3.—Jesus interviews three prospective followers. He gives in-
structions to the seventy helpers whom He sent out. He pronounces woes
upon certain cities.
    Lesson 4.—Jesus then prays, then extends most earnest invitation to
all weary ones. Ten men were healed of a loathsome disease. One only
expressed his thankfulness.
   Lesson 5.—On a Sabbath day Jesus heals a man blind from his birth.
He answers the criticism of the Jews.
   Lesson 6.—Jesus explains that He is the Good Shepherd, and also the
door to the sheepfold. He reveals a great difference between the shepherd
and an hireling.
   Lesson 7.—Jesus taught many lessons in telling the parable of the
good Samaritan. He settled the question, Who is my neighbor/ so fre-
quently asked by the Jews.
   Lesson 8.—Jesus was entertained at the home of Mary and Martha.
He was also a guest at the home of a Pharisee. Instruction was given
contrary to the prevailing ideas of the Jews.
    Lesson 9.—Precious instruction given revealing the evil of the leaven
of the Pharisees, and the loving care of Jesus. Jesus spoke the parable of
the rich man who did not have room for his wealth.
   Lesson 10.—The necessity for continual watching was made clear.
Division in families sometimes results from the preaching of the gospel.
The signs of the times should be discerned by all. '
   Lesson 11.—Lessons of divine love and patience are drawn from a
barren fig tree. A woman ill for many years, is healed. Jesus answered
those who criticized.
   Lesson 12.—Jesus taught in the villages on His way to Jerusalem. He
wept over Jerusalem.
