                             Five Parables
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matthew .13:31-35, 44-53; Mark 4:30-34; Luke
13:18-21.
    MEMORY VERSE: "So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
forth, and sever the wicked from among the just." Matt. 13:49.
   STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 76-79, 95-123.
    PLACES: The parables of the mustard seed and the leaven seem to have been
spoken by the Sea of Galilee, probably near Capernaum. Later the multitude was
sent away, and Jesus entered into a house in Capernaum where He spoke the other
three parables in this lesson.
    PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; the multitude.

                                THE LESSON

                            The Mustard Seed
    1. After speaking the parable of the tares, to what else did Jesus liken
the kingdom of heaven? Matt. 13:31.
    2. How does the mustard seed compare in size with other seeds? When
the mustard plant is grown, how does it rank in size with other garden
herbs? Verse 32.
    NoTE.—It was customary among the Jews to employ the mustard seed
to denote anything very small. (See Matt. 17:20 and Luke 17:6.)
    In certain seasons, the traveler on the shores of Galilee may ride by
mustard bushes as high as his horse, and alive with birds feeding upon the seeds/
    "Not only is the growth of Christ's kingdom illustrated by the parable of
the mustard seed, but in every stage of its growth the experience represented
in the parable is repeated. For His church in every generation God has a
special truth and a special work. . . . And in this last generation the parable
of the mustard seed is to reach a signal and triumphant fulfillment. The little
seed will become a tree:"—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 78, 79.
    There is life and force and the power of propagation in a tiny seed. "Let
a seed be planted with a stone—flashing diamond or burning ruby; and while
that [the stone] in the richest soil remains a stone, this [the seed] awakes
and, bursting its dusky shell, rises from the ground to adorn the earth with
beauty, perfume the air with fragrance, or enrich men with its fruit. Such life '
there is in gospel truths."—Tarbell.

                                The Leaven
    3. What other parable did Jesus speak concerning the kingdom of
heaven? Verse 33.
    NOTE.—Observe the stress laid upon unnoticed beginnings. A small amount
of leaven permeates a large quantity of meal. Bigness does not signify great-
ness. Beware of even the first speck of sin; cherish the smallest holy impulse
to do right.
    "The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the whole mass
under its leavening process; so the leaven of truth works secretly, silently,
                                      [3 ]
steadily, to transform the soul. The natural inclinations are softened and
subdued. New thoughts, new feelings, new motives, are implanted. A new
standard of character is set up,—the life of Christ. The mind is changed;
the faculties are roused to action in new lines. Ma is not endowed with new
faculties, but the faculties he has are sanctified. . . Often the question arises,
Why, then, are there so many, claiming to beli e God's word, in whom there
is not seen a reformation in words, in spirit, and in character? Why are there
so many who cannot bear opposition to their purposes and plans, who manifest
an unholy temper, and whose words are harsh, overbearing, and passionate?
There is seen in their lives the same love of self, the same selfish indulgence,
the same temper and hasty speech, that is seen in the life of the worldling.
There is the same sensitive pride, the same yielding to natural inclination,
the same perversity of character, as if the truth were wholly unknown to
them. The reason is that they are not converted. They have not hidden the
leaven of truth in the heart. It has not had opportunity to do its work. Their
natural and cultivated tendencies to evil have not been submitted to its
transforming power. Their lives reveal the absence of the grace of Christ, an
unbelief in His power to transform the character."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," pp. 98-100.
                                                •
    4. What method did Jesus largely use in teaching the multitude?
What scripture was thus fulfilled? Verses 34, 35.
    NoTE.—"Natural things were the medium for the spiritual; the things
pf nature and the life experience of His hearers were connected with the truths
of the written word. Leading thus from the natural to the spiritual kingdom,
Christ's parables are links in the chain of truth that unites man with God,
and earth with heaven."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 17, 18.

                               The Treasure
    5. What lesson did Jesus seek to teach by the parable of the hidden
treasure? Verse 44.
    NOTE.—"This parable illustrates the value of the heavenly treasure, and
the effort that should be made to secure it. The finder of the treasure in the
field was ready to part with all that he had, ready to put forth untiring labor,
in order to secure the hidden riches. So the finder of heavenly treasure will
count no labor too great and no sacrifice too dear, in order to gain the
treasures of truth.
    "In the parable the field containing the treasure represents the Holy
Scriptures. And the gospel is the treasure. The earth itself is not so inter-
laced with golden veins and filled with precious things as is the word of
God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 104.
   6. How earnestly should we seek for the treasure which is hidden in
the word of God? Prov. 2:3-5.
    NOTE.—"He who would seek successfully for the hidden treasure must
rise to higher pursuits than the things of this world. His affections and all
his capabilities must be consecrated to the search."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
p. 112.
                        The Pearl of Great Price
  7. How did Jesus illustrate the worth of the kingdom of heaven?
Matt. 13:45, 46.
                                [4]
    NoTE.—"Christ Himself is the pearl of great price. In Him is gathered
all the glory of the Father, the fullness of the Godhead. He is the brightness
of the Father's glory and the express image of His person. The glory of the
attributes of God is expressed in His character. Every page of the Holy
Scriptures shines with His light. The righteousness of Christ, as a pure, white
pearl, has no defect, no stain. No work of man can improve the great and
precious gift of God. It is without a flaw."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 115.
    "The parable of the merchantman seeking goodly pearls has a double
significance: it applies not only to men as seeking the kingdom of heaven,
but to Christ as seeking His lost inheritance. Christ, the heavenly merchant-
man seeking goodly pearls, saw in lost humanity the pearl of price. In man,
defiled and ruined by sin, He saw the possibilities of redemption. Hearts
that have been the battle ground of the conflict with Satan, and that have
been rescued by the power of love, are more precious to the Redeemer than
are those who have never fallen. God looked upon humanity, not as vile
and worthless; He looked upon it in Christ, saw it as it might become through
redeeming love. He collected all the riches of the universe, and laid them
down in order to buy the pearl. And Jesus, having found it, resets it in His
own diadem. 'For they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an
ensign upon his land.' They shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that
day when I make up My jewels.'"—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 118.
                           A Fisherman's Net
   8. What familiar illustration did Jesus next use to represent another
phase of the kingdom of heaven? Verse 47.
   9. What doe; this parable teach concerning the relationship of the
good and the evil to the kingdom of heaven? Verse 48.
    10.' What great event is represented by the sorting of the fish? Verses
49, 50.
    NoTE.—"Both the parable of the tares and that of the net plainly teach
that there is no time when all the wicked will turn to God. The wheat and
the tares grow together until the harvest. The good and the bad fish are
together drawn ashore for a final separation.
    "Again, these parables teach that there is to be no probation after the
judgment. When the work of the gospel is completed, there immediately
follows the separation between the good and the evil, and the destiny of
each class is forever fixed. . . . Throughout the period of probationary time
His Spirit is entreating men to accept the gift of life. It is only those who
reject His pleading that will be left to perish. God has declared that sin must
be destroyed as an evil ruinous to the universe. Those who cling to sin will
perish in its destruction."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 123.
    11. After speaking these parables, what question did Jesus ask the
 disciples? What was their reply? Verse 51.
    12. By what comparison did Jesus illustrate the work of His followers?
 Verse 52.
    NOTE.—"The treasure gained by the householder he does not hoard. He
 brings it forth to communicate to others. And by use the treasure increases.
 The householder has precious things both new and old. So Christ teaches
 that the truth committed to His disciples is to be communicated to the world.
 And as the knowledge of truth is imparted, it will increase."—"Christ's Object
 Lessons," p. 124.
                                       [5 )
                       "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
    Not only is the growth of the kingdom illustrated by the mustard seed,
but in every stage of its growth the experience represented by the parable
is repeated.
    The leayen of truth works secretly, silently, steadily, to transform the soul.
    Did the man who found the hidden treasure reluctantly part with his
former possessions in order' to obtain it?
    How willing should we be to secure the Pearl of great price?
    What lesson that was taught by the parable of the wheat and tares is
also taught in the parable of the net?


       "Let the Sabbath school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance
   at the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for
   the next week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration
   during the week."—"Education," pp. 251, 252.

 Stilling the Tempest; The Demoniacs of Gadara
     LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 8:22-40; Matthew 8:23-34; Mark 4;35 to 5:20.
     MEMORY VERSE: "What manner of man is this! for He commandeth even
 the winds and water, and they obey Him." Luke 8:25.
     STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pages 333-341; "The Great Contro-
 versy," pages 513-515.
     PLACES: The Sea of Galilee; the desolate
                                            '  region between Gadara, off the
'southeast coast of the lake, and the lake.
    PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; two demoniacs; the keepers of the swine;
 the people of Gadara.
                                 THE LESSON

                           Stilling the Tempest
   1. Desiring one day to withdraw from the multitude, what did Jesus
suggest to the disciples? Where would the "other side" of the sea from
Capernaum be? Luke 8:22.
    2. As they sailed, how did the Master show His weariness? What
danger threatened? Verse 23.
   NoTE.—A modern author, writing on "Eastern Customs," says that "in
the flourishing epoch of Galilee, under the Roman rule, there were four
hundred vessels on the lake, where now there are scarcely a dozen." The
modern boats, he says, are all of the same type, and he thinks it probable
that they look very much like those used by the apostolic fishermen of Galilee.
"They are broad, with a very shallow keel, are decked at the bow and stern,
                                      [6)
which are high; have an open well in the center, where a mast can be stepped
[or erected] ; and are capable of accommodating from a dozen to twenty
men. Under the deck of the bow is a sort of open cabin, where there is room
for several men to lie down." It is said of Jesus, however, that when the
disciples awoke Him He was asleep "in the hinder part of the ship." Some
of the fishing boats may have had a little cabin in the bow, and others, a
cabin in the stern. It was evidently one of the latter in which the disciples
had embarked.
    3. What appeal did the disciples make? What did the Master then
do? Verse 24.
    NOTE.—The Master was weary, and in calm trust He slept. We may well
believe that "the prince of the power of the air" saw in the circumstances a
good opportunity to destroy Him, hence the storm which constantly increased
in power. The strong, hardy fishermen were afraid, and doubtless uttered,
as their own efforts seemed futile and their fate certain, all three appeals
recorded by the evangelists, indicating their increasing fear and intense desire
for their Lord's direction at such a time. They cry out, "Master, Master, we
perish"! Then as He slept on seemingly unmindful, there is a tone of reproach
in their cry, "Master, carest Thou not that we perish?" At last came the
earnest appeal, "Lord, save us: we perish." They did not yet know that
"anywhere with Jesus" was safety; that
                  "No water can swallow the ship where lies
                   The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies."

    4. What question of rebuke did Jesus ask? What was the state of
mind of the disciples? How did they express their amazement among
themselves? Verse 25.
    NOTE.—"How often the disciples' experience is ours! When the tempests
of temptation gather, and the fierce lightnings flash, and the waves sweep
over us, we battle with the storm alone, forgetting that there is One who ,can
help us. We trust to our own strength till our hope is lost, and we are ready
to perish. Then we remember Jesus, and if we call upon Him to save us, we
shall not cry in vain. Though He sorrowfully reproves our unbelief and
self-confidence, He never fails to give us the help we need."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 336.
    5. Where did the boat carrying Jesus and His disciples land? Verse 26.

                       The Demoniacs of Gadara
    6. When they landed, by whom were they met? Verse 27; Matt. 8:28.
    NOTE.—In the eighth chapter of Matthew it is stated that there were
two demoniacs. One of them was doubtless more conspicuous than the other.
In this account we have an example of Christ's ministry over the powers of
darkness. Satan, the chief of evil spirits, is the originator of warfare and
destruction. Rev. 12:7-9. Christ is the Prince of Peace. Isa. 9:6. The evil
spirits, true to their nature, were tormenting the poor men, driving them to
and fro like the waves of the sea driven by the winds. Christ, true to His _
nature, spoke peace, and the troubled souls had rest. What a perfect parallel
is this miracle to the stilling of the sea!
    7. What did the evil spirit cause the men to do and say? Luke 8:28.
                                       [71
    8. What had preceded the cry of the demoniacs? How fully were these
 men possessed of the demons? Verse 29.
    NoTE.—"With authority He bade the unclean spirits come out of them.
 His words penetrated the darkened minds of the unfortunate men. They
 realized dimly that One was near who could save them from the tormenting
 demons. They fell at the Saviour's feet to worship Him; but when their lips
 were opened to entreat His mercy, the demons spoke through them, crying
 vehemently, 'What have I to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God most
 high? I beseech Thee, torment me not.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 338.
      9. What questions did Jesus ask? What reply did He receive? Verse 30.
      10. Knowing that they must depart from the men, what request did
 the evil spirits make of Jesus? What was feeding near by? What was the
 second request of the demons? Verses 31, 32.
      11. What is made known to us concerning the origin of evil spirits?
 Rei. 12:7-9.
      NOTE.—"Evil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal in nature,
  power, and glory with the holy beings that are now God's messengers. But
  fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dishonor of God and the
  destruction of men. United with Satan in his rebellion, and with him cast
 out from heaven, they have, through all succeeding ages, cooperated with him
 in his warfare against the divine authority. We are told in Scripture of their
 confederacy and government, of their various orders, of their intelligence and
 subtlety, and of their malicious designs against the peace and happiness of
 men."—"The Great Controversy," p. 513.
      12. Where were the demons permitted to go? What was the result?
 Luke 8:33.
      NoTE.—"He [Jesus] allowed the evil spirits to destroy the herd of swine
 as a rebuke to those Jews who were raising these unclean beasts for the sake
 of gain. Had not Christ restrained the demons, they would have plunged
 into the sea, not only the swine, but also their keepers and owners. The
 preservation of both the keepers and the owners was due alone to His power,
 mercifully exercised for their deliverance."—"The Great Controversy," p. 515.
      13. How did this demonstration affect those who were feeding the
 swine? Where did they go? Verse 34.
  " 14. As the people heard of the miracle and came where Jesus was,
 what did they see? Verse 35.
      15. What did eyewitnesses of the miracle tell the people? In what
 request did the multitude unite? Verses 36, 37.
      16. What did the healed men desire to do? What special commission
 was given them? What shows their faithfulness? Verses 38, 39.
      NoTE.—Telling what great things the Lord has done is the true mission
 of every redeemed soul. How quickly God's message would go if every one
 professing His name would so respond ! And these men began their work
'near home. A lesson in this for us.
                         "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
     The only remedy for fear.
      From the example of the healed demoniacs, what is the mission of every
 believer?
     The danger that financial gain may blind the eyes to that which . is of
 far greater importance.

  The Daughter of Jairus; The Afflicted Woman
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Mark 5:21-43; Matt. 9:18-26; Luke 8:41-56.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith bath made thee
whole." Matt. 9:22.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pages 342-348; "The Ministry of Heal-
ing," pages 59-62.
    PLACES: By the seashore; the home of Jairus in Capernaum.
    PERSONS: Jesus and His discipled; the multitude; Jairus, ruler of the syna-
gogue, and his daughter twelve years of age; messengers; the afflicted woman; hired
mourners.
                                 THE LESSON

                             Request of Jairus
    1. After healing the demoniacs of Gadara, to what place did Jesus
return? Who were gathered to meet Hini? Mark 5:21.
    2. On this occasionowhat person of authority came to Jesus? What
attitude of humility did he assume? Verse 22.
    NOTE.—"The 'ruler of the synagogue' occupied a very important position.
In the temple synagogue he was the third officer in rank; the first officer
being the high priest, and the second the chief of the priests. In provincial
synagogues the 'ruler' was supreme. No one was eligible to this office until he
had a certificate from the great Sinhedrin that he possessed the requisite qual-
ifications. His election, however, was by the members of the, synagogue. It
was his duty to supervise all matters connected with worship!'— "Bible Man-
ners and Customs."
    3. What trouble had come upon Jairus? What evidence of faith in
Jesus did he give? Verse 23.
    4. How did Jesus respond? Who accompanied Him? Verse 24.
    NOTE.—"Jesus set out at once with the ruler for his home. Though the
disciples had seen so many of His works of mercy, they were surprised at His
compliance with the entreaty of the haughty rabbi; yet they accompanied
their Master, and the people followed, eager and expectant. The ruler's house
was not far distant, but Jesus and His companions advanced slowly, for the
crowd pressed Him on every side. The anxious father was impatient of
delay; but Jesus, pitying the people, stopped now and then to relieve some
suffering one, or to comfort a troubled heart."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 342.
                            The Touch of Faith
    5. Who was in the throng that followed Jesus? How long had this
woman been ill? How had she sought relief? With what result? Verses
25, 26.
    6. How did she manifest her faith that Jesus could heal her? What
was her thought as she pressed her way through the crowd? Verses 27, 28.
    NOTE.—"In making His way through the multitude, the Saviour came
                                   i9)
                               The Life-Giver

near to where the afflicted woman was standing. Again and again she had
tried in vain to get near Him. Now her opportunity had come. She could
see no" way of speaking to Him. She would not seek to hinder His slow
advarice: But she had heard that healing came from a touch of His garments;
and fearful of losing her one chance of relief, she pressed forward, saying to
herself, `If I may but touch His garment, I shall be whole.' Christ knew every
thoughtf.her mind, and He was making His way to where she stood. He
realized her great need, and He was helping her to exercise faith."—"The
Ministry of Healing," pp. 59, 60.
  ' 7. What blessing came to the woman through this touch of faith?,
 Verse 29.
     NorE.—One writer compares some men "to the, birds on a telegraph wire,:
 that are utterly unconscious of. the messages of sorrow, and joy, of business.
 and friendship, which are passing right under theirjeet. It heeds the' battery
 and cOnnecting instruments in order to read: whatThasses - on the wire. "It
 needs hearts of 'rove and faith, longingS for holiness,'and the spirit'of prayer,
 if we Would receive the blessings which Christ has for us all.".
     In that one touch was cpncentrated the faith of the Woman's life.
     8. Of what was Jesus, immediately conscious? • What conversation ,
 concerning this did Jesus have with His disciples? Verses 30, 31.
     NorE.2-What was it that went from Christ to the afflicted woman? It
 was just the thing that she stood in need of, and that was life. As soon as she.
 touched Jesus, she was made whole. Life ftOrri Jesus 'had' followed that touch
 of faith, and filled her. This-alse-was-wriOe                night-telleve-that

     9. What public testimony did the healed woman tremblingly bear?
 Verses 32, 33.
     10. What comforting words did Jesus speak to her? Verse,34.
                           A Message to Jairus
    11. While Jesus was thus delayed, what message came to Jairus from
his home? How did Jesus encourage the sorrowing ruler? Verses 35, 36.
    12. Who only were permitted to continue the journey with Jesus to
the home of Jairus?. Verse 37.
    13. What situation did Jesus find• on His arrival at the home? Verse 38..
    NorE.—Noisy demonstrations of grief at the death of a friend are common
in some Eastern communities. As soon as a person dies, all the women "in the
family set up a loud and doleful cry. They continue it as long as they can
without taking breath, and the shriek of wailing dies away in a low sob.
Nor do the relatives satisfy themselves with these expressions of violent grief.
They hire persons of both sexes, whose employment it is to mourn for the
dead in like frantic manner. (See Amos 5:16; Jer. 9:20.)"—Barnes.

     14. What did Jesus say to those who were wailing? How did they
express their incredulity? 'Whom alone did Jesus perniit to go into the room
where the child lay? Verses 39, 40.            •
    NOTE.—"Jairus pressed closer to the Saviour, and together 'they hurried
to the ruler's home.. Already the hired mourners and flute players' were there,
filling the air with their clamor: The presence of the crowd; and the tumult,
jarred upon the spirit of. Jesus. He tried to silence them, saying, 'Why make
ye this ado, and weep? the dainsel is not 'dead, but sleepeth.' They were
indignant at the words of the stranger. They had seen the child in the embrace
of death, and they laughed •Him to scorn. Requiring them all to leave the
house, Jesus took with Him the father and mother of the maiden, and the
three distipIes, Peter, James- and John, and together'they entered the chamber
of death."—"The Desire ofAkes,"

  this miracle affect those who were there? Verses 41, 42.
      NOTE.—"Jesus approached the bedside, and taking the child's hand in
  His own, He pronounced softly, in the familiar language of her home, the
  words, 'Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.' Instantly a tremor passed through
  the unconscious form. The pulses of life beat again. The lips unclosed with
  a smile. The eyes opened widely as if from sleep, and the maiden gazed with
  wonder on the group beside her. She arose, and her parents clasped her in
  their arms, and wept for joy."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 343.

     MEMORY VERSE: "Then touched He their eyes, saying, According to your
 faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened?' hIatt. 9:29, .30.

     PLACES: Roads and paths through Galilee; in the synagogues of cities and
 villages.
     PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; two blind men; a dumb man; the Pharisees
 and the multitude.
                                   THE LESSON

                         Healing the Blind Men
     1. After Jesus had healed the daughter of Jairus, who followed Him?
 What did these men cry out? Matt. 9:27.
     Nom.—The cry of these blind men was "a recognition of His [Christ's]
 dignity as the Messiah; for this name, 'Son of David,' was the popular designa-
 tion of the Messiah. There was, therefore, upon their part a double confession
 of faith, first; that He could heal them, and secondly, not merely as a prophet
 from God, but as the Prophet, as the One who should come, according to the
 words of Isaiah, to give sight to theblind."—Trench.
     There are several instances in the four Gospels where the phrase "son of
 David" is used in referring to Jesus. The Jews commonly believed, according
 to the Scriptures, that the Messiah would be the Son of David (John 7:42) ;
 but they were greatly offended at having such language applied to Jesus,
 and for this reason tried to stop it. (See-Matt. 20:30,'31.) Those who made
 use of the term were convinced that He was the son of David and therefore the
 Messiah. Their very cry for help acknowledged Him as the Christ.
                                        [ 12]
    2. As they urged their plea, into what place did the blind men follow
Jesus? What pointed question did He ask them? What did they reply?
Verse 28.                                    .1                  .
    NorE.—Blind men and other unfortunates frequented the highways in Pal-
estine, begging of the passer-by. The afflicted men in the lesson were probably
of this class. One writer says: "Blindness was, and is, one of the commonest
afflictions of the natives of Palestine. The blear eyes, often crusted round with
dried secretion and fly-infested, make some of the most sickening sights in a
Syrian village crowd." The filth and dust in which the people live, the intense
brightness of the sun, the fine dust in the air of those sandy countries, the
great changes of temperature at different times of day and night may be given
as reasons for the frequency of eye trouble.
    3. What did Jesus then do and say? With what result? Verses 29, 30,
first part.
    4. What command did Jesus give them? How was His request disre-
girded? Verses 30, last part, 31.
    NOTE.—No doubt Jesus wished to be spared all unnecessary publicity.
Had He at this comparatively early period of His ministry fully manifested
Himself as the Messiah, the people might have tried to make Him king, as
they thought to do near the close of His ministry. Such an attempt would
have increased the hatred of the Jewish rulers and aroused the suspicions of
the Roman government and thereby serious obstacles would have been raised
which, humanly speaking, would have greatly hindered the work Christ came
to do.
                          A Dumb Man Healed
    5. As they went out of the house, who was brought to Jesus? Verse 32.
   6. What caused the affliction of this man? What miracle was per-
formed? What was the effect on the multitude? Verse 33.
    7. What did the Pharisees say concerning the power by which Jesus
cast out devils? Verse 34.
   NOTE.—In commenting on Matthew 12:22-30, which records an instance
similar to the one in this lesson, the author of "The Desire of Ages" says: "It
was just before this that Jesus had a second time performed the miracle of
healing a man possessed, blind and dumb, and the Pharisees had reiterated the
charge, 'He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.' Christ told
them plainly that in attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan, they
were cutting themselves off from the fountain of blessing. Those who had
spoken against Jesus Himself, not discerning His divine character, might re-
ceive forgiveness; for through the Holy Spirit they might be brought to see
their error and repent. Whatever the sin, if the soul repents and believes, the
guilt is washed away in the blood of Christ; but he who rejects the work of
the Holy Spirit is placing himself where repentance and faith cannot come to
him. It is by the Spirit that God works upon the heart; when men willfully
reject the Spirit, and declare it to be from Satan, they cut off the channel by
which God can communicate with them. When the Spirit is finally rejected,
there is no more that God can do for the soul. . .
   "It is not God that blinds the eyes of men or'hardens their hearts. He sends
them light to correct their errors, and to lead them in safe paths; it is by
                                       { 13}
the rejection of this light that the eyes'are blinded and the heart hardened..
Often the process is gradual, and almost imperceptible. Light comes to the
soul through God's word, through His servants, or by the direct agency of His
Spirit; but when one ray of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing
of the spiritual perceptions, and the second revealing of light is less clearly
discern6d. So the darkness increases, until it is night in the soul."—Pages
321,. 322.
                         Healing and Teaching
    8. How extensively did Jesus carry forward His work? Verse 35, first
part.
    9. What three things in particular did Jesus do as He traveled about?
Verse 35, last part.
   NOTE,—"During His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to healing. the sick
than to preaching. His miracles testified to the truth of. His words, that He-
came not to destroy, but to save. His righteousness went before Hitn, and
the glory of the Lord was his rearward. Wherever He went the tidings•of
His mercy preceded Him. Where He had passed, the objects of His compas-
sion were rejoicing in health, and making trial of their new-found powers.
Crowds were collecting around them to hear from their lips the works that
the Lord had wrought. His voice was the first sound that many had ever
heard, His name the first word they had ever spoken, His face the first
they had ever looked upon. Why should .they not love Jesus, and sound His
praise? As He passed thrOugh the towns and cities,He was like a vital cur-
rent, diffusing light and joy wherever He went."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 350.
   10. What condition among the people aroused His pity? Verse 36,
note margin.
   11. What did He say directly to His disciples? Verse 37.
   12. For what did He ask them to pray? Verse 38.
   NoTE.—Now, as then, many of the people are Without a shepherd, and the
close of probation is drawing near. The harvest of the earth is nearly ripe,
and is soon to be gathered. In a special sense should the people of the Lord
earnestly pray at this time, that the Lord of the harvest will raise up laborers,
and send them forth into the field to give the last call of salvation.

                      "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
    How sinners are like blind men.
    How a shiner's eyes may be opened.
    The most serious mistake of the Pharisees. Why?

triumphs won."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 59.

                   Sending Out the, Twelve
   LESSON. SCRIPTURES: Mait. 16:1-2.3; Mark 6:7-13;' Luke 9:1-6.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Freely ye have received, freely give." Matt. 10:8.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 349-355.
   PLACE: Galilee.
   PERSONS: Jesus and the twelve disciples.
                                THE LESSON
                       Power, Given to the Twelve
     1: Whoni did jesith- at one• time call together? What power did He give
to them? What did Jesus then do? Matt. 10:1-5, first claiise.
     NOTE.—"The apostles were members of the family of Jesus, and they had
accompanied.Him•as He traveled- on foot through Galilee. They had shared
with Him the toils and hardships that overtook them., They had listened to
His discourses, they had walked and talked with the Son of God, and from
His daily instruction they had learned how to work for the elevation of hu-
manity. As Jesus ministered to the vast multitudes that gathered about Him,
His disciples were in attendanee, eager to do His bidding and to lighten His
labor. They assisted in arranging the people, bringing the afflicted ones to the
Saviour, and promoting the comfort of all. They watched for interested hear-
ers, explained the Scriptures to them, and in various ways worked for their
spiritual benefit. Tlie}k taught what they had learned of Jesus, and were every
day obtaining a rich experience. But they needed also an experience in labor-
ing alone. They were still in need of much instruction, great patience and
tenderness. Now, while He was personally with them to point out their
errors, and counsel-and correct them, the Saviour sent them forth as His rep-
reSentatives."—"The Desire of Ages," .p. 349.
     2. Name the twelve apostles. Verses 2-4.
     NorE.—The primary meaning of "disciple" is learner, passing over into the
meaning of one who follows another in order to learn. Up to this time, the
twelye had been learners in the school of Christ. Jesus had chosen them to be
intimately associated with Him daily, that they might learn from the wonder:
ful words which fell from His lips; witness the exercise of His power to com-
fort the sorrowing, heal the sick, and raise the dead; and observe how to meet
the accusations of critical and hostile men under all sorts of conditions. Now
 Jesus was to send them' forth to do a similar work, and they were now called
apostles,—sent ones.
    •"Calling .the twelve about Him, Jesus bade them go out two and two
 through the towns and villages. None were sent forth alone, but brother' was
associated with. brother, friend with friend. Thus they could help and encour-
age each other, counseling and praying together, each one's strength supple-
 menting the other's weakness."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 350.
                      To Whom Were They. Sent?
    3. In the beginning of their ministry, to what people did Jesus charge
the twelve not to go? To whom was their mission to be? Verses 5, 6.
                                     [ 15 3
    NOTE.—"If they had now preached the gospel to the Gentiles or the Samari-
tans, they would have lost their influence with the Jews. By exciting 'the
prejudice of the Pharisees they would have involved themselves in controversy
which would have discouraged them at the outset of their labors. Even the
apostles were slow to understand that the gospel was to be carried to all na-
tions. Until they themselves could grasp this truth, they were not prepared to
labor for the Gentiles. If the Jews would receive the gospel, God purposed to
make them His messengers to the Gentiles. Therefore they were first to• hear
the message."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 351.
                       Their Message and Work
     4. What message were they to preach? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—The first message preached by John the Baptist, the first by Jesus
Himself, was to be the first preached by the apostles also,—"The kingdom of
heaven is at hand." Heaven was truly come down to earth. The principles of
the kingdom were taught and lived. Earth was becoming lightened with
its glory.
     5. What work were they to do in connection with their preaching? In
what spirit were they to labor? Verse 8.
    NoTE.—"Freely," not merely abundantly, but without pay.

                             Temporal Needs
    6. What customary preparation for traveling were the twelve not to
make? Verses 9, 10.
    7. How were they to obtain a place to live when they went into a
strange city? What should they do on entering a house? On what condi-
tions were they to impart peace to a house? Verses 11-13.
    NOTE.—The customary Oriental salutation was, "Peace be to this house."
    "Peace, among the Hebrews, had a very extensive meaning:—it compre-
hended all blessings, spiritual and temporal. . . . To wish peace to a family,
in the name and by the authority of Christ, was in effect a positive promise on
the Lord's side, of all the good implied in the wish. This was paying largely
even beforehand. . . . If that house be worthy. If that family be proper for
a preacher to lodge in, and the master ready to embrace the message of salva-
tion. Your peace. The blessings you have prayed for, shall come upon the
family: God will prosper them in their bodies, souls and substance."—Dr.
Adam Clarke.
    8. What were the disciples to do if they were not made welcome in
any place? How grievous a sin did Jesus count the rejection of these
messengers of God? Verses 14, 15.
    NoTE.—To shake the dust off their feet was not meant to show resent-
ment or wounded dignity, but to impress upon the people how grievous and
serious a thing it is to refuse the Lord's message, and to turn a deaf ear to
 His messengers. To reject the servants of the Lord is to reject the Lord
Himself.
    "To shake the dust of any city of Israel from off one's clothes or feet, was
an emblematical action, signifying a renunciation of all further connection
with them, and placing them on a level with the cities of the heathen."—Dr.
Adam Clarke.

                         As Sheep Among Wolves
    9. In sending His disciples forth to meet the wickedness of evil men,
what comparisons did Jesus make? Verse 16.
    10. Of whom were they to beware? For what reason? Before whom
would they be brought? Verses 17, 18.                                             •
    NOTE.—Jesus says that the faithful worker will be called before civil
authorities "for My sake," or more exactly, "because of Me." The teaching
and preaching of Jesus stirs up the wolfish nature in unrepentant or bigoted
hearts. The purpose in allowing His servants to be persecuted is here made
clear: "for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles." A. R. V. The gospel
must reach men in authority, and often the only way to get their ear is through
the trial of God's children before civil courts. The worker, then, is to recognize
such an occasion as his opportunity to bear witness for Jesus.
    11. Under such circumstances, about what need His children not be
anxious? How does the Father help them in the hour of trial? Verses 19, 20.
    NOTE.—"The servants of Christ were to prepare no set speech to present
when brought to trial. Their preparation was to be made day by day in
treasuring up the precious truths of God's word, and through prayer strength-
ening their faith. When they were brought into trial, the Holy Spirit would
bring to their remembrance the very truths that would be needed. A daily,
earnest striving to know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, would
bring power and efficiency to the soul. The knowledge obtained by diligent
searching of the Scriptures, would be, flashed into the memory at the right
time. But if any had neglected to acquaint themselves with the words of
Christ, if they had never tested the power of His grace in trial, they could not
expect that the Holy Spirit would bring His words to their remembrance."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 355.
    12. How bitter will persecution for Jesus' sake become in some in-
stances? What assurance is given to the faithful? Verses 21, 22.
    NoTE.—The martyrs have not all been burned at the stake, nor have they
all died in dungeons. Some are in homes suffering for the truth's sake. As a
result of obeying God and walking in the light, wives have borne persecution
from husbands, and husbands from wives, parents from children, and even
children from parents. To stand true to God under such circumstances
requires a martyr's spirit and a heart made strong by the love of God. Though
the gospel is a gospel of peace to those who receive it, its rejection often
causes suffering and sorrow. But the Lord admonishes His people under all
circumstances to stand without wavering.
    13. 'What were the disciples instructed to do when persecuted? Verse 23.
    Nom—Fleeing, though apparently an act of cowardice, is often the better
part of wisdom. There is such a thing as a masterly retreat in time of battle,
to save the lives of men, and conserve fighting strength. In gospel work, the
seeds of truth must be scattered. Persecution scattered the early Christians
away from Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and they "went every-
where preaching the word."
                        "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
    The need of laborers to-day.
    The spirit of persecution in these days.
    The value to us of the instruction given to the twelve.
    The only way to "get ready" for a defense before governors and kings.

   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 10:24 to 11:1.

a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in
nowise lose his reward." Matt. 10:42.

   PLACES AND PERSONS: Galilee; Jesus and the twelve disciples.

                                  THE LESSON

                  The Relation of Disciple to Master
    1. How is the disciple not related to his Master? What is it enough
for a disciple to be? Matt. 10:24, 25, first part.
    NOTE.—One who keeps this instruction in his heart, will never complain
of his lot or his sufferings. How many irregular thoughts, how much bitter-
ness of soul, these words should restrain.
    2. As Master of the house, what had Jesus been called? Verse 25,
last part.
    NOTE.—The name "Beelzebub" is derived from a heathen god. The Jews
applied it to Satan. Luke records the fact that some of the Jews had said
that 'Jesus had cast out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
Luke 11:15.
    3. For what reason does Jesus encourage His disciples not to fear
such treatment? Verse 26.
    4. How was the truth to be proclaimed? Verse 27.
    NoTE.—In Eastern countries, the housetops are usually fiat. When a death
occurs in a dwelling, the mourners, mostly hired for that purpose, go to the
housetops, where they attract attention by their loud wailing and lamentation.
From the housetops, decrees and proclamations of civil authorities are made.
These proclamations are generally made in the evening, when the streets are
full after the people have returned from their labors in the field. The public
crier ascends to the highest roof, and lifts up his voice in a long-drawn call
upon all faithful subjects to give ear and obey. He then proceeds to announce
the will of their master, and demands obedience. The call to divine worship
is often made from the housetop in the absence of a tower or a bell. Jesus
taught His disciples that they were to go to the multitudes, and there proclaim
the truth with courage and power.
                                    Fear Not
    5. What boldness yet what fear did Jesus urge upon His followers?
Verse 28.
    NOTE.—"Jesus assures His disciples of God's sympathy for them in their
needs and weaknesses. Not a sigh is breathed, not a pain felt, not a grief
pierces the soul, but the throb vibrates to the Father's heart."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 356.
                                    1' 18 'I
    6. What striking illustration is given of the care of our heavenly'
Father for His children? Verses 29-31.
 • NoTE.—God's greatness is seen _in His care for the most minute objects of
His creation as well as in making -and upholding worlds. Not a sparrow is
uncared for by Him. If one falls, He sees it. Even the hairs of our head are
numbered! This reveals a most wonderful and intimate knowledge of God
concerning us. Small comfort this for hypocrites, and lukewarm professors;
but for the trusting child of God it brings peace, and banishes from the heart
all needless anxiety and worry. "Casting all your care, upon Him; for He
careth for you." 1 Peter 5:7.
                        Confessing and Denying
    7. What promise is made to those who faithfully confess Jesus before
Op world? Verse 32.
    NOTE.—"Jesus continues: As you confess Me before men, so I will confess
You before God and the holy angels. You are to be My witnesses upon earth,
Aannels through which My grace can flow for the healing of the world. So
I will be your representative in heaven. The Father beholds not your faulty
character, but He sees you as clothed in My perfection. I am the medium
through which Heaven's blessings shall come to you. And every one who
confesses Me by sharing My sacrifice for the lost, shall be confessed as a
sharer in the glory and joy of the redeemed."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 357.
    8. What is said of those who deny Him before others? Verse 33: -
    NOTE.—"A spirit contrary to the spirit of Christ would deny Him, what-
ever the profession. Men may deny Christ by evil speaking, by foolish talking,
by words that are untruthful or unkind. They may deny Him by shunning
life's burdens, by the pursuit of sinful pleasure. They may deny Him by.
conforming to the world, by uncourteous behavior, by the love of their, own'
opinions, by justifying self, by cherishing doubt, borrowing tiOuble, and
dwelling in darkness. In all these ways they dedare that Christ is not in them."
 —"The Desire of Ages," p. 357.
                       Concerning Jesus' Mission
    9. What surprising statement did Jesus then make concerning His
mission to this earth? Verse 34.
    NorE.—The prophet names Jesus "the Prince of Peace." Isa. 9:6. At His
birth, an angelic host sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good will toward men." Luke 2:13, 14. How, then, are we' to account for
these words in verses 34, 35? The Spirit of Christ is not at war with men,
but with principles. Light and darkness 'will not blend. Oil and water will
not mix. Jesus came to deliver man from the bondage of sin. To those who
receive Him, He brings peace. In the hearts of those who reject Him there is
war. While Christ came to give peace to all, His coming challenges the powers
of darkness in the hearts of men. Thus it is said that the gospel divides
families, and rends asunder the strongest ties of nature ; but in reality, it is
sin that brings division when some members of a family refuse to yield to
righteousness.
    10. How .are some human relationships affected by His teachings?
Verses 35, 36.
    11. How may we become unworthy of Jesus? What must the followers
of Jesus bear? Verses 37, 38.
                                     [ 19 3
   12. What vital principle of the spiritual life does Jesus set forth?
Verse 39.                                                 .•
   NorE.—He who clings selfishly to this present life, using it for his own
comfort and pleasure, will lose eternal life with its everlasting joys. One who
gives up this life to be used for the good of others, as God may direct, will
have life eternal.
         Blessings Upon Those Who ReCeive His Disciples
    13. How closely does Jesus ally His followers with Himself and the
Father? Verse 40.
    14. How does our attitude toward God's messengers affect our reward?
Verse 41.                                        •         .
    15. 'What assurance is given that the smallest act of kindness is noted
in heaven? Verse 42.
                       Departing to Other Cities
   16. When Jesus had ended His instruction to the twelve, what did He
do? Matt. 11:1.
                        "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
     The instruction in this lesson which is applicable to me.
     The strongest influence,—love or fear.
     Danger of careless denial of Christ.

6:1-21.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good

                                 THE LESSON

                       The Return of the Twelve
'   1. Returning to Jesus from their first missionary tour, what did the
disciplesirelate to Him? Mark 6:30.
    NOTE.—"The disciples came to Jesus and told Him all things. Their
intimate relationship with Him encouraged them to lay before Him their
favorable and unfavorable experiences, their joy at seeing results from their
labors, and their sorrow at their failures, their faults, and their weaknesses.
They had committed errors in their first work as evangelists, and as they
frankly told Christ of their experiences, He saw that they needed much
                                      {20]
instruction. He saw, too, that they had become weary in their labors, and
that they needed to rest."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 359.
    2. Realizing their need of rest, what did Jesus say to them? Where
did they go? Verses 31, 32.
                         An Eager Multitude
    3. What shows the eagerness of the people to be with Jesus? Verse 33.
    4. How did Jesus feel concerning the multitude? What did He begin
to do? Verse 34.
                      Perplexity of the Disciples
    5. As night approached, what did the disciples suggest to Jesus?
Verses 35,-36.
    6. What was Jesus' reply? Who of the disciples questioned their ability
to feed so many? Verse 37; John 6:7.
    7. What discovery was made by another disciple? Verses 8, 9.
                      Jesus Feeds the Multitude
     8. What command did Jesus give concerning the multitude? Mark
6 : 39, 40.
     9. What did Jesus then do in the sight of the people? What part did
the disciples act?. How amply were the needs of all supplied? Verses 41, 42.
     10. What was done with the fragments? How much food remained
uneaten? How many persons were fed? Verses 43, 44; Matt. 14:21.
     NOTE.—"Christ never worked a miracle except to supply a genuine neces-
sity, and every miracle was of a character to lead the people to the tree of
life, whose leaves are for the healing of the nations. The simple food passed
round by the hands of the disciples contained a whole treasure of lessons. It
was humble fare that had been provided; the fishes and barley loaves were
the daily food of the fisher folk about the Sea of Galilee. Christ could have
spread before the people a rich repast, but food prepared merely for the
gratification of appetite would have conveyed no lesson for their good. Christ
taught them in this lesson that the natural provisions of God for man had
been perverted. And never did people enjoy the luxurious feasts prepared for
the gratification of perverted taste as this people enjoyed the rest and the
simple food which Christ provided so far from human habitations."—"The
 Desire of Ages," pp. 366, 367.
                  They Would Make Him a King
   11. What did those say who saw this miracle? What did Jesus perceive
that the multitude would try to do? John 6:14, 15.
    NoTi.—"The Jews had often suffered by famine in those times in which
their enemies were permitted to prevail over them; but finding that Jesus
had such power as to multiply a few loaves to feed thousands, they took it
for granted that while He was at their head, no evil could possibly happen
to them; and therefore were determined immediately to proclaim Him king."
—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    12. What precaution did Jesus take which hindered the people from
carrying out their. desire? Matt. 14:22, 23.
                                   r 21
                          "It is I; be not afraid."

    NorE.—"Violence and insurrection would follow an effort to place Him
on the throne, and the work of the spiritual kingdom would be hindered.
Without delay the movement must be checked. Calling His disciples, Jesus
bids them take the boat, and return at once to Capernaum, leaving Him to
dismiss the people. Never before had a command from Christ seemed so
impossible of fulfillment. The disciples had long hoped for a popular move-
ment to place Jesus on the throne; they could not endure the thought that
all this enthusiasm should come to nothing. . . . They protested against the
arrangement; but Jesus now spoke with an authority He had never before
assumed toward them. They knew that further opposition on their part
would be useless, and in silence they turned toward the sea. Jesus now com-
mands the multitude to disperse; and His manner is so decisive that they
dare not disobey."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 378.
                            A Storm at Sea
  13. What hardship did the disciples experience in crossing the lake?
Who saw them as they toiled at the oars? When did Jesus go to them?
How did He go? Mark 6:48.
                                   [22 7
    NOTE.—The night was divided-into four.watches:of three hours each. In
"the fourth watch" would therefore mean from three to six o'clock in the
morning. Fr6m this record we may infer that Jesus spent most of the night
in prayer, while the disciples had been battling against contrary rinds; Making
so little headway that in the fourth watch they were only "in the midst of
the sea."
    14. When the disciples saw Jesus, what did they think? How did they
show their alarm? How did Jesus quiet their fears? Matt. 14:25-27.

                           Peter's Experience
   15. What strange request did Peter make? What permission was given
him? What was he able to do for a time? Verses 28, 29.
    16. What caused Peter to begin to sink? What cry did he utter?
Verse 30.
    17. How quickly did Jesus respond? What words of reproof did He
kindly speak? Verse 31.
    NOTE.—Peter's failure in the physical act of walking on the sea, was owing
to the same thing that brings failure to us many times on the sea of life,—
doubt. It makes all the difference in the world whether our faith is based on
the definite word of God, or whether we look upon conditions around us
that seem contrary.

                            A Quick Landing
   18. What change came to pass as soon as Jesus entered the ship? What
did those, in the ship do and say? Verses 32, 33.
   NoTE.—"When trouble comes upon us, how often we are like Peter. We
look upon the waves, instead of keeping our eyes fixed upon the Saviour. Our
footsteps slide, and the proud waters go over our souls. Jesus did not bid
Peter come to Him that he should perish; He does not call us to follow Him,
and then forsake us."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 382.
    19. Where did they land? What blessing did Jesus bring to that
region? Mark 6:53-56.
                       "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
    Human need leads men to throng about Jesus. The different motives they
may have.
    Jesus knows our need of rest.
    The cause of the failure of Peter. Make an application of his experience
to your own life.

                                THE LESSON

                           Searching for Jesus
    1. What efforts did the people, make to find Jesus on the day after
the feeding of the five thousand? John 6:22-24.
    NOTE.—"The miracle of the loaves was reported far and near, and very
early next morning the people flocked to Bethsaida to see Jesus. They came
in great numbers, by land and sea. Those who had left Him the preceding
night returned, expecting to find Him still there; for there had been no boat
by which He could pass to the other side. But their search was fruitless, and
many repaired to Capernaum, still seeking Him."—"The Desire of,"        ges
p. 383.
                              Wrong Motives
    2. When they found Jesus, what question did the people ask? What
reason did Jesus give for their seeking Him? Verses 25, 26.
    NorE.—"After a time He [Jesus] went to the synagogue, and there those
who had come from Bethsaida found Him. They learned from His disciples
how He had crossed the sea. . . . Not content with this, however, many
gathered about Jesus, questioning, 'Rabbi, when tamest Thou hither?' They
hoped to receive from His own lips a further account of the miracle. Jesus
did not gratify their curiosity. He sadly said, 'Ye seek Me, not because ye
saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.' They
did not seek Him from any worthy motive; but as they had been fed with
the loaves, they hoped still to receive temporal benefit by attaching themselves
to Him."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 384.
    3. What higher aim in life did Jesus point out? What question did the
people ask in reply? Verses 27, 28.
   NOTE.—"They [the Jews] had been performing many and burdensome
works in order to recommend themselves to God; and they were ready to hear
of any new observance by which they could secure greater merit. Their
question meant, What shall we do that we may deserve heaven? What is
the price we are required to pay in order to obtain the life to come?"—"The •
Desire of Ages," p. 385.
                             Desiring a Sign
   4. What did Jesus say was the work of God? How did they show their
unbelief by their next questions? To what other miracle of supplying food
did the people refer? Verses 29-31.
                                   f 24 3
   NoTE.—"They had already seen the miracle of the five loaves, and did
not believe: and it was impossible for them to see anything more descriptive
of unlimited power and goodness. Even miracles themselves, are lost on
persons whose hearts are fixed on the perishing things of the world, and whose•'
minds are filled with prejudice against the truth. Their argument seems to
run thus: Thou hast, we grant, fed five thousand men with five loaves and
two small fishes; but what is this in comparison of what Moses did in the
desert, who for forty years fed more than a million of persons with bread
from heaven: do something like this, and then we will believe in Thee, as we
have believed in Moses."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    5. What comparison did Jesus make between the manna and the bread
of life? What desire did these words awaken in the hearts of the people?
Verses 32-34.
    6. What did Jesus then tell them plainly? Verses 35, 36.
   NoTE.—"Still thinking that it was temporal food to which Jesus referred,
some of His hearers exclaimed, 'Lord, evermore give us this bread.' Jesus
then spoke plainly: 'I am the bread of life.' ... Only the day before, the great
multitude, when faint and weary, had been fed by the bread which He had
given. As from that bread they had received physical strength and refresh-
ment, so from. Christ they might receive spiritual strength unto eternal life."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 386.
    7. What promise is extended to all who believe on Jesus? For what
purpose did Jesus come into the world? What is the will of the Father?
Verses 37-40.
                            Who Is This Man?
    8. What caused the Jews to murmur? What did they recall concerning
Jesus? Verses 41, 42.
    NOTE.—"They [the leaders of the people] tried to arouse prejudice by
referring scornfully to the lowly origin of Jesus. They contemptuously alluded
to His life as a Galilean laborer, and to His family as being poor and lowly
The claims of this uneducated carpenter, they said, were unworthy of their
attention. And on account of His mysterious birth they insinuated that He
was of doubtful parentage, thus representing the human circumstances of His
birth as a blot upon His history."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 387.
                      "Written in the Prophets"
   9. Who only did Jesus say could come to Him? To what prophetic word
did He refer? Who only has seen the Father? Verses 43-46.
                              "Living Bread"
   10. How can everlasting life be obtained? What further explanation
did Jesus make concerning the bread of life? Verses 47-51.
                            A "Hard Saying"
   11. What statement was especially difficult for the Jews to understand?
What further light did Jesus give concerning eating His flesh and drinking
His blood? Verses 52-58.
   NOTE.—The Jews were about to celebrate the Passover at Jerusalem, in
memory of the deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt. They would
then eat the flesh of the Passover lamb which represented the very One in
whom they now refused to believe.
                                    [ 25 ]
    "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive Him as a
personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins-,, and that we are complete
in Him: It is by beholding His love, by dwelling upon it, by drinking it in,
that we are to become partakers of His nature. What food is to the body,
Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot benefit us unless we eat it; unless it
becomes a part of our being. So Christ is of no value to us if we do not know
Him as a personal Saviour."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 389.
   "In the study of the Bible the converted soul eats the flesh and drinks the
blood of the Son of God, which He Himself interprets as the receiving and
doing of His words, that are spirit and life."—"Fundamentals of Christian
Education," p, 378.        .                      . .
    12. Where was Jesus teaching when He spoke these words? In what
respect did some who followed Jesus share in the unbelief of the Jews?
Verses 59, 60.      ,
   NorE.---"The.unbelieving Jews refused to see any, except the most literal
meaning in the Saviour's words. By the ritual law they were forbidden to
taste blood, and they now construed Christ's language into a ,sacrilegious
speech, and disputed over it among themselves. Many even of the disciples
said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"'—"The,Desire of Ages," p. 390.,
    13. What questions did Jesus ask in response to the murmuring of the
disciples? Verses 61, 62.
    14. What-contrast is-drawn. between the flesh and-the spirit? What did
Jesus say of the words He spoke? What did He say concerning some who
heard Him? What did He know from the beginning? Verses 63-65.
    15. What shows that some who had been following Him were not
willing to accept Him as their Saviour? Verse 66. -
    NOTE.—"By the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples were -still
further alienated from Jesus. They were greatly displeased, and wishing to
wound the Saviour, and gratify the malice of the Pharisees, they turned their
backs upon Him, and left Him with disdain. They had made their choice,—
had taken the form without the spirit, the husk without the kernel. Their
decision was never afterwards reversed; for they walked no mote with Jesus."
—"The-Desire of Ages," p. 392.-
                        A Question to the Twelve
   16. What searching question did Jesus ask the twelve? What was
Peter's' reply? Verses 67-69.
   NOTE.—"Afe you a follower of Christ? Then all that is written concerning
the spiritual life is written for you, and may be attained through uniting
yourself to Jesus. Is your zeal languishing? has your first love grown cold?
Accept again of the proffered loVe of Christ. Eat of His flesh, drink of His
blood, and you Will becoine one with the Father and with the Son. . . BAs
our physical life is sustained 'by food, so our spiritual life is sustained by the
wordr of God. And every soul is, to receive life from God's word for himself.
As We must, eat' for ourselves in order to receive nourishment, so we must
receive the *Ord       'ourselves: We are not to Obtain it merely throUgh the
medium of another's mind. We should carefully study the Bible, asking God
for the- aid•Of the Holy Spirit, that 'we may Understand His Word."—"The
tiesireges,'f`pto• 389                 •    -
    17. What sad statement did Jesus make concerning one of His dis-
ciples? Verses 70, 71.

 " > -'P"E-1Zsoisis: Jesus and the disciples; the SyrOphceniCian woman (a woman of
Canaan,—a, Greek, :a Gentile, a heathen). Matthew gives her; this narhe because of the
people from whom she sprang. (judges ).:31.) Mark gives her the, name used in this

                                  THE LESSON

                          A Missionary Journey
    1. From capernaum where did Jesus go on a longer: journey than usual?
Whit did Jesus hope to find at this place?,., Why did. He not? Mark 7: 24.
    2. Who came to Jesus out of that region? To What,,nation did this
woman belong? What trouble laympon her heart? , Verses 25, 26. .
    NOTE.—"Christ knew this woman's situation!. 'He knew''that she was 'long-
ing to see Him, and He,placed'Himself in her path. BY' ministering to'i;ber
sorrbw, ,He could give' a' living representation of the lesson He designedM
teach.. For' this He hadt brought His clisciples into,this, region. He! desired
them to see the ignorance existing in cities and!villages 'close to the land, of
Israel. The people who had been given every opportunity to understand the
truth, were without a knowledge of the needs of those around them. No
effort was made 10., help souls in darkness. The partitibn wall which Jewish
pride had erected, : shut, even the disciples from sympathy with the heathen
world. But these barriers were to be broken down."—"The Desire_ of Ages,"
p: 400.      ,
    3. In what words did the wornawmake-her first appeal? ,Illatt:'
                                                                      ,
    4. How 'did Jesus at first treat fier request? What did the disciples
Urge? Verse 23.                                       .rfc              ••
    NOTE.—"Christ did not immediately reply to the woman's request. He
received this representative of a despised race as the Jews would have-done.
                                      127'1
In this He designed that His disciples should be impressed with the cold and
heartless manner in which the Jews would treat such 'a case, as evinced by
His reception of the woman, and the compassionate manner in which He
would have them deal with such distress, as manifested by }Fs subsequent
granting of her petition."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 400.
                           Continued Pleading
    5. With what statement did Jesus break His silence? How did the
woman continue to urge her desire? Verses 24, 25.
    NOTE.—"But it was a pitying Saviour to whom the woman made her plea,
and in answer to the .request of the disciples, Jesus said, 'I am not sent but
unto the lost sheep etlite -house of Israel.' Although this answer appeared to
be in accordance wittilhe prejudice of the Jews, it was an implied rebuke to
the disciples, which;; ,hey afterwards understood as reminding them of what
He had often tOld th'em,—that He came to the world to save all who would
accept IIirn:7,"The 'Desire of Ages," p. 400.
    Notice hliw fully the woman identified herself with her daughter. Her
cry was; "Have mercy on me," "Help me," when her supplication was in
behalf el' her daughter.
    6. How did Jesus still further test this woman's faith? Mark 7:27.
    7. What humble reply did the woman in her sorrow make? Verse 28.
    NOTE.—By the mention of "children" Jesus doubtless referred to the Jews,
God's chosen Israel, and by the word "dogs" to the Gentiles, or unbelievers— ,
not that the illustration expressed His own feeling, in the least, toward the
non-Jew. By her faith in Jesus' power to heal, and by her perseverance in
praying that He exercise it upon, her daughter, this woman showed that
though a Canaanite by race, she was really a member of the spiritual house
of Israel.
                             A Great Victory
    8. How did Jesus commend the faith of this mother? What assurance
did He give her concerning her daughter? What did she find when she
returned to her home? Verses 29, 30; "Matt. 15:28.
    NOTE.—"To one who has ever held any prominent or official position in
the East, the persistency of pleading women is a fact which he will never
forget. They will not be driven from their purpose by a rough manner. Severe
language does not deter them. They are not wearied by delays. They will sit
and wait hour after hour, and come day after day, ignoring all kinds of
refusals. They are importunate. beyond anything that is ever experienced in
our Western life."—Hon. S. Merrill, formerly U. S. consul at Jerusalem.
    NOTE.—"This was the only miracle that Jesus wrought while on this
journey. It was for theperformance of this act that lit,went to the borders
of Tyre and Sidon., Hewished to relieve the afflicted Yir'linarr, and at the same
time to leave an example in His work of mercy toward one of a despised people,
for the benefit' of$His disciples when He should no longer be with them. He
wished to lead 'Ahem from their Jewish exclusiveness to be interested in
working -for, others besides their own people."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 402.
              encouragement is given to God's.peo.ple,to pray perseveringly?
Mark 11: 24.                         ••›
    NOTE.—"I' asked the angel y there was no more faith and pow& in
Israel. He said, 'Ye let go "o    e,arna of th'e Lord too soon. Press your peti-

Writings," p. 73.
                      A Second Visit to Decapolis
   10. Leaving the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, where did Jesus then go?
Mark 7:31.
  NoTE.—Decapolis was a region in North Palestine, containing ten cities, of
which Gadara was one. It was inhabited by many foreigners.
                          Another Great Miracle
    11. What afflicted man was brought to Jesus? What did his friends
beseech Jesus to do? Verse 32.
    12. How did Jesus take away the man's infirmities? Verses 33-35.
    NOTE.—"It was in the region of Decapolis that the demoniacs of Gergesa
had been healed. Here the people, alarmed at the destruction of the swine,
had constrained Jesus to depart from among them. But they had listened to
the messengers He left behind, and a desire was aroused to see Him. As He
came again into that region, a crowd gathered about Him, and a deaf, stam-
mering man was brought to Him. Jesus did not, according to His custom,
restore the man by a word only. Taking lirn apart from the multitude, He
put His fingers in his ears, and touched his ongue; looking up to heaven, He
sighed at thought of the ears that would not be open to the truth, the tongues
that refused to acknowledge the Redeemer."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 404.
    13. After the afflicted man was made whole, what charge did Jesuil
give? How were His directions disobeyed? Verse 36.
    14. How was the work of Jesus regarded by the people at this time?
Verse 37.
                        "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
   Contrast the words of Jesus to the Greek woman concerning her faith with
His words to Peter the night He walked on the water.

     Four Thousand Fed; Healing a Blind Man;
             Teaching the Disciples
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Mark 8; Matt. 15:32 to 16:28.
    MEMORY VERSE: "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?".
Mark 8:36, 37.
    LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 404-418.
    PLACES: A mountain desert place in the region of Decapolis, near Gergesa, where
the demoniacs were healed; thence across the lake to Dalmanutha, near Magdala, in
Galilee; towns near Caesarea Philippi.                                      •
    PERSONS: Jesus and the twelve; a multitude of four thousand men (Gentiles
and heathen), besides women and children; a blind man; Pharisees and Sadducees.
                                       { 291
                                THE LESSON

                      Feeding the Four Thousand
    1. What is said of the multitudes that came to Jesus? What caused
the people to wonder? Matt. 15:30, 31.
    2. What was the need of the people after three days? Why did Jesus
not send them to their homes? What question arose in the minds of the
disciples? Mark 8:2-4.
    NorE.—"Again the disciples revealed their unbelief. At Bethsaida they
had seen how, with Christ's blessing, their little store availed for the feeding
of the multitude; yet they did not now bring forward their all, trusting His
power to multiply it for the hungry crowds. Moreover, those whom He fed
at Bethsaida were Jews; these were Gentiles and heathen. Jewish prejudice
was still strong in the hearts of the disciples, and they answered Jesus, 'Whence
can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the Wilderness?'"—"The
Desire of Ages," pp. 404, 405.
    3. What question did Jesus ask the disciples? What was their reply?
What former experience was then repeated? How many baskets of frag-
ments were taken up? How many had eaten? Verses 5-9.
    4. After feeding the multitude, where did Jesus go? Matt. 15:39.
    NoTE.—Magdala was on the west side of the sea, in Galilee itself. Dal-
manutha (Mark 8:10) was a village near by. In this vicinity Jesus had per-
formed many miracles, and He was well kriown.. He again meets the cold
unbelief of the scribes and Pharisees, in marked contrast to His welcome among
the heathen people about Gadara and in the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. He
remained only a short time in this place.
                          A Sign From.Heaven
     5. Who came to Jesus at this time? What was the motive of these
leadcrs among the Jews in asking these questions? Matt. 16:1; Mark 8:11.
     NoTE.--Though the Pharisees and the Sadducees were opposed- to each
other in many of their beliefs, and were often at enmity in their dealings, yet
they frequently united in their efforts to overthrow the teachings of Jesus
and weaken His influence. Heie they sought to "tempt" or test Him that they
might entangle Him in His talk.
     6. What common saying did the request for a sign from heaven suggest
to Jesus? What sign only was to be given that generation? Matt. 16:2-4.
     NOTE.—"Every miracle that Christ performed was a sign of His divinity.
. .. Christ wrought no miracle at the demand of the Pharisees. . . . The change
in human hearts, the transformation of human characters, is a miracle that
reveals an ever-living Saviour, working to rescue souls. A consistent life in
Christ is a great miracle."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 406, 407.
     7. What did the 'disciples forget as Jesus reentered the boat with them?
How much food did they have with them? Mark 8:13, 14.
                        The Influence of Leaven
    8. What warning did Jesus now give them? What reasoning did this
start among them? Verses 15, 16.
    9. When Jesus perceived their misunderstanding, what did He say?
                                      [ 30 ]
The Healing of the Blind Man

         { 31
  To what two miracles did He make reference? What pointed questions did
  Re then ask? Verses 17-21.
     NorE.—"Jesus reproved them for thinking that He who had fed thousands
  with a few fishes and barley loaves could in that solemn warning have referred
  merely to temporal food. There was danger that the crafty reasoning of the
  Pharisees and the Sadducees would leaven His disciples with unbelief, causing
  them to think lightly of the works of Christ."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 408.
     10. What did the disciples finally understand? Matt: 16:11, 12.
     NOTE.—As a little yeast or leaven goes all through the dough of which the
  bread is made, so had the Pharisees corrupted the pure doctrines of the
  Scriptuyes by their evil traditions. For this reason the disciples were to
• bewarc•of all their teachings.
                            Healing a Blind Man
     11. In'what manner did Jesus give complete sight to the man brought
  to Him at Bethsaida? What did He tell the man? Mark 8:22-26.
                       Jesus Questions the Twelve
       12. As Jesus and the twelve were walking through the country, what
  direct question did Jesus ask the disciples? What was their reply? Verses
  27, 28.
       13. How personal did He then make the question? Who replied? What
  answer did he give? What charge did Jesus give? Verses 29, 30.
       NoTE.--Jesus approached the question of His divine Sonship with great
  caution. He knew that upon this question hung the destiny of the world; that
  around this truth the storm of the ages was already gathering, and would
  soon burst in relentless fury. Satan had assailed the truth of the incarnation,
  in the wilderness of temptation, with, "If Thou be the Son of God." Jesus
  knew His foe, and the strength of the temptation awaiting the disciples upon
  this point. He desired to prepare them for it while He was still with them.
       "From the first, Peter had believed Jesus to be the Messiah. Many others
    . . now doubted that Jesus was the Messiah, for whom they had looked so
  long. Many of the disciples who had ardently expected Jesus to take His place
  on David's throne, left Him when they perceived that He had no such inten-
  tion. . . . On this day, before they were brought face to face with the great
  trial of their faith, the Holy Spirit rested upon them in power. For a little
  time their eyes were turned away from 'the things which are seen' to behold
  `the things which are not seen.' Beneath the guise of humanity they discerned
  the glory of the Son of God."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 411, 412.
                         The Shadow of the Cross
      14. What future experience did Jesus then make known to them? What
  did Peter presume to do? How did Jesus rebuke Peter? Verses 31-33.
     NOTE.—"Satan was trying to discourage Jesus, and turn Him from His
  mission; and Peter, in his blind love, was giving voice to the temptation. The
  prince of evil was the author of the thought. His instigation was behind that
  impulsive appeal. . . . The words of Christ were spoken, not to Peter, but to
  the one who was trying to separate him from his Redeemer. 'Get thee behind
  Me, Satan.' No longer interpose between Me and My erring servant. Let Me
  come face to face with Peter, that I may reveal to him the mystery of My love.
     "It was to Peter a bitter lesson, and one which he learned but slowly, that
                                       [ 32
the path of Christ on earth lay through agony and humiliation. The disciple
shrank from fellowship with his Lord in suffering. But in the heat of the
furnace fire he was to learn its blessing. Long afterward, when his active form
was bowed with the burden of years and labors, he wrote, 'Beloved, think it
not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some
strange thing happened unto you; but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers
of Christ's sufferings; that, when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad
also with exceeding joy.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 416.
                                   Values
    15. What principle does Jesus lay down as the foundation of Christian
life? Verses 34, 35.
    16. What two questions of supreme importance did Jesus then ask?
Verses 36, 37.
    17. What solemn warning does He give? Verse 38.
                       "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
     The permeating effect of leaven, good or bad.
     The relation of Jesus to the individual person.
     The worth of your soul to Jesus. To you.

                        The Transfiguration
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matt. 17:1-13; Mark 9:1-13; Luke 9:27-36.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold
a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased; hear ye Him." Matt. 17:5.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 419-425.
    PLACE: Believed to be Mt. Hermon, snow-crowned perpetually, CMsarea Philippi
at the base. Jesus had recently been in that vicinity.
    PERSONS: Jesus; Moses; Elias (Elijah); Peter; James; John.

                                THE LESSON

                          A Strange Statement
   1. What promise had Jesus made to some of the disciples? Mark 8:38;
9:1.
   Nom—Christ had been telling the disciples of His humiliation and death.
"Beyond the poverty and humiliation of the present, He pointed His disciples
to His coming in glory, not in the splendor of an earthly throne, but with the
glory of God and the hosts of heaven. . . . Then for their encouragement He
gave the promise, 'Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in His kingdom.'
But the disciples did not comprehend His words. The glory seemed far away.
                                     { 33]
                              The ,Transfiguration

Their eyes were fixed upon the nearer view, the earthly life of poverty, humil-
iation, and suffering." Later Christ made plain to them that the experience
on the mount of transfiguration was the fulfillment of His promise. We are
told, "Jesus was clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when He
shall come 'the second time without sin unto salvation.' For He will come 'in
the glory of His Father with the holy angels.' The Saviour's promise to the
disciples was now fulfilled. Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory
was represented in miniature,—Christ the King, Moses a representative of
the risen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 417, 418, 422.
                  The Fulfillment of the Statement
    2. In fulfillment of this promise, what event took place a few days
later? Who of the twelve were with Jesus at this time? Verse 2.
    Nova.—"Evening is drawing on as Jesus calls to His side three of His
disciples, Peter, James, and John, and leads them across the fields, and far
up a rugged path, to a lonely mountain side. The Saviour and His disciples
have spent the day in traveling and teaching, and the mountain climb adds to
their weariness. . . . The light of the setting sun still lingers on the mountain
top, and gilds with its fading glory the path they are traveling. But soon the
light dies out from hill as well as valley, the sun disappears behind the western
                                        [341
horizon, and the solitary travelers are wrapped in the darkness of night. The
gloom of their surroundings seems in harmony with their sorrowful lives,
around which the clouds are gathering and thickening.
   "The disciples do not venture to ask Christ whither He is going, or for
what purpose."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 419.
                          The Earnest Prayer
    3. For what purpose did Jesus go up into the mountain? Luke 9:28.
   NOTE.—"Presently Christ tells them that they are now to go no farther.
Stepping a little aside from them, the Man of Sorrows pours out His supplica-
tions with strong crying and tears. . . . The dew is heavy upon His bowed
form, but He heeds it not. The shadows of night gather thickly about Him,
but He regards not their gloom. So the hours pass slowly by. At first the
disciples unite their prayers with His in sincere devotion; but after a.time
they are overcome with weariness, and, even while trying to retain their
interest in the scene, they fall asleep."—"The Desire of. Ages," ,pp. 419, 420.
                               Transfigured
    4. While Jesus was praying, what change came upon Him? Matt. 17:2.
    NOTE.—"While He [Jesus] is bowed in lowliness upon the stony ground,
suddenly the heavens open, the golden gates of the city of God are thrown
wide, and holy radiance descends upon the mount, enshrouding the Saviour's
form. Divinity from within flashes through humanity, and meets the glory
coming from above. Arising from His prostrate position, Christ stands in
Godlike majesty. The soul agony is gone. His countenance now shines 'as
the sun,' and His garments are 'white as the light.'"—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 421.
    5. Who appeared with Jesus at this time? Verse 3.
    NoTE.—Here was given a representation in miniature of the future king-
dom and home of God's people. Jesus, the King, was seen in His glory ; Moses
stood as a representative of the resurrected saints (Jude 9), and Elijah of
those who will be translated at the coming of Christ. 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
    6. What did Jesus, Elijah, and Moses talk about? Luke 9:30, 31.
    NOTE.—"Not the inauguration of Christ as king, but the decease to be
accomplished at Jerusalem, is the subject of their conference with Jesus.
Bearing the weakness of humanity, and burdened with its sorrow and sin,
Jesus walked alone in the midst of men. As the darkness of the coming trial
pressed upon Him, He was in loneliness of spirit, in a world that knew Him
not. Even His loved disciples, absorbed in their own doubt and sorrow and
ambitious hopes, had not comprehended the mystery of His mission. He
had dwelt amid the love and fellowship of heaven; but in the world that He
had created, He was in solitude. Now heaven had sent its messengers to Jesus;
not angels, but men who had endured suffering and sorrow, and who could
sympathize with the Saviour in the trial of His earthly life. Moses and Elijah
 had been colaborers with Christ. They had shared His longing for the salva-
 tion of men. Moses had pleaded for Israel: 'Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive
 their sin ;—and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou
hast written.' Elijah had known loneliness of spirit, as for three years and a
 half of famine he had borne the burden of the nation's hatred and its woe.
 Alone he had stood for God upon Mount Carmel. Alone he had fled to the
 desert in anguish and despai-. These men, chosen above every angel around
                                     [35 }
the throne, had come to commune with Jesus concerning the scenes of His
suffering, and to comfort Him with the assurance of the sympathy of heaven.
The hope of the world, the salvation of every human being, was the burden
of their interxiew."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 422-425.
                             A Voice Speaks
    7. What did Peter suggest to Jesus? Matt. 17:4.
    Nom—The disciples looked upon the glory they beheld with great awe.
All gloomy forebodings faded away in the presence of such brightness and joy.
Peter wished to prolong the experience and suggested that they build three
tabernacles, or booths, froni,fhe branches of the trees, for the comfort of
these holy men that they might remain there for a time.
    8. While Peter was yet speaking, what took place? What did the voice
out of the cloud say? Verse 5.
    9. What effect did the hearing of the voice have upon the three dis-
ciples? How were they reassured? Verses 6, 7.
                                Jesus Only
   10. When they,looked'about, whom only did they see? Verse 8.
                  Sureness of the Prophetic Word
    11. How did Peter long afterwards refer to this experience? 2 Peter
1:16-18.
    12. What did the apostle declare was more sure than the testimony of
their eyes and ears? Verse 19.
   NoTE.—Peter James, and John heard with their own ears the voice of God
when He spoke 'from the glory of the transfiguration. With their own eyes
they saw Jesus; Moses, and Elijah, and they heard them conversing together.
Nothing could have been clearer to human senses; but Peter says, "We have
also a more sure word of prophecy." That is to say, while we may place a
reasonable degree of confidence in what our natural senses, like sight, hearing,
and feeling, tell us, still we have something "more sure;" for our senses can,
be deceived, but the word of prophecy—the Bible—never fails.
   13. As they were coming down the mountain, what charge did Jesus
give them? Mark 9:9.
                            Questions Raised
   14. What did they question among themselves? Verse 10. '
   15. What did the disciples then ask? How did Jesus reply? Matt.
17:10-12, first part.
   16. How would the Son of man also be treated? Verse 12, last part.
   17. Whom did Jesus mean by Elias? Verse 13.
                     "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
   While Jesus prayed He was transfigured.
   While Jesus prayed the Holy Spirit came upon Him as a dove. Luke
3:21, 22.
   "Communion with Christ transfigures life."
   The sure word of prophecy.

    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Mark 9:14-29; Matt. 17:14-21; Luke 9:37-45.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why
could not we cast him out? •And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief."
Matt. 17:19, 20.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 426-431.
    PLACE: The base of the mount of transfiguration.
    PERSONS: Jesus and the disciples; a father and his afflicted son; scribes and
the multitude.
                                THE LESSON

               The Scene at the Foot of the Mountain
    1. Coming to the other disciples at the foot of the mount of trans-
figuration, what did Jesus see? What were the scribes doing? Mark 9:14.
    NOTE.—Jesus and the three disciples had passed the night in the mountain
of transfiguration. "As the sun arose, Jesus and His disciples descended to the
plain. Absorbed in thought, the disciples were awed and silent. Even Peter
had not a word to say. Gladly would they have lingered in that holy place
which had been touched with the light of heaven, and where the Son of God
had manifested His glory; but there was work to be done for the people, who
were already searching far and near for Jesus.
    "At the foot of the mountain a large company had gathered, led hither by
the disciples who had remained behind, but who knew whither Jesus had
resorted."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 426.
    2. How did the sight of Jesus affect the people? What did they do?
Verse 15.
    3. 'What did Jesus ask the scribes? Verse 16, margin.
    4. What explanation did one of the multitude give? How severe was
the affliction of his son? Verses 17, 18.
    NOTE.—"While they [the nine disciples] were waiting at the foot of the
mountain, a father had brought to them his son, to be delivered from a dumb
spirit that tormented him. Authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out,
had been conferred on the disciples when Jesus sent out the twelve to preach
through Galilee. As they went forth strong in faith, the evil spirits had obeyed
their word. Now in the name of Christ they commanded the torturing spirit
to leave his victim; but the demon only mocked them by a fresh display of
his power. The disciples, unable to account for their defeat, felt that they were
 bringing dishonor upon themselves and their Master. And in the crowd there
were scribes who made the most of this opportunity to humiliate them. Press-
ing around the disciples, they plied them with questions, seeking to prove that
 they and their Master were deceivers. Here, the rabbis triumphantly declared,
was an evil spirit that neither the disciples nor Christ Himself could conquer.
The people were inclined to side with the scribes, and a feeling of contempt
and scorn pervaded the crowd.
                                       [ 37 I
   "But suddenly the accusations ceased. Jesus and the three disciples were
seen approaching, and with a quick revulsion of feeling the people turned to
meet them. The night of communion with the heavenly glory had left its trace
upon the Saviour and His companions. Upon their countenances was a light
that awed the beholders. The scribes drew back in fear, while the people wel-
comed Jesus."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 427.
    5. How did Jesus rebuke the unbelief of the people? What did He ask
them to do? Verse 19.
                           A Contest of Power
    6. What did the evil spirit do as soon as he saw Jesus? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—"Again the Prince of life and the prince of the powers of darkness
had met on the field of battle,—Christ in fulfillment of His mission to 'preach
deliverance to the captives, . . . to set at liberty them that are bruised,'
Satan seeking to hold his victim under his control. Angels of light and the
hosts of evil angels, unseen, were pressing near to behold the conflict. For a
moment, Jesus permitted the evil spirit to display his power, that the behold-
ers might comprehend the deliverance about to be wrought.
   "The multitude looked on with bated breath, the father in an agony of
hope and fear."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 428.
    7. What question did Jesus ask the father? What reply was given?
What earnest appeal did the father make? Verses 21, 22.
    8. How did Jesus endeavor to strengthen the faith of the father?
Verse 23.
    9. What did the father then cry out with tears? Verse 24.
                                   Victory
    10. Seeing the running together of the excited people, how did Jesus
rebuke the evil spirit? Verse 25.
    NOTE.—"Enter no more into him." Jesus does not intend that our victo-
ries over Satan shall be only temporary. A special struggle is often necessary
in order to overcome a besetting sin. When we become sufficiently earnest in
our efforts to gain the victory that we pray and fast as we seek the Lord for
victory, we shall obtain it.
    11. How did the evil spirit respond to the command of Jesus? In
what condition did he leave the boy? Verse 26.
    12. What additional assistance did Jesus render? Verse '27.

                           The Secret of Power
    13. What power had Jesus previously conferred upon the twelve?
Matt. 10:1.
    NOTE.—"In order to succeed in such a conflict they must come to the work
in a different spirit. Their faith must be strengthened by fervent prayer and
fasting, and humiliation of heart. They must be emptied of self, and be filled
with the Spirit and power of God. Earnest, persevering supplication to God
in faith,—faith that leads to entire dependence upon God, and unreserved
consecration to His work,—can alone avail to bring men the Holy Spirit's aid
in the battle against principalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of
this world, and wicked spirits in high places."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 430.
                                     ( 38 )
    14. When alone with Jesus, what information did the disciples seek?
What was Jesus' answer? Mark 9:28, 29.
    NOTE.—"The selection of the three disciples to accompany Jesus to the
mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. Instead of strengthening their
faith by prayer and meditation on the words of Christ, they had been dwell-
ing on their discouragements and personal grievances. In this state of darkness
they had undertaken the conflict with Satan."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 430.
                      "THINK ON THESE THINGS"
   The mental attitude that brings defeat.
   What is possible "if thou canst believe."
   The conflict of the ages as it affects me.
   The possible certainty of spiritual victory.
