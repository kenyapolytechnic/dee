      The Epistle to the Romans
                          Introductory Note
     The epistle of Paul to the Romans is placed first among his writings,
perhaps because of its great doctrinal importance. It probably was
written in Corinth in the spring of A. D. 57 or 58. It is one of the most
systematic and comprehensive of religious treatises, and withal a mighty
appeal. It sets forth man's sinful and lost condition, whatever his race
or pretension, his hopelessness without God, and God's mercy in justifi-
cation through Christ Jesus. It shows how God can be just, and yet
justify the believing sinner; not that he may continue in sin, but that
he may develop a sinless, Christian character.. While a profound book,
it is not difficult for he heart of faith to apprehend.
     Study the book, its chapters, its sections, its verses, its clauses, its
phrases, its words. Do not hurry. Do not seek to give a whole verse for
an answer to a question, when a word will suffice. Use only that part of
the scripture necessary to answer the question. Get all you can out of
the words of life. Review often. Remember the "therefores" and
"wherefores;" and find the reasons for their use. May the study of this
wonderful epistle bring the multiplied blessings of faith to all.

                      Lesson 1 — April 4, 1931

                   Righteousness by Faith
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 10.
                              THE LESSON
    1. What was the apostle's desire and prayer for his people? Rom.
10:1.
    NOTE.—"My heart's desire and prayer." The Jews rejected our Lord
and persecuted His servants. Notwithstanding this, Paul knew that
many of them, even in their persecution of God's people, had real zeal
for God, and that they persecuted ignorantly. Had they understood,
they would not have crucified the Lord's Christ. Acts 3:17; 1 Cor. 2:8.
Paul, remembering his own misguided experience, could pray earnestly
for them. We do not see as God sees. Men of whom we feel hopeless,
may be on the very eve of turning to God.
   2. To what did the apostle bear witness? Verse 2.
   NOTE.—Paul no doubt remembered the time when he "was zealous
toward God," and on his way to Damascus was breathing out threaten-
ings and slaughter against those who believed on Jesus. His own experi-
ence made him sympathetic, even while he spoke truths that seemed
harsh to Jewish ears.
   3. Of what were Paul's brethren ignorant? Whose righteousness did
they seek to establish? As a consequence, what had they not done?
Verse 3.
                                [2]
    NoTE.—"Establish their own righteousness." That is what every one
tries to do who does not know God, who has not by revelation (Matt.
16:17) seen God, or who forgets His infinite holiness. He who holds ever
in view the righteousness of God, will abhor himself and honor God.
The gospel places the glory of man in the dust and exalts Jesus Christ.
    4. What is the object of the law? Verse 4.
    NoTE.—"End of the law." The word "end" in this text means aim, or
object, as in James 5:11. The aim, or object, of the law is to bring its
transgressors to Christ. The justice of the law shuts the sinner in the
prison house of death, with Christ the only door of hope. The law is
unable in itself to give freedom, but seeking release from both death
and sin, the transgressor turns to Christ as the only source of righteous-
ness. Rom. 7:7, 24, 25; Gal. 3:23, 24. Then in Christ the righteousness
of the law, which is the requirement, is fulfilled in those who walk after
the Spirit. Rom. 8:4. Faith in Christ establishes the law in the heart.
   5. What will come to the man who perfectly obeys the law? Verse 5.
    6. What does the righteousness by faith admonish not to say?
Verses 6, 7.
    NoTE.—Righteousness by faith is personified and made to speak for
itself. It does not demand that man shall do great things by which he
will take glory to himself. Man is not to descend into the deep, nor must
he climb up to heaven; all he needs to do is to yield himself, and believe
in Christ Jesus, who has come down to him.
    We can learn a lesson from the experience of Israel. " 'As Moses
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,' even so was 'the Son of man
lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
eternal life.' All who have ever lived upon the earth have felt the deadly
sting of 'that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan.' The fatal effects
of sin can be removed only by the provision that God has made. The
Israelites saved their lives by looking upon the uplifted serpent. That
look implied faith. They lived because they believed God's word, and
trusted in the means provided for their recovery. So the sinner may look
to Christ, and live. He receives pardon through faith in the atoning
sacrifice. Unlike the inert and lifeless symbol, Christ has power and
virtue in Himself to heal the repenting sinner."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 431.
    7. What does righteousness by faith say? Verse 8.
    8. What is necessary to salvation? Verse 9.
    9. What will faith and confession bring? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—"Unto righteousness." Much belief merely accepts facts and
no more. Faith accepts righteousness, reaches to it, makes it its own.
The faith which stops short of righteousness is a failure. But the faith
which grasps God's righteousness will be glad to tell others.
    "We come to God in the name of Jesus by special invitation, and He
welcomes us to His audience chamber. He imparts to the humble, con-
trite soul that faith in Christ by which he is justified. Jesus blots out
as a thick cloud his transgressions, and the comforted heart exclaims,
                                   [3 ]
`0 Lord, I will praise Thee: though Thou wast angry with me, Thine
anger is turned away, and Thou comfortedst me.' Isa. 12:1. Such a one
will understand by his own experience the words of Paul, 'With the heart
man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is
made unto salvation.' Rom. 10 :10."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 242.
   10. 'Who will not be put to shame? Verse 11.
    11. What is said of distinction between men and races? What shows
the equality of all before God? Verses 12, 13.
    IsTomE.—"The blessings of salvation are for every soul. Nothing but
his own choice can prevent any man from becoming a partaker of the
promise in Christ by the gospel. Caste is hateful to God. He ignores
everything of this character. In His sight the souls of all men are of
equal value. . . . Without distinction of age, or rank, or nationality, or
religious privilege, all are invited to come unto Him and live."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 403.
    12. What pertinent questions does the apostle ask? Verses 14, 15,
first clause.
    NomE.—"There are many in our world who are longing to hear the
word of life. But how can they hear without a preacher? And how can
those sent to teach them live without support? God would have the lives
of His workers carefully sustained. They are His property, and He is
dishonored when they are compelled to labor in a way that injures their
health. He is dishonored, also, when for lack of means workers cannot
be sent to destitute fields.
    "In place of complaining of the officers of the General Conference
because they cannot respond to the multiplied calls for men and means,
let our church, members bear a living testimony to the power of the truth
by denying self and giving liberally for the advancement of the work."
—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, pp. 52, 53.
    13. 'What is said of those who bring glad tidings? Verse 15.
    14. Do all accept the glad message? Verse 16.
    15. Upon what is faith based? Verse 17.
    16. How many have heard this gospel message? Verse 18.
    NomE.—"Their sound." The voice of God speaking through His
works; for the quotation is from Psalm 19:4. Sometimes He speaks in
dread majesty, sometimes in marvelous wisdom, sometimes in the ter-
rible tempest, in the soft-breathing night breezes, in the mighty oak, in
the tiny floweret, in all the wonders of the jeweled dome above us. In
a thousand different ways is proclaimed to the thoughtful, longing heart
the power, the wisdom, and the love of God. There has always been light
enough to lead to God, and there is sufficient potency in one ray to save
the soul who receives and follows the light.
   17. What effort was put forth to arouse them? What prophecy of
the Gentiles is mentioned? Verse 19.     •
   18. What prediction of the Gentiles is quoted from Isaiah? Verse 20.
                                [4 1
    NOTE.—"I was found of them that sought Me not." All through
God's work with Israel, He desired to make them instruments of salva-
tion to the nations. He placed them in the center of civilization, in the
highway of the nations, that they might minister light to the peoples of
earth. He taught them this in object lesson, in precept, in psalm, in
prophecy. But all these blessings they took to themselves, and perverted
them into curses. We hold our blessings only by using them for others.
    19. What did God say of those who sought to establish their own
righteousness? Verse 21.
    NOTE.—"All day long He had stretched forth His hands unto a dis-
obedient and gainsaying people; yet He would be found of them that
sought Him not; among a people that had not called upon His name
He would be manifest. . . .
    "Many are deceived to-day in the same way as were the Jews. Reli-
gious teachers read the Bible in the light of their own understanding
and traditions; and the people do not search the Scriptures for them-
selves, and judge for themselves as to what is truth; but they yield up
their judgment, and commit their souls to their leaders. The preaching
and teaching of His word is one of the means that God has ordained for
diffusing light; but we must bring every man's teaching to the test of
Scripture. Whoever will prayerfully study the Bible, desiring to know
the truth, that he may obey it, will receive divine enlightenment."—"The
Desire of Ages," pp. 458, 459.
        SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS FOR HOME STUDY
   1. Should we place anyone outside of God's limit and power to reach
and save? For how many, then, should we pray?
   2. In the light of this lesson, can we prosper spiritually and not bear
witness for God?
   3. What verse in this chapter contains a most precious promise?

                    Lesson 2 — April 11, 1931
                       Election by Grace
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 11:1-18.

                             THE LESSON

    1. What proof did the apostle give that God had not cast off His
people? Rom. 11:1.
    NOTE.—"I also." Paul was in his own experience a demonstration
that God had not cast away the Jews from salvation. For if God could
pardon Paul, who was a persecutor and blasphemer, He could pardon
all who came to Him; for He is "no respecter of persons."
   2. What further proof does he cite? Verses 2-4.
   3. What conclusion does the apostle draw? Verse 5.
    Nom.—"There is a remnant." The accepted remnant are not by
birth; they are not of man's making. They are God's people by His
                                   [5   ]
grace; "for by grace are ye saved through faith." Eph. 2:8. Salvation
is not of works; if it were, man could boast; but in every age and gen-
eration human hearts respond to God's truth and love, and become
receivers of His grace. In every age, in every generation, God has not
left Himself without witness. Acts 14:17. It is ever by His grace; as
in Elijah's day, even so now. To Him therefore belongs all the glory.
    "In the worst days of Hebrew apostasy there was always an elect
handful that did not go astray after other gods. It was so in the days
of Elijah; and it was a comfort to the faithful heart of Paul to believe
that, amid the general opposition excited by the preaching of the gospel,
there were many secret lovers of the cross who were true to the Messiah
and His claims. Man can never count these quiet, unknown, holy souls,
who, like the sweetest wild flowers, can be detected only by the fragrance
of their lives. But God counts them, to whose grace and care all that is
good in them is due."—F. B. Meyer.
   4. But by what alone is this election? Verse 6.
   5. What disappointment must necessarily come to Israel, who sought
righteousness by works? Verse 7, first part.
    6. Who did obtain the righteousness they sought? Verse 7, last part.
    NoTE.—"Israel hath not; . . . the election hath." Israel sought
righteousness by works. But how could they obtain itl for all their
works fell short of God's glory. Faith in the free grace of God was want-
ing. The election obtained righteousness, because they chose it, chose
God's grace, God's righteousness in their behalf, chose all for which He
had chosen them.
    7. Why were the rest blinded or hardened? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"Blinded." The margin gives "hardened." They were hard-
ened because they would not accept God's way, and God let them have
their own way.
    8. Of what were they worthy? Verses 9, 10.
    NOTE.—"Let." As they are determined to walk in their own way, let
them have it, let them have all the fruitage thereof. All the things men-
tioned are the legitimate fruit and consequences of their own choice.
   9. What question does the apostle ask? What answer is given? Verse
11, first part.
    10. What good thing came through their stumbling? What effect
was this meant to have on Israel? Verse 11, last part.
   NoTE.—"Their fall." Not their destruction as individuals; but their
separation from God, their setting aside as a nation, as a special people.
Christ had come. The true Israel—the Jew—was of the spiritual seed
alone. (See Rom. 2:28, 29; 9:6-8.) "The leaders in the Jewish nation
had signally failed of fulfilling God's purpose for His chosen people.
Those whom the Lord had made the depositaries of truth had proved
unfaithful to their trust, and God chose others to do His work;"—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pp. 78, 79. But though cast off in their national
capacity; God eagerly longed that they as individuals should come into
the fold through Christ.
                                  (6]
   11. From what condition of Israel is most gained? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"The fall . . . their fullness." God would have used the
nation of Israel to enlighten the world in the fullest sense, if they had
yielded fully to Him; but when their whole effort and thought was for
themselves, they held the world back from the riches of God's grace
intrusted to them. Their fall as a nation, and the proclamation of the
gospel to all alike, opened to the world the infinite riches of God's grace.
But even greater blessings would have been given if they had yielded
all, so that God could have used them as a positive force in the work of
carrying the gospel.                                                  •
   12. To whom is the apostle thus writing? What does he hope to ac-
complish? Verses 13, 14.
   13. What comparison is drawn between the casting away and the
receiving of the Hebrew people? Verse 15.
   14. What proofs are given of character? Verse 16.
    NomE.—"Notwithstanding Israel's failure as a nation, there re-
mained among them a goodly remnant of such as should be saved.. At
the time of the Saviour's advent, there were faithful men and women.
who had received with gladness the 'message of John the Baptist, and
had thus been led to study anew the prophecies concerning the Messiah.
When the early Christian church was founded, it was composed of these
faithful Jews who recognized Jesus of Nazareth as the one for whose
advent they had been longing. It is to this remnant that Paul refers
when he writes, 'If the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if
the root be holy, so are the branches.' "—Id., pp. 376, 377. The lump
evidently refers to the loaves offered when, Israel entered the land.
(See Num. 15:18-21.)
   15. How did the Gentiles come in? What blessings thus came to
them? Verse 17.
    NOTE.—"Partakest of the Root." This Root of holiness is Christ. If
branches will not partake of His life, they die, or are cut off. As is the
character of the source, so is that which it produces. We must not lose
sight of the fact that the term "Israel" is used in its twofold aspect.
The Jews used it in its literal, fleshly, national aspect, and many Chris-
tian expositors do still. Paul recognized this, but his effort was to show
to them that only Israel by faith was acceptable to God. So Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob—the fathers—obtained the blessings and the promise
by faith. Therefore when the people as a nation were set aside, the
individuals were not. God had better things for them in a "fullness"
not earthly but heavenly.
   16. What reason is given to show us we have no right to boast or
glory? Verse 18.
    NoTE.—"Shall the warnings from God be passed by unheeded? Shall
the opportunities for service be unimproved? Shall the world's scorn,
the pride of reason, conformity to human customs and traditions, hold
the professed followers of Christ from service to Him? Will they reject

were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but
fear: for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He
also spare not thee.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 306.

                    Lesson 3 — April 18, 1931
         "The Fullness" of Jew and Gentile
.LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 11 : 19-36.

                             THE LESSON

    1. What would the converted Gentiles be likely to say regarding
their union with God? Rom. 11:19.
    2. Why were the Hebrew branches broken off? How did the Gentile
Christian stand? What spirit should he manifest? Verse 20.
    3. What solemn admonition is then given? Verse 21.
    4. What does the apostle ask us to behold? On whom was His sever-
ity manifest? Toward whom was goodness exercised? On what condi-
tions? What would otherwise come to pass? Verse 22.
    NOTE. "Behold therefore the goodness." There is goodness in God's
severity. It cut off the Jews as a nation. It did not cut off a single Jew
as an individual. If he would not believe, he remained in condemnation.
His name as Israel, with the character of a sinner, would not save him.
But the severity against those who fell in a national way opened in an
equal way to every one the goodness and mercy of God, for in His sight
"there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free."
    5. What will be done to those who through unbelief have been cut
off, if they believe? Verse 23.
    6. What comparison does the apostle draw? Verse 24.
    NOTE.—"Contrary to nature." According to nature the fruit borne
is that of the scion, the engrafted piece, not the root; but contrary to
nature, in the work of redemption the scion itself becomes changed, and
the root indicates the character of the fruit. The Root of Israel is Christ
Jesus. The Gentile is a wild olive branch. But the fruit is of the Root,
not the branch.
    7. Of what would the apostle not have them ignorant? Why? Verse
25, first part.
                                   [8]
    8. What is the mystery? Verse 25, last part.
   9. In whom did the Hebrews find fullness? John 1:16.
   10. In whom do the Gentiles find fullness? Col. 1:19; 2:9, 10.
   NomE.—"The fullness." This term "fullness" has been greatly per-
verted. It has been made to mean the conversion of 'the Jews and their
restoration as a nation in the last days. But if the "fullness" applies to
Jews or Gentiles as persons, it must include every one, and we know
that not all of either class will be converted. The simple Scripture truth
is much clearer. The fullness is that which supplies all needs. To the
Jew it was offered in Christ Jesus. And of Him John says, "Of His full-
ness have all we received, and grace for grace." "For it pleased the
Father that in Him should all fullness dwell." Col. 1:19. There every
believing Jew found it. But addressing the Gentile Christians, Paul
said, "In Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and in
Him ye are made full." Col. 2:9, 10, R. V. The fullness of Jew and
Gentile is in Christ Jesus our Lord; and the blindness, or hardness,
came to Israel until all the covenant blessings in Christ were offered to
the Gentiles, offered to each and all alike, Jew and Gentile.
    11. What will be the result of this experience? What prophecy will
thus be fulfilled? Rom. 11:26.
    NomE.—"And so." That is, by faith in Christ, the Fullness, shall
Israel be saved. "Thou [the Gentile convert] standest by faith," and the
Jews will stand also if they abide not in unbelief in Christ the Fullness.
And therefore there shall come "out of Zion the Deliverer." Only in the
Deliverer can fullness of blessing be found.
    12. What covenant included this full salvation? Verse 27; Heb.
8:10-12.
    13. What seemingly contradictory statement does the apostle make
concerning the children of Israel? Rom. 11:28.
    NoTE.—"Enemies . . . beloved." Looked upon as a whole, as a
nation, the Israelites were excluded, cast off for the sake of all others;
but they are beloved still for the sake of the covenants made with the
fathers.
    14. What assurance is given concerning the gifts and calling of God?
Verse 29.
    NOTE.—"Without repentance." God does not repent of the good He
has done. Man may misuse His gifts, despise His goodness, yet Infinite
Love will not repent that He bestowed that love. For God loves man-
kind, not because it is lovable, but because He is love; and "we love,
because He first loved us." 1 John 4:19, R. V.
    15. What should the believing Gentiles know? Verses 30, 31.
    16. What has God done to all? Why? Verse 32.
    NoTE.—"All . . . all." God has done this because Infinite Wisdom
knew that only in His mercy was there hope for man. Man may fix up
a thousand schemes by which it is thought he singly or unitedly may
                                   [9 1
save himself, but all his efforts will prove futile. All are in unbelief, for
all have sinned; and God in His goodness proffers mercy unto eternal
salvation to all.
    17. What is said of God's wisdom and knowledge? Verse 33.
    NomE.—"We cap never by searching find out. God. We must not
attempt to lift with presumptuous hand the curtain behind which He
veils His majesty. The apostle exclaims, 'How unsearchable are His
judgments, and His ways past finding out             can so far comprehend
His dealings with us, and the motives by which He is actuated, that we
may discern boundless love and mercy united to infinite power. Our
Father in heaven orders everything in wisdom and righteousness, and
we are not to be dissatisfied and distrustful, but to bow in reverent sub-
mission. He will reveal to us as much of His purposes as it'-is for our
good to know, and beyond that we must trust the Hand that is omnipo-
tent, the Heart that is full of love."—"The Great Controversy," p. 527.
    18. In what is His all-sufficiency shown? Verses 34-36.
    NOTE.—"Of Him" in their origin, "through Him" in their disposal,
"unto Him" (R. V.) that all His purposes may be fulfilled to His glory.
It would seem that the apostle was carried away with God's marvelous
plan of saving man, as he closes this doctrinal part of this great epistle.
The grace of Christ, given in God's wisdom, love, and power, meets all
man's needs, solves all perplexities, works for man's eternal good, and
redounds to the praise and glory of God.

                     Lesson 4 — April 25, 1931

                       A Living Sacrifice
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 12: 1-8.
OTHER TEXTS: 1 Corinthians 12; Eph. 4:7, 8, 11, 12.
                         THE LESSON
   1. By what does the apostle beseech his brethren? Rom. 12:1, first
part.
    NoTE.—"Nothing so pleases God as daily surrender, the sacrificed
and yielded will tied by cords to His altar. Such an attitude is the only
reasonable one we can assume. If God be all we profess to believe, He
is worthy of all we are. But we are reminded that the world is ever
seeking to mold us to its will, and we need the renewing grace of the
Holy Spirit, that we may withstand its baleful influence. We need to
be transformed—that is, transfigured—by the renewing of our mind.
Please God, and you will be pleased with the will of God."—F. B. Meyer.
                                 [ 10]
    2. What does he plead with them to do? Verse 1, last part.
    NOTE.—"Present." "The verb used is the regular word used for
bringing to offer in sacrifice."
    "Your bodies." "The body is the organ of practical activity, which
practical activity is to be dedicated to God; better still, as an indication
that the sanctification of Christian life is to extend to that part of man's
nature which is most completely under the bondage of sin."—Alford.
    "A living sacrifice." In contrast to the offerings of beasts which were
slain. The beast could be offered but once; the body is a continual sac-
rifice, denying itself all the evil tendencies and lusts, and serving God
positively.
    "Reasonable." Logical, spiritual. It is rendered both.
    "In the time of ancient Israel, every offering brought as a sacrifice
to God was carefully examined. If any defect was discovered in the
animal presented, it was refused; for God had commanded that the
offering be 'without blemish.' So Christians are bidden to present their
bodies, 'a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.' In order to do
this, all their powers must be preserved in the best possible condition.
Every practice that weakens physical or mental strength unfits man for
the service of his Creator. And will God be pleased with anything less
than the best we can offer?"—"The Great Controversy," p. 473.
    3. To what should we not be conformed? Verse 2, first clause.
    Norz.—The Revised Version reads: "Be not 'fashioned' according
to this world." We owe the world nothing, any more than we are debtors
to the flesh. Rom. 8:12. "The unregenerate flesh is evil and the whole
world lieth in the evil one." God has called us out of both. We are not
only not to be enslaved with the lusts of the flesh, but we are not to be
molded, conformed to, fashioned, according to the world; we are to rise
above its power and influence. We are in the world, but we should not
be of the world. (See John 15:17-19.)
    4. How are we transformed? Verse 2, second clause.
    NOTE.—"Be ye transformed." The world transforms us for death.
Under God we are molded for life. Not by our own power do we win, but
by the power of God, and we cooperating with Him. Let His Holy Spirit
into your life. Plead His promise of a new heart, a new spirit, follow
God's word, and so prove Him by a life of partnership. The attractions
of the world will wither, and the promises of God will be life channels
between us and the God of life.
    5. What will we thus prove? Verse 2, last clause.
    NOTE.—"There is a great work to be accomplished for Sabbath
keepers. Their eyes must be opened, and they see their true condition,
and be zealous and repent, or they will fail of everlasting life. The spirit
of the world has taken possession of them, and they are brought into
captivity by the powers of darkness. They do not heed the exhortation
of the apostle Paul: 'And be not conformed to this world: but be ye
transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.' "—"Testimonies,"
Vol. 1, pp. 478, 479.
                                 [• 11 ]
    6. How should a man not think of himself? How should he think of
himself? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Not to think of himself more highly." A proper abiding
conception of the gifts of God's Spirit, or spiritual gifts, would prevent
an undue estimate of our own power and ability, and foster humility,
and would also keep us from becoming worshipers of men.
    7. Of what are we members? Verses 4, 5.
    NOTE.—"One body." Christ is the Head (Eph. 1:22, 23; Col. 1:18),
and believers are members one of another. So should we ever regard
one another.
    8. How do we become members of His body? 1 Cor. 12:12, 13.
    NoTE.—"By a comparison of the church with the human body, the
apostle aptly illustrated the close and .harmonious relationship that
should exist among all members of the church of Christ."—"The Acts
of the Apostles," p. 317.
    "In loving sympathy and confidence God's workers are to unite with
one another. He who says or does anything that tends to separate the
members of Christ's church, is counterworking the Lord's purpose.
Wrangling and dissension in the church, the encouragement of suspicion
and unbelief, are dishonoring to Christ. God desires His servants to
cultivate Christian affection for one another. True religion unites
hearts not only with Christ, but with one another, in a most tender union.
When we know what it means to be thus united with Christ and with our
brethren, a fragrant influence will attend our work wherever we go."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 145.
    9. How are gifts bestowed? Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:11.
    10. For what purposes are they bestowed? Eph. 4:11, 12.
    NOTE.—"Gifts." Read 1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4:7-12; the
parable of the talents in Matthew 25, and that of the pounds in Luke 19.
We will learn, from these Scriptures, that the gifts were bestowed upon
the church by our Lord through the Spirit when He ascended; that gifts
are bestowed upon all; that they are given for. His people to improve
and to profit by in the upbuilding of the church and the work of the
ministry; that they are given as God wills—not as man wills; that they
are to remain in the church till our Lord's return; that then all will have
to account for their use. These gifts are very precious, and our Lord
likens them to highest denominations of money in the Jewish and Roman
systems.
    11. What gifts are mentioned in our lesson? Rom. 12:6-8.
    12. In what order does the apostle elsewhere present these gifts?
1 Cor. 12:28.
    13. How should these gifts be exercised? Rom. 12:8.
    NoTx.—"With simplicity." The marginal reading is, "liberally," or
"with liberality." R. V.
    "With cheerfulness." "It is in exhibiting compassion, which is often
the compulsory work of one obeying his conscience rather than the spou-
                                   t 12
taneous effusion of love, that cheerfulness is so peculiarly required, and
so frequently wanting."—Alford. How do you answer the offending
one who has apologized or who asks forgiveness? Do you cheerfully say,
"I freely and fully forgive?" or does your very manner imply that in
your heart you condemn?

                      Lesson 5 — May 2, 1931

             Practical Duties and Privileges
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 12 : 9-21.
                             THE LESSON
    1. How should love be exercised? Rom. 12:9, first part.
    NomE.—"Without dissimulation." The Revised Version reads, "Let
love be without hypocrisy." In other words, let it not be pretense. Let
it come from the heart, born of God, "shed abroad" by the Holy Spirit.
Rom. 5:5.
    2. What should we abhor? Verse 9, second part.
    Noma.—"Abhor." Evil comes to us in very many pleasing forms.
Sometimes it does not seem harmful. Its appeal to us is strong, and
many people yield to it. Our only safety is to ask what God's word says
of it. What is its origin? What its purpose? What its end? If it is evil,
however beautiful may be its flowering, its end is death. Then when it
comes to us as a temptation, look upon it as death. See it as God sees it.
"Abhor" it.
    3. To what should we cleave? Verse 9, last part.
    NomE.—"Cleave." To adhere to, to be attached strongly.
    4. How should we regard each other? Verse 10.
    Noma.—"Kindly affectioned." The word in the original is that used
for affection toward near relatives. Alford renders the text, "In love of
the brethren be affectionate one to another; in giving honor, outdoing
one another." "Not waiting to be loved by another, but thyself spring
forward to the act, and make the beginning." -
    "The fact that we are under so great obligation to Christ, places us
under the most sacred obligation to those whom He died to redeem. We
are to manifest toward them the same sympathy, the same tender com-
passion and unselfish love, which Christ has manifested toward us.
Selfish ambition, desire for supremacy, will die when Christ takes pos-
session of the affections."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 170.
                                  [ 13 ]
    5. How diligent should we be? Verse 11, first part.
    NoTE.—"Not slothful." "In diligence, not slothful."—Alford. It
pertains first of all to the Lord's business; and yet all the Christian's
business ought to be the Lord's business. Whether it be raising corn, or
building houses, or keeping books, he should be doing all for God, under
whose all-searching eye all work must come at last. We-cannot do God's
business for Him and ours for ourselves • all should be for God. How
can we understand otherwise "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength" But how far short we come! We will find when we plan for
God, He will plan for us.
   6. What disposition should we manifest in the Lord's service? Verse
11, last part.
    NOTE.—"Those who are slothful may quiet themselves with the
thought that God requires nothing of them because they have no in-
crease. This will be no excuse for them; for if they had diligently em-
ployed their time, if they had not been slothful in business, they would
have had increase. Had they resolutely exerted themselves to earn some-
thing to cast into the treasury of God, ways would be opened for them,
and they would have some increase to devote to the cause of God, and
thus to lay up a treasure in heaven."—"Testimonies," Vol. 1, p. 325.
   7. What profitable injunctions are next given? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"Instant in prayer." "There is necessity for diligence in
prayer; let nothing hinder you. Make every effort to keep open the com-
munion between Jesus and your own soul. Seek every opportunity to go
where prayer is wont 10. be made. Those who are really seeking for
communion with God, will be seen in the prayer meeting, faithful to do
their duty, and earnest and anxious to reap all the benefits they can gain.
They will improve every opportunity of placing themselves where they
can receive the rays of light from heaven.
   "We should pray in the family circle; and above all we must not
neglect secret prayer; for this is the life of the soul. It is impossible for
the soul to flourish while pfayer is neglected. Family or public prayer
alone is not sufficient. In solitude let the soul be laid open to the in-
specting eye of God. Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-
hearing God."—"Steps to Christ," p. 102.
   8. How should others be remembered? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—"The Bible lays much stress upon the practice of hospitality.
Not only does it enjoin hospitality as a duty, but it presents many beau-
tiful pictures of the exercise of this grace and the blessings which it
brings."—"Testimonies," Vol. 6, p. 341.
   9. How should we regard our enemies? Verse 14; Matt. 5:44, 45.
   10. How should we join others in their experiences? Rom. 12:15.
    NOTE.—"God's servants should have hearts of tender affection and
sincere love for the followers of Christ. They should manifest that deep
interest that Christ brings to view in the care of the shepherd for the
                                   [14]
lost sheep; they should follow the example given by Christ, and exercise
the same compassion and gentleness, and the same tender, pitying love
that He has exercised toward us."—"Testimonies," Vol. 3, pp. 186, 187.
    11. What should be our general course of conduct? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—Three important things: (1) "Be of the same mind one
toward another." There is no place for grudges, ill-feeling, hatred, or
any of that ilk if verse 10 is true in our life. (2) "Mind not high things
[that is, "Set not your mind on high things," R. V.] ; but condescend to
men of low estate." Note also the margin. Have regard, as Jesus did,
to the poor and meek and humble. "The common people heard Him
gladly." (3) Do not be exalted in your own mind. At the best we know
but little, and self-exaltation shuts out God. "The meek will He guide
in judgment: and the meek will He teach His way."
  12. What course should we not pursue toward those who wrong us?
What example should we set? Verse 17.
   13. How should we live with others? Verse 18.
   NOTE.—"Live peaceably." It may not be possible, but it must not
be our fault. As much as depends upon us, we should live in peace.
"Follow peace with all." Heb. 12:14; Rom. 14:19. We may always
have peace with God. Rom. 5:1.
   14. What should we not do for ourselves? Verse 19, first part.
   NoTE.—"Give place unto the wrath of God." A. R. V. We should
leave all avenging of wrongs with God. He knows all motives. He will
deal justly,—that which man can never do in his wrath. Of Jesus it is
said that He "committed His cause to Him that judgeth righteously."
1 Peter 2:23, margin.
   15. To whom should we commit our cause? Verse 19, last part.
   16. How should we treat an enemy? Verse 20.
    17. By what should we not be overcome? How may we overcome?
Verse 21.
    NoTE.—"Overcome evil." The Christian's weapons, motives, pur-
poses, are not retaliation, they are not to destroy. He is to return good
for evil, sweet for bitter. He will find that such things will be more
effective for good than it would be to heap coals of fire on the head of
an enemy. In his own life he is to fight the evil by filling the thoughts,
the heart, the life, with God. We never put away evil, never overcome
evil, by dwelling upon it. "Fill our hearts with Thy love, that there may
be no room for competing affections," is a good prayer.

                     Lesson 6 — May 9, 1931
      Duty Toward Governments; Last-Day
                  Warnings
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 13.
                             THE LESSON
     1. To what should every soul be subject? Rom. 13:1, first part.
     NOTE.—"Be subject." Be cheerfully obedient. Neither be rebellious,
nor imbibe the seditious spirit of the lawless; for all authority is of
God's ordaining or permission. "His precepts regard an established
power, be what it may. It, in all matters lawful, we are bound to obey.
. . . If the civil power commands us to violate the law of God, we must
obey God before man. . . . These distinctions must be drawn by the
wisdom granted to Christians in the varying circumstances of human
affairs. They are all only subordinate portions of the great duty of
obedience to law."—Alford.
      2. From whom proceeds all power? Verse 1, last part.
      3. What is said of those who resist civil authority? Verse 2.
    4. To what are rulers a terror? Verse 3, first part.
    NOTE.—"A terror." The tendency of all proper civil power is salu-
tary, notwithstanding the abuses in government. It would be a fearful
world if there were not civil, organized authority.
    5. What then is the proper course to pursue? Verse 3, last part.
    6. What is the ruler in his proper sphere? Verse 4. (Compare Jer.
27:6, first part.)
    NOTE.—"The minister of God." Nebuchadnezzar, even in his proud
idolatry, is called God's "servant." He may not have known it, but he
was, nevertheless, a minister of God. This has no doubt been true of
other rulers. Yet apart from God's overruling guidance, they have all
shown the inherent greed and perversity of fallen humanity.
    7. What motive should impel the Christian to right actions? Rom.
13:5; 1 Peter 2:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"For conscience' sake." A higher motive than fear or force
actuates the Christian. His own conscience, "for the Lord's sake," will
keep him. He needs not laws to compel him or prevent him, but to inform
him as to what the proper authority requires. So long as the authority
of the government is exercised within its proper sphere, every true Chris-
tian should, and will, obey its requirements.
    8. What further duties do we owe these powers? Rom. 13:6.
    NOTE.—"We are to recognize human gove'rnment as an ordinance of
divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within
its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the claims of
God, we must obey God rather than men. God's word must be recognized
as above all human legislation. . . . We are not required to defy author-
                                   ( 161
ities. Our words, whether spoken or written, should be carefully consid-
ered, lest we place ourselves on record as uttering that which would
make us appear antagonistic to law and order."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 69.
    9. What therefore should we render? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"Tribute." The payment of money for the state. "Custom"
is toll, or tax, on produce. "Fear" is to be exercised toward those having
power, those set over us; and "honor" toward all upon whom the state
has conferred distinction.
    10. What obligation does the apostle lay upon us? Of what is love
the fulfilling? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—Dean Alford remarks: " 'Pay all other debts. Be indebted
in the matter of love alone.' This debt increases the more, the more it is
paid, because the practice of love makes the principle of love deeper and
more active."
    11. What general summary is given of the law in reference to our
duties to our fellows? In what statement is the spirit of the law compre-
hended? Verse 9. •
   12. What does love not do? In what therefore is love summed up?
Verse 10. (Compare John 14:15; 15:10.)
   NOTE.—"Love . . . law." Love toward God is unworthy of the
name if it does not delight to keep God's law. Love fulfills the law by
doing it willingly, gladly. 1 John 5 :3.
    13. What should God's children know in these days? Why should
this knowledge stir them? Rom. 13:11.
    NOTE.—"Knowing the time." Not mere duration, but the special,
appointed season, the character of the generation and the period in
which we live, foretold by great prophecies and signs.
    "The coming of Christ is nearer than when we first believed. The
great controversy is nearing its end. The judgments of God are in the
land. . . . But there are many, many in our churches who know little
of the real meaning of the truth for this time. I appeal to them not to
disregard the fulfilling of the signs of the times, which says so plainly
that the end is near. 0, how many who have not sought their souls' sal-
vation will soon make the bitter lamentation, 'The harvest is past, the
summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!'
    "We are living in the closing scenes of this earth's history. Prophecy
is fast fulfilling. The hours of probation are fast passing. We have no
time—not a moment—to lose. Let us not be found sleeping on guard.
Let no one say in his heart or by his works, 'My Lord delayeth His com-
ing.' Let the message of Christ's soon return sound forth in earnest
words of warning."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 252.
    14. What is said of the time? What should we cast off? What should
we put on? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"We resemble soldiers slumbering in their tents while dawn
is flushing the sky. Presently the bugle rings out its awakening note.
The long night of the world is ending, the dawn is on the sky, and all the
                                  [ 17 ]
malignity of men and demons cannot postpone it by a single hour. Let
us put off the garments which only befit the darkness, and array our-
selves in the armor of the day! What is that armory In a word, it is
Jesus Christ—His character and method, His unselfishness and purity—
so that when men see us, they may involuntarily turn to Him."—F. B.
Meyer.
    15. How should we walk? Verse 13. (Compare 1 Thess. 5:4, 5; Luke
21:34.)
 • NOTE.—"As in the day." God's children are of the day. The revelers,
the dishonest, the immoral, are of the night, and it is toward the dawn-
ing of the morning that such a class are always locked in deepest slum-
ber, unmindful of sin or crime, of danger or duty.
    16. What injunction includes all duties? Rom. 13:14.
       SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS FOR HOME STUDY
   1. Give three examples, in the Scriptures, in which men stood for
God against the decrees of government.
   2. How did Jesus distinguish between duty to God and duty to
government?
   3. What is absolutely essential that we may fulfill the law?


                     Lesson 7 —May 16, 1931
                             Judge Not
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 14 : 1-12.
                       THE LESSON
    1. How should we treat those who are weak in the faith? Rom. 14:1.
    NOTE.—"Weak in the faith." Alford suggests that this "weak in the
faith" was probably the overscrupulous Jewish convert afraid of meats
offered to idols, or of being brought into contact with undiscoverable
uncleanness. In foreign lands he abstained from prepared food, and ate
only that which he could trace from nature to his own use. Various
ceremonial days had strong hold upon a conscience not wholly enlight-
ened and a faith not strong. These converts were to be received as
Christians, and their doubtful thoughts not judged nor condemned.
    2. What may some believe? What might the weak do? Verse 2.
    3. What caution is given to all? Verse 3.          ,
    4. What rebuke is given to the one who assumes to judge others?
Verse 4, first part.
    5. What admonition does Jesus give concerning the matter of judg-
ing? Matt. 7:1-3..
    NOTE.—The words of Jesus "describe one who is swift to discern a
defect in others. When he thinks he has detected a flaw in the character
or the life, he is exceedingly zealous in trying to point it out ; but Jesus
                                   [ 181
declares that the very trait of character developed in doing this un-
Christlike work, is, in comparison with the fault criticized, as a beam in
proportion to a mote. It is one's own lack of the' spirit of forbearance
and love that leads him to make a world of an atom."—"Mount of Bless-
ing," p. 180.
     6. Before whom must each one stand or fall? Rom. 14:4, second part.
     7. What can God do for every true child, despite human judgment?
Verse 4, last part.
     NOTE.—"Shall be holden up." Despite man's judgment, God is able
to make His children stand. One of the great, dominant thoughts of this
chapter is, Judge not.
     8. To what other differences among Christians did the apostle refer?
Verse 5, first part.
     NomE.—"Every day." By "every day" we must not infer that the
Sabbath is included. This is guarded in the great fundamental law, the
Decalogue, over which there can be no question. The expression evi-
dently means the "every [rest] day" of the days apart from the Sabbath,
such as were connected with the yearly feasts,—the Passover, the day
of atonement, etc. See Exodus 16:4, where the term "every day" is used,
including only "the six working days." (Compare Ex. 16:4, 27, 28;
Eze. 46:1.) The controversy and the questionings pertained to the
national feast days, as Passover, Pentecost, and others, which had been
celebrated as a matter of lifelong habit by the Jews. As feasts of Leviti-
cal obligation they were no more of force after the cross, but as national
festivals they had a strong hold upon many among the Jewish converts.
     9. What was every man to be? Verse 5, last part.
     NoTE.—"In his own mind." God holds each one responsible. Each
person must decide for himself. This is true in moral as well as in cere-
monial observances. The power of choice is for each individual to exer-
cise. God indicates His choice for us also; let us be willing to choose
His way.
     "In matters of conscience, the soul must be left untrammeled. No
one is to control another's mind, to judge for another, or to prescribe
his duty. God gives to every soul freedom to think, and to follow his own
convictions. 'Every one of us shall give account of himself to God.' No
one has a right to merge his own individuality in that of another. In all
matters where principle •is involved, 'let every man be fully persuaded
in his own mind.' In Christ's kingdom there is no lordly oppression, no
 compulsion of manner. The angels of heaven do not come to the earth
 to rule, and to exact homage, but as messengers of mercy, to cooperate
 with men in uplifting humanity."—"The Desire of Ages," p.550.
     10. To whom and for whom do all serve who are children of faith?
 Verse 6.
     11. What is said of one's influence and responsibility? Verse 7.
     NOTE.—"Many fail where they should be successful, because they do
 not realize how great is the influence of their words and actions. They
 are affected by circumstances, and seem to think that their lives are their
                                   [19]
own, and that they may pursue whatever course seems most agreeable to
themselves, irrespective of others. Such persons will be found self-
sufficient and unreliable. They do not prayerfully consider their position
and their responsibilities, and fail to realize that only by a faithful dis-
charge of the duties of the present life, can they hope to win the future,
immortal life."—"Testimonies," Vol. 4, p. 562.
    12. To whom do we live or die? To whom do we wholly belong?
Verse 8.
    13. What price has been paid for us? Verse 9; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
    NoTE.—"Our bodies belong to Him who made them, and we are in
duty bound to become intelligent in regard to the best means of preserv-
ing them from decay. If we enfeeble the body by self-gratification by
indulging the appetite, and by dressing in accordance with healt        h-
destroying fashions, in order to be in harmony with the world, we be-
come enemies of God."—Id., Vol. 3, p. 63.
    14. In view of the price paid for all, what pertinent questions are
asked both classes? Before what tribunal shall we all stand? Rom.14:10.
    15. What scripture is quoted in proof of this? Verse 11. (Compare
Isa. 45:23.)
    16. Of whom and to whom shall each one give account? Rom. 14:12.
    NOTE.—"Every one." The great judgment day is an individual
affair. We cannot hide in the crowd, nor shield ourselves behind some
one else. We must then stand alone, face to face, so to speak, with God.
He is the Lawgiver, He is the Judge. Bearing this in mind, we shall not
care to judge, despise, or condemn our brother. The great thought from
the lesson will be, Let me follow God's way.
        SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS FOR HOME STUDY
   1. What is the real thought or lesson the apostle is seeking to
impress I
   2. What rule should govern our eating and drinking 'I 1 Cor. 10:31.


                     Lesson 8 —May 23, 1931

                       The Call of Faith
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 14: 13-23.
                              THE LESSON
   1. In view of the great price which God has paid for us, and of the
great fact that we must all stand before Him in judgment, what should
we never again do? Rom. 14:13, first part.
   2. About what should we be careful? Verse 13, last part.
   NomE.—"Judge this rather." Let your judging, your discernment,
your criticism, turn upon your own acts. If you are strong, look beyond
yourself to your weak brother. "None of us liveth to himself, and no
                                  [ 20 ]
man dieth to himself." More than your own desire and tastes is the soul
of your weak brother. Let no act of yours put a stumblingbloek or an
occasion for stumbling in his way. (See Matt. 18:6.)
    3. Of what was the apostle persuaded? What exception did he
make? Verse 14.
    NoTE.—"Nothing unclean." The uncleanness here referred to must,
in the light of the earlier part of the chapter, have reference to cere-
monial uncleanness in that mixed church of Jew and Gentile converts.
Nevertheless, if the conscience of the Christian Jew said they were un-
clean, let him not violate his conscience. To him they were unclean. Let
him keep his conscience free.
    4. If we have no regard for our brother's weakness, what reproof
do we merit? What should our liberty not do? Verse 15.
    NomE.—The word "meat" comes from a Greek word "broma," mean-
ing food.
    "To love God and man is the Christian's whole duty. The law of love
is written upon the tablets of the soul, the Spirit of Christ dwells in him,
and His character appears in good works. Jesus became poor, that
through His poverty we might be made rich. What sacrifices are we
willing to make for His sake I Have we His love enshrined in our hearts?
Do we love our neighbor as Christ loved us/ If we have this love for
souls, it will lead us to consider carefully whether by our words, our acts,
our influence in any way, we are placing temptation before those who
have little moral power. We shall not censure the weak and suffering,
as the Pharisees were continually doing, but we shall endeavor to remove
every stone of stumbling from our brother's path, lest the lame be turned
out of the way.
    "As a people, we profess to be reformers, to be light bearers in the
world, to be faithful sentinels for God, guarding every avenue whereby
Satan could come in with his temptations to pervert the appetite. Our
example and influence must be a power on the side of reform. We must
abstain from any practice which will blunt the conscience or encourage
temptation."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 360.
    5. To what end should love and wisdom control our liberty? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—Your strong faith is good. Let it not justly be condemned.
   "We who believe the truth should be very careful to give no occasion
for our good to be evil spoken of. We should know that every step we
take is in accordance with the Bible; for those who hate the command-
ments of God will triumph over our missteps and faults."—"Early
Writings," p. 70.
   6. In what does the kingdom of God not consist? What are its es-
sentials? Verse 17.
   NomE.—"Kingdom of God." The kingdom of God is founded upon
the eternal principles of righteousness; and from that righteousness,
received by faith, come peace and joy in the all-controlling Spirit of
God. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness," are
the words of Jesus. Matt. 6:33.
                                   [ 21 ]
   7. What may be said of the one who possesses these essentials of the
kingdom? Verse 18.
   8. What two things should we therefore pursue? Verse 19.
   NOTE.—Pursue the things that make for peace, true peace, God's
peace, in which there is no compromise with evil, sin, or sorrow. Do not
pursue that which will tear your brethren down, but rather that which
will build them up. Do not let differences over food turn you away from
God's building-up program. Edify one another; build one another up.
   9. What should we not do for the sake of food? Verse 20, first part.
   NOTE.—"Destroy not." Destroy neither yourself in overindulgence,
nor your neighbor by a bad example.
    10. If even good things cause stumbling, what are they to us? Verse
20, last part.
     NOTE.—"Eateth, with offense." What a mighty appeal the apostle
makes for unselfishness toward our brethren who may differ in opinion
and eating habits from us. "Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom
Christ died." Verse 15. "All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for
that man who eatetlf.With offense." Another version reads: "It is evil
for that man who by eating makes another stumble." The next verse
reads, "It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything
wherewith thy brother stumbleth, . . . or is made weak." Remember,
"It is good for the one who thus denies himself."
   11. What great general principle does the apostle enunciate? Verse
21; 1 Cor. 8:13.
    12. Whom alone should our faith guide or control? Rom. 14:22,
first part.
   13. Who in these matters may be accounted happy? Verse 22, last
part.
     14. What brings condemnation? Why? Verse 23.
     NoTE.—"Because he eateth not of faith." Faith has respect to God,
and• centers in Him. It has respect not alone to His promises, but to His
precepts. In all things it defers to Him, yields to Him. "Without faith
it is impossible to please Him." Not to please Him is to be out of har-
mony with Him, and to be out of harmony with God is sin.
         SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS FOR HOME STUDY
   1. Although neither food nor drink can save us, does that fact give
us liberty to follow blindly a perverted appetite? Prov. 23:1-3.

    "Read the Bible, and regard it as the voice of God speaking directly

        Helping the Weak; Glorifying God
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 15:1-13.
                            THE LESSON
   1. What 'ought the spiritually strong to do? What should they not
do? Rom. 15:1.
   2. What exhortation is given us? What is the end in view? Verse 2.
   NOTE.—"Please his neighbor." Not to that neighbor's hurt, but to
that neighbor's good. The Christian is to upbuild his neighbor. That is
one of the purposes of the gifts. Eph. 4:12. This is the law of God's
kingdom,—every one in his appointed place, every one working for all
others, and each served by all, blessed by all. Only love can do this.
   3. What example is given us in self-denial for others? Verse 3, first
part. (Compare Matt. 16:24.)
   NOTE.—" 'Christ pleased not Himself.' He did nothing for Himself ;
His work was in behalf of fallen man. Selfishness stood abashed in His
presence. He assumed our nature that He might suffer in our stead.
Selfishness, the sin of the world, has become the prevailing sin of the
church. In sacrificing Himself for the good of men, Christ strikes at the
root of all selfishness. He withheld nothing, not even His own honor
and heavenly glory. He expects corresponding self-denial and sacrifice
on the part of those whom He came to bless and save. Every one is
required to work to the extent of his ability. Every worldly considera-
tion should be laid aside for the glory of GOd. The only desire for
worldly advantages should be that we may the better advance the cause
of God."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 204.
    4. What prophecy of Christ is quoted in support of this? Rom. 15:3,
last part; Ps. 69:9.
    NOTE.—"It is written." The words quoted from this psalm are ad-
dressed to the Father, not to man. But they show that Jesus, while doing
the Father's work, bore in His own person all the reproaches that men
cast upon the Father. They show that Jesus pleased not Himself.
   5. What does the apostle declare concerning all Scripture? Rom. 15:4.
   NOTE.—"Through patience and comfort of the Scriptures." Through
the patience and comfort which the Scriptures give, hope is born and
confirmed in the hearts of the children of faith. "The expression, 'What-
soever things were written aforetime,' applies to the whole ancient
Scriptures [the Old Testament], not to the prophetic parts only."—
Alford.
   6. What prayerful exhortation does the apostle utter? Verse 5.
   NOTE.—Dwell on the clauses of the text—"the God of patience," the
long-suffering God; "the God of . . . consolation," the comforting
God; "like-minded one toward another," to build one another up; not
                                23 l
according to the world, or our own limited, imperfect way, but "accord-
ing to Christ Jesus." Then will God indeed be glorified.
     7. What will be the result of this unity? Verse 6.
     NoTa.—"The Lord has given us in His word definite, unmistakable
instructions, by obedience to which we may preserve union and harmony
in the church. Brethren and sisters, are you giving heed to these inspired
injunctions, Are you Bible readers, and doers of the word? Are you
striving to fulfill the prayer of Christ, that His followers might be one?
'The God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one
toward another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind
and one mouth glorify God.'"—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 248.
     8. What further exhortation does the apostle give? Verse 7.
     9. For what was Jesus our Lord a minister to the Hebrews? Verse 8.
    10. How much further did His ministration reach? Verse 9, first part.
    11. What scripture is quoted in proof of this? Verse 9, last part.
 (Compare Ps. 18:49.)
    12. What other scripture is quoted to show that the good tidings
must come to the Gentiles? Verse 10.
    13. What further prophecies of our Lord are quoted? Verses 11, 12.
(Compare Ps. 117:1; Isa. 11:10.)
    NoTE.—The praise given to God shows how far His salvation ex-
tended, and it included both Jew and Gentile. It all centers in the Root,
our blessed Lord.
    14. For what blessed experience in God's children does the apostle
pray? Verse 13.
    NoTE.—"The God of hope." The God of patience, or long-suffering,
is also the God of hope, the One from whom all our hopes spring, in whom
they all center. The inspired prayer is God's promise to the children of
faith. He will fill the believer with all joy and peace, that hope may
abound. The power through which this is accomplished is that of the
Holy Spirit.

                    Lesson 10 — June 6, 1931
               Ministering God's Blessings
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 15:14-33.
                      THE LESSON
  1. Of what three things was Paul persuaded of the Roman believers?
Rom. 15:14.
     NOTE. "The epistle hastens to its close. As to its instructions, doc-
trinal or moral, they are now practically written. The way of salvation
lies extended, in its radiant outline, before the Romans, and ourselves.
. . . Little remains but the missionary's last words about persons and
plans, and then the great task is done.
     "He will say a warm, gracious word about the spiritual state of the
Roman believers. He will justify, with a noble courtesy, his own authori-
tative attitude as their counselor. He will talk a little of his hoped for
and now seemingly approaching visit, and matters in connection with it.
He will greet the individuals whom he knows, and commend the bearer
of the letter, and add last messages from his friends. Then Phoebe may
receive her charge, and go on her way."—"The Expositor's Bible,"
p. 408.
    2. How only could the believers be filled with all goodness and knowl-
edge? Eph. 3:17-21.
    NOTE.—"The apostle breaks out into the memorable confession of
the power of the cross in his own life. Verses 20, 21. It stood between
him and the past. His self-life was nailed there, and this new life was
no longer derived from vain efforts to keep the law, but from the in-
dwelling and uprising of the life of Jesus—the perennial spring of
John 4:14."—F. B. Meyer.
    3. What did the apostle feel it necessary to do? Rom. 15:15.
    4. What kind of work did God expect of him? What was anticipated
as a result of his work among the Gentiles? Verse 16.
    5. In thus serving God, in whom might he glory? Verse 17.
    6. Of what things only would he speak? Verse 18.
    7. How was the power of God manifest through him? What was the
result? Verse 19.
    8. What was he ever anxious to do? Verse 20.
    NomE.—"Another man's foundation." Paul wanted proof from God
for his own labors. He did not care or dare to speak of others' work, but
only of his own. Verse 18. He would lay but the one foundation, Christ
Jesus. 1 Cor. 3:11.
   9. What scripture evidently urged Paul thus to work? Verse 21.
(Compare Isa. 52:15.)
   10. What did his work in new fields prevent him from doing?
Verse 22.
                                    25
    11. What did he say of his present field of labor? For what did he
long? Verse 23.
    NoTE.—"He [Paul] was indeed to 'see Rome,' and for no passing
`sight of the scene.' For two long years of sorrows and joys, restraints
and wonderful occasions, innumerable colloquies, and the writing of
great Scriptures, he was to 'dwell in his own hired lodgings' there. But
he did not see what lay between. For Paul ordinarily, as always for us,
it was true that 'we know not what awaits us.' For us, as for him, it is
better.'to walk with God in the dark, than to go alone in the light.' "—
"The Expositor's Bible," pp. 413, 414.
    12. What did the apostle conditionally promise? For what did he
hope? Verse 24.
    NoTE.—"Journey into Spain." It is a matter of dispute among
scholars as to whether the great apostle ever visited Spain. Such, he
tells us, was his intention. He did visit Rome, but under far different
circumstances from those he had planned. Yet with him it was well.
Rom. 8:28.
    13. What was he then purposing to do? For what object? Verse 25.
(Compare Acts 19:21; 20:22; 24:17.)
    14. What contributions did he expect to take with him? Verse 26.
(Compare 2 Cor. 9:1, 2.)
    15. With what spirit had the contributions been made? Verse 27,
first clause. (Compare 2 Cor. 9:11, 12.)
    16. What mutual obligation did the apostle mention? Verse 27,
last part.
    NoTE.—"Debtors they are." The world looks upon the spiritual bless-
ings lightly, upon the temporal as of far greater value. Yet the temporal
things perish with the using, the spiritual things are eternal. Would
that God's gifts might be better and more strongly appreciated. We
would then see that even our temporal things are increased by them.
    17. After Paul had been to Jerusalem, what did he purpose to do?
Verse 28.
    18. Of what was he assured? Verse 29.
    19. What did he earnestly ask the brethren to do? Verse 30.
    20. For what four things did he wish them to pray? Verses 31, 32.
    21. What benediction did he pronounce upon them? Verse 33.
    NoTE.—"Peace." In turbulent Rome, God's children had need of
peace. In this turbulent world, how much we need the "God of peace"
at all times! This is the legacy which the blessed Saviour left for His
people here in the world. John 14:27.

                   Lesson 11 —June 13, 1931

                    Greetings and Unity
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 16 : 1-20.
                             THE LESSON
    1. Whom did the apostle Paul commend to the church at Rome?
Rom. 16:1.
    NOTE.—Cenchrea was the eastern port of Corinth, about nine miles
distant. It seems to have been a town of considerable importance in the
apostle's day. Phoebe was a servant, or deaconess, at Cenchrea, and may
well have been the bearer of this epistle.
    2. What did he ask them to do for her? Why should they aid her?
Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"Keeping the commandments of God requires of us good
works, self-denial, self-sacrifice, and devotion for the good of others;
not that our good works alone can save us, but that we surely cannot
be saved without good works. After we have done all that we are capable
of doing, we are then to say, We have done no more than our duty, and
at best are unprofitable servants, unworthy of the smallest favor from
God. Christ must be our righteousness, and the crown of our rejoicing."
—"Testimonies," Vol. 3, p. 526.
    3. What two other laborers does Paul next name? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—Priscilla (Prises) and Aquila were among the strong lay
helpers of the gospel. Priscilla seems to have been the more prominent,
as her name is sometimes mentioned first. Paul first met them at Corinth.
Acts 18:2. They were natives of Pontus, and went with Paul to Ephesus.
Here they instructed Apollos in the truth. Then they went to Rome, and
later returned to Ephesus. They had gathered in Rome a church which
met in their own house.
   4. Why were they worthy•of honor? Who besides Paul should feel
grateful to them? Verse 4.
    5. Who are next mentioned? Verses 5-7.
    NorrE.—We know naught of these persons only as they are here men-
tioned by the apostle. It is good to know that Paul had relatives in
Rome, who accepted the gospel before he did, consequently were known
to the apostles. Junia was probably the wife of Andronicus.
    6. What other workers unknown to us does he name? Verses 8-15.
    Nom—Of this list of Christians we know nothing, save that Rufus
is supposed to be the son of Simon of Cyrene. Mark 15:21. The mother
of Rufus seems also to have been like a mother to Paul, one of the
mothers whom Paul found by following Christ. Mark 10:29, 30. But all
God's unknown workers are recorded on high. The mention of these
shows what high regard Paul cherished for his personal helpers indi-
vidually.
                                 I 27
    7. What further instruction did the apostle give? Verse 16.
    NoTE.—"Rom. 16:1-16. Here is a window into Paul's heart. He was
apparently disowned by his own kindred, yet, as the Lord had promised,
he had mothers, sisters, and brothers a hundredfold. What a contrast
there is between the spirit of this chapter and that of the mere disputant
or theologian, the stoic or monk! We see also the courtesy, purity,
thoughtfulness, and tenderness of Christian relationships.
    "Women are here—Phcebe, Priscilla, Mary, Junia, Persis, Julia, and
others. The apostle realized.the immense help that holy women could
furnish in the ministry of the gospel. Men are here—old and young,
fathers, brothers, and sons. Lovely titles are given with a lavish, though
a discriminating hand—succorer, helpers, beloved, approved in Christ,
saints. How especially beautiful the appellation, the beloved Persis,
who labored much in the Lord! The kiss was the common mode of
greeting, but there was to be a new sanctity in it, as though Christ were
between. This church in Rome was a model for other churches. Would
that we could realize the same spiritual unity that presided over the
gatherings of these early saints!"—F. B. Meyer.
   8. Against what class did the apostle warn the church? Verse 17.
   NoTE.—"Those who cause divisions on obscure points of doctrine
are to be avoided, lest they lead us away from the fundamentals. We
need to be wise in heavenly wisdom and guileless in regard to evil."
—Ibid.
   9. What were the characteristics of these persons? Verse 18. (Com-
pare Phil. 3:19.)
    10. What could he say of the church in Rome? Verse 19, first part.
    NoTE.—Rome was then the center of the world. All information went
out more readily from Rome to all parts of the empire than from any
other center. Churches elsewhere became greatly interested in the be-
lievers who were under the shadow of the palace of the Caesars.
   11. Yet while the apostle rejoiced in.their obedience, what did he
wish? Verse 19, last part.
    NOTE.—The apostle did not wish them to be wise in wickedness, but
to know naught of it. We do not need to study counterfeits to know the
genuine, but we do need to know the genuine that we may discern at once
the counterfeit.
    12. What assurance of triumph does the apostle give them? Verse
20, first part.
    NOTE.—A renewal, in promise, of the prophecy made four thousand
years before. Gen. 3:15. At the very longest, the triumph of evil will
soon be over. The light afflictions are for a moment, the triumph is an
eternal weight of glory. 2 Cor. 4:17.
   13. What benediction does he pronounce upon them? Verse 20, last
part.
                               [28]
         SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS FOR HOME STUDY
    1. What striking element of Christian work is emphasized in this
lesson'? (See Acts 20:20, 27, 31-35.)
    2. Can there be love of a church and not love of the individual
members'?


                   Lesson 12 — June 20, 1931

                 The Obedience of Faith
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Romans 16:21-27.
                      THE LESSON
    1. What fellow worker and relatives of Paul sent greetings to the
church at Rome? Rom. 16:21.
    NoTE.—Timotheus we know as Timothy, Paul's "son in the faith"
and fellow worker. For Lucius see Acts 13:1; Jason, Acts 17:5;
Sopater, Acts 20:4. The identity of none of these is certain, but
probable.
    2. Who wrote the epistle to the Romans for Paul? What did he say?
Verse 22.
    3. What others sent salutations? Verse 23.
    NOTE.—Gaius is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:14 as having been
baptized by Paul. The word rendered "chamberlain" seems to refer to
treasurer, and it is so rendered by Alford and others. This shows that
the gospel had reached high official circles.
   "We are not all, as were Gaius and Erastus, men of note and wealth,
but we can all resemble Quartus, 'a brother.' "—F. B. Meyer.
   4. What benediction did the apostle repeat? Verse 24.
    5. What did he say God is able to do? Verse 25, first clause.
    6. By what are we established? 2 Chron. 20:20; Heb. 13:9.
    7. According to what does God establish us? Rom. 16:25, first part.
    8. How was the mystery kept in times past? Verse 25, last part.
    NOTE.—God's great plan of salvation is not new. Sin did not take
Him by surprise. All the efforts of Satan against the government of
heaven have made more glorious God's love and mercy. The death of
Jesus, designed of the evil one to destroy the kingdom of God, in God's
wisdom opened up and revealed such depths of God's love as amazed the
universe. The silence of the ages burst into an eternal song of praise.
    "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan formu-
lated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of 'the mystery which
hath been kept in silence through times eternal.' It was an unfolding of
the principles that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God's
throne. From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of
                                   [29 1
Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive power of the apos-
tate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its
existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emergency."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 22.
   9. In what sense was the gospel kept secret? Eph. 3:5, 6.
    NOTE.—"The science of redemption is the science of all sciences; the
science that is the study of the angels and of all the intelligences of
the unfallen worlds; the science that engages the attention of our Lord
and Saviour; the science that enters into the purpose brooded in the
mind of the Infinite,—'kept in silence through times eternal;' the science
that will be the study of God's redeemed throughout endless ages."—
"Education," p. 126.
  10. What had been the condition of the unbelieving Gentile world?
Eph. 2:12.
   11. 'When is the mystery of the gospel made fully manifest? Rom.
16:26, first clause.
   12. In whom was it revealed? John 1:14.
   13. By what is it made known to us? Rom. 16:26, second clause.
   14. According to what is this mystery made known? To whom?
Verse 26, third clause.
    NOTE.—"The everlasting God." "In the word, God is spoken of as
'the everlasting God.' This name embraces past, present, and future.
God is from everlasting to everlasting. He is the Eternal One."—"Testi-
monies," Vol. 8, p. 270.
   15. For what purpose is it made known? Verse 26, last part.
   NOTE.—"Obedience." This is the purpose of the goispel. The "obedi-
ence of faith," the trusting, loving obedience of the child to a father
worthy to be loved. If the gospel fails in this, it fails of its purpose.
But, praise God, it never fails.
   16. How only is obedience possible? Gal. 5:6,; 1 John 5:3.
  17. To whom is the glory of all this revelation ascribed? Through
whom? Rom. 16:27.
   18. What is the closing word? Verse 27.
   NoTE.—"Amen." "Yea," "verily," "it is true." It is a Hebrew word
meaning firm, constant, certain, sure. It affirms the truth of what is
spoken. Let it be in us, all that God designs in this epistle, in Christ
Jesus. For "all the promises'of God in Him are yea, and in Him Amen."
2 Cor. 1:20.

       SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS FOR HOME STUDY
   1. By what is the heart established?
   2. What obedience only is acceptable to God?
   3. As all is wrought through God, to whom does the glory belong?
                                 (30]

   "God imparts His gifts to us that we also may give, and thus make
known His character to the world."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 300.
    "Men are guilty of robbery toward God. Their selfish use of means
robs the Lord of the gloiy that should be reflected back to Him in the
relief of suffering humanity and the salvation of souls."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 371.
   "The Bible must be made the foundation for all study. Individually
we must learn from this lesson book which God has given us, the condi-
tion of the salvation of our souls; for it is the only book that tells us
what we must do in order to be saved."—"Fundamentals of Christian
