                    Lesson 1—October 3, 1931

                    The Mount of Blessing
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 5:1-12.
MEMORY VERSE: "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute
    you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake."
    Matt. 5:11.
LESSON HELPS: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 17-58; "The Desire of Ages," pp.
    298-305.
                               The Lesson
    1, From what parts of the country had the people come who were
following Jesus? Matt. 4:25.
    2. As the multitude surrounded Him, where did Jesus go? Who
came close to Him? Matt. 5:1.
    NOTE.—"The Sermon on the Mount, though given especially to the
disciples, was spoken in the hearing of the multitude. After the or-
dination of the apostles, Jesus went with them to the seaside. Here in
the early morning the people had begun to assemble. . . . The narrow
beach did not afford even standing room within reach of His voice for
all who desired to hear Him, and Jesus led the way back to the moun-
tain side. Reaching a level space that offered a pleasant gathering
place for the vast assembly, He seated Himself on the grass, and the
disciples and the multitude followed His example.
    "The disciples' place was always next to Jesus. The people con-
stantly pressed upon Him, yet the disciples understood that they were
not to be crowded away from His presence."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 298, 299.
    3. Whom does He first call blessed? Why are they blessed? Verses
2, 3.
   NoTE.—The "poor in spirit" are those who recognize that they are
nothing and have nothing outside of Christ. They feel their entire de-
pendence upon One who is mighty to save. To them are promised the
greatest and best of all riches,—the kingdom of heaven "within you"
(Luke 17:21), and "in the world to come, eternal life" (Mark 10:30).
    4. Upon whom does the Lord say that He looks with favor? Isa. 66 : 2.
    5. By what parable did Jesus emphasize this truth? Luke 18:10-14.
     6. What does Jesus say of those who mourn? Matt. 5:4.
     NOTE.—"They that mourn." (1) For their sins. Sorrow for sin is
the first condition of forgiveness. It is the best assurance that the sin
will not be willingly repeated. The mourning state is blessed because
it is a necessary step to the more blessed state of forgiveness. (2) For
temporal losses. Mourning for a dear one that death has taken, or in
sympathy with the afflicted, or even for property loss mellows the spirit,
and tends to lead the mourner to sorrow for sin. And there is comfort
for the sorrowing from the "God of all comfort."
     7. What does He say of the meek? Verse 5.
                                    [ 33
    NOTE.—"The meek." Those who are patient and gentle under trial
or under wrong. They show no spirit of retaliation, no resentment, no
bigotry, no hardness. Self and self-consciousness are subdued. The
spirit is not contentious, or quarrelsome, or irritable. Self-possession;
calmness, and peace mark all they say and do.
     True meekness comes from Christ. "It is the love of self that de-
troys our peace. While self is all alive, we stand ready continually to
guard it from mortification and insult; but when we are dead, and our
life is hid with Christ in God, we shall not .take neglects or slights to
heart. We shall be deaf to reproach, and blind to scorn and insult. . . .
The meekness of Christ, manifested in the home, will make the inmates
happy; it provokes no quarrel, gives back no angry answer, but soothes
the irritated temper, and diffuses a gentleness that is felt by all within
its charmed eircle."—"Mount of Blessing," pp. 31, 32.                  •

     8. Upon whom does Jesus next pronounce a blessing? What promise
is theirs? Verse 6.         •
     NOTE.—Hunger is one of the strongest cravings of human nature.
Men have become so overpowered by it that they have taken human life
to relieve it; but thirst is even more intense.- Men go insane from thirst.
Men sometimes live without food for many days, but they can live only
a short time without water. These characteristics of our physical needs
should teach us the importance of supplying our spiritual sustenance.
Does our body need bread? More than this our souls need the bread of
life. Does the physical man call for water? Infinitely more do we need
the water of life? But if we hunger and thirst, the Great Provider will
abundantly supply our need.
     9. What promise is made to the merciful? Verse 7.
     NOTE.—"The merciful." In human experience, only those who know
how to exercise mercy may obtain mercy; and those who do exercise
mercy are sure to obtain mercy. The Lord exercises mercy toward us,
that we may learn the meaning of mercy, and so become better ac-
quainted with.Him, and, like Him, exercise it toward our fellow men.
"If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
forgive you."
     "The merciful are 'partakers of the divine nature,' and in them the
compassionate love of God finds expression. All whose hearts are in
sympathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek to reclaim, and not
to condemn."—Id., p. 39.
     10. What is said of the pure in heart? Verse 8.
     NOTE.—"In one who is learning of Jesus, there will be manifest a
 growing distaste for careless manners, unseemly language, and coarse
 thought. When Christ abides in the heart, there will be purity and re-
finement of thought and manner. But the words of Jesus, 'Blessed are
 the pure in heart,' have a deeper meaning,—not merely pure in the sense
 in which the world understands purity, free from that which is sensual,
 pure from lust, but true in the hidden purposes and motives of the soul ;
 free from pride and self-seeking; humble, unselfish, childlike."—Id.,
 p. 42.
     11. What class does Jesus next mention? What shall they be called?
 Verse 9.
                                    4
     NOTE.—It is easy to stir up strife, to cause hard feelings among as-
sociates. Many heartaches, much sorrow and suffering, have been caused
by the thoughtless word and the unkind gossip. The true Christian will
seek to heal all differences between others, and to promote a spirit of
love and harmony.
     Where contention and strife and irritability make life miserable,
the one who possesses the gift of composing differences, who has the
happy faculty of "pouring oil on the troubled waters," has indeed a
blessed ministry. The world is so full of unrest and conflict that peace-
makers are needed everywhere, in the home, in the church, in the com-
munity.
     12. Who among the persecuted are blessed? What is given to them?
Verse 10.
     13. How is the experience of the persecuted further described?
Verse 11.
     NOTE.—"While slander may blacken the reputation, it cannot stain
the character. That is in God's keeping. So long as we do not consent
to sin, there is no power, whether -human or satanic, that can bring a
stain upon the soul. A man whose heart is stayed upon God. is just the
same in the hour of his most afflicting trials and most discouraging sur-
roundings, as when he was in prosperity, when the light and favor of
God seemed to be upon him."—.-Id., p. 52.
     14. What should God's people do when persecuted? What reason is
given for rejoicing? Who has shared in this experience? Verse 12.
     NOTE.—"It was this joy that filled the hearts of Paul and Silas when
 they prayed and sang praises to God at midnight in the Philippian dun-
geon. Christ was beside them there, and the light of His presence irra-
 diated the gloom with the glory of the courts above. From Rome, Paul
 wrote, unmindful of his fetters as he saw the spread of the gospel,
 therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.' And the very words of Christ
 upon the mount are reechoed in Paul's messagelo the Philippian church,
 in the midst of their persecutions, 'Rejoice in the Lord always and
 again I say, Rejoice.' "—Id., pp. 57, 58.


                   Lesson 2—October 10, 1931
                 Admonitions to Believers
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 5:13-26.
MEMORY VERSE: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
    good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." Matt. 5:16.
LESSON HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 306-311; "Mount of Blessing,"
    pp. 59-92.
                             The Lesson
    1. Name the classes which Jesus calls blessed in His Sermon on the
Mount. Matt. 5:3-11.
    2. Continuing His instruction, what does Jesus declare His people
to be? Verse 13, first part.
                                 [5]
     3. To what are those compared who lose these blessed experiences?
Verse 13, last part.
     NOTE.—Salt is a preservative, and is therefore used as a symbol
here. God's church, instead of bringing calamity upon the world, pre-
serves the world. Ten good persons in Sodom would have kept it from
destruction.
    " 'But if the salt have lost his savor.' That this is possible in the
land of Judea, we have proof from Mr. Maundrell, who, describing the
Valley of Salt, speaks thus: 'Along, on one side of the valley, towards
Gibul, there is a small precipice about two men's lengths, occasioned .by
the continual taking away of the salt; and in this, you may see how the
veins of it lie. I broke a piece of it, of which, that part that was ex-
posed to the rain, sun, and air, though it had the sparks and particles
of salt, yet it had perfectly lost its savor: the inner part, which was
connected to the rock, retained its savor, as I found by proof.' "—Clarke.
     "As they listened to the words of Christ, the people could see the
white salt glistening in the pathways where it had been cast out be-
cause it had lost its savor and was therefore useless. . . . It represents
the life of every soul from whom the power of the grace of God has de-
parted, and who has become cold and Christless."—"Mount of Bless-
ing," p. 60.
     4. To what else are the people of God likened? Verse 14.
     NOTE.—"In the brilliant light of the morning, the towns and vil-
lages upon the surrounding hills stood forth clearly, making an attrac-
tive feature of the scene. . . . Most of those who listened to the words
of Jesus were peasants and fishermen, whose lowly dwellings contained
but one room, in which the single lamp, on.its stand, shone to all in the
house."—Id., pp. 63, 64.
     5. For what is a light used? How is a lamp or candle made to serve
its purpose? Verse 15.
• NoTE.—"No other light ever has shone or ever will shine upon fal-
len rhan, save that which emanates from Christ. . . . Humanity has
in itself no light. Apart from Christ, we are like an unkindled taper,
like the moon when her face is turned away from the sun; we have not
a single ray of brightness to shed into the darkness of the world. But
when we turn toward the Sun of Righteousness, when we come in touch
with Christ, the whole soul is aglow with the brightness of the divine
 presence."—Id., p. 64.
     6. What should a follower of Christ be to the world? How is the
 Father glorified? Verse 16.                                      •
     NOTE.—"Angels of glory wait to communicate through you heaven's
light and power to souls that are ready to perish. Shall the human agent
fail of Accomplishing his appointed work/ Oh, then to that degree is
the world robbed of the promised influence of the Holy Spirit!"—Id.,
 p. 67.
     7. How did Jesus guard against any possible charge that He was
setting aside the law of God? Verse 17.
     NoTE.—"Christ did not come to destroy the law or the prophets, but
to fulfill by obedience both in His own person and in the person of all
                                     6
who believe and obey."—William W. McLane, in the Homiletic Review
of October, 1908.
     "The, mission of Christ on earth was not to destroy the law, but by
His grace to bring man back to obedience to its precepts."—"Mount of
Blessing," p. 77.
     8. By what statement did Jesus show the unchangeableness and the
perpetuity of the law? Verse 18.
     NOTE.—"The smallest letter in the entire alphabet [Hebrew] is
called `Moth,' jot. It is as large as a comma. . . . Some of the He-
brew characters have what is known as crowns or tittles. These tittles
are about the size of the dot of the i. . . . The Saviour, in order to
show the people how He regarded the law, . . . said, in substance: Not
only do I believe in the law; . . . not only do I believe in its perpetu-
ity; not only do I believe that not a verse or a word can be changed;
but I believe and I teach that not the smallest letter in the Hebrew al-
phabet, nor the smallest point on that smallest letter of God's law, can
under any circumstances be set aside, or lightly esteemed.. As long as
the heavens and the earth shall remain, not a single point of any of the
law shall be annulled.". C. Gilbert.
     9. How did Jesus show the importance of obeying and teaching the
law of God? Vetse 19.
     NOTE.—The expression. "least in the kingdom of heaven" is trans-
lated by Adam Clarke thus: "Shall have no place in the kingdom of
Christ, here, nor in the kingdom of glory above."
     10. By what comparison does Jesus show that more than outward
observance of the law is required? Verse 20.
     11. What had Isaiah said the Lord would do with the law? isa.
42:21.
     12. How did Jesus fulfill this prophecy relative to the sixth com-
mandment? Matt. 5:21, 22.
     NOTE.—"'Whosoever shall say unto his brother, Rama [vain fellow],
shall be in danger of the council.' In the gift of His Son for our re-
demption, God has shown how high a value He places upon every human.
soul, and He gives to no man liberty to speak contemptuously of. an-
other. We shall see faults and weaknesses in those about us, but God
claims every soul as His property,—His by creation, and doubly His
as purchased by the precious blood of Christ."—"Mount of Blessing,"
p. 89.
     13. What is implied in this matter concerning our acceptance by the
Lord? Verses 23, 24.
     NOTE.—"Our brother may have done us a greater wrong than we
have done him, but this does not lessen our responsibility. If when we
 come before God we remember that another has aught against us; we are
 to leave our gift. of prayer, of thanksgiving, of freewill offering, and
 go to the brother with whom we are at variance, and in humility confess
 our own sin, and ask to be forgiven.
     "If we have in any manner defrauded or injured our brother, we.
should make restitution. If we have unwittingly borne false witness,
                                    [7 1
if we have misstated his words, if we have injured his influence in any
way, we should go to the ones with whom we have conversed about him,
and take back all our injurious misstatements."—Id., pp. 91, 92.
    14. Why should we agree quickly with an adversary? Verses 25, 26.
    NOTE.—"Verses 25, 26 contain another argument by an example for
putting an end as soon as possible to all angry feelings, and settling
everything that may lead to crime. 'Agree with,' come to an agree-
ment, settle your difficulty. 'Thine adversary.' The one who has a griev-
ance against you, that he is carrying to the law courts. Do not let anger,
which has been shown to be so dangerous, prevent or delay you. Do it
quickly, for a time will come when it will be too late, and you must
suffer the full consequences. 'The uttermost farthing,' that is, 'fourth
thing,'—here the fourth part of a Roman 'as,' a small brass coin worth
about a quarter of a cent. It is right and wise to apply this truth to
your oWn personal relations with God."—Peloubet.

                     Lesson 3—October 17, 1931
                       Magnifying the Law
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 5:27-37.
MEMORY VERSE: "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,
    but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
    the hearers." Eph. 4:29.
LESSON HELP: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 93-.105.

                               The Lesson
    1. Continuing His Sermon on the Mount, how did Jesus magnify
the meaning of the seventh commandment? Matt. 5:27, 28.
    2. How is the principle here involved made clear in another scrip-
ture? James 1:14, 15.
    3. What instruction shows the importance of keeping the heart pure?
Prov. 4:23.
    NoTE.—"The Jews prided themselves on their morality, and looked
with horror upon the sensual practices of the heathen. The presence
of the Roman officers whom the imperial rule had brought into Pales-
tine was a continual offense to the people; for with these foreigners had
come in a flood of heathen customs, lust, and dissipation. In Caper-
naum, Roman officials with their gay paramours haunted the parades
and piomenades, and often the sound of revelry broke upon the still-
ness of the lake, as their pleasure boats glided over the quiet waters.
The people expected to hear from Jesus a stern denunciation of this
class; but what was their astonishment as they listened to Words that
laid bare the evil of their own hearts! When the thought of evil is ldved
and cherished, however secretly, said Jesus, it shows that sin still reigns
in the heart."—"Mount of Blessing," pp. 93, 94.
    4. What illustration is given of the hatred that we should feel toward
sin? Matt. 5:29, 30.
    NoTE.—In the Revised Version, the expression "causeth thee to
                                      [81
stumble," is plainer than "offend thee." We should be willing to sacri-
fice what is as dear as the right hand or the right eye, rather than sin
against God. He wants the whole man clean. What is true of the in-
dividual is true of the church.
    "In order for us to reach this high ideal, that which causes the soul
to stumble must be sacrificed. It is through the will that sin retains its
hold upon us. The surrender of the will is represented as plucking out
the eye or cutting off the hand. Often it seems to us that 10. surrender
the will to God is to consent to go through life maimed or crippled.
But it is better, says Christ, for self to be maimed, wounded, crippled,
if thus you may enter into life. That which you look upon as disaster
is the door to highest benefit."—Id., pp. 95, 96.
    5. What instruction is given on the question of divorce as related
to the seventh commandment? Verses 31, 32.
    NoTE.—"Among the Jews a man was permitted to put away his
wife for the most trivial offenses, and the woman was then at liberty
to marry again. This practice led to great wretchedness and sin. In the
Sermon on the Mount Jesus declared plainly that there could be no
dissolution of the marriage tie, except for unfaithfulness to the mar-
riage vow."—Id., p. 99.
   6. What was the ancient law concerning oaths? Verse 33.
     7. What does Jesus say about swearing? Verse 34, first part.
     NOTE.—"I saw that some of God's children have made a mistake in
regard to oath taking, and Satan has taken advantage of this to oppress
them, and take from them their Lord's money. I saw that the words of
our Lord, 'Swear not at all,' do not touch the judicial oath. . . . I saw
that if there is anyone on earth who can consistently testify under oath,
it is the Christian. He lives in the light of God's countenance. He grows
strong in His strength. And when matters of importance must be de-
cided by law, there is no one who can so well appeal to God as the Chris-
tian. . . . Jesus submitted to the oath in the hour of His trial."—
Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 201-203.
   8. Why should one not swear by heaven? Verse 34, last part.
  9. At another time, what did Jesus say swearing by heaven meant?
Matt. 23:22.
  10. Why should one not swear by the earth? Nor by Jerusalem?
Matt. 5:35.
   11. For what reason ought one not to swear by his own head?
Verse 36.
    12. What simple manner of speech is becoming to a Christian?
Verse 37.
    NOTE.-"If these words of Christ were heeded, they would check
the utterance of evil surmising and unkind criticism ; for in comment-
ing upon the actions and motives of another, who can be certain of
speaking the exact truth'? How often pride, passion, personal resent-
ment, color the impression given! A glance, a word, even an intonation
of the voice, may be vital with falsehood. Even facts may be so stated'
                                   [9
as to convey a false impression. And 'whatsoever is more than' truth,
`is of the evil one.' "—"Mount of Blessing," p. 104.
    13. Upon another occasion what solemn declaration concerning our
words did Jesus make? Matt. 12:36.
    14. In the judgment, what part do our words have in the final de-
cision? Verse 37.
    15. What admonition, closely related to this lesson, does Solomon
give? Eccl. 5:2.
    16. How does Solomon picture the beauty of fitly spoken words?
Prov. 25:11.

                   Lesson 4—October 24, 1931

                         Love for Others
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 5:38-48.
MEMORY VERSE: "I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
    you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
    use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father
    which is in heaven." Matt. 5:44, 45.
LESSON HELP: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 106-118.
                              The Lesson
    1. What was the ancient law of compensation for wrongdoing?
Matt. 5:38 ; Lev. 24 : 17,22.
    NOTE.—"The rule, 'Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,' was a provision in
the laws given through Moses; but it was a civil statute. • None were
justifie'd in avenging themselves."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 109.
    2. Instead, then, of seeking to avenge one's self when wronged, to
whom should one look for redress? Prov. 20:22; Rom. 12:19.
    3. What instruction shows a great contrast between the right at,
titude of the Christian and the customs of the world? Matt. 5:39-41.
    NOTE.—"Jesus bade His disciples, instead of resisting the demands
of those in authority, to do even more than Was required of them. And,
so far as possible, they should discharge every obligation, even if it
were beyond what the law of the land required. The law, as given
through Moses, enjoined a very tender regard for the poor. When a
poor man gave his garment as a pledge, or as security for a debt, the
creditor was not permitted to enter the dwelling to obtain it; he must
wait in the street for the pledge to be brought to him. And whatever
the circumstances, the pledge must be returned to its owner at night- •
fall. In the days of Christ these merciful provisions were little re-
garded; but Jesus taught His disciples to submit to the decision of the
court, even though this should demand more than the law of Moses
authorized. Though it should demand a part of their raiment, they
werd to yield. More than this, they were to give to the creditor his
due, if necessary surrendering even more than the court gave him au-
thority to seize."—Id., pp. 110, 111.
                                  [ 10
    Verse 41 refers to a custom of the Roman soldiers in compelling
Jewish peasants who might be working in the fields or elsewhere, to
carry burdens for them along the highway or up the mountain side, or
render other service required by a company of soldiers.
    4. How should we respond to those who ask for help? Verse 42.
    5. What definite instruction should be our guide in giving to the
needy? Deut. 15:7, 8.
    NOTE.—A helpful comment upon this text is given. "This scripture
makes plain the meaning of the Saviour's words. Christ does not teach
us to give indiscriminately to all who ask for charity; but He says,
`Thou shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need;' and this is to be a
gift, rather than a loan; for we are to 'lend, hoping for nothing again.'"
—Id., p. 112.
    G. In what spirit should we render aid to the needy? Luke 6:35.
    7. What promise is made to those who give to the poor? Deut. 15:10.
    8. What other ancient saying did Jesus mention? Matt. 5:43.
    9. What course toward enemies does Jesus urge upon us? Verse 44.
    10. By following this instruction, whose children do we become?
Verse 45, first part.
    NOTE.—"The children of God are those who are partakers of His
nature. It is not earthly rank, nor birth, nor nationality, nor religious
privilege, which proves that we are members of the family of God;
it is love,—a love that embraces all humanity. Even sinners whose
hearts are not utterly closed to God's Spirit, will respond to kindness;
while they may give hate for hate, they will also give love for love.
But it is only the Spirit of God that gives love for hatred. To be kind
to the unthankful and to the evil, to do good hoping for nothing again,
is the insignia of the royalty of heaven, the sure token by which the
children of the Highest reveal their high estate."—Id., p. 115.
    11. What do we see in nature that proves the Father's love for all
mankind? Verse 45, last part.
     NOTE.—"It is not because of inherent power that year by year the
earth produces her, bounties, and continues her motion round the sun.
 The hand of God guides the planets, and keeps them in position in their
orderly march through the heavens. It is through His power that sum-
 mer and winter, seedtime and harvest, day and night follow each other
in their regular succession. It is by His word that vegetation flourishes,
 that the leaves appear, and the flowers bloom. Every good, thing we
 have, each ray of sunshine and shower of rain, every morsel of food,
 every moment of life, is a gift of love."—Id., pp. 114, 115.
     12. To whom may we justly be compared if we love and help those
 only who love us? Verse 46; Luke 6:32.
     13. What is intimated concerning those who greet their brethren
 only? Matt. 5:47.                   •
     14. What standard is set before us? Verse 48.
     NOTE.—"God's ideal for His 'children is higher than the highest
 human thought can reach. 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
                                  EliI
rather which is in heaven is perfect.' This command is a promise. The
plan of redemption contemplates our complete recovery from the power
of Satan. Christ always separates the contrite soul from sin. He came
to destroy the works of the devil, and He has made provision that the
Holy Spirit shall be imparted to every repentant soul, to keep him
from sinning.
    "The tempter's agency is not to be accounted an excuse for one wrong
act. Satan is jubilant when he hears the professed followers of Christ
making excuses for their deformity of character. It is these excuses
that lead to sin. There is no excuse for sinning. A holy temper, a
Christlike life, is accessible to every repenting, believing child of God."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 311.


                     Lesson 5—October 3 1 , 1931

                       Giving Alms; Prayer
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 6:1-18.
MEMORY VERSE: "If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
    will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
    your Father forgive your trespasses." Matt. 6:14, 15.
LESSON HELPS: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 119-132, 151-176; "Christ's Object
    Lessons," pp. 141-149 (new edition, pp. 139-148).

                                 The Lesson
    1. In talking to the people assembled on the mount, what instruction
did Jesus give concerning almsgiving? Matt. 6:1.
    NOTE.—"In the days of Christ the Pharisees were continually trying
to earn the favor of Heaven, in order to secure the worldly honor and
prosperity which they regarded as the reward of virtue. At the same
time they paraded their acts of charity before the people in order to
attract their attention, and gain a reputation for sanctity.
    "Jesus rebuked.their ostentation, declaring that God does not recog-
nize such service, and that the flattery and admiration of the people,
which they so eagerly sought, was the only reward they would ever
receive."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 120.
   2. How are we assured that a very simple act of kindness done in
the right spirit will be rewarded? Mark 9:41.
    3. What are those called who do good in order that they may have
the praise of men? In receiving their praise, what do they have? Matt.
6:2.
    4. By what figure of speech is the true spirit of service emphasized?
 Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"In these words Jesus did not teach that acts of kindness
should always be kept secret. . . . Christ's own words make His mean-
 ing plain,—that in acts of charity the aim should not be to secure praise
.and honor from men. Real godliness never prompts an effort at display.
 Those who desire words of praise and flattery, and feed upon them as
a sweet morsel, are Christians in name only."—Id., pp. 120, 121.
                                      [ 12
    5. What contrast is made in the rewards of those who give to be
seen of men and those who give from the right motive? Verses 1, 4.
    NoTE.—"We are to give in sincerity, not to make a show of our
good deeds, but from pity and love to the suffering ones. Sincerity of
purpose, real kindness of heart, is the motive that Heaven values. The
soul that is sincere in its love, whole-hearted in its devotion, God re-
gards as more precious than the golden wedge of Ophir."—Id., p. 121.
    6. What manner of praying is forbidden? Of what class of people
are ostentatious prayers characteristic? Verse 5.
    7. Where should Christ's followers love best to pray? Of what may
we be assured? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—"In the secret place of prayer, where no eye but God's can
see, no ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most hidden desires
and longings to the Father of infinite pity; and in the hush and silence
of the soul, that voice which never fails to answer the cry of human
need, will speak to our hearts. . . .
    "The soul that turns to God for its help, its support, its power, by
daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of
truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and
thirsting after righteousness."—Id., pp. 126, 127.
    "It is often said that we have no such place, and can secure none.
We are away from home; we are traveling; we are among strangers;
we are in stages and steamboats, and how can we find such places of
retirement? I answer, the desire to pray, and the love of prayer, will
create such places in abundance. The Saviour had all the difficulties
which we can have, but He lived in the practice of secret prayer. To be
alone He rose up 'a great while before day' and went into a solitary
place and prayed. With Him a grove, a mountain, a garden, furnished
such a place."—Barnes.                         •
    8. How do the heathen pray? Why do they pray in this manner?
Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"The heathen looked upon their prayers as having in them-
selves merit to atone for sin. Hence, the longer the prayer, the greater
the merit. If they could become holy by their own efforts, they would
have something in themselves in which to rejoice, some ground for
boasting. This idea of prayer is an outworking of the principle of
self-expiation which lies at the foundation of all systems of false re-
ligion. The Pharisees had adopted this pagan idea of prayer, and it
is by no means extinct in our day, even among those who profess to be
Christians. The repetition of set, customary phrases, when the heart
feels no need of God, is of the same character as the 'vain repetitions'
of the heathen."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 129.
    9. What does our heavenly Father know of each of us? Verse 8.
    10. Repeat the model prayer Jesus gave to His disciples. Verses
9-13.
    (a) How close is the relationship of God to His people, as expressed
in this prayer?
    (b) What are we to pray concerning His will?
    (c) For what are we to ask daily?
                                 [ 13 ]
    (d) What is the measure of forgiveness for which we may ask?
    (e) 0/ what help are we constantly in need?
    (f) With what words of praise does the prayer close?
   11. In what way did Jesus emphasize one part of the prayer?
Verses 14, 15.
   12. In the parable that Jesus used to illustrate prayer, what did a
man ask of his friend? How urgent was his need? Luke 11:5, 6.
   13. What answer was given to the request? Verse 7.
    14. What shows that the man continued to press his petition for
aid? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"The selfish neighbor in the parable does not represent the
character• of God. The lesson is drawn, not by comparison, but by con-
trast. A selfish•man will grant an urgent request, in order to rid himself
of one who disturbs his rest. But God delights to give. He is full of
compassion, and He longs to grant the requests of those who come unto
Him in faith. He gives to us that we may minister to others, and thus
become like Himself."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 141.
   15. What instruction is given concerning fasting? Matt. ,6:16-18.
   NOTE.—" 'Anoint thine head, and wash thy face.' These were for-
bidden in the Jewish canon on days of fasting and humiliation; and
hypocrites availed theinselves of this ordinance, that they might appear
to men to fast."—Clarke.


                  Lesson 6—November 7, 1931
         Our Father's Care for His Children
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 6:19-34.
MEMORY VERSE: "Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
    moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor
    steal." Matt. 6:20.
LESSON HELPS: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 133-150; "The Desire of Ages," pp.
    312, 313.
                             The Lesson
    1. Where does Jesus warn us not to place our treasures? What .dan-
ger threatens earthly treasures? Matt. 6:19.
    NOTE.—The rich and the poor, the high and the low among men,
were in the company that listened to Jesus as He sat upon the mount.
"The love of money was the ruling passion in the Jewish age. Worldli-
ness usurped the place of God and religion in the soul. So it is now.
Avaricious 'greed for wealth exerts such a fascinating, bewitching in-
fluence over,the life that it results in perverting the nobility and cor-
rupting the humanity of men, until they are drowned in Perdition. The
service of Satan is full of care, perplexity, and wearing labor, and the
treasure men toil to accumulate on earth is only for a season."—"Mount
of Blessing," p„ 133.
    2. Where may we find a safe place for our treasures? For whom do
we lay up these treasures? Verse 20.
                                  [ 14 ]
     NOTE.—Jesus does not forbid our having treasures, but He warns
 us to put them in a safe place. "The instruction is to 'lay up for your-
 selves treasures in heaven.' It is for your own interest to secure heav-
 enly riches. These alone, of all that you possess, are really yours. The
 treasure laid up in heaven is imperishable."—Id., pp. 133, 134.
     "In every effort to benefit others, we benefit ourselves. He who
"gives money or time for spreading the gospel enlists his own interest
 and prayers for the work, and for the souls to be reached through it;
 his affections go out to others, and he is stimulated to greater devotion
 to God, that he may be enabled to do them the greatest good. And at the
 final day, when the wealth of earth shall perish, he who has laid up
 treasure in heaven will behold that which his life has gained."—Id.,
 p. 135.
     3. What is the result of laying up our treasures in any place?
 Verse 21.
     4. How does Jesus further show the importance of seeking God
 with singleness of purpose and heart? What only is necessary to have
 the whole body full of light? Verses 22, 23.
     NOTE.—The direction of the eye shows the purposes of the man, and
 the laying up of treasures shows the affections of the heart. He who
 has a single purpose to do God's will and steadfastly looks to God will
 be guided and filled with the light of God. He whose purpose is turned
 upon the low, dark ambition of selfishness, worldliness, and sin will
 become a body of darkness.
     5. What can no man do? Why not? What two masters are men-
 tioned? Verse 24.
     NOTE.—"Christ does not say that man will not or shall not serve
 two masters, but that he cannot. The interests of God and the interests
 of mammon have no union or sympathy. Just where the conscience of
 the Christian warns him to forbear, to deny himself, to stop, just there
 the worldling steps over the line, to indulge his selfish propensities. On
 one side of the line is the self-denying follower of Christ; on the other
 side is the self-indulgent world lover, pandering to fashion, engaging
 in frivolity, and pampering himself in forbidden pleasure. On that
 side of the line the Christian cannot go.
     "No one can occupy a neutral position; there is no middle class,
 who neither love God nor serve the enemy of righteousness. . . . He
 who does not give himself wholly to God, is under the control of an-
 other power, listening to another voice, whose suggestions are of an
 entirely different character. Half-and-half service places the human
 agent on the side of the enemy, as a successful ally of the_ hosts of
 darkness."—Id., p. 139.
     6. When we are serving God, about what would He not have us
 become anxious? What is most important? Verse 25.
     NOTE.—Jesus anticipated that, some would be tempted to believe
 that they cannot get clothing or food unless they serve the world or
 themselves. His effort in. all this instruction is to lead men to the
 higher service alone, that of God. Whatever we do, do it as unto God,
 and leave results with Him. "Take no thought" is better expressed in
 the Revised Version, "Be not anxious." The word means anxious,
 troubled, worried thought. So also in verses 27, 28, 31, and 34.
                                    [ 15
   7. What illustration is given to teach us trust and confidence in our
Father's care for us? Verse 26.
    8. However anxiously we may take thought, what can we not do
for ourselves? Verse 27.
                                    •
    9. For what else are we not to be anxious? What are we asked to
consider? Verse 28.
    NOTE.—"Consider, says Jesus, how the lilies grow; how, springing
from the cold, dark earth, or from the mud of the river bed, the plants
unfold in loveliness and fragrance. Who would dream of the possibili-
ties of beauty in the rough brown bulb of the lily'? But when the life
of God, hidden therein, unfolds at His call in the rain and the sunshine,
men marvel at the vision of grace and loveliness. Even so will the life of
God unfold in every human soul that will yield itself to the ministry of
His grace, which, free as the rain and the sunshine, comes with its bene-
diction to all. It is the word of God that creates the flowers, and the
same word will produce in you the graces of His Spirit."—Id., p. 144.
    10. With all his caretaking, who was not arrayed as beautifully as
the lily? Verse 29.
   11. What may we conclude from these examples of God's care?
Verse 30.
   12. What admonition concerning anxiety for temporal things is re-
peated? Verse 31.
   13. What is the basis of this counsel? Verse 32.
    NOTE.—It is the Gentiles, nations of the world, who seek such things,
whose hopes are only temporal, earthly. The children of God should
have higher objectives. " 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.' I have
come to open to you the kingdom of love and righteousness and peace.
Open your hearts to receive this kingdom, and make its service your
highest interest. Though it is a spiritual kingdom, fear not that your
needs for this life will be uncared for. If you give yourself to God's
service, He who has all power in heaven and earth will provide for your
needs."—Id., p. 147.
    14. On what condition may we claim the promise that the necessary
things of life shall be given us? Verse 33.
    NOTE.—"Jesus' does not release us from the necessity of effort, but
He teaches that we are to make Him first and last and best in every-
thing. We' are to engage in no business, follow no pursuit, seek no
pleasure, that would hinder the outworking of His righteousness in
our character and life. Whatever we do, is to be done heartily, as unto
the Lord."—Id., pp. 147, 148.
    15. How should we relate ourselves to the future? Verse 34.
    NoTE.—Borrow no trouble for the future. God gives us to-day
strength for to-day's duties, trials, sorrows, evils. We can borrow no
grace for future troubles. How foolish it is, then, to borrow trouble
which we may not meet ! The day brings sufficient anxiety and care.
There is always grace for the day. God is a present help in trouble.

                 Lesson 7—November 14, 1931

        Judging Others; Asking of the Lord
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 7:1-14.
MEMORY VERSE: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,
    do ye even so to them." Matt. 7:12.
LESSON HELP: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 177-207, selected portions.

                               The Lesson
    1. Continuing His Sermon on the Mount, what did Jesus say we
should not do? Matt. 7:1.
    NomE.—Speaking of the Pharisees, this statement is made: "Their
own attainments became the standard by which they judged others.
Putting on the robes of self-dignity, they mounted the judgment seat,
to criticize and condemn. The people partook largely of the same spirit,
intruding upon the province of conscience, and judging one another in
matters that lay between the soul and God. It was in reference to this
spirit and practice that Jesus said, 'Judge not, that ye be not judged.'
That is, do not set yourself up as a standard. Do not make your opin-
ions, your views of duty, your interpretations of Scripture a criterion
for others, and in your heart condemn them if they do not come up to
your ideal. Do not criticize others, conjecturing as to their motives,
and passing judgment upon them. . . .
    "We cannot read the heart. Ourselves faulty, we are not qualified
to sit in judgment upon others. Finite men can judge only from out-
ward appearance. To Him alone who knows the secret springs of action,
and who deals tenderly and compassionately, is it given to decide the
case of every soul."—"Mount of Blessing," pp. 178, 179.
    2.- What rule will be followed when the Lord judges us? Verse 2.
    3. What illustration is used showing the unfitness of one brother to
 judge another? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—A "mote" is a speck of dust such as one sees floating in the
sunlight. This little particle is placed in contrast with a great beam or
timber used in building the framework of a house. How can one with
a great bean; of wood in his eye see to take a mere speck from another's
eye? Sitting in judgment on others is one of the greatest of sins. This
 judging does not refer to proper church discipline, where the Spirit
guides. 1 Corinthians 5.
    4. What inconsistent course do we frequently take? Verse 4.
   5. What should we do before beginning the work of reforming
others? Verse 5.
   NOTE.—"Not until you feel that you could sacrifice your own self-
dignity, and even lay down your life, in order to save an erring brother,
have you cast the beam out of your own eye, so that you are prepared to
help your brother. Then you can approach him, and touch his heart.
No one has ever been reclaimed from a wrong position by censure and
reproach; but many have thus been driven from Christ, and led to seal
their hearts against conviction. A tender spirit, a gentle, winning de-
                                 [ 17 ]
portment, may save the erring, and hide a multitude of sins."—Id.,
pp. 184, 185.
    6. What counsel should we follow respecting those who will not
hear God's truth? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—"Jesus here refers to a class who have no desire to escape
from the slavery of sin. By indulgence in the corrupt and vile, their
natures have become so degraded that they cling to the evil, and will
not be separated from it. The servants of Christ should not allow them-
selves to be hindered by those who would make the gospel only a matter
of contention and ridicule.
    "But the Saviour never passed by one soul, however sunken in sin,
who was willing to receive the precious truths of heaven. To publicans
and harlots His words were the beginning of a new life. Mary Magda-
lene, out of whom He cast sever; devils, was the last at the Saviour's
tomb, and the first whom He greeted in the morning of His resurrec-
tion. It was Saul of Tarsus, one of the most determined enemies of the
gospel, who became Paul, the devoted minister of Christ. Beneath an
appearance of hatred and contempt, even beneath crime and degrada-
tion, may be hidden a soul that the grace of Christ will rescue, to shine
as a jewel in the Redeemer's crown."—Id., p. 186.
   7. How are God's blessings to be obtained? What is the threefold
promise? Verse 7.
    8. What assurance is given to one who asks? seeks? knocks?
Verse 8.
    9. What illustration is cited to emphasize this truth? Verses 9, 10.
    NOTE.—It is characteristic of Jesus' teaching to draw upon the
things of common experience to illustrate spiritual truth. Here He
chooses the tenderest of human relations, that of parent and child, and
selects a touching incident in this relation—a hungry child asking for
something to eat. Parents will and must refuse some things asked by
children, but they do not refuse food to the children when they need it.
So our heavenly Father responds to the cry of him who hungers and
thirsts after righteousness.
    10. What conclusion is drawn from this illustration? Verse 11.
    11. What golden rule is given for our guidance under all circum-
stances? By what is this rule strengthened? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"In your association with others, put yourself in their place.
Enter into their feelings, their difficulties, their disappointments, their
joys, and their sorrows. Identify yourself with them, and then do to
them as, were you to exchange places with them, you would wish them
to deal with you. This is the true rule of honesty. It is another expres-
sion of the law, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' And it is
the substance of the teaching of the prophets."—Id., p. 192.
    12. Alluding to the Christian life as a pathway, what gate are we
urged to enter? Where do the wide gate and the broad way lead? What
is said of the number of travelers on the broad way? Verse 13.
   13. Why do but few find the way leading unto life? Verse 14.
   NOTE.—"If you would climb the path of spiritual life, you must
                              [18 1
constantly ascend; for it is an upward way. You must go with the'
few; for the multitude will choose the downward path.
    "In the road to death the whole race may go, with all their worldli-
ness, all their selfishness, all their pride, dishonesty, and moral debase-
Ment. There is room for every man's opinions and doctrines, space to
follow his inclinations, to do whatever his self-love may dictate. In
order to go in the path that leads to destruction, there is no need of
searching for the way; for the gate is wide, and the way is broad, and
the feet naturally turn into the path that ends in death.
    "But the way to life is narrow, and the entrance strait. If you
cling to any besetting sin, you will find the way too narrow for you to
enter. Your own ways, your own will, your evil habits and practices,
must be given up if you would keep the way of the Lord. He who would
serve Christ cannot follow the world's opinions, or meet the world's
standard. Heaven's path is too narrow for rank and riches to ride in
state, too narrow for the play of self-centered ambition, too steep and
rugged for lovers of ease to climb."—Id., pp. 197, 198.

       Fruit Bearing; Doing; Right Building
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 7:15-29.
MEMORY VERSE: "Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
    into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which
    is in heaven." Matt. 7:21.
LESSON HELP: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 208-218.

                               The Lesson
    1. In the closing verses recording the Sermon on the Mount, what
warning does Jesus give? In what guise do these false leaders come?
What is their true nature? Matt. 7:15.
    NoTE.—Jesus continues His Sermon on the Mount, pressing the
truths of His message closer and closer to the hearts of the people. The
sermon closes with a startling parable illustrating the extreme impor-
tance of putting His words into practice.
    2. How are we to discern these false prophets? What questions
does Jesus ask to make His meaning clear? Verse 16.
    3. What kind of fruit does every good tree bear? What is true of
a corrupt tree? Verse 17.
    4. What can a good tree not bring forth? What can a corrupt tree
not do? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—"We are not bidden to prove them [false prophets] by their
fair speeches and exalted professions. They are to be judged by the
word of God."="Mount of Blessing," p. 208.
    5. What is done with trees that do not bring forth good fruit?
Verse 19.
    6. Before fruitless trees are cut down, who inspects them? Luke
13:6.
                                    [ 19 ]
    7. What did the owner say to the caretaker? Verse 7.
    8. How does the dresser of the vineyard show his concern? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"In the parable the dresser of the vineyard does not question
the sentence that the tree, if it remained fruitless, should be cut down ;
but he knows and shares the owner's interest in that barren tree. Noth-
ing could give him greater joy than to see its growth and fruitfulness.
He responds to the desire of the owner, saying, 'Let it alone this year
also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it; and if it bear fruit, well.'
    "The gardener does not refuse to minister to so unpromising a plant.
He stands ready to give it still greater care. He will make its surround-
ings most favorable, and will lavish upon it every attention.
    "The owner and the dresser of the vineyard are one in their interest
in the fig tree. So the Father and the Son were one in their love for the
chosen people. Christ was saying to His hearers that increased oppor-
tunities would be given them. Every means that the love of God could
devise would be put in operation that they might become trees of right-
eousness, bringing forth fruit for the blessing of the world."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," pp. 215, 216.
    9. If all efforts in behalf of the fruitless tree fail, what is the final
verdict? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—"Are you, 0 careless heart, a .fruitless tree in the Lord's
vineyard? Shall the words of doom erelong be spoken of you? How
long have you received His gifts? How long has He watched and waited
for a return of love? Planted in His vineyard, under the watchful care
of the gardener, what privileges are yours! How often has the tender
gospel message thrilled your heart! You have taken the name of Christ,
you are outwardly a member of the church which is His body, and yet
you are conscious of no living connection with the great heart of love.
The tide of His life does not flow through you. The sweet graces of
His character, 'the fruits of the Spirit,' are not seen in your life.
    "The barren tree receives the rain and the sunshine and the gar-
dener's care. It draws nourishment from the soil. But its unproductive
boughs only darken the ground, so that fruit-bearing plants cannot
flourish in its shadow. So God's gifts, lavished on you, convey no bless-
ing to the world. You are robbing others of privileges that, but for you,
might be theirs.
    "You realize, though it may be but dimly, that you are a cumberer
of the ground. Yet in His great mercy God has not cut you down. He
does not look coldly upon you. He does-not turn away with indifference,
or leave you to destruction. . . . The pitying Saviour is saying concern-
ing you, Spare it this year also, till I shall dig about it and dress it."
—Id., pp. 216-218.
    10. What statement did Jesus repeat to His hearers on the mount?
Matt. 7:20.
    11. How only may we rightfully call Jesus "Lord"? Verse 21.
    12. What pleas will many make in the day of the Lord? Verse 22.
    13. How will Jesus respond to these boastful statements? Verse 23.
    NOTE.—"Saddest of all words that ever fell on mortal ear are those
                                    [ 20]
words of doom, 'I know you not.' . . . You are shut out from heaven
by your own unfitness for its companionship."—Id., p. 413.
    14. To whom does Jesus liken the obedient hearer of His sayings?
Verse 24.
    NOTE.—"The great principles of the law, of the very nature of God,
are embodied in the words of Christ on the mount. Whoever builds upon
them is building upon Christ, the Rock of Ages. In receiving the word,
we receive Christ. And only those who thus receive His words are build-
ing upon Him."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 213.
   15. What tests will such a house stand? Why? Verse 25.
   NOTE.—"We build on Christ by obeying His word. It is not he who
merely enjoys righteousness, that is righteous, but he who does right-
eousness. Holiness is not rapture; it is the result of surrendering all
to God; it is doing the will of our heavenly Father."—Id., pp. 214, 215.
    16. To whom does Jesus liken one who hears His sayings, but does
them not? Verse 26.
    NOTE.—"He who, like the Jews in Christ's day; builds on the foun-
dation of human ideas and opinions, of forms and ceremonies of man's
invention, or on any' works that he can do independently of the grace of
Christ, is erecting his structure of character upon the shifting sand.
The fierce tempests of temptation will sweep away the sandy founda-
tion, and leave his house a wreck on the shores of time."—Id., p. 216.
    17. What test will such a house not stand? What is said of its
fall? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—"You who are resting your hope on self, are building on. the
sand. But it is not yet too late to escape the impending ruin. Before the
tempest breaks, flee to the sure foundation."—Id., pp. 217, 218.
    18. How did the teachings of Jesus affect His hearers? Verse 28.
    19. Why were they astonished? Verse 29.


                 Lesson 9—November 28, 1931

           The Sending Forth of the Twelve
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 10:1-15.
MEMORY VERSE: "As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
    hand." Matt. 10:7.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 349-352.

                               The Lesson
     1. After ministering for some time in Galilee, whom did Jesus call
to Him? What power did He bestow upon them? Matt. 10:1.
     NOTE.—"The apostles were members of the family of Jesus, and
they had accompanied Him as He traveled on foot through Galilee.
. . . As Jesus ministered to the vast multitudes that gathered about
Him, His disciples were in attendance, eager to do His bidding and to
lighten His labor. . . . They taught what they had learned of Jesus,
                                  [ 21 I
 and were every day obtaining a rich experience. But they needed also
 an experience in laboring alone."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 349.
     To give them this experience, Jesus called them to Him, gave them
 the power for service, and sent them forth to gain the needed training
 for that wider service which they would be called upon to render after
 His return to His Father's throne.
     2. What were the names of the twelve apostles? Verses 2-4.
     3. In the beginning of their ministry, where were they cautioned
not to go? Verse 5.
     NomE.—Christ cautioned His disciples in these, their first efforts,
not to go to the Gentiles or to the Samaritans, but to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel. This did not indicate that they would never take
the gospel to the Gentiles, but that they were first to present the claims
of Jesus to Israel's straying ones. These were first to be called to re-
pentance and reformation that they might be ready for the kingdom.
More, the time allotted to special work for Israel as stated in Daniel's
prophecy (Dan. 9:24), had not expired. Seven years yet remained to
the people of Israel and to 'the city of Jerusalem. A turning to the
Gentiles at this time would have been premature. Later our Lord said
to His disciples, "Ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and
in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."
Acts 1:8. He here indicates that after His ascension they were to begin
their labors at home, and extend them to the whole world.
    4. Upon whom were the first efforts of the twelve to be bestowed?
Verse 6.
    5. What was to be the central theme of their message? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—The burden of the message to be borne by the apostles in
their first independent labor was, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Not merely were they to spread the news, but, endowed with power by
their Master, they were to demonstrate by their ministry the presence of
the kingdom in their lives. To them was given power against unclean
spirits, and for the healing of sickness and disease. With their Master
they were to be living witnesses of the nearness of the kingdom of
heaven to men. Only as this personal experience was manifest could
their message lay hold upon hearts and prepare them for the kingdom.
    6. What did . Jesus instruct them to do. for the people? Verse 8,
first part.
     7. What principle was to actuate their labor of love? Verse 8, last
part.
    8. What instruction did Jesus give them concerning provision for
their temporal needs? Verses 9, 10, first part.
     9. On what gospel principle was this instruction given? Verse 10,
last part.
    NOTE.—Christ had traveled throughout the country in which the
disciples were to ,labor. They had been with Him. As they went back
over the roads of Galilee and Judea, they traveled among friends and
those who had benefited from the ministry of the Saviour. The apostles
alsnwent forth to serve, to help, to minister, to those in need. Those who
                                   [ 22]
 benefited from their labor should provide for their actual needs. Hence
 His instruction to the apostles as they started forth.
     10. On entering a city, what inquiry was to be made? Where were
 they to abide? Verse 11.
      NOTE.—As they entered a city, they were to seek abode for the time
 of their sojourn in the home of some one who was "worthy." The orig-
 inal gives the thought of deserving or suitable. They were to seek an
 abiding place which would fit in with their mission, and from which
 they could uphold the name and kingdom of their Master.
      11. What were they to do upon entering a house? What was to be
 their attitude toward a worthy or an unworthy house? Verses 12, 13.
      NOTE.—The customary Oriental salutation was, "Peace be to this
 house." If the house was unworthy, the proffered blessing would not
  rest upon it.
      "Peace among the Hebrews had a very extensive meaning,—it com-
  prehended all blessings, spiritual and temporal. . . . To wish peace to
  a family, in the name and by the authority of Christ, was in effect a
-positive promise, on the Lord's side, of all the good implied in the wish.
  This was paying largely even beforehand. . . .
      " 'If that house be worthy'—if that family [shall be found to] be
  proper for a preacher to lodge in, and the master be ready to embrace
  the message of salvation.
      " 'Your peace'—the blessings you have prayed for shall come upon
 .the family: God will prosper them in their bodies, souls, and substance."
  —Dr. Adam Clarke.
      12. If their message was rejected, what were they to do on depart-
  ing? Verse 14.
      NOTE.—Christ's instruction to the apostles to shake the dust off
  their feet as they departed from a city that had rejected their mes-
  sage was in harmony with the ancient Oriental custom. It signified that
  the one who did it carried no further responsibility for that city—they
  had made their own choice.
      13. To the fate of what cities is the fate of those who rejected their
  message compared? Verse 15.
      NOTE.—The fate of those who reject the overtures of God's mercy
  is compared unfavorably with the fate of those who perished in the
  destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire. What must be the fate of
  those to-day who reject the greater light available to them, and spurn
  as of no account the warnings and entreaties of a merciful and just
   God?

                 Lesson 10—December 5, 1931
          Instruction for Personal Ministry
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 10:16-28.
MEMORY VERSE: "For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
    which speaketh in you." Matt. 10:20.

                              The Lesson
    1. To what are those likened among whom Christ sent forth the
apostles? Matt. 10:16, first part.
    2. What counsel did He give the apostles for meeting these condi-
tions? Verse 16, last part.
    NoTE.—Christ knew as He sent forth the apostles for personal min
istry that theirs would be no easy task. The leaders of Israel had re.
jected Him, sought to entrap Him, endeavored by guile and subterfuge
to lead Him into pitfalls that they might have cause to discredit and
destroy Him. They would do no less in opposition to His disciples. He
therefore warns them to live and act with discretion and wisdom, but
love and peace were to be the controlling principles in their bearts.
    3. Of whom were they to beware? For what reasons? Verse 17.
    4. Before whom would they be brought? For what three reasons?
Verse 18.
    5. What provision would be made for them when arraigned before
councils and rulers? Verse 19.
    6. Who would be the spokesman in the hour of trial? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—If God's servants are faithful in their study of the truths
of His word, storing up, filling the mind with the principles of His
kingdom, then when asked for a reason of their faith, whether before
judges or councils, or in trial by the adversary of their souls, God
through His Spirit will give them words to speak. He will bring to
their minds His words as needed. He will speak through them. , (See
John 14:26.)
    7. What normal relationships would be destroyed in these days of
trial? Verse 21.
    8. What would be the attitude of the majority of men toward
Christ's followers? Verse 22, first part.
    9. What would be the reward of those who endured? Verse 22, last
part.
    NOTE.—The martyrs—those who have witnessed for Jesus—have not
all been burned at the stake, nor have they all died in dungeons. Some
are in homes suffering for the truth's sake. As a result of obeying God
and walking in the light, wives have borne persecution from husbands
and husbands from wives and parents from children. To stand true to
God under such circumstances takes a martyr's spirit and a heart made
strong by the love of God. Those who as good soldiers endure to the end
will be saved.

              Supposed Fate of the Disciples and Apostles
     "Matthew was martyred in a city of Ethiopia.
     "Mark was dragged through the streets of Alexandria in Egypt
till he expired.
     "Luke was hanged upon an olive tree in Greece.
     "John was bound and cast into a caldron of boiling oil in Rome
without injury, and it is said that he died a natural death at Ephesus
in Asia.
     "Peter was crucified in Rome, with his head down, regarding him-
self as unworthy to be crucified as his Lord.
     "James the Great was beheaded in Jerusalem.
     "James the Less was beaten to death with a fuller's club.
     "Philip was hanged against a pillar at Hierapolis in Phrygia.
     "Thomas was slain with a lance at Coromandel, East India.
     "Bartholomew was flayed alive.
     "Jude was shot to death with arrows.
     "Simon Zelotes was crucified in Persia.
     "Andrew was crucified, says tradition, at Patrm in Achaia.
     "Matthias was beheaded.
     "Barnabas was stoned to death by Jews at Salamis.
     "Paul was beheaded at Rome in the reign of Nero.
      "Such was their fate, according to legends and traditions that have
 been handed down through the centuries."—Christian Herald.
      10. What were the disciples to do when persecuted in one city?
 Verse 23.
      11. What is the relationship of individuals to those in authority?
 Verse 24.
      12. With what position should every disciple be content? Of what
 treatment accorded the Master may we expect to partake? Verse 25.
      13. For what reason should we not fear the attitude and treatment
 accorded by Christ's enemies? Verse 26.
      14. How were the disciples to proclaim that truth committed to
 them by the Master? Verse 27.
      NOTE.—In Eastern countries, the housetops are usually flat. When
 a death occurs in a dwelling, the mourners, mostly hired for that pur-
 pose, go to the housetops, where they attract attention by their loud
 wailing and lamentation. From the housetops, decrees and proclama-
 tions of civil authorities are made. These proclamations are generally
 made in the evening, when the streets are full after the people have
 returned from their labors in the field. The public crier ascends to the
 highest roof, and lifts up his voice in a long-drawn call upon all faith-
 ful subjects to give ear and obey. He then proceeds to announce the -
 will of their master and demands obedience. The call to divine wor-
 ship is often made from the housetop in the absence of a tower or bell.
  Jesus taught His disciples that they were to go to the multitudes, and
  there proclaim the truth with courage and power.
      15. Whom were they not to fear? Of whom, rather, should they be
  afraid? Verse 28.
       NOTE.—"The servant is not above his master. The Prince of heaven
                                   f 25 1
was called Beelzebub, and His disciples will be misrepresented in like
manner. But whatever the danger, Christ's followers must avow their
principles. They should scorn concealment. They cannot remain un-
committed until assured of safety in confessing the truth. They are set
as watchmen, to warn men of their peril. The truth received from Christ
must be imparted to all, freely and openly. Jesus said, 'What I tell
you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear,
that preach ye upon the housetops.' Jesus Himself never purchased
peace by compromise."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 355.


                 Lesson 11—December 12, 1931

Instruction for Personal Ministry (Concluded)
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 10:29-42.
MEMORY VERSE: "Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will
    I confess also before My Father which is in heaven." Matt. 10:32.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 356-358.

                              The Lesson
    1. How does the Saviour illustrate the Father's care for His chil-
dren? Matt. 10:29-31.
    2. What promise is made to those who are faithful in confessing
Christ before the world? Verse 32.
    NoTE.—"The confession of Christ by the apostles was before the
heads of their religion,.the chief priests who had crucified Him. It was
before rulers and kings, before the philosophers of Athens, the liber-
tines of Corinth. It was the bold, unflinching avowal that the world
was saved by the cruel and disgraceful death of a Jew, one of a nation
regarded with pretty much the same contempt as they are now. They
who made this confession always made it at the risk of their lives. . . .
    "A Christian has now to profess the creative power of God among
evolutionists, and the all-ruling providence of God in the company of
unbelieving scientists. In some companies, he has to brave the ridicule
attaching to the belief in miracles. In the society of filthy-minded men,
he has to uphold the purity of Christ; and in the society of worldliugs,
lie may be called upon to uphold the rooted antagonism between the
world and Christ. These may seem very poor and mild ways of con-
fessing Christ, compared with what our forefathers in the faith had to
endure; but they all try the mettle of the Christian. If he is faithful
in confessing Christ in these comparatively little matters, he may have
good hope that God would, if called upon, give him grace to make a
bolder and more public and dangerous confession if it was laid upon
him so to do. Such is the confession of Christ; and the reward answers
to it."—M. F. Sadler.
    3. What will be the result of denying the Saviour before men?
Verse 33.
    NOTE.—There are many ways of denying our Saviour. In "The De-
sire of Ages," page 357, we are told, "Men may deny Christ by evil
                                   E 26
speaking, by foolish talking, by words that are untruthful or unkind.
They may deny Him by shunning life's burdens, by the pursuit of sinful
pleasure. They may deny Him by conforming to the world, by uncour-
teous behavior, by the love of their own opinions, by justifying self,
by cherishing doubt, borrowing trouble, and dwelling in darkness. In
all these ways they declare that Christ is not in them."
   4. What startling statement does Jesus make concerning His mis-
sion among men? Verse 34.
    NOTE.—The prophet names Jesus "the Prince of Peace." Isa. 9:6.
At His birth, an angelic host sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace, good will toward men." Luke 2:13, 14. How, then, are
we to account for these words in verses 34, 351 The spirit of 'Christ is
not at war with men, but with principles. Light and darkness will not
blend. Oil and water will not mix. Jesus came to deliver man from
the bondage of sin. To those who receive Him, He brings peace. In
the hearts of those who reject Him there is war. While Christ came
to give peace to all, His coming challenges the powers of darkness in
the hearts of men. Thus it is said that the gospel divides' families, and
rends asunder the strongest ties of nature; but in reality, it is sin that
brings division when some members of a family refuse to yield to
righteousness.
   5. How are the family relations sometimes affected by the teach-
ings of Christ? Verse 35.
   6. Who are often one's bitterest foes? Verse 36.
   NOTE.—One of the strange anomalies of life is that those nearest
and dearest because of ties of blood often turn to bitterest enmity
when one chooses the path of self-denial and unquestioned loyalty to
Christ. Throughout the history of the Christian church loyalty to the
Mast& has meant to thousands scorn, ridicule, 'and open opposition
with bitter persecution from those nearest of kin to them.
    7. How definitely and completely must our love for Christ be mani-
fest? Verse 37.
    8. What must each individual do to be worthy of a part with Christ?
Verse 38.
    NoTE.—Christ bore the burden of the cross with its climax on Mount
Calvary from the time His earthly ministry began. Scorned by His own
townsmen who would have slain 'Him, tempted that they might find
cause for condemnation by the religious leaders, betrayed by one of
His own disciples, deserted at His betrayal and trial by all who pro-
fessed to love Him, He was Called upon to carry His heavy cross through-
out His earthly life. The Christian who professes to love Him, but is
unwilling to bear the crosses, sufferings, and burdens of life with Him
"is not worthy" of Him. "If 'we suffer, we shall also reign with Him."
2 Tim. 2:12. Only such are worthy.
    9. What vital principle of living does Christ enunciate? Verse 39.
    NOTE.—Again we meet an apparent contradiction of terms. Find
and you lose : lose and you find. The text is fully explained in the words
of the Saviour in Matthew 16:25, "Whosoever will save his life [seek
his own safety and ease] shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life
                                  [ 27 ]
for My sake [unselfishly give his life in Christ's service] shall find it."
 The Master speaks of the eternal rewards in which "the gift of God is
'eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Rom. 6:23.
    10. In our service for Christ, how closely are we related to Him and
to His Father? Verse 40.
• 11. 'What will be the result of receiving a prophet? Verse 41, first
part.
    12. What will be the reward of receiving a righteous man? Verse
41, last part.
    13. What simple illustration of true service is given to make clear
the. rewards of well-doing? Verse 42.
    14. What further does the Saviour teach concerning the service. -
rendered to the least of His children? Mark 9:41, 42.
    Nina—The doing•of the smallest, simplest act of kindness is not
without its reward. Not alone is it recorded in heaven's records, but in
this world it reacts upon the life of the doer. "It is twice blest; it
blesseth him that gives and him that takes." It is thrice blest in that
in doing in behalf of others we are serving the Master, in receiving
them into our hearts and helping them we are receiving Him, and to
receive Him is to partake of the eternal verities. Even the cup of cold
water given, costing naught but the effort and the expression of our
love and concern for another in need, has both its present and its future
reward.

LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 437-442.

                               The Lesson
    1. With what question did the disciples come to Jesus while they
were ministering in Galilee? Matt. 18:1.
    NOTE.—Although Christ's life had been one long lesson on humility
and unselfishness, and He had told the disciples that He must still
further humble Himself—even to death (Matt. 17:22, 23) ; yet His
followers had not learned the lesson of humility. They were proud and
selfish. Their hearts were filled with the same selfish desires for the
best place that had caused Satan's fall from heaven—the same desires
that were the foundation stones of Satan's kingdom of unrighteousuess
Self appeared so large in their eyes That they could see nothing else.
    2. Whom did Jesus call to Him and set in their midst before an-
swering? Verse 2.
    3. What statement did He then make concerning entering the king-
dom of heaven? Verse 3.
                                    [ 28 ]
    NomE.—The disciples had not yet come to realize the true spirit of
service and life as exemplified by the Master. They had not recognized
its need for self-sacrifice, for self-effacement, and for a complete re-
versal of the ways of the world. To bring home to theif hearts this
need, the Saviour called a little child, symbol of simple faith, loyalty,
and willing obedience, and set it in their midst, saying "Except ye turn
[beconverted], and become as little children, ye shall in nowise enter
into the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 18:3, Revised Version.,
  4. Who did Jesus state would be the greatest in His kingdom?
Verse 4. '
  5. In receiving and treating kindly one who believes in Christ,
whom are we receiving? Verse 5.
   6. What is said of one who harms the least of God's children?
Verse 6.
   NoTE.—In the Revised Version the text reads, "Whoso shall cause
one of these little ones that believe on Me to stumble." That is, whoso
shall do anything to discourage one who has started to follow Jesus,
and shall cause Him to fall into sin and be lost, "it were better for
him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,- and that he were
drowned in the depth of the sea."
    7. What of necessity will exist in this world of sin? What is said
of him through whom offense comes? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling for
it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through
whom the occasion cometh!" Matt. 18:7, Revised Version.
    8. What counsel is given concerning a member of the body which
causes one to stumble? Verses 8, 9.
     NOTE.—A habit or practice of our lives which leads us to transgres-
sion of God's law, and to discouragement in Christian living, should be
cut off at whatever cost to ourselves. As the surgeon operates to remove
a diseased member and save life, so we should cut off every wrong prac-
tice which may separate us from God, and bring about spiritual death.
     "Any habit or practice that would lead• into sin, and bring dishonor
upon Christ, would better be put away, whatever the sacrifice. . . . 14
the foot or the hand would be cut off, or •even the eye would be plucked
out, to save the body from death, how much more earnest should we be
to put away sin, that brings death to the soul."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 439.
     9. What further caution is given concerning the treatment of God's
little ones? What reason is given? Verse 10.
   10. For what purpose did the Son of God come into the world?
Verse 11.
   11. What illustration of the Father's loving care does the Saviour
give? Verses 12, 13.
    12. What is said to be the will of our heavenly Father? Verse 14.
    13. What is the right procedure to take toward an offending brother?
 Verse 15.
                                  [ 29 ]
   14. If he refuses to listen to us, what further steps should we take •
toward reconciliation? Verses 16, 17.
   NOTE.—"While we seek to correct the errors of a brother, the Spirit
Of Christ will lead us to shield him, as far as possible, from the criti-
cism of even his own brethren, and how much more from the censure of
the unbelieving world. We ourselves are erring, and need Christ's pity
and forgiveness, and just as we wish Him to deal with us, He bids us
deal with one another."—Id., p. 441.
    15. What authority is bestowed upon the church of God on earth?
Verse 18.
    NOTE.—Of the authority thus vested in the church of Christ, we are
told in "The Desire of Ages," page 442, "You are acting as the ambas-
sadors of heaven, and the issues of your work are for eternity. But
we are not to bear this great responsibility alone. Wherever His word
is obeyed with a sincere heart, there Christ abides. Not only is He pres-
ent in the assemblies of the church, but wherever disciples, however
few, meet in His name, there also He will be." It is the obedient church,
loyal to Christ, with whom He cooperates and of whose decisions He
approves. With them He is present on every occasion.
   16. Of what may we be assured if we are agreed concerning our re-
quests from God? Verse 19.
    17. Whose presence is promised in the assemblies of God's people?
Verse 20.
    18. What question concerning forgiveness was asked by Peter?
Verse 21.
    19. What answer did the Saviour give to his question? Verse 22.
    NOTE.—"We are not forgiven because we forgive, but as we forgive.
The ground of all forgiveness is found in the unmerited love of God;
but by our attitude toward others we show whether we have made that
love our own. Wherefore Christ says, 'With what judgment ye judge,
ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
to you again.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 251.


                Lesson 1 3 —December 26, 1931

                   True Sabbath Keeping
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 12:1-21.
MEMORY VERSE: "He said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and
    not man for the Sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the
    Sabbath." Mark 2:27, 28.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 281-289.

                            The Lesson
   1. As Jesus and His disciples walked through the fields one Sab-
bath day, what did the disciples do? Matt. 12:1.
   2. What complaint did the Pharisees make to Jesus concerning the
disciples' act? Verse 2.
                              1301
   NOTE.—The Pharisees did not accuse the disciples of taking that
which did not belong to them, for they knew that the Scriptures gave
permission to take enough to satisfy present hunger. Deut. 23:25. It
was because they took it on the Sabbath day that they found fault.
Before this (Matthew 5) Jesus had reproved the Jews because they
had interpreted some of the commandments too loosely, and He taught
them that it was sin to disobey them even in their thoughts. Now
Jesus finds them going to the other extreme concerning the fourth
commandment, interpreting it so strictly that it had become loaded
down with man-made restrictions and burdensome ceremonies. They
claimed that the gathering of the grain was a kind of reaping, and the
rubbing of it in their hands was threshing; therefore the disciples were
doubly guilty of Sabbath breaking.
   3. 'Whose example did Jesus first cite in justification of what His
disciples had done? Verses 3, 4.
    NOTE.—"The object of God's work in this world is the redemption
of man; therefore that which is necessary to be done on the Sabbath
in the accomplishment of this work, is in accord with the Sabbath law.
Jesus then crowned His argument by declaring Himself the 'Lord of
the Sabbath,'—One above all question and above all law. This infinite
Judge acquits the disciples of blame, appealing to the very statutes
they are accused of violating."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 285.
   4. What work done by the priests was also referred to for their
justification? Verse 5.
   5. Whom did He say was present with them? Verse 6.
   Nora—Standing in their midst was One greater than the temple,
the One who had created. all things, who was Lord of all. John 1:3 ;
Gen. 2:2, 3. The law which He had instituted was that law which they
accused His disciples of violating. He, its Giver, was its best inter-
preter both in life and in precept.
   6. What statement did Christ make, quoting from the prophets?
Verse 7.
    NOTE.—Their many heartless rites and ceremonies, their condem-
nations of men for the transgression of the restrictions with which
they had bound about God's law, caused this rebuke of the Pharisees
and scribes by the Saviour. Had they known God's mercy, His long-
suffering, His love, they would not have bound about His law with
needless restrictions, nor condemned those who were in His sight guilt-
less.
  7. What does He say is His relation to the Sabbath day? Verse 8;
Mark 2:27, 28.
    NOTE.—As One with the Father, Christ was the giver of the law.
He could say concerning the Sabbath, "The Son of man is Lord also of
the Sabbath." Mark 2:28. By their traditions the Jewish leaders had
hedged about the keeping of the Sabbath with so many petty restric-
tions, many of which were contrary to the true spirit of Sabbath keep-
ing, that they had made its observance a burden rather than the bless-
ing which God had intended the Sabbath should be. Christ takes His
                                 [ 31 ]
 rightful place as its author and Lord, and teaches its rightful and
 joyful observance.
    8. Where did Christ then go? Whom did He find there? Matt. 12:
9, 10, first part.
    9. What question was asked of Him by the bystanders? Verse 10,
last part.
    10. By what apt illustration did He reply to their question? Verses
11, 12, first part.
    11. With what brief statement of truth did Christ settle the ques-
tion? Verse 12, last part.
    NOTE.—The Master well knew the selfishness of the human heart,
and its immediate reaction, when in danger of losing temporal bene-
fits. He uses this natural impulse of humanity to help the animal crea-
tion in need, even on the Sabbath day, to press home the principle
which He clearly and forcefully states in verse 12, "It is lawful to do
well on the Sabbath days."
    12. What command did He give to the man with the withered hand?
On complying, what results followed? Verse 13.          •
    13. What course did the Pharisees follow when Christ thus broke
their tradition? Verse 14.
    NOTE.—Christ, in violating their traditions by healing on the Sab-
bath, incurred the bitter enmity of the Pharisees. Their traditions,
binding about in every little detail of life the observance of the law,
were dearer to them than the sacred principles of the law itself. Christ's
broader, richer interpretation of the law angered them, and as is often
true, they sought to find means, of getting rid of Him at any cost. To
such lengths will the wounded pride and thwarted ambitions of men
lead them. Christ, knowing their intentions as well as though they had
published them, followed the counsel He had given to His disciples,
"When they ,persecute you in this city, flee ye into another." Matt.
10:23.
    14. Where did Christ go? What work did He continue? Verse 15.
    15. What charge did He give those whom He had healed? What
season is given for making this request? Verses 16, 17.
    16. In quietly teaching and continuing His work of healing, what
prophecy concerning Himself was Jesus fulfilling? Verses 18-21. (See
Isa. 42:1-3.)

   "The knowledge of God is obtained from His word. The experi-
mental knowledge of true godliness, found in daily consecration and
service, insures the highest culture of body, mind, and soul."—Testi-
monies, vol. 8, p. 63.
    "Christ calls upon His people to believe and practice His word.
Those who receive and assimilate this word, making it a part of every
action, of everytattribute of character, will grow strong in the strength
of God."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 300.
