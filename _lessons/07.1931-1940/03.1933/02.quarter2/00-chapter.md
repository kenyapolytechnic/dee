    1931 and half of 1932 had no overflows of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering. Sabbath
school offerings of all kinds fell off 21 per cent during the same period, one and one-
half years. This shortage of mission funds vitally affects the maintenance of the work.
  - To make the income of the Mission Board go as far as possible in continuing the
work already begun, it was voted at the 1932 Autumn Council that until conditions be-
came better, all of the overflow as well as the offering to meet the goal on the thirteenth
Sabbath, should go to maintain the work already established in the field designated.
This quarter the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering and overflow will go to hold the ropes
in India and Burma. Let us indicate our interest and real concern for the souls in these
non-Christian lands by most liberal and self-sacrificing giving.

                        The Bible—Its Origin
   MEMORY VERSE: "For this_cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word
of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
believe." 1 Thess. 2 :13.
                                   THE BIBLE
                        Hast thou ever heard
                 Of such a book? The Author, God Himself;
                 The subject, God and man, salvation, life
                 And death. . . .
                 Most wondrous Book ! bright candle of the Lord !
                 Star of eternity ! the only star
                 By which the bark of man could navigate
                 The sea of life, and gain the coast of bliss
                 Securely! only star which rose on time,
                 And on its dark and troubled billows,
                                   . . threw a ray
                 Of heaven's own light, and to the hills of God,
                 The eternal hills, pointed the sinner's eye.
                 By prophets, seers, and priests, and sacred bards,
                 Evangelists, apostles, men inspired,
                 And by the Holy Ghost anointed, . . .
                 This Book, this holiest, this sublimest Book
                 Was sent.                           --Robert Pollok.

    NOTE.—"Every chapter and every verse of the Bible is a communication
from God to men."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 504.
    5. Over what space of time were the writings which compose the Bible
spread?
    NOTE.—The Old Testament covered in its writings about one thousand
years, Moses beginning the work, and Malachi closing the Old Testament
canon about 420 B. c. The New Testament was begun probably about A. D. 56,
and was closed about A. D. 97. In present usage the word "canon" signifies the
collection of books making our Bible.
    "During the first twenty-five hundred years of human history, there was
no written revelation. Those who had been taught of God, communicated
their knowledge to others, and it was handed down from father to son, through
successive generations. The preparation of the written word began in the time
of Moses. Inspired revelations were then embodied in an inspired book. This
work continued during the long period of sixteen hundred years,—from Moses,
the historian of creation and the law, to John, the recorder of the most sublime
truths of the gospel."—"The Great Controversy," Introduction, p. V.
    6. Upon one occasion when Jesus referred to the Scripture-s, how much
of the Old Testament was included? John 5:39.
    NOTE.—The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament are the books in-
cluded in the Hebrew Scriptures. Josephus, an eminent Jewish historian, con-
temporary with the apostles, in writing of the Hebrew Bible which had the
same books as our Bible, said: "During so many ages as have already passed,
no one has been so bold as either to add anything to them, to take anything
from them, or to make any change in them." While Josephus speaks of there
being only twenty-two books in the Hebrew Bible, this is because all of the
minor prophets are counted as one book, also First and Second Kings, First
and Second Samuel, and First and Second Chronicles as one each, and Ezra
and Nehemiah as one book together; thus making the number correspond with
the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet.
    7. 'What is the first writing, so far as we have record, which the Lord
commanded to be made and preserved for future generations? Ex. 17:14.
    8. What record is given of other writings of Moses? Ex. 34:27; Deut:
31:9, 24.                                                        •
    NOTE.—It is evident that Moses was the first Bible writer, for there is no
record of any inspired writings, nor any reference to such writings, nor any
known remains of them, prior to his time. Some scholars once maintained that
Moses could not have written the books accredited to him, for writing, they
claimed, was unknown in his day; yet there are now in our museums many
examples of uninspired writings, produced centuries before Moses' time, and
even before the time of Abraham, who lived centuries before Moses.
    9. What books of the Bible are accredited to Moses? Answer.—The Pen-
tateuch, or first five books.
    Nom—In John 5:46 and Acts 3:22, Moses is distinctly referred to as hay-,
ing written the prophecy in Deuteronomy 18:15-18. In Mark 12:26, Jesus
calls Exodus "the book of Moses;" and Paul in Romans 9:15, refers to Moses
as having written what God said to him at Horeb. Ex. 33:19.
    Some critics assert that the first five books of the Bible were produced
much later than the time of Moses, Deuteronomy making its appearance about
623 B. c. in the days of Josiah, king of Israel; and that the Pentateuch as we
                                       [41
now have it was not completed until the time of Ezra, about 444 B. c. But the
Pentateuch was the foundation upon which all later writers built. Each one
of the sixteen major and minor prophets, most of whom lived centuries before
Josiah and Ezra, refer in some way to the books of the Pentateuch, some of
them making a number of references, direct or implied, to the contents of these
books. Isaiah is credited with making more than five hundred such references;
Ezekiel and Jeremiah each with over three hundred. The historical books of
Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and Samuel also show an intimate acquaintance with
the entire Pentateuch; while the Psalms have scores of direct quotations
from it, and a multitude of allusions and references to it. Israel's experience
as portrayed in Psalms 78, 105, 106, is a reiteration of the recital given in the
Pentateuch. If these books were not written for hundreds of years after the
time of David, who lived a thousand years before Christ, whence did David
get his knowledge? A concrete illustration of the fallacy, of the critic's view
may be pertinent in this connection. In 2 Kings 14:6 we are told that Amaziah
refrained from slaying the children of the murderers of his father because it
was "written in the book of the law of Moses" (Deut. 24:16) that the children
should not be put to death for the sins of their fathers. If Deuteronomy was
not written until the time of Josiah, who lived nearly two hundred years later,
how could Amaziah be restrained by its mandate? Despite the, critics, we are
sure that ere Moses slept on Pisgah's lonely mount, he penned by inspiration
these living oracles for the people of God. Deut. 31:24-26.
    10. From whom did Moses receive the subject matter for the Penta-
teuch? On what occasion did he receive much of the instruction found in
his writings? Ex. 24:4; 25:40; Heb. 8:5.
    NomE.—To learn the authority behind the counsel and instruction of Mo-
ses, it is only necessary to observe how frequently the statement, "The Lord
spake unto Moses," or some similar expression, is found in the Pentateuch.
Many chapters of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers begin with the statement,
and not infrequently end with the same. No less than seven hundred such af-
firmations are in the writings of Moses.
    The instruction concerning the building of the tabernacle was received
from the Lord during the forty days and nights spent on the mount (Ex. 24:
18; 25:9). "As the years rolled on, and he [Moses] wandered with his flocks
in solitary places, pondering upon the oppressed condition of his people, he
recounted the dealings .of God with his fathers, and the promises that were the
heritage of the chosen nation, and his,prayers for Israel ascended by day and
by night. Heavenly angels -shed their light around him. Here, under the in-
spiration of the Holy Spirit, he wrote the book of Genesis. The long years
spent amid the desert solitudes were rich in blessing, not alone to Moses and
his people, but to the World in all succeeding ages."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," .p. 251.
    11. What instruction was given Joshua concerning the book of the
law, or the Pentateuch? Joshua 1:7, 8.
    NOTE.—The Hebrew nation has always received these treatises as the books
of Moses, and they were read to the assembled tribes at stated times.. The
apostle James said, "Moses of old time bath in every city them that preach
him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day." Acts 15:21.
   12. Who are cited as some of the New Testament writers? John 21:20,
24; 1 Cor. 1:1, 2; Luke 1:1-4; Acts 1:1.
                                      {5]
    NOTE.—The New Testament is the product of the companions and apostles
of Jesus. Paul is accredited with writing fourteen of the books of the New
Testament, John with five, Peter with two, Luke with two, James and Jude
with one each, and Matthew and Mark each with one of the Gospels, making
twenty-seven books. While we do not have the original writings of these men
of God, we know that the New Testament existed in the early part of the
second century. The apostle John died near the beginning of the second cen-
tury, and according to Eusebius, the first church historian, John helped to
arrange the New Testament canon.

                 The Bible—An Inspired Book
    MEMORY VERSE: "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man
of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

                                  INTRODUCTION
    The Bible is a unique book. No other book approaches it in character. As
cloth is sometimes so woven- that a gray silk may appear on one side and a
blue on the other, so the Old Testament is a double book, historical in its main
character, but underneath the historical narrative and intermingled with it is
the prophetic. From the third chapter of Genesis the two are intermingled.
The interpretations of Jesus and His apostles disclose many of these prophe-
cies hidden in "the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms."
Only the Omniscient One could prepare such a book. The Bible is therefore
inspired, God-breathed. "It is the transcript of the divine mind, the unfold-
ing of the divine purpose, the revelation of the divine will."—H. L. Hastings.
    The Bible was the first book of any note in all the world's literature to be
translated into another language, and the first book to come from a printing
press. It is acknowledged as the chief of books,—a testimony to the high regard
in which it is held.
                                THE LESSON
    1. From whom do writers of. the Old Testament say their messages
came? 'Num. 33:2; Isa. 1:2.
    NoTE.—More than one thousand times do the writers of the first sixteen
books of the Old Testament give the Lord as the authority for what they
wrote. David said, "The Rock of Israel spake to me" (2 Sam. 23:3) ; and it is
recorded that after the death of Moses "the Lord spake unto Joshua" (Joshua
1:1). Amos said, "Hear this word that the Lord hath spoken" (Amos 3:1).
The prophets, as the name implies, speak supernaturally, and in their writings,
                                           6
more than thirteen hundred times they give credit to the Lord for what they
wrote.
    2. What does the New Testament say concerning the inspiration of the
Old Testament? 2 Peter 1:19-21; Luke 1:70.
    NomE.—Inspiration does not leave a man to speak his own words. Balaam
realized this in his futile attempt to curse Israel; for he said, "Have I now any
power at all to say anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that
shall I speak." Num. 22:38. The Lord said to Ezekiel (Eze. 2:7), "Thou shalt
speak My words unto them;" again, "The word of the Lord came expressly
unto Ezekiel" (Eze. 1:3). This is inspiration.
    3. How much of the prophetic writings did the Saviour intimate we
should believe? Luke 24:25.
    4. What test of spirituality did Paul give the Corinthians? 1 Cor. 14:37.
    5. What confidence did the apostle Peter express concerning the epistles
of Paul? 2 Peter 3:2, 15, 16.
    6. What importance did the apostle John attach to his writings? Rev.
22:18, 19.
    NOTE.—"Every principle in the word of God has its place, every fact its
bearing. And the complete structure, in design and execution, bears testimony
to its Author. Such a structure no mind but that of the Infi     nite could con-
ceive or fashion."—"Education," p. 124.
    7. What authority does Paul say lies behind the gospel he preached?
Gal. 1:11, 12.
    8. Did the prophet Isaiah see fact or fiction in the story of Israel's de-
liverance at the Red Sea? Isa. 63:11-13.
    NOTE.—J. S. Griffiths, in his book "The Exodus in the Light of Archm-
ology," page 14, quotes the following pertinent observation: "No nation ever
gratuitously invented the report that it had been ignominiously enslaved by
another; none ever forgot the days of its deliverance. And so through all the
centuries there survived in Israel the inextinguishable recollection that it was
once delivered out of Egypt, the house of bondage, by Jahveh [Jehovah] the
God of its fathers, with a strong hand and outstretched arm; that specially at
the passage of the Red Sea it experienced the mighty protection of God."
There is no intimation in all of the Bible that any'writer ever regarded the
history of Israel as portrayed in the Bible other than a recital of absolute facts.
David states (Ps. 77:20) definitely that the Lord led His people "like a flock
by the hand of Moses and Aaron;" and in Psalms 105 and 106 he rehearses
what Moses and others had written of Israel's experience. Jeremiah regarded
Moses and Samuel as real persons (Jer. 15:1). Daniel refers to Moses as the
lawgiver (Dan. 9:11, 13). Nothing is more certain than that the later writers
of the Bible accepted as true all that preceding writers had penned. It is equally
certain that they accepted as literally true the historical portions of the Scrip-
tures; and that they acknowledged the authority of God- behind all that had
been written. (See Isa. 48:21 ; 43:16.)
    9. How did Peter, and evidently his coworkers, regard the Psalms?
Acts 1:16, 20.
    NOTE.—New Testament writers quote from fifty-nine different psalms.
    10. What value did Jesus attach to what Moses wrote? John 5:46, 47.
                                       [7]
    NomE.—Jesus made a number of other references to the writings of Moses;
and every New Testament writer refers to something Moses said or wrote.
    11. How did the prophet Malachi indicate his acceptance of what Moses
wrote? Mal. 4:4.
    12. How do the Scriptures evince their inspiration? 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
    Noma.—The Bible thus professes to be a guide for the faith and life of all
men; hence we should expect that every subject having to do with daily duty
would have adequate treatment; and we find that somewhere between Genesis
and Revelation every such matter is treated.
    13. What conclusion did Paul reach from his study of the Scriptures?
Eph. 4:5, 6.
    NOTE.—The singular unity of the Scriptures, "one Lord, one faith, one
baptism," accords them a divine origin. Every circumstance connected with
the preparation and production of the Bible "was calculated to prevent and
prohibit such unity. Here are sixty-six different books, written by some forty
different authors, in three different languages, and the periods of authorship
cover a score or more of centuries. These human writers were brought up in
different countries, and were so remote from each other in time and space,
that they could have had no mutual acquaintance. And could neither have
conspired for an evil end nor combined for the best purpose. The subjects on
which they wrote were very diverse and various, some historical, some prophet-
ical, some devotional, some ethical. The form of their writings was in some
cases prose and in others poetry, and yet, notwithstanding all these divergent
elements, they have produced essentially one book. Not only is the Bible as
a whole an unrivaled phenomenon, but its features are all phenomenal, and ,
none more so than this convergence of contents like rays toward one common
focal point."—"God's Living Oracles," by A. T. Pierson, pp. 16, 17.

  The Bible—Prophetic Evidences of Inspiration
   MEMORY VERSE: "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye
do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day
dawn, and the Day-star arise in your hearts." 2 Peter 1:19.

                                INTRODUCTION
   "The fulfillment of the word of prophecy in history is a fascinating story.
To the Lord, the future is an open book, even as the present. The word is
spoken, telling of the event to come; it is written on the parchment scroll by
the prophet's pen. Time passes; centuries come and go. Then, when the hour
                                        (8   ]
of the prophecy arrives lo, there appears the fulfillment. And it is seen in
matters pertaining to individuals, as well as in the affairs of cities and empires."
—"Our Day in the Light of Prophecy," W. A. Spicer, p. 26.
                              THE LESSON
   1. What did the Lord challenge the idols to do to show that they were
gods? Isa. 41:23, first part.
   2. Why could the Lord make this challenge? Isa. 46:9, 10.
    3. What evidence does the Bible frequently give of its inspiration?
Matt. 1:22; 2 1.5.
    NomE.—"Fulfilled prophecy is the testimony of the centuries to the living
God. The evidence of prophecy and its fulfillment is God's challenge and ap-
peal to men to acknowledge Him as the true God and the Holy Scriptures as
His word from heaven."—"Our Day in the Light of Prophecy," W. A. Spicer,
p. 37.
    4. At the time of the destruction of Jericho by the Israelites, what
prophecy and curse did Joshua pronounce? Joshua 6:26.
    NOTE.—Jericho was not only one of the strongest military fortresses in
Canaan, but it was the center of all that was vilest and most degrading in the
Canaanite religion. For Israel's sake, therefore, the city and its people were
to be utterly destroyed. Deut. 7:2. "Jericho was never to be rebuilt as a
stronghold; judgments were threatened upon anyone who should presume to
restore the walls."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 491, 492. The city, though
rebuilt, was to stand undefended forever as a memorial of God's power which
by angel hands had overthrown the walls. For five hundred years no man
ventured to rebuild its fortifications; but in the time of Ahab's idolatrous
reign God was so far forgotten that Hiel, the Bethelite, made bold to defy the
Lord's word and rebuild the walls of the city. And true to the prophetic word,
Hiel lost his eldest son when laying the foundation of the walls, and his young-
est son as the work neared completion. The Revised Version of 1 Kings 16:34
reads: "In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation
thereof with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof with
the loss of his youngest son Segub ; according to the word of the Lord, which
He spake by the hand of Joshua, the son of Nun." -
    5. When, after Jonah's day Nineveh had again become corrupt, what
warning message was sounded by the prophet Zephaniah? Zeph. 3:1, 2.
    6. What was to be the fate of the city? Zeph. 2:13-15.
    NOTE.—Nineveh's devastation and disintegration continued until she lay
buried beneath millions of tons of earth. Now after nearly 2500 years of ob-
livion she has been resurrected, as it were, to bear witness to the unerring
wisdom and fidelity of the word of God, which portrayed so vividly her char-
acter and ultimate destruction, a half century or more before it took place.
    7. What prediction did the Lord make against Tyre, Phoenicia's wealth-
iest and most magnificent city? Eze. 26:3-6.
    NoTE.—Tyre flourished for three thousand years, and in the time of Solo-
mon was the wonder of the world. Because of its pride and its having en-
tangled Israel and Judah in Baal and Astarte worship, the Lord determined its
destruction. The Lord was displeased with Tyre also because she rejoiced over
                                        [9)
the fall of Jerusalem, exulting in the fact that she would profit thereby com-
mercially and industrially. Eze. 26:2. Joel, Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah like-
wise prophesied of the downfall of Tyre, Isaiah's prophecy being given long
years before the invasion by Nebuchadnezzar. Isaiah recognizes Tyre's com-
mercial power by referring to her as "the merchant city." Isa. 23:8, 11. Tyre's
downfall was to be gradual; she was to be harassed by many nations (Eze.
26:3) ; the prophecy, therefore, must be regarded as a general prediction, with
allusions to different sieges.
    8. Who was used to fulfill partially this prediction against Tyre?
Verses 7-9.
    NomE.—For thirteen years Tyre baffled the proud Nebuchadnezzar and all
his engines of warfare. Eze. 29:18. The continental city finally succumbed
to his efforts, and having had her commerce practically ruined by the siege,
a period of great depression followed. It seems that the island city with its
impregnable walls washed by the sea withstood his attack. A century or so
later Alexander the Great met an equally stubborn resistance to his attack
upon the city. This so angered him that he determined to take it at all hazards.
He therefore constructed a mole or causeway two hundred feet wide connect-
ing the mainland with the island, using for this project the ruins from the
continental city. Eze. 26:4, 12. With the advantage thus gained, Alexander
was able to subjugate the city, destroying eight thousand of the citizens, and
selling 30,000 into slavery. Joel 3:8. Alexander left the city half-burned,
 ruined, and almost depopulated. Zech. 9:3, 4. Tyre never recovered from
this blow; her long day of maritime supremacy was at an end, though later
she enjoyed considerable commercial and industrial prosperity. At the present
time a miserable village straggles along a portion of the site where once stood
the richest of storehouses and the most splendid palaces. Meyer's "General
History" says that "the site of the once brilliant capital is now 'bare as the
top of a rock,' a place where the few fishermen that still frequent the spot
spread their nets to dry"—a strange contrast to the noisy whirl of business and
life that so long went on in the city. "Tyre will never rise from her dust to
falsify the voice of prophecy."
    9. What did the Lord say should come to Babylon? Jer. 51:49, 53.
    NOTE.—The text uses the plural form, "spoilers." In Jeremiah 5:10 we
read that "all that spoil her shall be satisfied," implying there would be a num-
ber of spoilers, and that on opening her storehouses (Jer. 50:26), all should
find enough riches to satisfy them. History tells us that Cyrus, Xerxes, Ale-
xander, and others found great riches there; and later when the Romans rav-
agedaldea,
        h     Gibbon the historian tells us that "though much of the treasure
had been removed, . . . the remaining wealth appears to have exceeded their
hopes, and even to have satiated their avarice."
    10. Who did the Lord say should begin the attack against Babylon?
Jer. 51:11.                            •
    11. Who was to direct the campaign against Babylon? Isa. 45:1-4.
     NOTE.—About 175 years after this prophecy was given, Cyrus and his
army were at the gates of Babylon.
    12. What help for the taking of the city was unwittingly given the be-
siegers? Verses 1, 2.
    NOTE.—Cyrus and his army entered the city, advancing through the bed
                                  1 10),
of the river and from both ends of the channel at once; hence messengM14.1
approach the palace from two directions.
    13. How complete was to be the final destruction of Babylon? Isa.
19-22.
    .NomE.—Twenty-five hundred yeais have passed since the prophet penned
the doleful record of Babylon's fate; arid to-day its ruins bear witness to the
infallibility of the word of God. Mr. LAyard, an English archmologist, de-
scribes what he found there in 1845 as follows: "Shapeless heaps of rubbish
cover for many an acre the face of the land. \. . . On all sides, fragments of
glass, marble, pottery, and inscribed brick ale mingled with that peculiar
nitrous and blanched soil, which bred from the remains of ancient habitations,
checks and destroys vegetation, and renders the site of Babylon a naked and
hideous waste. Owls (which are of a large gray kind, and often found in
flocks of nearly a hundred) start from scanty thickets,, and the foul jackal
skulks through the furrows." Of the one hundred or more details given in the
prophecies concerning the fall of Babylon, not one has failed of fulfillment.

           The Bible and the Archwologist—I
   MEMORY VERSE: "But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,
even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be in-
creased." Dan. 12:4.
                               INTRODUCTION
    "Knowledge shall be increased." When the time to which this prophecy
applied came, there was nothing, outside of the statements made in the Old
Testament, definitely known of the history or peoples of the world prior to
400 B. c., the 'date of the oldest reliable history of Greece and Rome. There
was not a single document contemporaneous with the Old Testament known
to be in existence; therefore the Old Testament had no witnesses to call to its
aid when its statements were challenged; it stood alone, telling of nations,
peoples, and events of which the world had not a trace. It was therefore
counted- by the worldly-wise as a book of myths and legends, not a book of
facts. Within the past century, however, the pick and spade of the archmolo-
gist has unearthed thousands of fragments of literature written on clay tab-
lets, cylinders, statues, and temples, contemporaneous with the Old Testament,
and many antedating its writing. This newly uncovered evidence marvelously
corroborates and elucidates questioned statements of the Old Testament.

                                 THE LESSON
        From what place was Abraham called? Gen. 11:31.
    NOTE.—The site of Ur, Abraham's early home, had long been lost; but
41853 it was located by an archaeologist who discovered in Southern Baby-
lonia in the extensive ruins of the modern Mugheir a massive tower of brick
work, many of the bricks scattered about bearing the name Ur. So late as
the spring of 1931, workmen unpacked in the cellar of the British Museum
many large cases of inscribed clay bricks which tell of ordinary happenings
in Ur four thousand years ago.(There are schoolbooks, tradesmen's accounts,
love letters, and all kinds of ,Writings. In an old schoolroom, that had been
buried millenniums, there were found two thousand inscribed tablets, largely
schoolbooks which the master had kept by him.
     2. Of what is the fourteenth chapter of Genesis a record? Gen. 14:
1-3, 12-24,
     NoTE.—Dr. Edgar J. Banks of the University of Chicago says of this chap-
ter: "To the scholar of a few years ago it was a chapter of meaningless names,
a 'record of imaginary wars between fOur traditional kings of Mesopotamia,
and five of the j ordan Valley,—wars, so the critic said, invented to add glory
to an imaginary Abraham." Dr. A. H. Sayce of Oxford University makes the
following interesting comment on the critic's position on this chapter: "In 1869
the great Semitic scholar,Professor Noldeke, published a treatise on the un-
historical character of th fourteenth chapter of Genesis. He declared that
criticism had forever disproved its claim to be historical. The political situa-
tion presupposed by it was incredible and impossible. . . . This was in 1869.
In 1903 criticism is discreetly silent about the conclusions which it then an-
nounced with so much assurance." Why? Because recent discoveries give us
knowledge of the kings who carried Lot and his family away from Sodom;
and these discoveries show that "the four kings were not mythical characters
of a mythical alliance; they were real kings who fought real wars, and the
Biblical chapter telling us of them, is real history."
     3. What special request did the Israelites make of the Egyptians just
before leaving Egypt? Ex. 12:35, 36.
     NOTE.—The Revised Version's use of the word "asked" instead of "bor-
rowed," evidently gives the better rendering. It is interesting to note that this
asking treasure of the Egyptians and their generous response was a part of
the original plan of God as revealed to Abraham hundreds of years before the
 Exodus. After speaking of the bondage and affliction, the Lord said, "And
afterward shall they come out with great substance." Gen. 15:13, 14. Doubt-
less many of the Egyptians sympathized with the Hebrews in the cruel treat-
 ment they had received at the hands of the Egyptian authorities, some of
 these being among the servants of Pharaoh who "feared the word of the
 Lord" (Ex. 9:20), and so were glad to give to the Hebrews; while others were
 willing to give of their treasures in the hope of saving themselves further suf-
 fering at the hand of the God of Israel. All these gave, however, because of
 the direct influence of the Lord; for He said, "I will give this people- favor in
 the sight of the Egyptians." Ex. 3:21.
     4. What part did the king of Lachish take in opposing Joshua? Joshua
10:3-5.      •
     NOTE.—The site of Lachish like that of Gezer was long unknown, having
 been buried completely. In fact eight cities of the name have been buried one
                                        [12 ]
upon another. Lachish is of special interest as being the place from which
Sennacherib and his army had recently removed when the angel of the Lord
destroyed the army. Isa. 37:8, 33-36. The excavators of Lachish found in a
governor's house a clay tablet covered with the wedge-shaped writing of
Babylonia. It was the first tablet of the kind found in Palestine.
    5. When Joshua and the Israelites were conquering Canaan, who re-
sisted the effort to subdue the land? Joshua 10:33.
    NOTE.—The site of Gezer was lost until 1902, when excavations were be-
gun among the ruins of what proved to be Gezer. Several cities, one beneath
another, were uncovered. Excavations revealed large standing stones varying
in height from five to ten feet, forming a "high place" in which religious
rites of the Canaanites were practiced. Near the standing stones and beneath
the floor of the temple were found the' bones of human skeletons, especially
of newborn infants, all witnessing to the fact that human sacrifices formed a
large part of the religious ceremony carried on in these high places. This fact
doubtless furnishes the chief reason why the Hebrew prophets of every age
demanded the destruction of the high places, and why the Lord Himself,
through Moses, gave the instruction found in Deuteronomy 12:2.
     6. Whose land specifically did the Lord promise Israel? Joshua 1:4.
     NOTE.—"It was scarcely a generation ago," says Edgar J. Banks, author
of "The Bible and the Spade," "that many scholars claimed that the Hittites
were but a mythical race of people, yet the Bible frequently speaks of them.
. . . [See Gen. 23:8-16; 26:34; 2 Samuel 11.1 In spite of these•and a score
of other references to the Hittites, the scholars continued to assert that if
such people ever existed, they were merely a small tribe of Palestine occupy-
ing but a village or two."—Page 97.
     When the Egyptian hieroglyphs on the temple at Karnak were deciphered,
and the palaces of the Assyrian kings excavated,' and the inscriptions on the
clay tablets found therein were read, and various other important finds were
made, much was learned of this long-lost people. We now know that the
Hittites once had large fortified cities; that at one time they ruled a greater
part of Asia Minor, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River; and
that their power was scarcely inferior to' that of Assyria or of Egypt; and it
was only when their capital city fell before the arms of Sargon (Isa. 20:1) in
717 B. c. that their power waned. These discoveries of the archwologist are a
strong testimony showing the futility of accepting the verdict of even the
wisest of scholars against the statement of the Bible.
     7. What incident does the prophet Isaiah record that was long ques-
tioned by scholars? Isa. 20 : 1.
     NOTE.—As this is the only mention of Sargon in the Scriptures, or in all
literature, it was easy for Biblical critics to pronounce this record a creation of
the prophet's imagination, and totally untrue. The first important discovery
made by the archxologist was to unearth in 1843 the palace of the conqueror
of Ashdod, Sargon II, king of Assyria, and father of Sennacherib. Sargon's
palace covered an area of more than twenty-five acres; and its-walls were-
wainscoted with alabaster slabs upon which were sculptured battle and hunt-
ing scenes, triumphal processions, and like events.
    "Worldly wisdom is foolishness with God. Those who rely upon it, will
surely err."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 354.
     8. Why did Samaria have such a mixed population? 2 Kings 17:24.
                                        [13 }
    NOTE.—While Shalmaneser began the siege of Samaria, it seems that Sar-
gon II claims to have consummated the taking of the city in the first year of
his reign, 722 B. c. One inscription found on Sargon's palace tells the story
of Samaria's fall and repopulation as follows: "I besieged and captured the
city of Samaria, and I carried away 27,280 of its inhabitants as captives. I
took fifty of their chariots. I restored the city, and causing the inhabitants to
be more in number than before, I stationed my lieutenants over them. I made
the people of the lands which I had conquered, to dwell there, and I collected
from them the same amount of tribute as from the Assyrians."—"The Bible
and the Spade," p. 128.

           The Bible and the Archxologist—II
    MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty
in strength and wisdom." Job 36:5.
                           • INTRODUCTION
    Dr. Robert D. Wilson; professor of Semitic Philology in Princeton Theologi-
cal Seminary, who has spent a lifetime in study fitting him to speak authori-
tatively on this subject, says: "I have come now to the conviction that no
man knows enough to assail the truthfulness of the Old Testament. Whenever
there is sufficient documentary evidence to make an investigation, the state-
ments of the Bible in the original texts have stood the test."—"Is the Higher
Criticism Scholarly?" p. 10.
                               THE LESSON
    1. What relation existed at one time between Israel and the king of
Moab? 2 Kings 3:4, 5.
    NOTE.—In a little village about a day's journey eastward from the Dead
Sea, there was found in 1868 what is known as the Moabite stone, a stone
inscribed by King Mesha himself. It tells of Moab's oppression by Omri, king
of Israel, and by his son, who was none other than Ahab. This stone is now
in the museum of the Louvre, Paris, and is regarded as very precious, as its
writing differs very little from the early Hebrew. It was engraved about
850 B. c.
    2. What was prophesied concerning Nineveh? How has the spade of
the excavator made clearer this prophecy? Nahum 3:7-10.
    NOTE.—Nahum was prophesying the overthrow of Nineveh, and to por-
tray the severity of the punishment to be inflicted, he referred to the destruc-
                                    t 14
 tion of "populous No"; but this text puzzled Bible readers as no such city as
 No was known to history. Not until the royal records of Ashur-bani-pal, the
 last great king of Assyria, were discovered in the unearthing near Nineveh of
 his extraordinary palace, with its remarkable library of thousands of clay
 tablets, was it learned that No or No-Amon or Ni was the Semitic name_ for
 Thebes, the capital of Egypt. The tablet disclosing this information is Ashur-
 bani-pal's own record. It says: "In my second expedition I directed the march
 to Egypt and Ethiopia. Urdamani heard of the approach of my army, and
 when I entered the borders of Egypt, he abandoned Memphis and fled to Ni
 (Thebes) to save his life. . . . I pursued Urdamani, and came to Thebes his
 fortress. He saw the approach of my mighty army; he abandoned Thebes and
 fled. My hands captured the entire city. . . . Plunder beyond count I took
 with me from Thebes."—"The Bible and the Spade," pp. 153, 154.
     Nahum gave this prophecy only a year or two after the awful destruction
 of No; so the event was still fresh in the minds of the people; and though he
 prophesied the disaster coming to Nineveh a half century or more before it
 came, in 606 B. c., the city fell to rise no more.
     3. When Sennacherib was on his campaign to resubdue the cities of
 Palestine, what word did Hezekiah, king of Judah, send to him? What
tribute did the Assyrian king demand of Hezekiah? 2 Kings 18:13, 14.
     NOTE.—In Sennacherib's own account of this incident the amount of the
 tribute exacted of Hezekiah is stated to be eight hundred talents of silver in-
stead of three hundred, as the Bible states. Once it was thought there was no
way of harmonizing the two statements; but it is now known that while the
standard for circulating talents of gold was the same in Judah and. Assyria,
it was different for silver, requiring exactly eight hundred Assyrian talents to
make three hundred Hebrew talents.
                                                                •
     4. What tragic end came to Sennacherib, king of Assyria? Who then
took the throne? 2 Kings 19:36, 37.
     Nom—An Assyrian record has been found which says: "On the twen-
tieth day of the month Tebet, Sinacherib, king of Assyria, was killed by his
son in a revolt. For twenty-three years Sinacherib ruled Assyria. From the
twentieth day of Tebet to the second day of Adar the rebellion in Assyria
continued. On the Eighteenth day of Sivan, Esarhaddon, his son, ascended the
throne." Now 2,600 years after the death of Sennacherib, we can read his
will from a clay tablet in the British Museum. On this tablet Sennacherib be-
queaths his possessions to his son Esarhaddon, which indicates that the father
was cognizant of the disloyalty of his younger sons, who later assassinated him.
     5. What further trouble did Judah have with Assyria? 2 Chron. 33:
10-13.
     NoTE.—It was about 648 B. c. that Esarhaddon's son Ashur-bani-pal, an-
nounced himself king of Babylon, seized Manasseh, and carried him captive to
that city. Esarhaddon was accounted the greatest of all Assyrian monarchs;
and the unearthing of his palace with its sculptured slabs and collection of
engraved tablets, a veritable library of a hundred thousand volumes, makes
him one of the best-known characters of all ancient history. Ashur-bani-pal
is supposed to be "the great and noble Asnapper" of Ezra 4:10.
     6. During the reign of Rehoboam, what did the king of Egypt take
from Jerusalem? 1 Kings 14:25, 26.
                                         { 15l
   NOTE.—Shishak, king of Egypt, caused to be engraved on the walls of the
court of the temple at Karnak, sculptures portraying himself as striking down
Syrian captives with an immense club: Upon the shields at his side are re-
corded the names of 156 cities or districts of Judah and Israel which he cap-
tured.
    7. What is the brief Biblical record concerning the fall of Babylon
during the reign of Belshazzar? How does archology corroborate this?
Dan. 5:30.
    NOTE.—Time and the spade completely corroborate the Bible; for there
was discovered in Ur of the Chaldees some terra cotta cylinders containing
an inscription by Nabonidus in which he mentions his son Belshazzar. Then
there was unearthed in Babylon a tablet containing a official account by Cyrus
of the taking of Babylon in which he says that Nabonidus fled from the city,
but was taken prisoner. An account of the taking of Babylon by Nabonidus
himself has been discovered, which is proof that he was not the king that was
slain on the night that Cyrus entered the city. Cyrus in his account of the
taking of the city, after speaking of the capture of Nabonidus, as a prisoner,
adds that on a certain "night . . . the king died," which must have been
Belshazzar. It is evident from these inscriptions that Belshazzar was acting
as regent for his father, Nabonidus, both reigning at the same time. Evidently
this is why Daniel was made third ruler (Dan. 5:7, last part) in the kingdom
instead of second ruler, as Pharaoh made Joseph.
    8. What incident is related in 2 Kings 15:29, 30? How has this been
corroborated by the spade?
    NOTE.—"Among the inscriptions found by Layard in the palace of Tiglath-
pileser is one containing the record of the invasion of Palestine. It is some-
what mutilated, yet the lines which are preserved say that the Assyrian king
captured Gilead, made it Assyrian territory, and placed it in charge of his
officers; that Hanno, king of Gaza, fled to Egypt; that Samaria was captured,
and then, to use Tiglath-pileser's own words: 'I deported to Assyria all the
inhabitants, together with their property. Pekah, their king, I' slew, and I
appointed Hoshea to rule over them. Ten talents of gold and a thousand tal-
ents of silver I received from him.' Thus do the royal records of Assyria sup-
plement and confirm the historical portions of the Old Testament."—"The
Bible and the Spade," pp. 123, 124.
     9. What work did Hezekiah perform for Jerusalem that is mentioned
in Kings, Chronicles, and Isaiah? 2 Kings 20:20.
     NOTE.—In 1880 a truant schoolboy bathing in the pool of Siloam, observed
a stone in the wall of the pool with some marks on it. He reported this to his
teacher in the hope that it might divert the master's attention from his tru-
ancy. The master, Dr. Schick, lost no time in locating the stone, which is
reckoned by archxologists the most valuable find in the ruins of Palestine, as
it is the oldest known writing in the pure Hebrew of the Bible. Scholars agree
that this is the original stone placed there by Hezekiah to commemorate his
work of cutting an aqueduct through the solid rock -for 1700 feet, connecting
the Virgin's pool with the pool of Siloam. The inscription on the stone tells
how the excavators worked from both ends simultaneously toward the center,
and that while there were three cubits more to excavate, the excavators talked
together through the solid rock.

                    Peter and the Scriptures
   MEMORY VERSE: "But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy." 1 Peter
1:15, 16.
                             INTRODUCTION
   There are few books of the Old Testament from which quotations are not
quoted in the New. Theological, ceremonial, and ethical lines of thought are
woven into the fabric of the New Testament.
                               THE LESSON
    1. In what emphatic words did the apostle Peter express his confidence
in the Old Testament prophecies? 2 Peter 1:21.
     2. After Peter understood the work and mission of Jesus, what. was
he able to say.when preaching to Cornelius and his family? Acts 10:43.
     3. In speaking of Judas (Acts 1:15-17) to what scripture did Peter
make reference? Ps. 41:9.
     4. In counseling that another should be appointed to take the place of
Judas (Acts 1:20-26), what scriptures did Peter cite? Ps. 69:25; 109:8.
     5. What charge was made against the disciples on the day of Pente-
cost? In refuting the charge, to what words did Peter refer? Acts 2:14-18;
Joel 2 : 28.
     6. Upon what scripture did Peter base his claim (Acts 2:33-35) that
Jesus was then at the right hand of God? Ps. 110:1.
     7. While speaking under the influence of the Holy Spirit, what specific
statement concerning Christ did Peter make? Whence did the apostle get
this symbol of a stone as applying to Jesus? Acts 4:8-11; Ps. 118:22.
     8. From what did Peter get the idea of the Lord's impartiality as ex-
 pressed in 1 Peter 1:17? Job 34:18, 19.
     9. To what Old Testament teaching was the apostle alluding when he
said in 1 Peter 1:19 that we were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ,
"as of a lamb without blemish"? Ex. 12:5.
     NOTE.—"God expressly directed that every offering presented for the serv-
 ice of the sanctuary should be 'without blemish.' The priests were to examine
all animals brought as a sacrifice, and were to reject every one in which a de-
 fect was discovered. Only an offering 'without blemish' could be a symbol of
 His perfect purity who was to offer Himself as 'a lamb without blemish and
 without spot.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 352.
                                       1171
    10. In comparing the frailty of man with the enduring word of God
(1 Peter 1:24, 25), what scripture did Peter quote? Isa. 40:6-8.
    11. In 1 Peter 2:22-25, what expressions does the apostle borrow from
Isaiah 53?
    12. What instruction is given in 1 Peter 3:10-12? What scripture did
the apostle practically quote? Ps. 34:12-16.
    NOTE.—"True religion brings man into harmony with the laws of God,
physical, mental, and moral. It teaches self-control, serenity, temperance.
Religion ennobles the mind, refines the taste, and sanctifies the judgment. It
makes the soul a partaker of the purity of heaven. Faith in God's love and
overruling providence lightens the burdens of anxiety and care. It fills the
heart with joy and contentment in the highest or the lowliest lot. . . . Man
is doing the greatest injury and injustice to his own soul when he thinks and
acts contrary to the will of God."—Id., p. 600.
    13. How did Peter regard Moses' account of the Flood? 1 Peter 3:20.
    14. What admonition did he give concerning charity? What proverb
was the basis of this instruction? 1 Peter. 4:8; Prov. 10:12.
    NoTE.—"Love's agencies have wonderful power; for they are divine. The
soft answer that `turneth away wrath,' the love that `suffereth long, and is
kind,' the charity that `covereth a, multitude of-sins,'—would we learn the les-
son, with what power for healing would our lives be gifted ! How life would
be transformed, and the earth become a very likeness and foretaste of heaven !"
—"Education," p. 114.
    15. What punishment was inflicted upon the angels who sinned? Whence
did Peter learn this? 2 Peter 2:4; Eze. 28:12-16.
    16. What was the basis of the apostle's expectation as expressed in
2 Peter 3:13? Isa. 65:17.

                    James and the Scriptures
   MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughti-
ness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
James 1:21.
                                INTRODUCTION
    The apostle James, in his brief treatise on practical religion, refers twelve
times directly to the Old Testament scriptures or to some incident recorded
therein. Besides these direct references, his epistle is but a reproduction of
truths set forth in the Old Testament.
                                        ( 18 3
                                  THE LESSON
    1. Of what does the apostle James confidently assure us? Upon what
Old Testament scripture is this assurance evidently based? James 1:5;
Prov. 2:3-7.
    NOTE.—James was familiar with the,experiences of Solomon as recorded
in 1 Kings 3:9-12, and the confidence born of Solomon's experience must have
been deepened by the instruction found in Proverbs, as cited above.
    "God does not bestow help for to-morrow. He does not give His children
all the directions for their life journey at once, lest they should become con-
fused. He tells them just as much as they can remember and perform. The
strength and wisdom imparted are for the present emergency. 'If any of you
lack wisdom,'—for to-day,`let him ask of God, that giveth to all men lib-
erally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.' "—`•`The Desire of Ages,"
p. 313.
     2. What Scriptural basis did James have for his admonition to the rich,
as stated in James 1:9-11? Isaiah 40:6, 7; Ps. 103:15.
    NoTE.—It is not strange that the apostle warns the rich of man's insuffi-
ciency apart from God; for the prophet in Isaiah 40 gives nine striking illus-
trations of this fact, comparing man to grass, flower of the field, drop in the
bucket, small dust of the balance, a very little thing, nothing, less than nothing,
vanity, and grasshoppers. But when he thinks of the man who endures temp-
tation (James 1:12), the apostle presents a more hopeful view. That man is
to live eternally.
     3. Whose word did the apostle have for the statement concerning God's
constancy found in James •1:17, last part? Num. 23:19.
    NoTE.—"While there are different degrees of development and different
manifestations of His power to meet the wants of men in the different ages,
God's work in all time is the same. The Teacher is the same. God's character
and His plan are the same. With Him 'is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning.' "—"Education," p. 50.
     4. What was no doubt the source of the instruction found in James 1:
19, 20? Eccl. 5:2.
    NoTE.—The wise man said in Proverbs 17:27, "He that hath knowledge
spareth his words ;" and again in. Proverbs 10:19, "In the multitude of words
there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise."
     5. What conclusion does the apostle draw concerning one who cannot
control his tongue? James 1:26.
     6. Whence did James evidently borrow his figure of bridling the
tongue? Ps. 39:1.
     NoTE.—"Many will be weighed in the balance and found wanting in this
matter of so great importance. Where are the Christians who walk by this
 rule? who will take God's part against the evil speaker? who will please God,
 and set a watch, a continual watch, before the mouth, and keep the door of
 the lips? Speak evil of no man. Hear evil of no man. If there be no hearers,
 there will be no speakers of evil. If anyone speaks evil in your presence,
 check him. Refuse to hear him, though his manner be ever so soft, and his
 accents mild. He may profess attachment, and yet throw out covert hints
 and stab the character in the dark."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 54.
                                       {191
    7. To what Old Testament command does James definitely direct at-
tention in James 2:8? Lev. 19:18.
    NOTE.—"The law of love calls for the devotion of body, mind, and soul
to the service of God and our fellow men. And this service, while making us
a blessing to others, brings the greatest blessing to ourselves."—"Education,"
p. 16.
    8. To what Old Testament -incident does James appeal to prove that
faith without works is dead? James 2 : 20-22, 24.
    NOTE.—"The testimony of the word of God is against this ensnaring doc-
trine of faith without works. It is not faith that claims the favor of Heaven
without complying with the conditions upon which mercy is to be granted.
It is presumption; for genuine faith has its foundation in the promises and
provisions of the Scriptures.
    "Let none deceive themselves with the belief that they can become holy
while willfully violating one of God's requirements. The commission of a
known sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit, and separates the soul
from God."—"The Great Controversy," p. 472.
     9. What scriptures must James have had in mind when he referred
 (James 2:23) to Abraham as "the friend of God"? Isa. 41:8.
     NOTE.—"Friend of God," why ?—Because "there would be, on the part
of Abraham, no betraying of the truth for selfish purposes. He would keep
the law, and deal justly and righteously. And he would not only fear the Lord
himself, but would cultivate religion in his home. He would instruct his fam-
ily in righteousness. The law of God would be the rule in his household."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 141.
     10. What reason did James give for unanswered prayer? What basis
did he have for the statement? James 4:1-3; Ps. 66:18.
     11. To what scripture does James appeal (James 4:6) to show how
differently the Lord regards the proud and the humble? Ps. 138:6.
    NoTr.—"Those who reveal the meek and lowly spirit of Christ are ten-
derly regarded by God. They may be looked upon with scorn by the world,
but they are of great value in His sight. Not only the wise, the great, the
beneficent, will gain a passport to the heavenly courts; not only the busy
worker, full of zeal and restless activity. No; the poor in spirit, who crave
the presence of an abiding Christ, the humble in heart, whose highest ambi-
tion is to do God's will,—these will gain an abundant entrance."—"The Desire
of Ages," pp. 301, 302.
    12. What scripture was evidently the basis for the instruction found in
James 4:13-15? Prov. 27 : 1.
    13. To what instruction does James allude in his arraignment of the
rich in James 5:1-4? Lev. 19:13.
    NOTE.—"Love of money and love of display have made this world as a
den of thieves and robbers. The Scriptures picture the greed and oppression
that will prevail just before Christ's second coming. . . . Because avarice
and treachery are seen in the lives of those who have named 'the name of
Christ, because the church retains on her books the names of those who have
gained their possessions by injustice, the religion of Christ is held in contempt.
Extravagance, overreaching, extortion, are corrupting the faith of many, and
                                      ( 20 1
destroying their spirituality. The church is in a great degree responsible for
the sins of her members. She gives countenance to evil if she fails to lift her
voice against it."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 651.
    14. To what Old Testament characters is reference made in emphasiz-
ing the lesson of patience under affliction? James 5:10, 11.
    15. What incident did James cite in admonishing the sick to look to
God in faith for healing? Verses 13-18.
    NOTE.—"Faith such as this is needed in the world to-day,--faith that will
lay hold on the promises of God's word, and refuse to let go until Heaven
hears. Faith such as this connects us closely with Heaven, and brings us
strength for coping with the powers of darkness."—"Prophets and Kings,"
p. 157.

                       Paul and the Scriptures
   MEMORY VERSE: "The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of
the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
Heb. 4:12.
                                INTRODUCTION
    Paul being brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, one of the thost• distinguished
of rabbis, became rooted and grounded in the Old Testament scriptures; and
in writing fourteen of the epistles of the New Testament, he has shown how
closely he regards the Hebrew scriptures to be related to the cause he espoused
on the way to Damascus. In the book of Romans alone, Paul quotes directly
from the Old Testament more than forty times, and almost whole chapters
are essentially built upon quotations from or allusions to the Old Testament
scriptures. He quotes from Isaiah at least twenty-five times. In no case does
the apostle intimate that the Old Testament is nonessential or in any way op-
posed to the gospel truth as revealed in Jesus; but he used the Old Testament in
such a way that he "mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing
by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ." Acts 18:28.
                             THE LESSON
    1. Upon what does Paul say the gospel of which he was made a minister
is based? Rom. 1:1, 2.
    2. Where is the underlying principle of the gospel found as recorded in
Romans 1:17? Hab. 2:4.
                                         21
     3. In describing man's sinful nature (Rom. 3:10-12), to what scripture
 does the apostle make reference? Ps. 14:1-3.
     NOTE.—In writing Romans 3, the apostle quotes from at least nine psalms,
 and from several other books of the Old Testament.
     4. Whose experience did Paul use to impress the fact that belief in
 Jesus as the Saviour of the world, is accounted righteousness? Rom. 4:3-5.
     5. What psalm is quoted in Romans 4:7 and 8, as teaching the same
 truth? Ps. 32:1, 2.
     6. What other incident in the experience of Abraham did Paul cite as
 a reason why the Lord imputed righteousness unto him? Rom. 4:18-22.
     7. How did the apostle express his belief in the story of the fall of
 Adam? Rom. 5:12-14.
     NOTE.—Paul refers several times to Adam's sin, and it is evident that he
 gave a literal interpretation to the narrative recorded in Genesis 3. How vain
 for critics to attempt to throw away or discountenance the Old Testament,
 while professing to accept the New!
     8. What scripture was the basis of the apostle's argument in Romans
9:6-9 as to the real seed of Abraham? Gen. 21:12, last clause.
     NOTE.-" 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.' This
 promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood it, and he trusted in Christ
 for the forgiveness of sins. It was this faith that was accounted unto him for
 righteousness."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 370.
     9. By what scripture did Paul seek to prove in Romans 9:24-26 that the
 Gentiles will be counted among the redeemed? Hosea 2:23.
     NoTE.—Centuries before Christ the pen of inspiration through Hosea
 traced the ingathering of the Gentiles; but those prophetic utterances were but
 dimly understood. So the Saviour in the parable of the vineyard (Matt. 21:43)
 told the impenitent Jews plainly that the kingdom of God would be taken
 from them and "given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof." Paul,
 writing to the Galatians, says plainly, "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abra-
 ham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3:29:
     10. What encouraging promise to the sower of gospel truth is quoted
in Romans 10:15? Isa. 52:7.
     11. To how many scriptures is reference made in Romans 15:9-12?
 Answer.—Four.
    NoTE.—In these four short verses Paul quotes from Psalm 18:49; Deuter-
onomy 32:43; Psalm 117:1; and Isaiah 11:1, 10.
    12. What allusion does Paul make to the first gospel promise? Rom.
16:20; Gen. 3:15.
    NoTE.—"To man the first intimation of redemption was communicated in
the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden. . . . This sentence, ut-
tered in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a promise. While it fore-
told war between man and Satan, it declared that the power of the great ad-
versary would finally be broken."—Id., pp. 65, 66.
    13. In urging the people (2 Cor. 6:2) not to receive the grace of God
in vain, what scripture did Paul quote? Isa. 49:8.-
                                    [22)
     14. In the apostle's exhortation (Heb. 3:7-12) for immediate surrender
to God, what scripture did he quote? Ps. 95:7-11.
    15. In showing that faith brings the favor of God, how much Old Tes-
tament history did Paul cite in proof? Hebrews 11.
    NoTE.—Paul begins his recital of Old Testament incidents with the events
recorded in the first chapter of Genesis, touches upon the main points of the
book, passes on through Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Job, Daniel, Jere-
miah, and Zechariah, noting the exhibitions of faith recorded in these books,
giving credence to each incident as related.
    16. What reference did Paul make to the giving of the law as recorded
in Exodus? Heb. 12:18-21.
    17. In writing to Timothy, what strong tribute did Paul bear to the
authority of the Old Testament scriptures? 2 Tim. 3:15.
    NoTE.—What larger purpose could the Scriptures serve? Truly "whatso-
ever things were written aforetime were written for our learning," and we
should cherish every word; for "what the heart of a fortress is to its outworks
and minor defenses, that, to the Christian faith, is the inspired word of God—
its central stronghold. To give up that, in any measure, is, therefore, in so
far, to yield up the whole fortress."—"God's Living Oracles," A. T. Pierson, p. 1.
    Of all the varied religions and so-called sacred books of the world, the
Bible is the only one that tells a man how to be delivered from a sinful past.

               . Jesus and the Scriptures—I
   MEMORY VERSE: "I know that His commandment is life everlasting." John
12:50, first part.
                               INTRODUCTION
     Jesus nourished His soul upon the scriptures of the Old Testament; and
upheld them by His reverent attitude toward them, and by the practical, vital
use He made of them in His teaching.
     "In childhood, youth, and manhood, Jesus studied the Scriptures. As a
little child, He was daily at His mother's knee, taught from the scrolls of the
prophets. In His youth the early morning and the evening twilight found
Him alone on the mountainside or among the trees of the forest, spending a
quiet hour in prayer and the study of God's word. During His ministry His
intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures testifies to His diligence in their
                                      233
study. And since He gained knowledge as we may gain it, His wonderful
power, both mental and spiritual, is a testimony to the value of the Bible as
a means of education."—"Education," p. 185.
   Jesus' unequivocal testimony for the Scriptures was not only that they
contain truth, but, "Thy word is truth."
                                THE LESSON
    1. What did Jesus imply the Scriptures would do for those who studied
them? Matt. 22:29.
    NOTE.—By these words the Saviour clearly implied that the study of the
Scriptures would not only remedy the ignorance of the student of the word,
but would put him in touch with the transforming, renewing power of God.
    2. Upon whom did Jesus pronounce a blessing? Luke 11:28.
    3. In giving the first and second "great commandments" (Matt. 22:
37-39), what scriptures was Jesus evidently repeating? Deut. 6:5; Lev.
19:18, last part.
    4. What scriptures gave Jesus His replies to the tempter during His
experience in the wilderness? Deut. 8:3, last part; 6:13-16.
    NorE.—In "The Desire of Ages," pages 88, 89, we learn that it was Jesus'
custom, even in childhood and youth, to answer those who questioned Him
concerning His course by an "It is written." Likewise in our lives, we are told
that "when assailed by temptation, look not to circumstances, or to the weak-
ness of self, but to the power of the word. All its strength is yours. 'Thy
word,' says the psalmist, 'have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
Thee.' "—Id., p. 123.
    5. In the instruction recorded in Matthew 18:15, 16, what scripture did
the Saviour evidently have in mind? Deut. 19:15.
    6. When cleansing the temple, what Old Testament texts did Jesus
quote '(Matt. 21:12, 13) in His rebuke to the money changers? Isa. 56:7;
Jer. 7:11.
    7. How did the Saviour use the statement in Isaiah 54:13? John 6:45.
    NOTE.—This scripture, Isaiah 54:13, the Jews appropriated to themselves.
They boasted that God was their teacher. But Jesus showed that this claim
was vain; for He said, "Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned
of the Father, cometh unto Me."
    8. When the disciples inquired of Jesus why He spoke in parables
(Matt. 13:10-16), from what prophet did He quote in reply? Isa. 6:9, 10.
    9. In pressing home the lesson taught by the parable of the vineyard
(Mark 12:10, 11), what scripture did Jesus quote? Ps. 118:22, 23.
    10. What Old Testament authority did Jesus have for saying (Matt.
16:27) that 'every man would be rewarded according to his works? Jer.
32:19.
    NOTE.—"Every man's work passes in review before God, and is registered
for faithfulness or unfaithfulness. Opposite each name in the books of heaven •
is entered, with terrible exactness, every wrong word, every selfish act, every
unfulfilled duty, and every secret sin, with every artful dissembling. Heaven-
sent warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted moments, unimproved oppor-
                                       24 1
tunities, the influence exerted for good or for evil, with its far-reaching results,
all are chronicled by the recording angel."—"The Great Controversy," pp.
481, 482.
                                      •
    11. When accused of blasphemy, how did Jesus use Psalm 82:6 to show
the injustice of the charge? John 10:34-36.
    NOTE.—Many times Jesus refers His hearers to the Scriptures, saying, "Is
it not written?" "It is written ;" "Did ye never read in the scriptures?" "Have
ye not read in the book of Moses?" "As the scripture hath said," and similar
expressions.
    12. From what prophecy did Jesus evidently take the words He used in
describing the fear of the wicked at the time of their destruction (Luke
23:30)? Hosea 10:8.
    13. What scriptures gave Jesus authority for the statement made to
the seventy that their names were written in heaven? Dan. 12:1; Mal. 3:16.
    NOTE.—"The books of record in heaven, in which the names and the deeds
of men are registered, are to determine the decisions of the judgment. . . .
The book of life contains the names of all who have ever entered the service
of God."—./d., p. 480.
    14. In speaking of the poor (Matt. 26:11), what Old Testament state-
ment was Jesus paraphrasing? Deut. 15:11.
    15. When Jesus rebuked those who sought the highest places at a feast
(Luke 14:8-10), to what instruction was He doubtless alluding? Prov.
25:6, 7.
    16. How did Jesus express His confidence in the story of the Flood as
related in Genesis? Luke 17:26, 27.
    NOTE.—The New Testament quotes from twenty-five of the fifty chapters
of Genesis, and makes forty-eight quotations from the book besides many
allusions to it.
    17. What reference is made by Jesus to Lot's wife? Luke 17:32.
    NorE.—There is not the slightest hint in all of the references made in the
New Testament to incidents of the Old Testament that they were other than
a trustworthy portrayal of realities. It is significant that Jesus took occasion
to refer to several incidents that have been the most widely rejected or alle-
gorized, such as the experience of Lot's wife, the Flood, and the story of Jonah's
experience when fleeing from the Lord. Many Protestant pulpits are filled
by men who do not regard the characters and incidents of the Old Testament
as real. "With the open Bible before them, and professing to reverence its
teachings, many of the religious leaders of our time are destroying faith in it
as the word of God. They busy themselves with dissecting the word, and set
their own opinions above its plainest statements. In their hands God's word
loses its regenerating power. This is why infidelity runs riot, and iniquity is
rife."—"The• Desire of Ages," p. 258.

    "The Old and the New Testament Scriptures need to be studied daily. The
knowledge of God and the wisdom of God come to the student who is a con-
stant learner of His ways and works. The Bible is to be our light, our educa-
tor."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education," page 414.

                 Jesus and the Scriptures—II
   MEMORY VERSE: "Beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded
unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself." Luke 24:27.
                               INTRODUCTION
    A thousand or more prophecies are found in the Bible, and more than one
third of the eight hundred found in the Old Testament are concerning the per-
son of Jesus. But the Messiah is not presented alone in prophecy but in type
and antitype. The eye of faith reads the inscription, "Behold the Lamb of
God," over every offering and sacrifice of the ancient economy. Happy is he
who reads the story of the Christ, and hears His voice, throughout the Old
Testament as well as throughout the New; for the essential religious truths of
the Old Testament are the truths on which Jesus built in His work as the
founder of Christianity.
    "The clearer light granted us, should not cause us to despise that which in
earlier times was received through the types pointing to the coming Saviour."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 368.
                                THE LESSON
    1. What was the burden of the Saviour's work for the disciples on that
eventful walk to Emmaus after His resurrection? Luke 24:27.
    NoTE.—Jesus "wished the truth to take firm root in their minds, not merely
because it was supported by His personal testimony, but because of the un-
questionable evidence presented by the symbols and shadows of the typical
law, and by the prophecies of the Old Testament. It was needful for the fol-
lowers of Christ to have an intelligent faith, not only in their own behalf, but
that they might carry the knowledge of Christ to the world. And as the very
first step in imparting this knowledge, Jesus directed the disciples to 'Moses
and the prophets.' Such was the testimony given by the risen Saviour to the
value and importance of the Old Testament Scriptures."—"The Great Con-
troversy," p. 349.
    2. What did Philip say to Nathaniel about Jesus? What did Nathaniel
say of Jesus? What prophecy did he doubtless have in mind? John 1:
45, 49; Zech. 9:9.
    3. Who was the first of the prophets to write of Jesus? Acts 7:37.
    NoTE.—Moses near the close of his work gave this prophecy of the com-
ing Messiah, and assured the Israelites that God Himself had revealed this to
him in Mount Horeb. Deut. 18:15. Note the following comment concerning
the Samaritan woman who was ministered unto by the Saviour at Jacob's
                                     [ 26 ]
well: "She had studied the Old Testament promise, 'The Lord thy God will
raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like
unto me ; unto Him ye shall hearken.' She longed to understand this prophecy.
Light was already flashing into her mind. The water of life, the spiritual life
which Christ gives to every thirsty soul, had begun to spring up in her heart.
The Spirit of the Lord was working with her."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 190.
   4. What is the earliest recorded promise of a Redeemer? Gen. 3:15.
    5. Who foretold the time of the Saviour's birth as referred to in Gala-
tians 4:4, 5? Dan. 9:25.
    NOTE.—"The prophecy of Daniel revealed the time of His [Christ's] ad-
vent, but not all rightly interpreted the message. Century after century passed
away ; the voices of the prophets ceased. The hand of the oppressor was
heavy upon Israel, and many were ready to exclaim, 'The days are prolonged,
and every vision faileth.'
   "But like the stars in the vast circuit of their appointed path, God's pur-
poses know no haste and no delay. Through the symbols of the great darkness
and the smoking furnace, God had revealed to Abraham the bondage of Israel
in Egypt, and had declared that the time of their sojourning should be four
hundred years. 'Afterward,' He said, 'shall they come out with great sub-
stance.' Against that word, all the power of Pharaoh's proud empire battled
in vain. , On the selfsame day' appointed in the divine promise, 'it came to
pass that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.' So in
heaven's council the hour for the coming of Christ had been determined.
When the great clock of time pointed to that hour, Jesus was born in Beth-
lehem."—Id., pp. 31, 32.
    6. Who prophesied concerning the manner of the Messiah's birth as re-
vealed in Matthew 1:23? Isa. 7:14.
    7. Who foretold the Saviour's birthplace as recorded in Matthew 2:
4-6, seven hundred years before he was born? Micah 5:2.
    NOTE.—A characteristic of the Gospel of Matthew is its frequent citations
from the Old Testament, of which there are no less than sixty-five.
     8. Who foretold the rich gifts that would be presented to Jesus by the
Magi? Ps. 72:10.
     9. Who foresaw that Herod would seek to take the life of the "young
Child"? Who foresaw that the infant Jesus would be taken to Egypt? Jer.
31:15; Hosea 11:1. (See Matt. 2:15.)            •
     10. Who foretold that the Child born unto us should be God Himself
as indicated in Matthew 1:23? Isa. 9:6, 7.
     NoTE.—The apostle Paul said of Jesus, "In Him dwelleth all the fullness
of the Godhead bodily;" and Jesus said to the Jews, "Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Before Abraham was, I am;" and John says that the Word was
God, and that the "Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." "The divinity -
of Christ is in solution in the Bible as salt in sea water."
    True to His name Jesus assured us as He ascended to heaven, "Lo, I am
with you alway"—Immanuel, God with us. There are at least one hundred
thirty titles given Jesus in the Bible, forty of these being found in the Old
Testament. All of the letters of the alphabet but five are used to begin these
titles.
                                      { 27]
     11. What prophecy did Jesus say (Matt. 11:9-11) had its fulfillment
in John the Baptist? Mal. 3:1.
    12. How did the prophet Isaiah outline the Messiah's work? Isa. 61:
1-3. How is it known that this outline of the prophet refers to the work of
Jesus? Matt. 11:2-5.
    13. According to Matthew 8:16, 17, what scripture was Jesus fulfilling
in His healing work? Isa. 53:4.
     NOTE.—To assure us that He carried our sorrows, sicknesses, and infirmi-
ties in love for us, Jesus "put forth His hand, and touched" the leper, the
sinner, the man who had long been a cringing outcast, who had not felt a sym-
pathetic touch for years. A word from Jesus would have brought healing
power; but the touch assured the leper that back of the power was divine love
and salvation. The meaning of that touch lay behind Jesus' entire life of min-
istry and miracle.
    14. In speaking of the hatred of the Jews (John 15:25), what scrip-
ture did our Lord apply to Himself? Ps. 35:19.
    15. What prophecies were given of the quiet, unostentatious way in
which Jesus would carry on His great work for the world? Isa. 42:2-4;
Hosea 6:3.
    NOTE.—"The Sun of Righteousness did not burst upon the world in splen-
dor, to dazzle the senses with His glory. It is written of Christ, 'His going
forth is prepared as the morning.' Quietly and gently the daylight breaks
upon the earth, dispelling the shadow of darkness, and waking the world to
life. So did the Sun of Righteousness arise, 'with healing in His wings.' "—
Id., p. 261.
    16. In the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, what scripture was Jesus
consciously fulfilling? Zech. 9:9.

                Jesus and-the Scriptures—III
   MEMORY VERSE: "Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
written of Me, I delight to do Thy will, 0 My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart."
Ps. 40:7, 8.
                                 INTRODUCTION
    Jesus said, "The scripture cannot be broken" (John 10:35) ; it is depend-
able, true, whether it speaks in prophecy, history, or narrative. The word
scripture means "writing;" and according to C. M. Cobern in "The New
                                        28
Archeological Discoveries," page 34, the Greek "term 'writing' used for the
Old Testament was the common legal term for a royal decree which could not
be altered."
    Since the scripture cannot be broken, it is to be expected that all Old Tes-
tament prophecies concerning the Messiah were fulfilled at the time of the
first advent. So marvelously do prophecy and fulfillment agree that Dr. A. T.
Pierson says: "There would be no honest infidel in the world were Messianic
prophecy studied, nor any doubting disciple if this body of prediction were
understood."—"God's Living Oracles," p. 117.
                                THE LESSON
     1. What experience of the Saviour does Paul say is plainly taught in
the Old Testament? 1 Cor. 15:3, 4.
     2. What manner of death had the prophet signified that Jesus should
die? Zech. 12:10.
     NOTE.—In Zechariah 13:6 and Psalm 22:16 the crucifixion of Jesus is also
foreshadowed.
     3. What statement shows that Jesus knew He was to be crucified? John
12:31-33.
     NOTE.—Jesus made other references to His crucifixion. On His last journey
to Jerusalem, He traveled "in the most public manner, by a circuitous route,
and preceded by such an announcement of His coming as He had never made
before. He was going forward to the scene of His great sacrifice, and to this
the attention of the people must be directed. 'As Moses lifted up the serpent
in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up.' As the eyes of
all Israel had been directed to the uplifted serpent, the symbol appointed for
their healing, so all eyes must be drawn to Christ, the sacrifice that brought
salvation to the lost world."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 485.
     4. How did Jesus outline what would take place on His last visit to
Jerusalem? Who did He say wrote all these things? Luke 18:31-33.
     5. What prophecies especially refer to the sufferings of the Messiah?
Isaiah 53; Psalm 22.
    NOTE.—"These portrayals of the bitter suffering and cruel death of the
Promised One, sad though they were, were rich in promise; for of Him whom
it 'pleased the Lord to bruise' and to put to grief, in order that He might be-
come 'an offering for sin' Jehovah declared:
          `He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days,
           And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.
           He shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied' "
                                                      —Isa. 53:10,11.
    The twenty-second psalm is known as The Crucifixion Psalm. It opens
with the Saviour's agonized cry on the cross, and closes with the declaration
of His righteousness unto the people in that last announcement, "It is finished !"
    6. According to Matthew 26:31, what prophecy did Jesus call to the
attention of the disciples on the night of His betrayal? Zech. 13:7.
    NomE.—Besides quoting Zechariah's prophecy, Jesus, in bidding Peter put
up his sword, gave Genesis 9:6 as the reason; and when assuring the perturbed
                                      [ 29
disciple that His Father would, if asked, send more than twelve legions of an-
gels to His rescue, He doubtless had in mind Elisha's experience as related in
2 Kings 6:17. But Jesus added, "How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,
that thus it must be ?" Jesus lived in the atmosphere of fulfilling scripture,
and made frequent references to the fact. By word and example He "was
committed to the truth of the Scripture. He lived in it, stood for it, died in
vindication of it."—"The Teaching of Jesus," D. J. Burrell, p. 85.
     7. What is perhaps the saddest prophecy recorded of Jesus? Ps. 69:20.
     8. What specific act of persecution was it prophesied our Lord should
suffer? Micah 5:1.
     9. In what words was the price of Christ's betrayal foretold? Zech.
11:12.
     10. What prediction was made of the derision and mockery (Matt. 27:
39, 40, 42, 43) to which the Saviour would be subjected? Ps. 22:6-8.
     NOTE.—"Those who in derision uttered the words, 'He trusted in God;
let Him deliver Him now, if He will have Him; for He said, I am the Son of
God,' little thought that their testimony would sound down the ages. But
although spoken in mockery, these words led men to search the Scriptures as
they had never done before."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 749.
     11. What prophecy reveals the voluntary submission of Jesus to His
persecutors? Isa. 50:6.
    NOTE.—"It was love for sinners that led Christ to pay the price of redemp-
tion. 'He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no inter-
cessor ;' none other could ransom men and women from the power of the enemy ;
`therefore His arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sus-
tained Him.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 692.
    12. When the Saviour gave expression to His thirst (John 19:28, 29),
what response did He expect? Ps. 69:21.
    13. What words found in Psalm 31:5 did the dying Saviour use to, ex-
press His full confidence in the Father? Luke 23:46.
     NoTE.—Many martyrs have since died with these words upon their lips.
    14. How did Jesus foretell His triumph over death and the grave?
Matt. 20:18, 19.
    Nora.—"Even before He took humanity upon Him, He saw the whole
length of the path He must travel in order to save that which was lost. Every
pang that rent His heart, every insult that was heaped upon His head, every
privation that He was called to endure, was open to His view before He laid
aside His crown and royal robe, and stepped down from the throne, to clothe
His divinity with humanity. The path from the manger to Calvary was all
before His eyes. He knew the anguish that would come upon Him. He knew
it all, and yet He said, `Lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of
Me, I delight to do Thy will, 0 My God; yea, Thy law is within My heart.' "—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 410.                                           •
    15: What scripture assured Jesus of His resurrection? Ps. 16:8-10.
    NOTE.—"The very efforts made to prevent Christ's resurrection are the
most convincing arguments in its proof. The greater the number of soldiers
placed around the tomb, the stronger would be the testimony that He had
                                     [ 30
risen. Hundreds of years before the death of Christ, the Holy Spirit had de-
clared through the psalmist, 'Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine
a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take coun-
sel together, against the Lord, and against His anointed. . . . He that sitteth
in the heavens shall laugh ; the Lord shall have them in derision.' Roman
guards and Roman arms were powerless to confine the Lord of life within the
tomb. The hour of His release was near."—Id., p. 778.
    16. To what scriptures did John allude in John 19:36 as being fulfilled
in Jesus? Ps. 34:20; Num. 9:12.
    17. What prophecy did John quote (John 19:23, 24) in writing of the
disposition the soldiers made of the Saviour's garments? Ps. 22 : 18.
    NoTE.—"The prophecy concerning His garments was carried out without
counsel or interference from the friends or the enemies of the Crucified One.
To the soldiers who had placed Him upon the cross, His clothing was given.
Christ heard the men's contention as they parted the garments among them.
His tunic was woven throughout without seam, and they said, let us not
rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.' "—Id., p. 746.
    18. What reference did Jesus make to His ascension? John 6:62.
    19. What prophecy according to Ephesians 4:8 is given of the ascen-
sion? Ps. 68:18.

          The Psalms and the New Testament
  MEMORY VERSE: "Forever, 0 Lord, Thy word is settled in heaven." Ps. 119:89.
                               INTRODUCTION
    The book of the Psalms has been called "the Bible within the Bible;" for no
single book of Scripture, not even of the New Testament, has perhaps, ever
taken such hold on the heart of Christendom. None, if we may dare judge, un-
less it be the Gospels, has had so large an influence in molding the affections,
sustaining the hopes, purifying the faith, of believers.

                            THE LESSON
   1. Into what divisions were the books of the Old Testament originally
divided? Luke 24:44.
  NoTE.—The canonical books of the Old Testament from very early times
were arranged in three divisions by the Jewish church; namely, the Law,
                                  [ 31 I
Prophets, and Writings or Psalms. This last group was frequently spoken of
as "The Psalms," as in the text cited, because of the importance and position
of the Psalms in this group, they generally occupying first place. The "Law"
included the first.five books, the Pentateuch; the "Prophets" included Joshua,
Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the minor prophets;
while "The Psalms" or the "Writings" compassed the rest. Daniel was in-
cluded in the last division.
    2. How was the book of Psalms anciently divided? '
    NOTE.—For centuries before Christ the Psalter was divided into five books:
Book 1, Psalms 1-41; Book 2, Psalms 42-72; Book 3, Psalms 73-89; Book 4,
Psalms 90-106; Book 5, Psalms 107-150. These divisions are indicated by
doxologies at the close of the first four books; for example, "And blessed be
His glorious name forever: and let the whole earth be filled with His glory;
Amen, and Amen." Ps. 72:19. No special doxology marks the close of the
fifth book, but the one hundred fiftieth psalm is in itself an appropriate con-
cluding doxology for the whole Psalter.
    3. Who wrote the Psalms? Mark 12:35-37.
    NOTE.—The songs of David, like the rest of the word, have not escaped
the modern critic, who denies to David their authorship, gnd also their in-
spiration; but the Saviour plainly states in the text cited that David wrote
at least the first verse of the 110th psalm, and wrote it under the influence of
the Spirit of God. There is abundant evidence for accrediting David with
writing the majority, if not all of the psalms. In 2 Samuel 23:1 David is called
"the sweet psalmist of Israel," so it is evident he wrote psalms; and in 2 Sam-
uel 22:1 we are told he "spake unto the Lord the words of this song," which
is the eighteenth psalm. David said, "The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and
His word was in my tongue."
    4. For what purpose were the Psalms written? 1 Chron. 16:7-9.
    NOTE.—The entire Psalter was used by the Jews in its present form for
centuries before Christ. For many years the Psalms formed Israel's hymnal,
and were accepted by that people as having been written by David under the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
    5. To whom did Paul give credit for writing the sixteenth psalm? Acts
13:35-37.
    NoTE.—Paul incidentally ascribes the authorship to David, for he argues
that David was not speaking of himself, but was writing prophetically of Christ.
    6. To whom does Peter also incidentally ascribe the authorship of this
psalm? Acts 2:25-32.
    7. What psalm contains a prophecy of Judas? Psalm 109.
   NOTE.—Peter in the latter part of Acts 1:20 quotes a part of the eighth
verse of this psalm, as applying to Judas. Several verses that follow clearly
refer to the betrayer of the Saviour; but many Bible critics overlook this
fact and accuse David of exhibiting prejudice, passion, and vindictiveness. Ac-
cording to Peter's interpretation of this psalm, it is an inspired prediction of
what was to come upon Judas and his descendants; it is not David, therefore,
speaking, but the Holy Spirit through David. David's psalms contain pro-
phetic warnings of the various kinds of judgment that would certainly one
day fall upon the wicked, whether individuals or nations, unless they repented.
                                     [32]
David was not vindictive, calling down judgment on his personal enemies
from unholy passion. He was rather, as this interpretation of the apostle
shows, moved by the Spirit of God to record the dire punishment to be in-
flicted upon those who reject the mercies of God. David's love for the Lord
was so strong that he counted those who rebelled against the Lord as his own
enemies, and called for the punishment due them to be inflicted by Jehovah.
"Do not I hate them, 0 Lord, that hate Thee? and am not I grieved with those
that rise up against Thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them
mine, enemies." Ps. 139:21, 22.
    8. In Hebrews 1:10-12, what psalm does Paul quote to show the un-
changeableness of the Lord? Ps. 102:25-27.
    NOTE.—In this first chapter of Hebrews Paul quotes from six different
psalms, and twice from one of the six. The number of times that the New
Testament writers quote from the Psalms or allude to expressions in them,
shows that these songs belong to Israel, to the new dispensation, not less
than to Israel of old.
    9. Where is the persecution of the saints predicted? Ps. 44:22.
    NOTE.—"The trials of life are God's workmen, to remove the impurities
and roughness from our character. Their hewing, squaring, and chiseling, their
burnishing and polishing, is a painful process, it is hard to be pressed down to
the grinding wheel. But the stone is brought forth prepared to fill its place
in the heavenly temple."—"Mount of Blessing," pp. 23, 24.
    10. How do,we know this text is to be so interpreted? What comment
follows the quotation from the psalm? Rom. 8:36-39.
    11. In emphasizing the fact that God had not cast away all Israel,
neither would all be saved (Rom. 11:1, 8-10), from what psalm did Paul
quote? Ps. 69:22, 23.
    12. When David wrote, "The reproaches of them that reproached Thee •
are fallen upon me" (Ps. 69:9), of whom was he speaking prophetically?
Rom. 15:3.
    13. Where does Paul make reference to Psalm 116:10? 2 Cor. 4:13.
    NOTE.—The quoting of obscure passages like this, as he frequently does,
evinces the apostle's intimate acquaintance with the Psalms, as well as with
the entire Old 'Testament.
    14. In encouraging the Corinthians to liberality (2 Cor. 9:9), to what
scripture does Paul refer? Ps. 112:9.

      The Message and the Power of the Bible
   MEMORY VERSE: "They were astonished at His doctrine: for His word was
with power." Luke 4:32.
                              INTRODUCTION
    "He who with sincere and teachable spirit studies God's word, seeking to
comprehend its truths, will be brought in touch with its Author; and, except
by his own choice, there is no limit to the possibilities of his development.
    "In its wide range of style and subjects, the Bible has something to interest
every mind and appeal to every heart. In its pages are found history the most
ancient; biography the truest to life; principles of government for the control
of the state, for the regulation of the household,—principles that human wis-
dom has never equaled. It contains philosophy the most profound, poetry the
sweetest and the most sublime, the most impassioned and the most pathetic.
Immeasurably superior in value to the productions of any human author are
the Bible writings, even when thus considered; but of infinitely wider scope,
of infinitely greater value, are they when viewed in their relation to the grand
central thought."—"Education," p. 125.

                               THE LESSON
    1. What is the message of the Bible?, 2 Cor. 5:20, 21.
    NOTE.—Paul's message as an ambassador of Christ to the Corinthian
church was, "Be ye reconciled to God." This is the message that has sounded
all down the ages through priest and prophet. This is the message of the en-
tire word of God; happy is he who responds to the message.
    2. Since death is the penalty for sin (Rom. 6:23), and Christ was made
sin for us, how were we reconciled to God? Rm. 5:10.
    NOTE.—"Sin gives its best first—pleasure and honors. Its worst follows—
sorrow, poverty, disgrace, ruin. First harlots and riotous living, then swine.
Christ gives first the cross, the race, the battle; then the crown, rest, and
glory."—D. L. Moody. Let us hasten to make our reconciliation with God
that we may receive the crown at last.
    3. What then is our duty and privilege? Rom. 12:1.
    4. What change did the apostle say should come to those who accept
the reconciliation made for them? Verse 2.
    5. 'What will effect this transformation in character? 2 Peter 1:4.
    6. What gives the word of God power to transform lives? John 6:63.
                                      [ 34 ]
    NOTE. "The creative energy that called the worlds into existence is in
the word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life. Every command
is a promise; accepted by the will; received into the soul, it brings with it the
life of the Infinite One. It transforms the nature, and re-creates the soul in
the image of God."—"Education," p. 126.
    7. What confidence did David express in the power of the word? Ps.
119:11; 17:4.
    NOTE.—"When once the restraints of God's word and His Spirit are re-
jected, no man knows to what depths of degradation he may sink. Secret sin
or master passion may hold him a captive as helpless as was the demoniac of
Capernaum. Yet his condition is not hopeless."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 258.
Could some when just beginning to lose their hold upon God and His truth
have seen their final end, they surely would.have cried, "Save, Lord, or I
perish !" It is well then for us all to heed the admonition, "Hold that fast
which thou hast, that no man take thy crown" (Rev. 3:11) ; and, "Watch ye,
stand fast in the faith; quit you like men, be strong." 1 Cor. 16:13.
   8. What is an indication of real nobility of character? Acts 17:11.
    9. What was the one lesson the Lord wanted Israel to learn? Deut. 8:3.
    NoTE.—"Apostasy and corruption are the certain results of a failure in
the church to maintain direct intimacy with the word of life. Straying away
from the one source of saving knowledge, there follows a declension of faith
and practice. If a high state of spiritual life is expected in the church, it must
be obtained by a close and intimate acquaintance with the truth of the Holy
Scriptures."—"The Bible—Is It a True Book?" C. B. Haynes, p. 121.
    10. What power did Jesus accord the word of God? Matt. 16:19.
    NOTE.—" 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of Christ.
All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These words
have power to open and to shut heaven. They declare the conditions upon
which men are received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach God's
word is a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Theirs is a mission
weighted with eternal results."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 414.
    11. What symbols are used to express the diversified power of the Bible?
Ps. 119:105; Isa. 55:10, 11.
    12. How should we receive the word of truth? Jer. 15:16.
    NOTE.—"The springs of heavenly peace and joy unsealed in the soul by
the words of Inspiration will become a mighty river of influence to bless all
who come within its reach. Let the youth of to-day, the youth who are grow-
ing up with the Bible in their hands, become the recipients and the channels
of its life-giving energy, and what streams of blessing would flow forth to the
world!-influences of whose power to heal and comfort we can scarcely con-
ceive,—rivers of living water, fountains 'springing up unto everlasting life.' "
—"Education," p. 192.
    13. What will the Scriptures give to those who study them with a right
purpose? Rom. 15:4.
    NoTE.—A. T. Pierson said that when an honest doubter of the word came
to him, he felt perfectly safe in saying, "You have never studied the evidences,
and it is likely never attentively examined the Bible;" and that arrow never
                                       f35 )
missed the mark. Some of the most noted skeptics have manifested a lament-
able ignorance of the Bible; had all of these followed the course of two prom-
inent Englishmen, no doubt the results would have been similar. Gilbert West
and Lord Lyttleton agreed together to assault Christianity ; but they agreed,
too, that in order to conduct their work the most skillfully and successfully
they would first thoroughly examine the evidence. Through this examination
they were convinced that the Bible is the word of God; and so they became
ardent defenders of the faith they once denied. It was so with William Miller,
and other noted infidels. "The sovereign cure for all doubting disciples is to
immerse themselves," says Dr. Pierson, "in the word of God, as a vessel is
dipped in the sea till it is filled and overflows."
    14. What will the hope engendered by the Scriptures give one? Heb.
6:19.
                                   CONCLUSION
    To rob the world of the Bible as its infallible guide is to rob it of its
Christ. "Thou, 0 Christ, art become the corner stone of humanity so com-
pletely, that to tear Thy name from the world, would be to rend it to its
foundation." "Aye, the written word and the Incarnate Word stand together!
Neither can fall; but a man will fall from either when he lets go the other.
    "Blessed Bible I Old-fashioned but not obsolete; deep beyond the plumet
of philosophy, yet clear enough to reveal thy deepest treasures to children's
eyes; sharp as a Damascus blade to pierce a guilty conscience, but comfort-
ing as balm of Gilead to the wounds of the penitent; fierce as the lightning
against all wrong and error, but gentle as a mother's touch in time of trouble!
 Dear Book that our fathers and mothers touched with reverent hands and
 pressed with loving lips, thou shalt be the man of our counsel also, a lamp
 unto our feet and a light unto our way ! In sorrow we will find thy solace
 through our tears; in weariness we will drink from thy crystal depths as
soldiers at a wayside fountain; in weakness we will gird our loins with thine
 exceeding great and precious promises; and in our last journey thy living Word
shall be our rod and staff."—"The Teaching of Jesus," David James Burrell,
 pp. 192, 193.

                                    T    HE Bible is the very foundation of our
faith. Present trends of modern criticism make it the more important that we
should study anew this vital topic, to make sure of our own foundation. It is
therefore highly essential that the Bible as a divine book should be the subject
of our-Sabbath school lessons this quarter. To assist our people in their study,
Fannie Dickerson Chase has prepared a booklet of valuable lesson helps. You
will need a copy to give you that deeper interest while studying your lessons.
