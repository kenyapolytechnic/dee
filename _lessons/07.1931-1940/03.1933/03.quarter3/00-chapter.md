 pha] 4:1, 36; 5:20. See 1 Chron. 15:5) ; 'Ariel' (doubtless of angelic
 origin. See Ezra 8:16).
     "Michael means, 'Who is like God,' and hence is a fit title for Christ.
 Gabriel signifies, 'The strength of God,' an appiopriate name for the
 angel or being who stands next to Christ (Dan. 10:21). -13:rielonica-ns

    /3-: What other fact shows that angels are not the spirits of men who
 have died? Gen. 3:24.
     NoTE.—"Satan commenced his deception in Eden. He said to Eve,

mortality of the soul, and he had carried on this deception from that
time to the present, and will carry it on until the captivity of God's
children shall be turned. I was pointed to Adam and Eve in Eden. They
partook of the forbidden tree, and then the flaming sword was placed
around the tree of life, and they were driven from the garden, lest they
should partake of the tree of life, and be immortal sinners. The fruit
of this tree was to perpetuate immortality. I heard an angel ask, 'Who
of the family of Adam have passed that flaming sword, and have par-
taken of the tree of life?' I heard another angel answer, 'Not one of the
family of Adam have passed that flaming sword, and par ken of that
tree; therefore there is not an •               sinner.' The so   qt sinneth,
it shall die an everlasting deat        Leath fro          ich      ill be no

    Nova.—The American Revised Version reads, "For our wrestling is
not , against flesh. and blood, but against principalities, against the
powers, against the 'world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual
hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."
    "The power and malice of Satan and his host might justly alarm us,
were it not that we may find shelter and deliverance in the superior
power of our Redeemer. We carefully secure our houses with bolts and
locks to protect our property and our lives from evil men; but we seldom
think of the evil angels who are constantly seeking access to us, and
against whose attacks we have, in our own strength, no method of de-
fense. If permitted, theycan distract our minds, disorder, torment our
bodies, destroy our' possessions and our lives. Their only delight is in
misery and destruction. Fearful is the condition of those who resist the
divine claims, and yield to Satan's temptations, until God gives them
up to the control of evil spirits. But those who follow Christ are ever
safe under His watchcare. Angels that excel in strength are sent from
heaven to protect them. The wicked one cannot break through the guard
which God has stationed about His people."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 517.
     14. What aid may we have in our warfare against the powers of
darkness? Heb. 1:13, 14.

son of man, that Thou visitest him? For Thou hast made him a little lower than
the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor." Ps. 8:4, 5.

  1:26-28; Ps. 8:6-8.
      2. In whose image was man made? Gen. 1:26.
      NoTE.—"Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance
  and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father;
  but man was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony
  with the will of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine
  things. His affections were pure; his appetites and passions were un-
  der the control of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image
  of God, and in perfect obedience 10. His will.
      "As man came forth from the hand of his Creator, he was of lofty
  stature and perfect symmetry. His countenance bore the ruddy tint of
  health, and glowed with the light of life and joy., Adam's height was
  much greater than that of men who now inhabit the earth. Eve was
  somewhat less in stature; yet her form was noble, and full of beauty.
  The sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they were clothed with a
  covering of light and glory, such as the angels wear. So long as they
  lived in obedience to God, this robe of light continued to enshroud them."
  —"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 45.
      3. In God's creative plan, how did man compare with angels? Ps.
  8:4, 5.
  • 4. What questions di) some ask regarding the resurrection? 1 Cor.
  15:35.
      5. What differences in bodies does the apostle Paul call to our atten-
  tion? Verses 36-41.
      6. What change of body comes to man in the resurrection? Verses
  42-44.
,     7. What terms distinguish these different bodies? Verse 44, last part.
      NOTE.—"From this scripture, it is plainly seen that there are spirit-
  ual beings with spiritual bodies—bodies unlike the material bodies we
                                     C4]
possess. Just as surely as there are earthly, or material bodies, just so
surely are there spiritual bodies. 'There are also celestial bodies, and
bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of
the terrestrial is another.' It is sown a natural body; it is raised a
spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.'
Man was created with a natural, or material body. He belongs to this
earth; for he was made from the dust of the ground. But though man's
eyes are holden from perceiving spiritual beings with his natural senses,
still these are revealed to him through the word of God and by the in-
fluence of the Holy Spirit."—"Ministry of Angels," p. 35.
    8. 'When the Son-of-God was-born in Bethlehem, was He born,with
a spiritual or-a natural-bod*? Heb. 2:16, 9.
   NOTE.—When Jesus came into this world, He came as a man. He
did not take "the nature of angels," but He took the nature of "the
seed of Abraham." Jesus, then, was made "for a little while" lower than
the angels. Read carefully Hebrews 2:7, 9, 17, noting marginal read-
ings of the verses.
    9". How did John recognize the superiority of an angel? Rev. 22:8, 9.
    10. How weak-and helplesrare'human beings in the presence of an
angel? Matt. 28:2-4.
    kr: How was Daniel affected by the presence of an angel? Dan. 10:8.
    12. What change of body will be given to the righteous in the resur-
rection? 1 Cor. 15:51-53, 49.
    13. In what respect will the' redeemed be "equal unto the angels"
After the resurrection? Luke 20:36.
    NOTE.—"Let us not forget that the promise is never given to man
that he will at any time become an angel. We are assured, however, that
in one respect we shall be made equal to the angels—we shall not be sub-
ject to death. Of those who are accounted worthy to have a part in the
first resurrection, Jesus Himself said, 'Neither can they die any more:
for they are equal unto the angels.' At that long-desired and trium-
phant day, the saved of earth will be made 'equal unto the angels.' Every
longing of the heart will find complete satisfaction. The fear of death
will be banished; and they will receive from the hand of God, through
faith in Jesus Christ, the priceless gift of immortal               p. 39.

    "With the word of God in hand, we may draw nearer, step by step,
in consecrated love to Jesus. As the Spirit of God becomes better known,
the Bible will be accepted as the only foundation of faith. God's people
will receive the word as the leaves of the tree of life, more precious than
fine gold purified in the fire, and more powerful to sanctify than any
other agency."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 193.

           Number and Glory of the Angels
     MEMORY VERSE: "Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels."
Heb. 12:22.
    LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 40-53.

                              THE LESSON
                         NUMBER OF ANGELS

    1. How is the vastness of God's kingdom emphasized? Isa. 40:15,
17, 26.
    NOTE.—"In this wonderful description, we obtain a glimpse of how
this earth and its people appear in the eyes of heaven. In God's sight
the earth is but as a grain of sand, the waters He can measure in the
hollow of His hand, and all the inhabitants of the earth are but as grass-
hoppers. Looking up to the starry heavens, man can see with the naked
eye something of, the magnitude of God's creation. He beholds, and
marvels—but his unaided eye cannot number those glittering suns. Now
let him bring to his aid the strongest telescope, and again gaze at some
chosen spot in the heavens. What myriads of worlds, before unseen,
are visible! Could he add to this telescope still greater magnifying
power, there would be revealed still other worlds,—worlds that have
been hidden from the gaze of man during all the ages past. So great
is the immensity of space into which we gaze, that man has never found
the end. By the aid of photography, stars otherwise invisible have been
distinguished ; and astronomers tell us there are 18,000,000 worlds in
a single system, and that the systems are beyond counting."—"Ministry
of Angels," pp. 42, 43.
    2. What is said of the number of angels in this great kingdom? Heb.
12:22.
   3. How many angel ministers did the prophet Daniel see before the
throne of God? Dan. 7:9, 10.
   4. What similar vision was shown to the prophet John? Rev. 5:11.
 • NomE.—"This language leaves us in a state of uncertainty concern-
ing the precise number of the heavenly beings,—`thousands of thou-
sands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood
before Him.' We know that 'ten thousand times ten thousand' equal
one hundred million, but we can form no idea of the number represented
by `thousands of thousands.'- Nowhere in the word of God is given the
exact number of the heavenly beings."—Id., p. 46.
                                 [61
             •           GLORY OF ANGELS
   5. What is the first reference in the Bible to the glory of angels?
Gen. 3:24.
   6. What was the appearance of the horses and chariots that the •
servant saw about Elisha? 2 Kings 6:17.
   7. How are the chariot and horses that took Elijah into heaven
described? 2 Kings 2:11, 12; Ps. 68:17.
   8. How did the angel that appeared to Manoah reveal his glory?
Judges 13:19-22.
   9. With what words had the wife of Manoah described this same
angel? Verse 6.
   10. What was the appearance of the angel who rolled back the stone
from the Saviour's tomb? Matt. 28:2-4.
    NOTE.—"As night drew on, soldiers were stationed to guard the
Saviour's resting place, while angels, unseen, hovered above the sacred
spot. The night wore slowly away, and while it was yet dark, the watch-
ing angels knew that the time for the release of God's dear Son, their
loved Commander, had nearly come. 'As they were waiting with the
deepest emotion the hour of His triumph, a mighty angel came flying
swiftly from heaven. His face was like lightning, and his garments
white as snow. His light dispersed the darkness from his track, and
caused the evil angels, who had triumphantly claimed the body of
Jesus, to flee in terror from his brightness and glory. One of the angelic
host who had witnessed the scene of Christ's humiliation, and was
watching His resting place, joined the angel from heaven, and together
they came down to the sepulcher. The earth trembled and shook as they
approached, and there was a great earthquake."—"Early Writings,"
p. 181.
    11. What description is given by the prophet Daniel df the glory
of an angelic being? Dan. 10:5, 6.
    12. How is their glory pictured by Ezekiel? Eze. 1:13, 14.
    13. How does the prophet John describe the glory of the Son of
God? Rev. 1:13-16.
    NOTE.—The Son of God is the "Archangd." See 1 Thess. 4:16. To
no other being is given this exalted title. The glory of His presence
surpasses that of the angels.
    14. If faithful, what may we some day share in some degree? 1 John
3:2:

                     Powei, of the Angels
    MEMORY VERSE: "Bless the Lord, ye Ws angels, that excel in strength,
that do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His word." Ps. 103:20,
    LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 54-70.
                          THE LESSON
                              POWER
   1. What does the psalmist say of the strength of angels? Ps. 103:20.
    2. Where were Peter and John imprisoned ,Vie -second ..time?_Acts

   3. What power was manifested by an angel upon this occasion?
Verses 19, 20.
   4. With what words did Rabshakeh, leader of the Assyrian hosts,
taunt Hezekiah and defy heaven? 2 Kings 19:10-13.
   5. What did Hezekiah do when he received the letter? Verses 14-19.
    6. What was the message sent by the Lord through Isaiah in answer
to Hezekiah's prayer? Verses 20-34.

    7. That very night, what did one angel do? Verse 35 ;1,‘ Chron. 32:21.
                                                         i rom captivity
    NOTE.—"What a thrilling tale of deliverance
wrought by God through the agency of an angel! Where, now, is the
boasting of that proud, blasphemous monarch, who defied the Lord of
heaven, and said He was not able to deliver out of his hand? Before
the Assyrians can shoot an arrow or throw a javelin, the God of heaven
sends an angel to smite their sleeping hosts. In a single night, one
hundred eighty-five thousand of Sennacherib's warriors are slain, not
on the field of battle, but by this silent messenger from' heaven.     •
    "Was ever such victory won before, in the history of nations?—a
whole army gone down into the jaws of death, not in battle, not on the
field of campaign and strife, but while they lay sleeping, dreaming
perchance of the morrow, when they hoped to scale the walls of Jeru-
salem, and satisfy their lust and appetite and greed in the plunder and
spoils of a conquered city. From a study of this record, we must admit
that the power of angels is limited only by the work which God designs
they shall accomplish."—"Ministry of Angels," p. 59.

                      RAPIDITY OF MOVEMENT
    9. What description does Ezekiel give of the swiftness of the move-
ment of angels? Eze. 1:14.
    NomE.—Man has never attempted to measure the velocity of any-
thing traveling faster than light. Light travels 186,000 miles a second
—more than seven times around the earth in one second of time. Yet
angels can travel faster than this. Ezekiel wrote of their movement
that they "ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning."
Men may move about by train, automobile, or airplane, at what we
consider an extremely high rate of speed, but when we compare such
movement to that of an angel, it is as nothing. Faster than the tele-
graph message these heavenly messengers speed on their errands of
ministry to man.
    10. Note the time it takes to read a certain prayer offered by Daniel.
Dan. 9:4-19.
    11. While Daniel was still speaking, who appeared to answer his
prayer? Verses 20-22.
    12. When was Gabriel sent from heaven to answer Daniel's prayer?
Verse 23.
  c33~ hat- is said,of thellight_of-thisAngel?....Yerse-21,..
    NOTE.—"Here a messenger from heaven, standing before the throne
of God when Daniel began to pray, was commanded to come to the
prophet, and to give him skill and understanding concerning the reve-
lations of Jehovah. While the prayer was still on his lips, before he
had closed his petition, a messenger from the throne of God was at
Daniel's side, announcing, 'At the beginning of thy supplications the
commandment came forth, and I am 'come to show thee.' Surely one
could not ask for a more speedy response to his supplication than this.
    "Notice the expression 'being caused to fly swiftly.' Our Father
knows the need of immediate help for His children, and when the
occasion demands,' He causes His more than lightning-swift messengers
to quicken their flight. The angel did not have to search from place
to place in Babylon to find Daniel. He did not have to look for him in
the palace of the king, or in the council halls of the wise man, or among
the throngs in the streets, but he came direct from the throne of God to
 Daniel's side. No earthly monarch ever sent so swift a messenger to
bear tidings of good or ill as Jehovah sent to this prophet in prayer.
No heart of love, bound by the strongest cords of devotion, ever yet sent
so quick an answer to the object of his affections as God sends through
His holy angels to those who trust in Him. For our Lord is no respecter
of persons: what He did for Daniel, He will do for the humblest of His
children who serve Him in sincerity and offer their petitions to Him in
faith."—:Id. pp. 65, 66.
    14. When Herod had imprisoned Peter and designed to kill him,
what did the church at Jerusalem do? Acts 12:5.
    15. What speedy deliverance was effected by an angel? Verses 6-10.
    16. What was the church still doing when Peter came to the house
of Mary? Verses 11, 12.

                         Guardian Angels
 ' MEMORY VERSE: "He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee
in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone." Ps. 91:11, 12.
    LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 71-83; "Prophets and Kings,"
pages 255-257, 539-545.
                          THE LESSON
   1. What do even the least of God's children have accompanying
them? What shows that these attending angels have access to the throne
of God? Matt. 18:10.
     2. What charge does God give His angels concerning the care of. His
people? Ps. 91:11, 12.
    NOTE.—"I have seen the tender love that God has for His people, and
it is very great. I saw angels over the saints with their wings spread
about them. Each saint had an attending angel. If the saints wept
through discouragement, or were in danger, the angels that ever at-
tended them would fly quickly upward to carry the tidings, and the
angels in the city would cease to sing. Then Jesus would commission
another angel to descend to encourage, watch over, and try to keep them
from going out of the narrow path; but if they did not take heed to the
watchful care of these angels, and would not be comforted by them, but
continued to go astray, the angels would look sad and weep. They
would bear the tidings upward, and all the angels in the city would
weep, and then with a loud voice say, `Amen.' But if the saints fixed
their eyes upon the prize before them, and glorified God by praising
Him, then the angels would bear the glad tidings to the city, and the
angels in the city would touch their golden harps and sing with a loud
voice, 'Alleluia!' and the heavenly arches would ring with their lovely
songs."—"Early Writings," p. 39.
     3. What comforting assurance is given to those who fear God?
 Ps. 34:7.
     NOTE.---" `The angel of the Lord encatnpeth round about them that
 fear Him, and delivereth them.' God commissions His angels to save
 His chosen ones from calamity, to guard them from 'the pestilence that
 walketh in, darkness,' and `the destruction that wasteth- at noonday.'
 Again and again have angels talked with men as a man speaketh with
.a friend, and led them to places -of security. Again and again have the
 encouraging words of angels renewed the drooping spirits of the faith-
                                  1101
ful, and carrying their minds above the things of earth, caused them to
behold by faith the white robes, the crowns, the palm branches of vic-
tory, which overcomers will receive when they surround the great white
throne."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 153.
   4. What question did God once ask Satan regarding Job? Job 1:6-8.
   5. How did Satan complain of the protection about Job? Verses 9,10.
 /6 ~Vatsed the perplexity of the kiarg of Syril'ilrhse---
against Israel?-2-Rings" 6:8          -
    7. What action was therefore determined against the prophet
Elisha? Verses 13, 14.
    8. How did the situation affect Elisha's servant? Verse 15.
   9. Why was not Elisha afraid? Verses 16, 17.
   NOTE.—"Between the servant of God and the hosts of armed foemen
was an encircling band of heavenly angels. They had come down in
mighty power, not to destroy, not to exact homage, but to encamp round
about and minister to the Lord's weak and helpless ones.
   "When the people 'of God are brought into straight places, and
apparently there is no escape for them, the Lord alone must be their
dependence."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 257.
  10. What did the scheming of men not prevent Daniel from doing?
Dan: 6:10, 11.
  11. What did the king reluctantly do? Verses 14-17.
    12. What question did the anxious king ask Daniel early the next
morning? Verses 18-20.
    13. Who had stood guard between Daniel and the lions? Verses
21-23.
    NOTE.—"From the story of Daniel's deliverance, we may learn that
in seasons of trial and gloom, God's children should be just what they
were when their prospects were bright with hope and their surroundings
all that they could desire. Daniel in the lions' den was the same Daniel
who stood before the king as chief among the ministers of state and
as a prophet of the Most High. A man whose heart is stayed upon God
will be the same in the hour of his greatest trial as he is in prosperity,
when the light and favor of God and of man beam upon him. Faith
reaches to the unseen, and grasps eternal realities.     •
    "Heaven is very near those who suffer for righteousness' sake. Christ
identifies His interests with the interests of His faithful people; He
suffers in the person of His saints; and whoever touches His chosen
ones touches Him. The power that is near to deliver from physical
harm or distress is also near to save from the greater evil, making it
possible for the servant of God to maintain his integrity under all
circumstances, and to triumph through divine grace."—Id., p. 545.
   14. Whose lives did the angels not guard? Verse 24.
   15. In the final conflict, what extra provision will be made for the
protection of God's people?
   NOTE.—"Said the angel, 'List ye!' Soon I heard a voice like many
musical instruments and sounding ,in perfect strains, sweet and har-
                                 1 111
'amnions. It surpassed any music I had ever heard, seeming to be full
of mercy, compassion, and elevating, holy joy. It thrilled through my
whole being. Said the angel, 'Look ye!' My attention was then turned
to the company I had seen, who were mightily shaken. I was shown
those whom I had before seen weeping and praying in agony of spirit.
The company of guardian angels around them had been doubled, and
they were clothed with an armor from their head to their feet. They
moved in exact order, like a company of soldiers. Their countenances
expressed the severe conflict which they had endured, the agonizing
struggle they had passed through. Yet their features, marked with
severe internal anguish, now shone with the light and glory of heaven.
They had obtained the victory, and it called forth from them the deepest
gratitude, and holy, sacred joy."—"Early Writings," pp. 270, 271.

              Angels and the Judgment Books
   MEMORY VERSE: "Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to an-
other: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was
written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His
name." Mal. 3:16.
   LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 84-97.
                             THE LESSON
    1. For what event has God appointed a time? Acts 17:31.
    2. How many must appear before the judgment•bar? 2 Cor. 5:10.
    3. When Daniel beheld the scene of judgment, how many of God's
ministers assisted in the work? Dan. 7:9, 10.
    4. What witness is there of our actions and words? Eccl. 5:6..
   NoTE.—"Many have a form of godliness, their names are upon the
church records, but they have a spotted record in heaven. The recording
angel has faithfully•written their deeds. Every selfish act, every wrong
word, every unfulfilled duty, and every secret sin, with every artful dis-
sembling, is faithfully chronicled in the book of: records kept by the
recording angel."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 442.
   "I was shown that the recording angel makes a faithful record of
every offering dedicated to God, and put into the treasury, and also of
the final result of the means thus bestowed. The eye of God takes cog-
nizance of every farthing devoted' to His cause, and of-the willingness
                                  C 121
or reluctance of the giver. The motive in giving is also chronicled.
Those self-sacrificing, consecrated ones who render back to God the
things that are His, as He requires of them, will be rewarded according
to their works. Even though the means thus consecrated be misapplied,
so that it does not accomplish the object which the donor had in view,—
the glory of God and the salvation of souls,—those who made the sac-
rifice in sincerity of soul, with an eye single to the glory of God, will
not lose their reward."—Id., pp. 518, 519.
    5. `There did the psalmist indicate that his life record was kept?
Ps. 56:8.
   6. When all men finally stand before the "great white throne," what
records will be opened? Rev. 20:11-15.
    7. Who have kept these records?
    NOTE.—It is evident that angels are familiar with every detail of
our lives (Eccl. 5:6; 1191=t07'; 1 Cor. 11:10, A. R. V.), and it is reasonable
to believe that they are heavenly recorders. In each note of this lesson,
quotations are given from the spirit of prophecy, declaring that angels
are keeping these record books. In 1882 an important testimony was
sent to one of our denominational centers; the following paragraph is
taken from it:
    "A few weeks since, I was in a dream brought into one of your meet-
ings for investigation. I heard the testimonies borne by students against
Bro. —. Those very students had received great benefit from his
thorough, faithful instruction. Once they could hardly say enough in
his praise. Then it was popular to esteem him. But now the current
was setting the other way. These persons have developed their true
character. I saw an angel with a ponderous book open, in which he wrote
every testimony given. Opposite each testimony were traced the sins,
defects, and errors of the one Who bore it. Then there was recorded the
great benefit which these individuals had received from Bro. —'s
labors. "—Id., vol. 5, p. 59.
    8. For whom is a book of remembrance kept? Mal. 3:16, 17.
    NorE.—"It will pay, then, to improve the privileges within our reach,
and, even at some sacrifice, to assemble with those who fear God and
speak for Him; for He is represented as hearkening•to those testimonies,
while angels write them in a book. God will remember those who have
met together and thought upon His name, and He will spare them from
the great conflagration. They will be as precious jewels in His sight;
but His wrath will fall on the shelterless head of the sinner."—Id., vol.
4, p. 107.
    9. What is taken into account in the judgment? Matt. 12:36, 37.
    NOTE.—"Some talk too much; they stand in this position, 'Report,
and we will report it.' Miserable indeed is such a position I. If all these
gossipers would ever bear in mind that an angel is following them,
recording their words, there would be less talking and much more pray-
ing."—Id., p. 40.
    "You all have an influence for good or for evil on the minds and
characters of others. And just the influence which you exert is written
in the book of records in heaven. An angel is attending you, and_ taking
                                    [ 13 ]
 record of your words and actions. When you rise in the morning, do you
 feel your helplessness, and your need of strength from God? and do you
 humbly, heartily make known your wants to your heavenly Father? If
 so, angels mark your prayers, and if these prayers have not gone forth
 out of feigned lips, when you are in , danger of unconsciously doing
 wrong, and exerting an influence which will lead others to do wrong,
 your guardian angel will be by your side, prompting you to a better
 course, choosing your words for you, and influencing your actions."—
 Id., vol. 3, pages 363, 364.
     10. What will then be revealed? 1 Cor. 4:5; Bell.4 X12
     NOTE.—"Words and actions and motives are recorded; but how
little do these light, superficial heads and hard hearts realize that an
angel of God stands writing down the manner in which their precious
moments are employed. God will bring to light every word and every
action. He is in every place. His messengers, although unseen, are
visitors in the workroom and in the sleeping apartment. The hidden
works of darkness will be brought to light. The thoughts, the intents
and purposes of the heart, will stand revealed. All things are naked
and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do."—Id., vol. 4,
pp. 589, 590.
   11. What shows that the secrets of our lives are registered in heaven?
Eccl. 12:14.
    NOTE.—"Rvery-man4s-wor-k-passes‘in-review-beioze-Gairmlis-IAegifi.
tere_d_to_r_falthfulness_or-unfaithfulaesa. Opposite each name in the
boblfs of heaven is entered, with terrible exactness, every wrong word,
every selfish act, every unfulfilled duty, and every secret sin, with every
artful dissembling. Heaven-sent warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted
moments, unimproved opportunities, the influence exerted for good or
for evil, with its far-reaching results, all are chronicled by the recording
angel."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 481, 482.
•  12. In what book are the names of the overcomers registered? What
will be done before the angels for these names? Rev. 3:5.
    13: Who will be delivered in the "time of trouble"? Dan. 12:1.
    14. Who only will enter the city of God? Rev. 21:27.
    15. Why should the Christian rejoice? Luke 10:20.

                Agents in Divine Revelation
   MEMORY VERSE: "He said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true;
and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel-to show unto His servants
the things which must shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that
keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book." Rev. 22:6, 7.
    LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 98-110.

                        THE LESSON
   1. Through whom does God reveal a knowledge of His will? Amos
3:7.
    2. What agency does God use in communicating revelations to His
prophets? Rev. 1:1.
    NOTE.—"In the past, God has revealed to man many of His plans
and purposes. Again and again, in different ages, He has spoken to
men in various ways, througl! His Holy Spirit, by vision, and by sending
angels to bring His messages to those through whom He would reveal
His will. Almost from the earliest records of GOd's dealings with His
chosen people, to the closing book in the Bible, we find that God has
repeatedly spoken to His prophets and His people through the agency
of angels."—"Ministry of Angels," p. 98.
    3. In what-*ctie- direct way does God sometimes communicate with
man? Gen. 22:11, 12, 15-18.
    NOTE.—"In this instance a direct message from heaven was given
to Abraham through the agency of a heavenly being. The angel spoke in
a language Abraham understood, giving him a message that greatly
cheered his heart, and that revealed to him God's acceptance of his
sacrifice. When the Lord had thus tested His servant, He also revealed
His purpose toward him and toward his seed."—Ibid.
    4. How did God once reveal His purpose to Gideon? Judges 6:11, 12.
   5. Who was "caused to fly swiftly" in order to give Daniel "skill
and understanding"? Dan. 9:21, 22.
   6. Who is "the man Gabriel"? What honored position' does he
occupy in heaven? Luke 1:19; Dan. 10:21.,
    7. How do we know that Gabriel is the angel chosen to open the.
purposes of God to men? Rev. 22:9.
    NOTE.—"The words of the angel, am Gabriel, that stand in the
presence of God,' show that he holds a position of high honor in the
heavenly courts. When he came with a message to Daniel, he said,
'There is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael [Christ]
your prince.' Of Gabriel the Saviour speaks, in the Revelation, saying
that 'He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John' And
to John the angel declared, am a fellow servant with thee, and with
thy brethren the prophets.' Wonderful thought—that the angel who
stands next in honor to the Son of God, is the one chosen to open the
purposes of God to sinful men."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 98, 99.
   8. How did Zechariah receive special heavenly instruction? Zech.
1:9-17.
                              [ 151
    9. What message did the angel Gabriel bring to Zacharias? Luke
1:11-19.
    10. What judgment rested upon Zacharias because he doubted the
words of Gabriel? Verses 20-22, 63, 64.
    11. How was the message given to Mary concerning the birth of
Jesus? Verses 26-33.
    12. What relation does this angel of divine revelation sustain to
Jesus? Rev. 1:1; 22:16.
    13. How should we regard the messages carried by His angel? Rev.
22:6, 7.
    NOTE.—"Christ sent and made known the RevelatiOn to John by 'His
angel.' A particular angel seems here to be brought to view. What
angel could appropriately be called Christ's angel? May we not find
an answer to this question in a significant passage in the prophecy of
Daniel? In Daniel 10:21, an angel, which was doubtless Gabriel (see
Daniel, chapters 9, 10, and 11:1), in making known some important
truths to Daniel, said, 'There is none that holdeth with me in these
things, but Michael your prince.' Who Michael is, we easily learn.
Jude (verse_ 9) calls him the 'Archangel.' And Paul tells us that when
the Lord descends from heaven, and the dead in Christ are raised, the
voice of the Archangel shall be heard. 1 Thess. 4:16. And whose voice
will be heard at that amazing hour when the dead are called to life?
The Lord Himself replies, 'Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming
in the which all, that are in the graves shall hear His voice' (John 5:28) ;
and the previous verse shows that the one here referred to, whose voice
will then be heard, is the Son of man, or Christ. It is the voice of
Christ, then, that calls the dead from their graves. That voice, Paul
declares, is the voice of the archangel; and Jude says that the archangel
is called Michael, the very personage mentioned in•Daniel, and all re-
ferring to Christ. The statement in Daniel, then, is, that the truths to
be revealed to Daniel were committed to Christ, and confined exclusively
to Him, and to an angel whose name was Gabriel. Similar to the work
of communicating important truth to the 'beloved prophet' is the work
of Christ in the Revelation of communicating important truth to the
`beloved disciple'; and who, in this work, can be His angel but he who
was engaged with. Him in the former work, that is, the angel Gabriel'?"

                   Angel Ministry to Men
   MEMORY VERSE: "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some
have entertained angels unawares." Heb. 13:2.
   LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 124-129.
                             THE LESSON
                         ABRAHAM AND LOT
    1. What            was made to Abraham regarding his posterity?
Gen. 15:5.
    2. Who were the "three ins" entertained by Abraham in the plains
of Mature? Gen. 18:1-8, 22;1'3:1.
    3. How did the Lord at this time tell Abraham the promise concern-
ing his seed was to be fulfilled? Gen. 18:9-15.
    4. What was the mission of the angels to Sodom and neighboring
cities? Verses 17-22..
    5. What did Lot not know when he invited these two strangers to
his home? Gen. 19:1-3.
    6. What reference is made to this incident in the New Testament?
Heb..13:2.
    7. In what way was the real character of Lot's guests revealed?
Gen. 19:9-11. ,
    NomE.—Lot's "words were like oil upon the flames. Their rage be-
came like the roaring of a tempest. They mocked Lot as making himself
a judge over them, and threatened to deal worse with him than they had
purposed toward his guests. They rushed upon him, and would have
torn him in pieces had he not been rescued by the angels of God. The
heavenly messengers 'put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
house to them, and shut to the door.' The events that followed revealed
the character of the guests he had entertained."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 159.
    8. What did the angels then tell Lot regarding the object of their
visit? Verses 12-14.
    9. While these angels had been sent to destroy the wicked inhabit-
ants, what was their work in behalf of Lot and his family? Verses 15-25.
    NOTE.—"We need to understand better than we do the mission of
the angels. It would be well to remember that every true child of God
has the cooperation of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and
power attend the meek and lowly. ones who believe and claim the prom-
ises of God. Cherubim and seraphim, and angels that excel in strength,
stand at God's right hand, 'all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
for them who shall be heirs of salvation.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 154.
                                 HAGAR
   10. When Hagar fled from her mistress, who found her in the wit-
derness? Gen. 16:6-8.
   11. What message did the angel give to her? Verses 9-13.
                                   [ 17 ]
  12. When Ishmael was fourteen years of age, what difficulty arose?
Gen. 21:9-11.
   13. In what distressing situation did Hagar soon find herself?
Verses 12-16.
   14. Who heard the cry of the dying lad 'who called to Hagar?
Verse 17.
    15. How did God help this poor discouraged mother? Verses 18, 19.
    NOTE.—"Thus it is that Heaven ministers to man's needs. These
poor exiles were hopeless and friendless. No more could they return to
the abundance of Abraham's house. Moreover, He to whom the future
is as an open book, knew that Ishmael would not choose to walk in the
paths of righteousness; yet notwithstanding all this, He sent .an angel
from heaven to this sorrowing mother and her suffering child to supply
their needs.
    "In this dark world, there is many a mother whose heart aches as
did Hagar's; many a one who, like the outcast Egyptian, knows not
what to do. Often her heart is too full for utterance. There may be no
true human friend to whom she can tell her sorrows, none from whom
she may seek counsel. In utter hopelessness, she may feel that life is
too bitter to be borne, and long for the time when she may rest from
her troubles. But there is not one such who may not find comfort and
help in God."—"Ministry of Angels," p. 128.

                           THE LESSON
                               JACOB
  1. In Jacob's dream at Bethel, whom did he see ascending and de-
scending between earth and heaven? Gen. 28:10-12.
   NomE.—"Heaven is brought near to earth by that mystic ladder, the
base of which is firmly planted on the earth, while the topmost round
reaches the throne of the Infinite. Angels are constantly ascending
and descending this ladder of shining brightness, bearing the prayers
                                [18 1
of the needy and distressed to the Father above, and bringing blessing
and hope, courage and help, to the children of men. These angels of
light create a heavenly atmosphere about the soul, lifting us toward the
unseen and the eternaL We cannot behold their forms with our natural
sight; only by spiritual vision can we discern heavenly things. The
spiritual ear alone can hear the harmony of heavenly voices."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 153.
   2. What message did God speak to him? .Verses 13-15.
    3. Hpw did this dream impress Jacob? What vow did he make?
Verses 16-22.
    4. Who met Jacob as he was returning to his father's land twenty
years later? Gen. 32:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Again the Lord granted Jacob a token of the divine care.
As he traveled southward from Mount Gilead, two hosts of heavenly
angels seemed to encompass him behind and before, advancing with his
company, as if for their protection. Jacob remembered the vision at
Bethel so long before, and his burdened heart grew lighter at this
evidence that the divine messengers who had brought him hope and
courage at his flight from Canaan, were to be the guardians of his re-
turn. And he said, 'This is God's host; and he called the name of that
place Mahanaim'—'two hosts, or camps.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 195.
    5. When in distress for fear of Esau, for what did Jacob pray?
Verses 9-12.
    6. What experience did he have with an angel during the night?
Verses 24-30.
    NOTE.—"The struggle continued until near the break of day, when
the stranger placed his finger upon Jacob's thigh, and he was crippled
instantly. The patriarch now discerned the character of his antagonist.
He knew that he had been in conflict with a heavenly messenger, and
this was why his almost superhuman effort had not gained the victory.
It was Christ, 'the Angel of the covenant,' who had revealed Himself
to Jacob. The patriarch was now disabled, and suffering the keenest
pain, but he would not loosen his hold. All penitent and broken, he
clung to the Angel; 'he wept, and made supplication,' pleading for a
blessing. He must have the assurance that his sin was pardoned. Physi-
cal pain. was not sufficient to divert his mind from this object. His de-
termination grew stronger, his faith more earnest and persevering,
until the very last. The Angel tried to release Himself ; He urged,
'Let Me go, for the day breaketh ;' but Jacob answered, will not let
Thee go, except Thou bless me.' Had this been a boastful, presumptuous
confidence, Jacob would have been instantly destroyed; but this was the
assurance of one who confesses his own unworthiness, yet trusts the
faithfulness of a covenant-keeping God. . . .
    "While Jacob was wrestling with the Angel, another heavenly mes-
senger was sent to Esau. In a dream, Esau beheld his brother for
twenty years an exile from his father's house; he witnessed his grief
at finding his mother dead; he saw him encompassed by the hosts of
God. This dream was related by Esau to his soldiers, with the charge
not to harm Jacob, for the God of his father was with him. . . .
                                 [191
    "At sight of that crippled sufferer, 'Esau ran to meet him, and em-
braced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept.' As
they looked upon the scene, even the hearts of Esau's rude soldiers
were touched. Notwithstanding he had told them of his dream, they
could not account for the change that had come over their captain.
Though they beheld the patriarch's infirmity, they little thought that
this his weakness had been made his strength."—Id., pp. 197, 198.
                                  ELIJAH
    7. For what •did Elijah pray when in utter discouragement at the
threat of Jezebel? 1 Kings 19:1-4.
    8. In this dark hour of despondency, who ministered to the weary
prophet? Verses 5-8.
    NOTE.—"Into• the experience of all there come times of keen dis-
appointment and utter discouragement,—days when sorrow is the
portion, and it is hard to believe that God is still the kind benefactor
of His earthborn children; days when troubles harass the soul, till
death seems preferable to life. It is then that many lose their hold on
God, and are brought into the slavery of doubt, the bondage of unbelief.
Could we at such times discern with spiritual insight the meaning of
God's providences, we should see angels seeking to save us from our-
selves, striving to plan.t our feet upon a foundation more firm than the
everlasting hills; and new faith, new life, would spring into being."
—"Prophets and Kings," p. 162.
                       THE' THREE. HEBREWS
    9. What sentence did Nebuchadnezzar pronounce against Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego? Dan. 3:19, 20.
    10. After the sentence had been executed. what caused great as-
tonishment to the king? Verses 21-25.
  ' 11. How complete was the deliverance? Verses 26, 27.
    .12. Whom did God send to keep these• men in the hour of persecu-
tion? Verse 28.
     NorE.—"As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so
in the closing period of earth's history the Lord will work mightily in
behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the right. He who walked
with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery furnace will be with His followers
wherever they are. His abiding presence will comfort and sustain. In
the midst of the time of trouble trouble such as has not been since
there was a nation,-His chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan with
all the hosts of evi cannot destroy the weakest of God's saints. Angels
that excel in strength will protect them, and in their behalf Jehovah
will reveal Himself as a 'God of gods,' able to save to the uttermost
those who have put their trust in Him."—Id. p. 513.

    "There is nothing more calculated to energize the mind, and
strengthen the intellect, than the study of the word of God. No other
book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties,
as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible."—"Fundamentals of Chris-
tian Education," p. 126.

                    Angel Ministry to Jesus
   MEMORY VERSE: "Thinkeat thou that I cannot now pray 10. My Father,
and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?" Matt. 26:53.
   LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 165-174.
                            THE LESSON
   1. Who announced the Saviour's birth with joy and song? Luke
2:8-14.
    2. How were the wise men from the East guided to the birthplace of
Jesus? Matt. 2:1, 2, 9, 10.
    NOTE.—"The wise men had seen a mysterious light in the heavens
upon that night when the glory of God flooded the hills of Bethlehem.
As the light faded, a luminous star appeared, and lingered in the sky.
It was not a fixed star nor a planet, and the phenomenon excited the
keenest interest. That star was a distant company of shining angels,
but of this the wise men were ignorant. Yet they were impressed that
the star was of special import to them."--"The Desire of Ages," p. 60.
    3. How did the angels show their interest and sympathy when Jesus
was tempted in the wilderness? Matt. 4:11.
    NOTE.—"After the foe had departed, Jesus fell exhausted to the
earth, with the pallor of death upon His face. The angels of heaven
had watched. the conflict, beholding their loved Commander as He
passed through inexpressible suffering to make a way of escape for us.
He had endured the test, greater than we shall ever be called to endure.
The angels now ministered to the Son of God, as He lay like one dying.
He was strengthened with food, comforted with the message of His
Father's love, and, the assurance that all heaven triumphed in His
vietory."—Id., p. 131.
    4. How did the Master escape the wrath of His own townsmen?
Luke 4:28-30.
    NOTE.—"Some were casting stones at Him, when suddenly He 'dis-
appeared from among them. The heavenly messengers who liadrbenn
 by His side in the synagogue were with Him in tile midst of ',that
maddened throng. They shut Him in from MS enemies, and'conducted
Him to a place of safety."—Id., p. 240.
   5. What other occasion of angel ministry to Jesus is recorded?
Luke 22:39-44.
                              [ 21]
    NOTE.—"The worlds unfallen and the heavenly angels had watched
with intense interest as the conflict drew to its close. Satan and his
confederacy of evil, the legions of apostasy, watched intently this great
crisis in the work of redemption. The powers of good and evil waited to
see what answer would come to Christ's thrice-repeated prayer. Angels
had longed to bring relief to the divine sufferer, but this might not be.
No way of escape was found for the Son of God. In this awful crisis,
when everything was at stake, when the mysterious cup trembled in
the hand of the sufferer, the heavens opened, a light shone forth amid
the stormy darkness of the crisis hour, and the mighty angel who stands
in God's presence, occupying the position from which Satan fell, came
to the side of Christ. The angel came not to take the cup from Christ's
hand, but to strengthen Him to drink it, with the assurance of the
Father's love. He came to give power to the divine-human suppliant. He
pointed Him to the open heavens, telling Him of the souls that would be
saved as the result of His sufferings. He assured Him that His Father
is greater and more powerful than Satan, that His death would result in
the utter discomfiture of Satan, and that the kingdom of this world
would be given to the saints of the Most High. He told Him that He
would see of the travail of His soul,'and be satisfied, for He would see
a multitude of the human race saved, eternally saved."—Id., pp. 693, 694.
   6. What eiperience came to that band of men in Gethsemane when
Jesus answered them, "I am He"? John 18:4-6.
    NomE.—"No traces of His recent agony were visible as Jesus stepped
forth to meet His betrayer. Standing in advance of His disciples, He
said, 'Whoin seek ye?' They answered, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus re-
plied, 'I -am He.' As these words were spoken, the angel who had lately
ministered to Jesus, moved between Him and the mob. A. divine light
illuminated the Saviour's face, and a dovelike form overshadowed Him.
In the presence of this divine glory, the murderous throng could not
stand for a moment. They staggered back. Priests, elders, soldiers, and
even Judas, fell as dead men to the ground."—Id., p. 694.
   7. How didNSi on-Peter--attempt 10.s defend the Son of God from
the ayaCk6f the mob? Matt. 26:50, 51.
   8. Instead of having twelve men to defend Him, who were at His
command? Verses 52-54.
    NomE.="Jesus bade him put up the sword, saying, ‘Thinkest thou
that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give me
more than twelve legions of angels?' I saw that as these words were
spoken, the countenances of the angels were animated with hope. They
wished then and there to surround their Commander, and disperse that
angry mob. But again sadness settled upon them, as Jesus added, 'But
how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?' The
hearts of the disciples also sunk in despair and bitter disappointment,
as Jesus suffered Himself to be led away by His enemies.
    "The disciples feared for their own lives, and they all forsook Him
and fled. Jesus was left alone in the hands of the murderous mob. Oh,
what a triumph of Satan then! And what sadness and sorrow with the
angels of God! Many companies of holy angels, each with a tall com-
manding angel at their head, were sent to witness the scene. They were
                                  [ 22]
to record every insult and cruelty imposed upon the Son of God, and
to register every pang of anguish which Jesus should suffer; for the
very men whd joined in this dreadful scene are to see it all again in
living characters."—"Early Writings," p. 168.
    9. What experience did Pilate's wife have during the trial of Jesus?
Matt. 27:19.        ,
    NOTE.—"From the first, Pilate was convicted that Jesus was no
common man. He believed Him to be an excellent character, and en-
tirely innocent of the charges brought against Him. The angels who
were witnessing the scene marked the convictions of the Roman gover-
nor, and to save him from engaging in the awful act of delivering
Christ to be crucified, an angel was sent to Pilate's wife, and gave her
information through a dream that it was the Son of God in whose trial
her husband was engaged, and that He was an innocent sufferer. She
immediately sent a message to Pilate, stating that she had suffered
many things in a dream on account of Jesus, and warning him to have
nothing to do with that holy Man."—Id.-, p. 173.
   10. What work was given an angel the morning of Christ's resur-
rection? Matt. 28:2.
   11. How did' the angel's presence affect the soldiers who guarded
the tomb? Verses 3, 4.
   12. What did the.angel tell the women at the tomb? Verses 5-7.
   13. How many angels at least had special duties in connection with
the resurrection? Luke 24:3-5.
   14. What escort was present to receive Jesus at His ascension?
Acts 1:9.
   NOTE.—"As He passed upward, the awe-stricken disciples looked
with straining eyes for the last glimpse of their ascending Lord. A
cloud of glory hid Him from their sight; and the words came back to
them as the cloudy chariot of angels received Him, `Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world.' At the same time there floated
down to them the sweetest and most joyous music from the angel choir."
—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 830, 831.
    15. Why did two angels remain with the disciples while the heavenly
hosts were welcoming Jesus? Verses 10, 11.
    NOTE.—"These angels were of the company that had been waiting in
a shining cloud to escort Jesus to His heavenly home. The most exalted
of the angel throng, they were the two who had come to the tomb at
Christ's resurrection, and they had been with Him throughout His life
on earth. With eager desire all heaven had waited for the end of His
tarrying in a world marred by the curse of sin. The time had now come
for the heavenly universe to receive their King. Did not the two angels
long to join the throng that welcomed Jesus? But in sympathy and love
for those whom He had left, they waited to give them comfort. 'Are
they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
be heirs of salvation?' "—Id., pp. 831, 832.
   16. What•ministry do the angels
                               r23 lgive to the children of God at the
present time?
    NOTE.—"Heaven and earth are no wider apart to-day than when
shepherds listened to the angel's song. Humanity is still as much the
object of heaven's solicitude as when common men of common occupa-
tions met angels at noonday, and talked with the heavenly messengers
in the vineyards and the fields. To us in the common walks of life,
heaven may be very near. Angels from the courts above will attend the
steps of those who come and go at God's'command."—Id., p. 48.
    "From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have been preserved
through the interposition of the angels, we shall never know, until in
the light of eternity we see the providences of God. Then we shall know
that the whole family of heaven was interested in the family here be-
low, and that messengers from the throne of God attended our steps
from day to day."—Id., p. 240.

                Angel Ministry in the Gospel
   MEMORY VERSE: "While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto
him, Behold, three men seek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with
them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them." Acts 10:19, 20.
   LESSON HELP: "Ministry of Angels," pages 175-186.

                               THE LESSON
                        PHILIP AND THE ANGEL
   1. What did Philip do when persecution arose at Jerusalem? Acts
8:4-8.
   2. While thus working for the salvation of men, what instruction
did he receive from an angel? Verse 26.
    3. Following the instruction, whom did Philip see? Verses 27-29.
    4. Who also were accompanying the Ethiopian?
    NOTE.—"This Ethiopian was a man of good standing and of wide
influence. God saw that when converted, he would give others the light
he had received, and 'would exert a strong influence in favor of the
gospel. Angels of God were attending this seeker for light, and he
was being drawn to the Saviour. By the ministration of the Holy Spirit,
the Lord brought him into touch with one who could lead him to the
light."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 107.
   5. As Philip obeyed the heavenly messenger, what was the result?
Verses 30-38.
                               [ 24]
     6. What class is represented by the Ethiopian? What will the angels
do to-day?
     NOTE.—"This Ethiopian represents a large class who need to be
 taught by such missionaries as Philip,—men who will hear the voice
 of God, and go where He sends them. There are many who are reading
 the Scriptures who cannot understand their true import. All over the
 world men and women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and
 tears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for
 the Holy Spirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only
 to be gathered in.
     "An angel guided Philip to the one who was 'seeking for light, and
 who was ready to receive the gospel; and to-day angels will guide the
 footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify
 their tongues and refine and ennoble their hearts. The angel sent to
 Philip could himself have done the work for the Ethiopian, but this is
'not God's way of working. It is His plan that men are to work for their
 fellow men."—Id., p. 109. "
                   CORNELIUS AND THE ANGEL
    7. How did the Lord answer the prayer of a Roman officer? Acts
10:1-ork
   ‘811W1)41t specific' directions-were- given- Cornelius ,by the. angel?
Versedi5,'6`:
    NOTE.—"Interesting indeed are these minute directions of the angel.
He knew Simon, knew his surname, knew where he was, the name of
the city in which he was stopping, the man at whose house he was
lodging, his name, and the street in which he lived. Such intimate
knowledge shows that angelic beings know all about man. They know
his lying down and his rising up, his faithfulness or negligence, his zeal
and earnestness, his lukewarmness and barrenness of soul; they are
messengers of Him who knows even man's very thoughts afar off."—
"Ministry of Angels," p. 182.
    9. What influenced Peter to accept an invitation to visit this Gentile
army officer? Verses 9-20.
    NOTE.—"The angel, after his interview with Cornelius, went to
Peter, in Joppa."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 135.
    10. Who were gathered in by Cornelius to hear the preaching of the
gospel? Verses 24, 27.
    11. In the presence of his "kinsmen and near friends," what did he
relate to Peter? Verses 30-33.
    12. What was the result of this meeting arranged by an angel?
Verses 44-48.
    13. In what way is this experience of Peter and Cornelius a lesson
to us?
    NOTE.—"Because Cornelius was living in obedience to all the in-
structions he had received, God so ordered events that he was given
more truth. A messenger from the courts of heaven was sent to the
Roman officer and to Peter, in order that Cornelius might be brought
into touch with one who could lead him into greater- light,
                                  [ 25 ]
    "There are in our world many who are nearer the kingdom of God
than we suppose. In this dark world of sin, the Lord has many precious
jewels,. to whom He will guide His messengers. Everywhere there are
those who will take their stand for Christ. Many will prize the wisdom
of God above any earthly advantage, and will become faithful light
bearers. Constrained by the love of Christ, they will constrain others
to come 10. Him."—Id., pp. 140, 141.
    "Re venly intelligences are waiting to ooperate with human instru-
mentahtieat they may reveal t.se world what human beings may
become, and w -at, through t I      influence, they may accomplish for
the saving of souls that • ready to perish."—"Testimonies," vol. 9,
p. 30.
    "Heavenly angels- have long bee waiting for human agents—the
members of the church—to cooperate with them in the great work to be
done. They are waiting for you. So vast is *the field, so comprehensive
the design, that every sanctified heart will be pressed into service an an,
instrument of divine power."—Id., pp. 46, 47.

    Angel Ministry in the Gospel (Continued)
   MEMORY VERSE: "After these things I saw another angel come down from
heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory." Rev. 18:1.
   LESSON HELP:. "Early Writings," pages 277-279.

                         THE LESSON
    1. To whom are the angels sent to minister? Heb. 1:13, 14.
    2. What shows their deep interest in the salvation of men? Luke'
15:7, 10..
    NOTE.—"The angels of glory find their joy in giving,—giving love
and tireless watchcare. to souls that are fallen and unholy. Heavenly
beings woo the hearts of men; they bring to this dark world light from
the courts above; by gentle and patient ministry they move upon the
human spirit; to bring the lost into a fellowship with Christ which is
even closer than they themselves can know."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 21.
    "In this work all the angels of heaven are ready to cooperate: All
the resources of heaven are at the command of those who: are seeking to
save the lost. Angels will help you to reach the most careless and the
most hardened. And when one is brought back. to God, all heaven is
                                  [ 26 3
made glad; seraphs and cherubs touch their golden har
praises to God and the Lamb for their mercy and loving
the children of men."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 197:'
   3. 'When the long-hidden secrets in the book of Daniel wei
unsealed, who held in his hand "a little book open"? Rev. 10:1,
     4. By what symbol is the movement represented announcing that
the time of the judgment is come? Rev. 14:6, 7.
     NOTE.—"These angels are evidently symbolic; for the work assigned
them is that of preaching the everlasting gospel to the people. But
the preaching of the gospel has not been intrusted to literal angels; it
has been committed unto men, who are responsible for this sacred trust
placed in their hands. Each of these three angels, therefore, symbolizes
a body of religious teachers, who are commissioned to make known to
their fellow men the special truths which constitute the burden of these
messages respectively.
     "But we are to consider further that angels, literally, are intensely
interested in the work of grace among men, being sent forth to minister
 to those who shall be heirs of salvation. And as there is order in all
the movements and appointments of the heavenly world, it may not be
fanciful to suppose thdt a literal angel has charge and oversight of the
work of each message."—"Daniel and the Revelation," p. 633 (old edi-
tion, p. 711).
     5. How was the fall of Babylon announced? Verse 8.
     6. Who is represented as proclaiming a warning against the wor-
ship of the beast? Verses 9-12.
     7. Who are instructed to hold the winds of strife while the sealing
 message is being proclaimed? Rev. 7:1.
     8. How intensely are the angels interested in the sealing work?
 Verses 2, 3.
     NOTE.—"I saw four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and
 were on their way to accomplish it. Jesus was clothed with priestly
 garments. He gazed in pity on the remnant, then raised His hands, and
 with a voice of deep pity cried, 'My blood, Father, My blood, My blood,
 My blood!' Then I saw an exceeding bright light come from God, who
 sat upon the great white throne, and was shed all about Jesus. Then I
 saw an angel with a commission from Jesus, swiftly flying to the four
 angels who had a work to do on the earth, and waving something up and
  down in his hand, and crying with a. loud voice, "Hold! Hold! Hold!
  Hold! until the servants of God are sealed in their foreheads.'
      "I asked my accompanying angel the meaning of what I heard, and
  what the four angels were about to do. He said to me that it was God
  that restrained the powers, and that He gave His angels charge over
  things on the earth; that the four angels had power from God to hold
  the four winds, and that they were about to let them go ; but while their
  bands were loosening, and the four winds were about to blow, the mer-
  ciful eye. of Jesus gazed on the remnant, that were not sealed, and He
  raised His hands, to the Father, and pleaded with Him that He had
  spilled His blood for them. Then another angel was commissioned to
  fly swiftly to the four angels, and bid them hold, until the servants of
                                    [ 27 ]

           -..."
            at mighty being will join the "third angel" in the last warn-
       a/man and lighten the earth with his glory? Rev. 18:1, 2.
       ,
     NOTE.—"I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, descending
pt,the earth, and again ascending to heaven, preparing for the fulfill-
ment of some important event. Then I saw another mighty angel com-
 missioned to descend to the earth, to unite his voice with the third
angel, and give power and force to his message. Great power and glory
were imparted to the angel, and as he descended, the earth was lightened
with his glory. . .
     "Angels were sent to aid the mighty angel from heaven, and I heard
voices which seemed to sound everywhere, 'Come out of her, My people,
 that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
 plaghes; for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remem-
 bered her iniquities!"—Id., p. 277.
     10. How is the sealing work described by the prophet? Eze. 9:1-7.
     11. What did the prophet see the angel reporting, who was sent to
"set a mark upon the foreheads" of men? Verse 11.
          E.—An angel has never failed to do a work given him of God.
   he Bib         rds no instance of an angel unable to perform a mission
 i.iven him by'lliklr-Heayen. On one occasion, a king "withstood" an
(g
angel for three weeks, and-Michael,Himself (Christ) "came to help"
 the angel( Dan-10 1.2, 13. When a Wark•is liven to a heaverily angel,
 it will be•doiie, even if all heaven has to join him- to,do it./The angel
with-the inkhorn will finish his work. The third angel's hiessage.move-
mient cannot fail ; it is in charge of an angel.
     "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven. An angel with a writ-
er's inkhorn by his side returned from the earth, and reported to Jesus
 that his work was done, and the saints were numbered and sealed. Then
 I saw Jesus, who had been ministering before the ark containing the
 Ten Commandments, throw down the censer. He raised His hands, and
 with a loud voice said, 'It is done.' "—Id., p. 279.
    12. When the gospel work is finished and the angels cease to hold
in check the "four winds," what will come?
    NOTE.—"When He [Jesus] leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers
the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must
live, in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The restraint
which has been upon the wicked is removed, and Satan has entire con-
trol of the finally impenitent. God's long-suffering has ended. The
world has rejected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon
His law. The wicked have passed the boundary of their probation; the
Spirit of God persistently resisted, has been at last withdrawn. Un-
sheltered by divine grace, they have no protection from the wicked one.
Satan will then plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one great, final
trouble. As the angels of God cease to hold in check the fierce winds of
human passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose. The whole
world will be involved in ruin more terrible than that which came upon
Jerusalem of old."—"The Great Controversy," p. 614.

twinkling of an eye.' At the voice of God they were glorified; now they
are made immortal, and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their
Lord in the air. Angels 'gather together the elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other.' Little children are borne by holy
angels to their mothers' arms. Friends long separated by death are
united, nevermore to part, and with songs of gladness ascend together
to the city of God."—"The Great Controversy," p. 645.
    6. Where are the saved taken? 1 Thess. 4:16.
    NOTE.—"On each side of the cloudy chariot are wings, and beneath it

and the wings, as they move, cry, 'Holy,' and the retinue of angels cry,
`Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.' And the redeemed shout 'Alle-
luia!' as the chariot moves onward toward the New Jerusalem."—Ibid.

      11. What then comes to pass? Verses 19, 20.
     12.    en Peter. was imprisoned by Herod, how did 'an angel prove
 a messe ger of mercy? Acts 12:7;10.                         1
               ty
     13.    whom did this same angel soon after come as a messenger of
 wrath. Verses 20-23.
     NoKE.—"But suddenly a terrible change came over--him. His face
 became pallid as death, and distorted with agony. Great drops of sweat
 started from pores. He stood for a moment as if transfixed with
 pain and terror; then turninghis blanch9storid livid face to his horror-
 stricken friends, he crre<in hollow,,despairing tones, He whom you
 have exalted as a god is strickenwith death.. . .
     "The same angel who halconeft:ov  .....the royal courts to rescue Peter,
 had been the messenger,o-f-wrath and j1 went to Herod. The angel
 smote Peter to aroloe-him from slumber: it v7.7as-wlth a different stroke
 that he smote the-wicked king; laying low his pride;and bringing upon
 him the punishment of the Almighty. Herod died in great agony of
 mind and b6dy, under the retributive judgment of God."—"The Acts
 of the Apostles," pp. 151, 152.
      14. What terrible visitation will be meted out to impenitent sinnern
  by angels? Rev. 15:1; 16:1.
      NOTE.—Heavenly angels are both ministers of mercy and messengers
  of wrath. In the final harvest of earth, they will both reap the saved
- of the ages for the garner of God and gather the tares to be burned.
  Blessed is the man who may be smitten by an angel as was Peter (Acts
  12:7) rather than be smitten as was Herod (Acts 12:23).
     15. After the ascension to heaven with the saints, how will the angels
 participate in the "welcome home" service?
     NOTE.—"Then I saw a very great number of angels bring from the
 city glorious crowns,—a crown for every saint, with his name written
 thereon. As Jesus called for the crowns, angels presented them to Him,
 and with His own right hand the lovely Jesus placed the crowns on the
 heads of the saints. In the same manner the angels brought the harps,
 and Jesus presented them also to the saints. The commanding angels
 first struck the note, and then every voice was raised in grateful, happy
 praise, and every hand skillfully swept over the strings of the harp,
 sending forth melodious music in rich and perfect strains."—"Early
 Writings," p. 288.
