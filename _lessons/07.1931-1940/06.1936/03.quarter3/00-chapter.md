                  THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
    Three years ago when a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering was given to
the Inter-American Division, the overflow amounted to only $1,093.89,
which was the smallest overflow to this field for many years. It is hoped
that on September 26, the hearts of our people will be touched to give
liberally of their means to this needy neighbor mission field. We have
529 churches in this division, with a membership of 26,741. Our Sabbath
schools number 948, and have a membership of 39,434, showing that
there is a keen interest in our Sabbath school work there. Great progress
has been made in this field during recent years in winning souls to the
Master, and every dollar given on the thirteenth Sabbath will help
continue this work.
    Plan definitely to place a certain amount each week in your Thir-
.eenth Sabbath Offering envelope. Let everyone endeavor to make
this Thirteenth Sabbath, Dollar Day. Remember that when the Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering reaches $60,000, $1,000 of the amount will be con-
sidered an "overflow" to the Inter-American Division. In addition, 10
per cent of the excess above $60,000 will be added to the overflow.
    As will be seen by the map, the Inter-American Division covers a
large territory. When the missions talk is given each week in your
school, a glance at the map will show to what country or island reference
is being made.

                  Jesus Comforts His Disciples
LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 14.
MEMORY VERSE: "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the
   world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
   afraid." John 14:27.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 662-672; "The Acts of the Apostles,"
   pp. 21-24.
PLACE: Jesus and His disciples were still in a guest chamber in Jerusalem where
   they had eaten the Passover, and the ordinances of the Lord's house had been
   instituted.
PERSONS: Jesus and the eleven.

                  "I Go to Prepare a Place for You"
    1. What statement had Jesus made to the disciples which caused
them sorrow of heart? John 13:33.
    NOTE.—"There cannot be doubt, that the first discourse was spoken while
at the supper table. It connects itself closely with that statement which had
caused them [the disciples] so much sorrow and perplexity, that, whither He
was going, they could not come; . . . the two great elements in the discourse
being: teaching and comfort."—"Life and Times of Jesus," Edersheim, p. 513.
    "The disciples could not rejoice when they heard this. Fear fell upon them.
They pressed close about the Saviour. Their Master and Lord, their beloved
Teacher and Friend, He was dearer to them than life. To Him they had looked
for help in all their difficulties, for comfort in their sorrows and disappoint-
ments. Now He was to leave them, a lonely, dependent company. Dark were
the forebodings that filled their hearts."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 662.
   2. With what words of assurance and promise did Jesus seek to
comfort His disciples? John 14:1-4.
                     Two Disciples Ask Questions
    3. What question did Thomas ask? What vital truths did Jesus set
forth in His reply? Verses 5-7.
    NOTE.—"There are not many ways to heaven. Each one may not choose
his own way. . . . He is the way by which alone we can have access to God."
—Id., p. 663.
                                       [3]
    4. What truth concerning his Master had Philip not yet understood?
How did Jesus gently reprove him? How did Jesus try to show that they
could know the Father only by knowing the Son? Verses 8-11; Heb. 1:1-3.
    NOTE.—"Christ had not ceased to be God when He became man. Though
He had humbled Himself to humanity, the Godhead was still His own. Christ
alone could represent the Father to humanity, and this representation the
disciples had been privileged to behold for over three years. . . . Their faith
might safely rest on the evidence given in Christ's works, works that no man,
of himself, ever had done, or ever could do. Christ's works testified to His
divinity. Through Him the Father had been revealed."—Id., pp. 663, 664.
     5. What did Jesus say those who believe in Him will do? What assur-
 ance did He give them? What will those do who love Him? John 14:12-15;
    NorE.—"By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work would be of
a more exalted character than His, but that it would have greater extent. He.
did not refer merely to miracle-working, but to all that would take place under
the working of the Holy Spirit. After the Lord's ascension, the disciples realized
 the fulfillment of His promise. . . .
    "The Saviour's promise to His disciples is a promise to His church to the
end of time. God did not design that His wonderful plan to redeem men
should achieve only insignificant results. All who will go to work, trusting
 not in what they themselves can do, but in what God can do for and through
them, will certainly realize the fulfillment of His promise. . . .
    "To pray in Christ's name means much. It means that we are to accept
His character, manifest His spirit, and work His works."—Id., pp. 664-668.
                 The Promise of Another Comforter
     6. What request would Jesus make of the Father? How long will this
other Comforter remain with believers? How intimate is His association
with them? Verses 16, 17.
     NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity,
Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest
that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on
earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his location or his
personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible
to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended
on high."—Id., p. 669.
     7. Though leaving His disciples, what did Jesus promise them? What
 does faith enable the believer to experience in personal relationship
with Jesus? Verses 18-20.
     8. How is true love for Jesus proved? What promise is given to those
who so love Him? Verse 21.
     9. What question was asked by one of the disciples? What did Jesus
say in reply? Verses 22-24.
     10. For what purpose did Jesus tell these things to the disciples while
He was still with them? Verses 25, 29; 13:19.
     11. What did Jesus say the Comforter, or Holy Spirit, would be able
-to do for His people? John 14:26.
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He [Jesus] could
solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was to
                                      [4]
be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would
have been of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries,
and the submission of men to this satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be
resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person of
the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness
of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought
out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure.
Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature.
Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and
cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His
church."—Id., p. 671.
                                    Peace
    12. What does Jesus give to every true believer? What words did He
repeat? Verse 27.
    13. To what did Jesus again refer? What spirit might the disciples
have shown that would have been pleasing to Him? Verse 28.
    14. After that evening, why could not Jesus talk much more with the
eleven? Verse 30.
    NOTE.-" 'Hath nothing in Me.' There is in Me no principle or feeling that
accords with his, and nothing, therefore by which he can prevail."—Barnes.
    15. What would even the world know by the experiences through
which Jesus was to pass? What did He then say to the disciples? Before
leaving the upper room, what did they do? Verse 31; Matt. 26:30, margin.
    NoTE.—"Before leaving the upper chamber, the Saviour led His disciples
in a song of praise. His voice was heard, not in the strains of some mournful
lament, but in the joyful notes of the Passover halle1:—
               " '0 praise the Lord, all ye nations;
                  Praise Him all ye people.
                  For His merciful kindness is great toward us,
                  And the truth of the Lord endureth forever.
                  Praise ye the Lord'
    "After the hymn, they went out. Through the crowded streets they made
their way, passing out of the city gate toward the Mount of Olives. Slowly
they proceeded, each busy with his own thoughts."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 672.
                       THINE ON THESE THINGS
   Reasons for not being troubled in mind.
   The proof of love for Jesus.
   What the Holy Spirit can do for me.

  The Vine and the Branches; Jesus' Last Prayer
               With His Disciples
LESSON SCRIPTURES: John 15:1-15; 17.
MEMORY VERSE: "I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me,
   and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for severed from Me ye can do
   nothing." John 15:5, margin.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 674-680.
PLACE: On the way from the upper chamber in Jerusalem where the Passover was
   eaten to the Garden of Gethsemane.
PERSONS: Jesus and the eleven.

                        A Lesson From the Vine
     1. Looking upon a grapevine by the wayside, what did Jesus say of
Himself? Of His Father? Who are the branches? John 15:1, 5, first part.
    NOTE.—"Jesus and the disciples were on the way to Gethsemane, at the
foot of Mount Olivet, a retired spot which He had often visited for meditation
and prayer. The Saviour had been explaining to His disciples His mission to
the world, and the spiritual relation to Him which they were to sustain. Now
He illustrates the lesson. The moon is shining bright, and reveals to Him a
flourishing grapevine. Drawing the attention of the disciples to it, He employs
it as a symbol."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 674.
    2. What is done with every unfruitful branch? With every fruitful one?
Upon what conditions may one bear the fruits of a Christian experience?
Verses 2-5.
    NOTE.—The Greek adjective here translated "clean" has the same root as
the Greek verb translated "purge" or "prune" in the previous verse.
    3. If one abides not in Christ, what is the sure result? What unlimited
possibilities are attainable by abiding in Him? How may we best glorify
the Father? Verses 6-8.
    NoTE.—"From the chosen twelve who had followed Jesus, one as a withered
branch was about to be taken away, the rest were to pass under the pruning
knife of bitter trial. Jesus with solemn tenderness explained the purpose of
the husbandman. The pruning will cause pain, but it is the Father who applies
the knife. He works with no wanton hand or indifferent heart. There are
branches trailing upon the ground; these must be cut loose from the earthly
supports to which their tendrils are fastening. They are to reach heavenward,
and find their support in God. The excessive foliage that draws away the life
current from the fruit, must be pruned off. The overgrowth must be cut out,
to give room for the healing beams of the Sun of Righteousness. The hus-
bandman prunes away the harmful growth, that the fruit may be richer and
more abundant."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 677..
                            Great Love for Us
   4. How does Jesus state His love for us? How only may we abide in
His love? Verses 9, 10,
                                      [6 1
    NOTE.—"You are just as dependent upon Christ, in order to live a holy life,
as is the branch upon the parent stock for growth and fruitfulness. Apart from
Him you have no life. You have no power to resist temptation or to grow in
grace and holiness. Abiding in Him, you may flourish. Drawing your life from
Him, you will not wither nor be fruitless. You will be like a tree planted by
the rivers of water.
    "Many have an idea that they must do some part of the work alone. They
have trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sin, but now they seek by their
own efforts to live aright. But every such effort must fail. Jesus says, 'Without
Me ye can do nothing.' Our growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness,—all
depend upon our union with Christ. ,It is by communion with Him, daily,
hourly,—by abiding in Him,—that we are to grow in grace. He is not only the
author but the finisher of our faith. It is Christ first and last and always. He
is to be with us, not only at the beginning and the end of our course, but at
every step of the way."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 73,74.
                           Closing Instruction
   5. Why did Jesus' tell His disciples these things? What command-
ment did Jesus then give? What is the greatest proof a person can give
of his love for another? Verses 11-13.
   Nom.—"The joy of seeing souls redeemed, souls eternally saved, is the re-
ward of all that put their feet in the footprints of Him who said, 'Follow Me.' "
"The Desire of Ages," p. 523. It was for this joy that Jesus "endured the cross,
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Heb. 12:2. It is this joy that will enable the child of God now to endure hard-
ness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
   6. What contrast did Jesus make between a servant and a friend?
Verses 14, 15.
   7. What were the closing words of His talk with the disciples? John
16:33.
                                Jesus Prays
    8. After ending His instruction to the eleven, what did Jesus do?
What were the opening words of His prayer? John 17:1.
    NOTE.—The Son of God is addressing His Father and our Father. Divinity
in humanity is pleading with divinity for humanity. No other such prayer can
be found upon record. It is the outbreathing of divine love for Christ's own
in a sinful world. Ponder the prayer. Become familiar with its words. Every
sentence is full of divine meaning. Let it become Jesus' prayer for you.
    9. What power had been given to the Son of God? For what purpose?
What is eternal life? Verses 2, 3.
    10. What did Jesus say of His loyalty to His Father? What only did
He ask for Himself? (Verse 5) Verses 4-8.
    NOTE.—"Man cannot show greater weakness than by allowing men to
ascribe to him the honor for gifts that are Heaven-bestowed. The true Chris-
tian will make God first and last and best in everything. No ambitious motives
will chill his love for God; steadily, perseveringly will he cause honor to
redound to his heavenly Father. It is when we are faithful in exalting the name
of God that our impulses are under divine supervision, and we are enabled to
develop spiritual and intellectual power."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 68, 69.
                                      [7 ]
    11. For whom did Jesus pray? What did He especially request for
the believers? What reference did He make to Judas Iscariot? Verses
9-12.
    12. What had Jesus given to His disciples? How would the world
continue to regard them? For what reason? Verses 13, 14.
    13. For what did Jesus not pray? From what did He desire His dis-
ciples to be kept? Verses 15, 16.
    14. Through what were His followers to be sanctified? What had
Jesus Himself done? For whom else, besides those present, did Jesus
pray? Verses 17-20.
    15. What would be the effect of complete oneness among believers?
Verses 21-23.
    NOTE.—"It is the will of God that union and brotherly love should exist
among His people. The prayer of Christ just before His crucifixion was that
His disciples might be one as He is one with the Father, that the world might
believe that God had sent Him. This most touching and wonderful prayer
reaches down the ages, even to our day. . . . While we are not to sacrifice
one principle of truth, it should be our constant aim to reach this state of
unity. This is the evidence of our discipleship."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 520.
    16. What did Jesus desire His beloved ones to behold? Who has not
known the Father? Who has known Him? What will Jesus continue to
do? Verses 24-26.
    NOTE.—"All that man needs to know or can know of God has been re-
vealed in the life and character of His Son. . . .
    "Taking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with humanity, and
at the same time to reveal our heavenly Father to sinful human beings. He
was in all things made like unto His brethren. He became flesh, even as we
are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained by food and
refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of men, and yet He was the blameless
Son of God. He was a stranger and sojourner on the earth,—in the world,
but not of the world; tempted and tried as men and women today are tempted
and tried, yet living a life free from sin.
    "Tender, compassionate, sympathetic, ever considerate of others, He repre-
sented the character of God, and was constantly engaged in service for God and
man."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 286.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
   The source and results of a fruitful life.
   The end of a life apart from Christ.
   Loyalty to Jesus.
   Loyalty to our fellow men.

   "Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of prayer
and the study of the Bible, the tempted one cannot readily remember God's
promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are round
about those who are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of
great necessity, they will bring to their remembrance the very truths which
are needed."—"The Great Controversy," p. 600.

                 In the Garden of Gethsemane
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matthew 26:36-56; Mark 14:32-52; Luke 22:39-53;
   John 18:1-12.
MEMORY VERSE: "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
   indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." Matt. 26:41.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 685-697.
PLACE: The Garden of Gethsemane, about three fourths of a mile east of the wall
   of Jerusalem, and across the brook Kedron, near the foot of Mount Olivet. A
   place where Jesus was accustomed to go with His disciples for prayer and for
   giving instruction.
PERSONS: Jesus and the eleven; Judas with the soldiers and a mob; an unnamed
   young man,

        Jesus, Peter, James, and John Enter the Garden
    1. After Jesus had prayed with His disciples, where did they then go?
John 18:1.
    2. What did Jesus say to them? Who were privileged to go with Him
farther into the garden? What were His feelings at the time? What did
He ask the three disciples who were with Him to do? Matt. 26:36-38.
    NOTE.—"In company with His disciples, the Saviour slowly made His way
to the Garden of Gethsemane. The Passover moon, broad and full, shone from
a cloudless sky. The city of pilgrims' tents was hushed into silence.
    "Jesus had been earnestly conversing with His disciples and instructing
them; but as He neared Gethsemane, He became strangely silent. . . . So
dreadful does sin appear to Him, so great is the weight of guilt which He must
bear, that He is tempted to fear it will shut Him out forever from His Father's
love. Feeling how terrible is the wrath of God against transgression, He ex-
claims, 'My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.'
    "As they approached the garden, the disciples had marked the,change that
came over their Master. Never before had they seen Him so utterly sad and
silent. As He proceeded, this strange sadness deepened; yet they dared not
question Him as to the cause. His form swayed as if He were about to fall.
Upon reaching the garden, the disciples looked anxiously for His usual place
of retirement, that their Master might rest. Every step that He now took
was with labored effort. He groaned aloud, as if suffering under the pressure of
a terrible burden. Twice His companions supported Him, or He would have
fallen to the earth.
    "Near the entrance to the garden, Jesus left all but three of the disciples,
bidding them pray for themselves and for Him. With Peter, James, and John,
He entered its secluded recesses. These three disciples were Christ's closest com-
 panions. They had beheld His glory on the mount of transfiguration; they
had seen Moses and Elijah talking with Him; they had heard the voice from
heaven; now in His great struggle, Christ desired their presence near Him."—
"The Desire of Ages," pp. 685, 686.
                                      [9]
                 Jesus Prayed—The Disciples Slept
    3. Having gone a little distance from them, what did Jesus then do?
Repeat the words of His prayer? Verse 39.
    4. On returning to the three disciples, what did Jesus find? What
question did He ask Peter? Verse 40.
    NorE.—"The human heart longs for sympathy in suffering. This longing
Christ felt to the very depths of His being. In the supreme agony of His soul
He came to His disciples with a yearning desire to hear some words of comfort
from those whom He had so often blessed and comforted, and shielded in
sorrow and distress. The One who had always had words of sympathy for
them was now suffering superhuman agony, and He longed to know that they
were praying for Him and for themselves. How dark seemed the malignity
of sin. Terrible was the temptation to let the human race bear the consequences
of its own guilt, while He stood innocent before God. If He could only know
that His disciples understood and appreciated this, He would be strengthened.
Rising with painful effort, He staggered to the place where He had left His
companions. But He 'findeth them asleep' Had He found them praying, He
would have been relieved."—Id., pp. 687, 688.
    5. What tender admonition did Jesus give? How did He seek to
excuse His disciples? Verse 41.
    NOTE.—"The weakness of His disciples awakened the sympathy of Jesus.
He feared that they would not be able to endure the test which would come
upon them in His betrayal and death. . . . Even in His great agony, He was
seeking to excuse their weakness."—Id., p. 689.
    6. Leaving His disciples a second time, what did Jesus pray? Re-
turning to them again, in what condition did He find them? Verses
42, 43.
    7. What did the Saviour do the third time? With what intensity did
He pray? How was He strengthened? Verse 44; Luke 22:41-44.
    NoTE.—"God suffered with His Son. Angels beheld the Saviour's agony.
They saw their Lord enclosed by legions of Satanic forces. His nature weighed
down with a shuddering, mysterious dread. There was silence in heaven. No
harp was touched. Could mortals have viewed the amazement of the angelic
host as in silent grief they watched the Father separating His beams of light,
love, and glory from His beloved Son, they would better understand how
offensive in His sight is sin.
    "The worlds unfallen and the heavenly angels had watched with intense
interest as the conflict drew to its close. Satan and his confederacy of evil, the
legions of apostasy, watched intently this great crisis in the work of redemp-
tion. The powers of good and evil waited to see what answer would come to
Christ's thrice-repeated prayer. Angels had longed to bring relief to the divine
sufferer, but this might not be. No way of escape was found for the Son of
God. In this awful crisis, when everything was at stake, when the mysterious
cup trembled in the hand of the sufferer, the heavens opened, a light shone
forth amid the stormy darkness of the crisis hour, and the mighty angel who
stands in God's presence, occupying the positionmro which Satan fell, came
to the side of Christ. The angel came not to take the cup from Christ's hand,
but to strengthen Him to drink it, with the assurance of the Father's love."
—Id., p. 693.
  8. Returning to the disciples. what did He say to them? What was
about to take place? What did He bid them do? Matt. 26:45, 46.

                       Judas and a Mob Appear
  9. While Jesus was thus speaking, who came into His presence?
Who were with him? Verse 47.
  10. What sign and direction did Judas give the multitude? Verse 48.
                           Jesus Stepped Forth
   11. Knowing all that was to come to pass, what did Jesus ask as He
stepped forth? How did the mob reply? What direct answer did Jesus
make? Who stood with the mob? John 18:4, 5.
                        Divine Glory Manifested
    12. What occurred when Jesus said, "I am He"? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—"No traces of His recent agony were visible as Jesus stepped forth
to meet His betrayer. Standing in advance of His disciples, He said, 'Whom
seek ye?' They answered, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus replied, 'I am He.' As
these words were spoken, the angel who had lately ministered to Jesus, moved
between Him and the mob. A divine light illuminated the Saviour's face, and
a dovelike form overshadowed Him. In the presence of this divine glory, the
murderous throng could not stand for a moment. They staggered back. Priests,
elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to the ground.
    "The angel withdrew, and the light faded away. Jesus had opportunity to
escape, but He remained, calm and self-possessed. As one glorified He stood
in the midst of that hardened band, now prostrate and helpless at His feet.
The disciples looked on, silent with wonder and awe."—Id., p. 694.
                       A Repeated Conversation
   13. When the mob recovered itself, what question did Jesus again"'
ask? What the reply? How does Jesus reveal His anxiety and love for
His disciples? Verses 7, 8.
    14. What shows that Judas did not forget the part he was to act?
Matt. 26:49.
    15. What did Jesus say to Judas? Verse 50; Luke 22:48.
   NOTE.—"The mob grew bold as they saw Judas touch the person of Him
who had so recently been glorified before their eyes. They now laid hold of
Jesus, and proceeded to bind those precious hands that had ever been employed
in doing good. The disciples had thought that their Master would not suffer
Himself to be taken. For the same power that had caused the mob to fall as
dead men could keep them helpless, until Jesus and His companions should
escape. They were disappointed and indignant as they saw the cords brought
forward to bind the hands of Him whom they loved."—Id., p. 696.
                          Peter Drew His Sword
      16. How did Peter think to defend His Master? What did Jesus say
 to him for this rash act? What did Jesus do? Luke 22:49-51; Matt. 26:52.
      NOTE.—The import of the words, "Suffer ye thus far," spoken to His cap-
 tors, seems to be, "Bear with Me a little till I correct this error." The officers
 were already laying hands upon Him; but He would have them desist a little,
 till He did one more deed of mercy. Sublime nobility of love that could put
 forth a hand to heal the the wound of an enemy, the very hand so soon to be
 pierced. Dark and dead must have been the souls of men who could remain
 unmoved by so divine a deed.

   17. If Jesus so desired, in what manner could He have obtained pro-
tection? Why could He not ask to be delivered from His enemies? Matt.
26:53, 54.
                          A Prophecy Fulfilled
    18. What did Jesus now say to the multitude? What reason did He
give as to why He permitted Himself to be taken? What did the disciples
now do? Verses 55, 56.
   NozE.—"The disciples were terrified as they saw Jesus permit Himself to
be taken and bound. They were offended that He should suffer this humilia-
tion to Himself and them. They could not understand His conduct, and they
blamed Him for submitting to the mob. In their indignation and fear, Peter
proposed that they save themselves. Following this suggestion, 'they all for-
sook Him, and fled.' But Christ had foretold this desertion."—Id., p. 697.

   The need of watching and praying against temptation.
   Resignation in prayer.

     Jesus Before the High Priest; Peter's Denial
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matthew 26:57-75; Mark 14:53-72; Luke 22:54-71;
   John 18:12-27.
MEMORY VERSE: "He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows, and
   acquainted with grief." Isa. 53:3.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 698-715.
PLACE: From Gethsemane to the home of Annas, thence to the judgment hall of
   Caiaphas, the high priest.
PERSONS: Jesus; John; Peter; Annas, the ex-high priest; Caiaphas, the high
   priest; the council (Sanhedrin); witnesses; onlookers; guards; servants.

                     Jesus Taken Before Officials
    1. After Jesus was arrested in Gethsemane, where was He taken?
John 18:12-14.
    NoTE.—Reading the record as given by each of the four evangelists, we
learn that after Jesus was bound by His captors, He was first taken to the
home of Annas, the former high priest, a man much respected by the Jews.
Still bound, Annas sent Him to Caiaphas, son-in-law of Annas, who was then
high priest. Caiaphas is identified (John 11:49-52) as the high priest who had
spoken in a council saying with reference to Jesus, "It is expedient for us, that
one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."
    2. Where was Jesus next taken? Who were assembled at the house
of Caiaphas? Verse 24; Matt. 26:57.
                                     [ 121
                         Peter and John Arrive
    3. What did Peter and another disciple do? John 18:15, 16.
    NOTE.—"After deserting their Master in the garden, two of the disciples
had ventured to follow, at a distance, the mob that had Jesus in charge. These
disciples were Peter and John. The priests recognized John as a well-known
disciple of Jesus, and admitted him to the hall, hoping that as he witnessed the
humiliation of his leader, he would scorn the idea of such a one being the Son
of God. John spoke in favor of Peter, and gained an entrance for him also.
    "In the court a fire had been kindled; for it was the coldest hour of foie
night, being just before the dawn. A company drew about the fire, and Peter
presumptuously took his place with them. He did not wish to be recognized
as a disciple of Jesus. By mingling carelessly with the crowd, he hoped to be
taken for one of those who had brought Jesus to the hall."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 710.
                             False Witnesses
    4. What did the council deliberately endeavor to secure? With what
purpose in mind? How successful were they? Mark 14:55-59; Matt.
26:59-61.
    NoTE.—"Early in His ministry Christ had said, 'Destroy this temple, and
in three days I will raise it up.' In the figurative language of prophecy, He had
thus foretold His own death and resurrection. 'He spake of the temple of His
body.' These words the Jews had understood in a literal sense, as referring to
the temple at Jerusalem. Of all that Christ had said, the priests could find
nothing to use against Him save this. By misstating these words they hoped
to gain an advantage. The Romans had engaged in rebuilding and embellishing
the temple, and they took great pride in it; any contempt shown to it would
be sure to excite their indignation. -Here Romans and Jews, Pharisees and
Sadducees, could meet; for all held the temple in great veneration. On this
point two witnesses were found whose testimony was not so contradictory as
that of the others had been. One of them, who had been bribed to accuse Jesus,
declared, 'This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to
build it in three days' Thus Christ's words were misstated. If they had been
reported exactly as He spoke them, they would not have secured His condem-
nation even by the Sanhedrin."—Id., pp. 705,706.
                         Jesus Declares Himself
    5. What did the high priest ask Jesus? When Jesus did not reply,
how did the high priest solemnly adjure Him? What answer did Jesus
then make? Matt. 26:62-64.
    NOTE.—When asked directly by the proper person to declare His identity,
Jesus did not hesitate to answer. His words, "Thou hast said," are equivalent
to an affirmative answer, as when He used the same expression in answering
Judas in verse 25.
    "Every ear was bent to listen, and every eye was fixed on His face as He
answered, 'Thou hast said.' A heavenly light seemed to illuminate His pale
countenance as He added, "Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see
the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
heaven.'
    "For a moment the divinity of Christ flashed through His guise of human-
ity. The high priest quailed before the penetrating eyes of the Saviour. That
look seemed to read his hidden thoughts, and burn into his heart. Never in
                                     [ 13 1
afterlife did he forget that searching glance of the persecuted Son of God."
—Id., p. 707. •
                           A Decision Reached
   6. What did the high priest then do to show his pretended indigna-
tion? What did he say? When he pressed the council for a decision,
what was the verdict? Matt. 26:65, 66.
   NOTE.—According to Jewish law, as cited in the "Cambridge Bible for
Schools and Colleges," "the penalty for procuring false witnesses was death."
Other violations of thse rules were, "the trial by night, the sentence on the first
day of trial, the trial of a capital charge on the day before the Sabbath, the
suborning of witnesses, the direct interrogation by the high priest."
   "A high priest was not to rend his garments. By the Levitical law, this was
prohibited under sentence of death. Under no circumstances, on no occasion,
was the priest to rend his robe. It was the custom among the Jews for the
garments to be rent at the death of friends, but this custom the priests were
not to observe. Express command had been given by Christ to Moses con-
cerning this."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 708,709.
                           Insult and Mockery
    7. What cruel treatment did Jesus then receive? Verses 67, 68.
   NOTE.—"The Saviour was now treated as a condemned criminal, and given
up to be abused by the lowest and vilest of humankind. The palace of the high
priest surrounded an open court in which the soldiers and the multitude had
gathered. Through this court, Jesus was taken to the guardroom, on every side
meeting with mockery of His claim to be the Son of God."—Id., p. 710.

                            Peter Denies Jesus
   8. What did the damsel who kept the door say to Peter as he entered
the court of the palace? How did Peter reply? John 18:17.
   9. With whom did Peter mingle as he stood near the fire? Verse 18.
    10. What did another maid remark about Peter when she saw him
in the porch? How did Peter seek to strengthen his denial? Matt. 26:71, 72.
    11. What did bystanders say to Peter a little later? Who among the
servants had seen Peter in the garden? Matt. 26:73; John 18:25, 26.
    12. With what emphasis did Peter deny his Lord a third time? What
happened immediately? Matt. 26:74.
    13. What words did Peter now recall? What did he do? Verse 75,
first part; Luke 22:61, 62.
    NoTE.—"While the degrading oaths were fresh upon Peter's lips, and the
shrill crowing of the cock was still ringing in his ears, the Saviour turned from
the frowning judges, and looked full upon His poor disciple. At the same
time Peter's eyes were drawn to his Master. In that gentle countenance he
read deep pity and sorrow, but there was no anger there. The sight of that
pale, suffering face, those quivering lips, that look of compassion and for-
giveness, pierced his heart like an arrow. . . . He reflected with horror upon
his own ingratitude, his falsehood, his perjury. Once more he looked at his
Master, and saw a sacrilegious hand raised to smite Him in the face. Unable
longer to endure the scene, he rushed, heartbroken, from the hall. He pressed
on in solitude and darkness, he knew not and cared not whither. At last he
                                      [ 14 ]
found himself in Gethsemane. . . . On the very spot where Jesus had poured
out His soul in agony to His Father, Peter fell upon his face, and wished that
he might die. It was in sleeping when Jesus bade him watch and pray that
Peter had prepared the way for his great sin."—Id., pp. 712, 713.
                       THINK ON THESE THINGS
   The danger in these days of denying Jesus in word or act.
                     "And now, though ages intervene,
                      Sin is the same, while time and scene
                            Are shifted.
                     "For all at last the cock will crow
                      Who hear the warning voice, but go
                            Unheeding,
                     "Till thrice and more they have denied
                      The Man of Sorrows, crucified
                             And bleeding."

 Jesus Before the Sanhedrin; Jesus Before Pilate:
               The Death of Judas
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 22:66 to 23:3; Matthew 27:1-14; John 18:28-38;
   Mark 15:1-5.
MEMORY VERSE: "Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth."
   1 Peter 2:22.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 716-728.
PLACES: Before the Sanhedrin; in the house of Caiaphas; Pilate's judgment hall.
PERSONS: Jesus; the chief priests and members of the Sanhedrin; Judas, the traitor;
   Pilate, the Roman governor; the multitude.

                    Jesus Before the High Council
    1. As soon as day dawned after the night when Jesus was taken,
what was done with Him? Luke 22:66.
    NOTE.—The beginning of this lesson seems to have been a formal meeting
of the Sanhedrin, the council highest in authority among the Jews. The pur-
pose of this session in the morning was no doubt that of passing the legal
sentence, and approving the acts of the previous night.
    Though the Sanhedrin could come to the decision that Jesus was worthy
of death, it had not the authority to carry out its own sentence. The leaders
therefore took counsel as to how they could present Jesus to the Roman
governor so as to secure His condemnation. Their charge against Him must
be a political one. Evidently they made the charge of conspiracy against
Caesar.
    2. What question did the Sanhedrin ask Jesus? What answer did He
give? Verse 67.
                                       [I5I
   3. What further statement did Jesus make? Verses 68, 69.
   4. What did this lead them all to ask? How did Jesus acknowledge
the truth in their question? How did the Jews regard the answer of Jesus?
Verses 70, 71.
                 Jesus Before the Roman Governor
    5. After His condemnation by the Sanhedrin, where was Jesus taken?
Luke 23:1; John 18:28.
    NorE.—"After condemning Jesus, the council of the Sanhedrin had come
to Pilate to have the sentence confirmed and executed. But these Jewish
officials would not enter the Roman judgment hall. According to their cere-
monial law they would be defiled thereby, and thus prevented from taking
part in the feast of the Passover. In their blindness they did not see that
murderous hatred had defiled their hearts. They did not see that Christ was the
real Passover lamb, and that, since they had rejected Him, the great feast had
for them lost its significance.
    "When the Saviour was brought into the judgment hall, Pilate looked upon
Him with no friendly eyes. The Roman governor had been called from his
bedchamber in haste, and he determined to do his work as quickly as possible.
He was prepared to deal with the prisoner with magisterial severity."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 723.
    6. What question did Pilate ask of those who had brought Jesus to
him? What was the reply? John 18:29, 30.
    7. What did Pilate then tell the Jews to do? What was their reply?
What statement concerning the manner of Jesus' death was thus ful-
filled? Verses 31, 32.
    NOTE.—Pilate's reply was a reminder to the Jews that they were a subject
nation. According to Jesus' own prophecy He was to be condemned to death
by the Jews, but delivered into the hands of the Gentiles to be crucified. Matt.
20:19. John referred in John 18:32 to the fulfillment of this prophecy.
    8. What accusations against Jesus were then made to Pilate? What
direct question did Pilate ask? What was the reply? Luke 23:2, 3.
    NOTE.—Jesus' answer, "Thou sayest," is similar to that used when Caiaphas
urged Him to say whether or not He was the Son of God. Matt. 26:64. It is
equivalent to an affirmative answer. Jesus could not deny that He was the Son
of God or King of the Jews.
    9. When Pilate questioned Jesus privately, what did he ask? How
did Jesus reply? John 18:33, 34.
    10. What did Pilate say had been done? What information did Jesus
give him about His kingdom? Verses 35, 36.
    11. What did Jesus say of His kingship? What query arose in Pilate's
mind? Verses 37, 38. ,
    12. How did Jesus receive the charges of the priests and elders?
What did Pilate then ask Him? When Jesus made no attempt to defend
Himself against the accusations, how was Pilate affected? Matt. 27:12-14.
                           The Fate of Judas
   13. When Judas saw that Jesus was condemned by Caiaphas and
the Sanhedrin, what did he do? Matt. 27:3.
                                      16
    14. What confession did he make? What sarcastic reply did he
receive? Verse 4.
    NorE.—"Judas reasoned that if Jesus was to be crucified, the event must
come to pass. His own act in betraying the Saviour would not change the
result. . . . Judas did not, however, believe that Christ would permit Himself
to be arrested. . . . Judas beheld the captors of Christ, acting upon his words,
bind Him firmly. In amazement he saw that the Saviour suffered Himself to
be led away. Anxiously he followed Him from the garden to the trial before
the Jewish rulers. At every movement he looked for Him to surprise His
enemies, by appearing before them as the Son of God, and setting at naught
all their plots and power. But as hour after hour went by, and Jesus sub-
mitted to all the abuse heaped upon Him, a terrible fear came to the traitor
that he had sold his Master to His death.
    "As the trial drew to a close, Judas could endure the torture of his guilty
conscience no longer. Suddenly a hoarse voice rang through the hall, sending
a thrill of terror to all hearts: He is innocent; spare Him, 0 Caiaphas!
    "The tall form of Judas was now seen pressing through the startled throng.
His face was pale and haggard, and great drops of sweat stood on his forehead.
 Rushing to the throne of judgment, he threw down before the high priest the
 pieces of silver that bad been the price of his Lord's betrayal. Eagerly grasp-
 ing the robe of Caiaphas, he implored him to release Jesus, declaring that
 He had done nothing worthy of death. Caiaphas angrily shook him off; but
 was confused, and knew not what to say. The perfidy of the priests was re-
 vealed. It was evident that they had bribed the disciple to betray his Master."
—Id., pp. 720-722.
    15. In his despair, what did Judas do? Verse 5.
   NoTE.—Several things show that the repentance of Judas was not of the
genuine kind that brings remission of sins: (1) It did not come till he saw
that Jesus was condemned—it was based on consequences, not on the sinfulness
of betrayal. (2) If the repentance had been of the right kind, he would not
have taken his own life. (3) The word "repented" used here is not the usual
one for repentance of sin, but rather denotes a growing anxiety over a thing
after it is done, and could very properly be rendered here "filled with regret
or remorse."
    16. What did the priests say about the betrayal money? Verse 6.
    Nom—This is a striking example of straining at a gnat and swallowing
a camel. Matt. 23:24. It was a matter for serious counsel what to do with
this "tainted" money,—tainted by themselves in taking it out of the Lord's
treasury and using it to bribe the betrayer of Jesus. They were mindful of the
law in not putting the price of bribery back into the treasury, but they ignored
the law in the murder of the innocent Son of God.
   17. What did the priests decide to do with the money? What name
 was given to this field set apart as a burial place for paupers, criminals,
 and unknown persons? Verses 7, 8.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
    The extremities to which wicked men will resort to gain their objective.
    The blinding influence of prejudice and hatred.
    The untimely end of an unrepentant sinner.

Jesus Before Herod; Pilate Seeks to Release Jesus
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 23:4-25; Matthew 27:15-26; John 18:39 to 19:12;
  Mark 15:6-15.
MEMORY VERSE: "He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for
  our iniquities." Isa. 53:5.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 728-740.
PLACES: Pilate's judgment hall; Herod's court; return to Pilate's hall.
PERSONS: Jesus; Pilate; Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee, then in Jerusalem; priests;
  soldiers; the mob.

           Pilate Finds No Fault: Sends Jesus to Herod
     1. After Pilate had heard the accusations and talked with Jesus
privately, what did he say to the priests and people? Luke 23:4.
    2. In response what did the Jews say of the extent of Jesus' influence?
What information did Pilate seek? Verses 5, 6.
    NOTE.—Three charges against Jesus were made before Pilate by the Jews,
and these may be summed up as follows: (1) sedition, inciting revolution;
(2) "forbidding to give tribute to Caesar," the Roman emperor; (3) claiming
to be the Son of God and the king of the Jews.
    3. To whom did Pilate send Jesus? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—The Herod here mentioned is Herod Antipas, son of Herod the
Great. He was ruler of Galilee and Perea. He was a wicked man, and one of
his greatest crimes was the beheading of John the Baptist. At the time of the
events of this lesson, he was in Jerusalem, having come to attend the Passover.
    4. What had Herod long desired? What did he now hope to see?
How did Jesus respond to Herod's questions? Verses 8, 9.
    NOTE.—Herod "ordered that the fetters of Christ should be unloosed, at
the same time charging His enemies with roughly treating Him. Looking with
compassion into the serene face of the world's Redeemer, he read in it only
wisdom and purity. He as well as Pilate was satisfied that Christ had been
accused through malice and envy.
    "Herod questioned Christ in many words, but throughout the Saviour
maintained a profound silence. At the command of the king, the decrepit and
maimed were then called in, and Christ was ordered to prove His claims by
working a miracle. Men say that Thou canst heal the sick, said Herod. I am
anxious to see that Thy widespread fame has not been belied. Jesus did not
respond."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 729.
    5. What did the chief priests and scribes continue to do? In what
cruel way was Jesus now mocked? To whom was He now sent? Verses
10, 11.
    NOTE.—"Herod promised that if Christ would perform some mirade in
his presence, He should be released. . . . He now threatened Jesus, declaring
repeatedly that he had power to release or to condemn Him. But no sign from
Jesus gave evidence that He heard a word. Herod was irritated by this
                                      [18   ]
silence. It seemed to indicate utter indifference to his authority. . . . Herod's
face grew dark with passion. Turning to the multitude, he angrily denounced
Jesus as an impostor. Then to Christ he said, If you will give no evidence of
your claim, I will deliver you up to the soldiers and the people. They may
succeed in making you speak. If you are an impostor, death at their hands is
only what you merit; if you are the Son of God, save yourself by working a
miracle.
    "No sooner were these words spoken, than a• rush was made for Christ.
Like wild beasts, the crowd darted upon their prey. Jesus was dragged this
way and that, Herod joining the mob in seeking to humiliate the Son of God.
Had not the Roman soldiers interposed, and forced back the maddened throng,
the Saviour would have been torn in pieces."—Id., pp. 730, 731.
    6. What resulted from the sending of Jesus to Herod? Verse 12.
                       Jesus Again Before Pilate
    7. How did Pilate summarize the proceedings against Jesus? What
did he offer to do to satisfy the Jews? Verses 13-16.
    NOTE.—This was the third time, twice by Pilate and once by Herod, that
Jesus had been pronounced guiltless. This position the Roman governor should
have steadfastly maintained. But Pilate was a timeserver, willing to sacrifice
principle to be popular. His next step was a compromise.
    Though one reads the story a hundred times, he wishes each time that
Pilate had proved true to his convictions and released Jesus. But he failed,
yielding truth and right little by little, and entangling himself more and
more securely in Satan's web.
    8. What was customary for the governor to do at the time of the
Passover feast? What notorious man was then a prisoner in Jerusalem?
Verse 17; Matt. 27:15, 16.
    9. What had Barabbas done? Luke 23:18, 19; John 18:40.
    NOTE.—"The Roman authorities at this time held a prisoner named Barab-
bas, who was under sentence of death. This man had claimed to be the
Messiah. He claimed authority to establish a different order of things, to set
the world right. Under satanic delusion he claimed that whatever he could
obtain by theft and robbery was his own. He had done wonderful things
through satanic agencies, he had gained a following among the people, and
had excited sedition against the Roman government. Under cover of religious
enthusiasm he was a hardened and desperate villain, bent on rebellion and
cruelty."—Id., p. 733.
    10. What choice did Pilate now give the Jews? What had he dis-
cerned about their motive in arresting Jesus? Matt. 27:17, 18.
    NOTE.—"By giving the people a choice between this man and the innocent
Saviour, Pilate thought to arouse them to a sense of justice. He hoped to gain
their sympathy for Jesus in opposition to the priests and rulers. So, turning
to the crowd, he said with great earnestness, 'Whom will ye that I release unto
you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?"—Ibid.
                    A Warning From Pilate's Wife
   11. As Pilate sat on the judgment seat, what message did his wife
send him? Verse 19.
   NOTE.—"Pilate was not left to act blindly. A message from God warned
him from the deed he was about to commit. In answer to Christ's prayer,
                                  ( 19 l
the wife of Pilate had been visited by an angel from heaven, and in a dream
she had beheld the Saviour and conversed with Him. Pilate's wife was not a
Jew, but as she looked upon Jesus in her dream, she had no doubt of His
character or mission."—Id., p. 732.
    After describing how there passed before Pilate's wife in a dream the
scenes in the judgment hall, the crucifixion, and the second coming of Christ
in glory, the author of "The Desire of Ages," continues: "With a cry of horror
she awoke, and at once wrote to Pilate words of warning. While Pilate was
hesitating as to what he should do, a messenger pressed through the crowd,
and handed him the letter from his wife, which read, 'Have thou nothing to
do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream
because of Him.' "—Ibid.
                           Christ or Barabbas
    12. What did the Jews persuade the multitude to do? What question
did Pilate ask the people? The answer? Verses 20, 21.
    13. What further question reveals Pilate's perplexity? What reply
did the people make? Verse 22.
    14. By what question did the governor show his dissatisfaction with
their purpose? What did the people persist in demanding? Verse 23.
    NoTE.—"Like the bellowing of wild beasts came the answer of the mob,
Release unto us Barabbas. Louder and louder swelled the cry, Barabbas!
Barabbas! Thinking that the people had not understood his question, Pilate
asked, 'Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?' But they cried
out again, 'Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas 1"What shall
I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?' Pilate asked. Again the surging
multitude roared like demons. Demons themselves, in human form, were in
the crowd, and what could be expected but the answer, let Him be crucified'?"
—Id., p. 733.
    15. Seeing that he could not prevail with the people, how did he
show his desire to escape from the responsibility of his act? How did
the people defiantly reply? Verses 24, 25.

                           The Final Decision
    16. What argument that the Jews presented seemed to have the
greatest weight with Pontius Pilate? John 19:12, 15.
    17. What was Pilate's final decision regarding Jesus? Matt. 27:26.
    NOTE.—"Pilate yielded to the demands of the mob. Rather than risk losing
his position, he delivered Jesus up to be crucified. But in spite of his precau-
tions, the very thing he dreaded afterward came upon him. His honors were
stripped from him, he was cast down from his high office, and, stung by re-
morse and wounded pride, not long after the crucifixion he ended his own
life. So all who compromise with sin will gain only sorrow and ruin."—
Id., p. 738.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
   The responsibility of a decision.
   The character of Herod.
   The weakness of Pilate.
   The nobility of Jesus.

  19:16-24.
MEMORY VERSE: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
  life for his friends." John 15:13.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 741-749.
PLACES: Pilate's judgment hall; on the way to Calvary; Calvary.
PERSONS: Jesus; Pontius Pilate; Roman soldiers; priests and people; Simon of
  Cyrene; two thieves, companions of Barabbas.
                    Jesus Mocked by Soldiers
   I. After Pilate gave sentence against Jesus, to what place did the
soldiers take Him? Matt. 27:27.
   NorE.—"Into the common hall," or governor's house. The whole band
gathered together to mock Jesus. He had endured six "trials": before Annas,
before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin at night, before the same body in the
morning, before Pilate, before Herod, and again before Pilate. At last, to
appease the mob, sentence was given against Him.
   2. To what mocking ceremony did the soldiers subject Jesus? How
did they further show contempt for Him? Verses 28-30.
                          Jesus and Barabbas
    3. What effort did Pilate again make to release Jesus? With what
words did he appeal to the people in behalf of Jesus? John 19:4, 5.
    NoTE.—"Pilate now sent for Barabbas to be brought into the court. He
then presented the two prisoners side by side, and pointing to the Saviour he
said in a voice of solemn entreaty, 'Behold the Man' `I bring Him forth to you,
that ye may know that I find no fault in Him.'
    "There stood the Son of God, wearing the robe of mockery and the crown
of thorns. Stripped to the waist, His back showed the long, cruel stripes, from
which the blood flowed freely. His face was stained with blood, and bore the
marks of exhaustion and pain; but never had it appeared more beautiful than
now. The Saviour's visage was not marred before His enemies. Every feature
expressed gentleness and resignation and the tenderest pity for His cruel foes.
In His manner there was no cowardly weakness, but the strength and dignity
of long-suffering. In striking contrast was the prisoner at His side. Every
line of the countenance of Barabbas proclaimed him the hardened ruffian
that he was. The contrast spoke to every beholder. Some of the spectators
 were weeping. As they looked upon Jesus, their hearts were full of sympathy.
 Even the priests and rulers were convicted that He was all that He claimed to
be."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 735.
     4. What did the chief priests still cry out? While giving sentence
 against Jesus, what statement did Pilate repeat? Verse 6.
     5. How did the Jews seek to excuse their desire to crucify Jesus?
 What effect did their words have upon Pilate? Verses 7. 8.
                                     [21   ]
                      Degree of Pilate's Power
   6. What information did he again seek from Jesus? When Jesus did
not answer, what statement did Pilate make? Verses 9, 10.
   7. What did Jesus tell Pilate concerning the power Pilate had to put
Him to death? Verse 11.
   NoTE.—Once more Pilate seeks to release Jesus. Once more he halts, waits,
hesitates, falters, fails.
                      Led Away to Be Crucified
     8. As Jesus was led away to be crucified, what burden did He bear?
Verses 16, 17.
     NoTE.—"A vast multitude followed Jesus from the judgment hall to
Calvary. The news of His condemnation had spread throughout Jerusalem,
and people of all classes and all ranks flocked toward the place of crucifixion.
. . . As Jesus passed the gate of Pilate's court, the cross which had been pre-
pared for Barabbas was laid upon His bruised and bleeding shoulders. . . .
The Saviour's burden was too heavy for Him in His weak and suffering con-
dition. . . . The crowd that followed the Saviour saw His weak and stagger-
ing steps, but they manifested no compassion. They taunted and reviled Him
because He could not carry the heavy cross. Again the burden was laid upon
Him, and again He fell fainting to the ground."—Id., pp. 741,742.
      9. When Jesus could no longer carry the cross, upon whom was it
laid? Matt. 27:32.
     NOTE.—"At this time a stranger, Simon a Cyrenian, coming in from the
country, meets the throng. He hears the taunts and ribaldry of the crowd; he
hears the words contemptuously repeated, Make way for the King of the
Jews. He stops in astonishment at the scene; and as he expresses his compas-
sion, they seize him and place the cross upon his shoulders.
     "Simon had heard of Jesus. His sons were believers in the Saviour, but he
himself was not a disciple. The bearing of the cross to Calvary was a blessing
to Simon, and he •was ever after grateful for this providence. It led him to
take upon himself the cross of Christ from choice, and ever cheerfully stand
beneath its burden."—Id., p. 742.
      10. What companions of Barabbas were led along with Jesus to
 crucifixion? Luke 23:32.
      NOTE.—"Two companions of Barabbas were to suffer death at the same
 time with Jesus, and upon them also crosses were placed."—/d., p. 741.
      11. Who followed Jesus on the way to the cross? What did Jesus
say of their weeping? Verses 27-31.
      NOTE. `By the green tree, Jesus represented Himself, the innocent Re-
deemer. God suffered His wrath against transgression to fall on His beloved
Son. Jesus was to be crucified for the sins of men. What suffering, then, would
 the sinner bear who continued in sin? All the impenitent and unbelieving
would know a sorrow and misery that language would fail to express."—
Id., p.743.
                           Arrival at Calvary
   12. Upon arrival at Calvary, what was offered to Jesus? Matt. 27:33, 34.
   NOTE.—"It was a merciful Jewish practice to give to those led to execution
a draught of strong wine mixed with myrrh, so as to deaden consciousness.
                                     [ 22 ]
This charitable office was performed at the cost of, if not by, an association of
women in Jerusalem. That draught was offered to Jesus when He reached
Golgotha. But having tasted it, and ascertained its character and object, He
would not drink it."—"Life and Times of Jesus," Edersheim, Vol. 2, pp.
589, 590.
    "To those who suffered death by the cross, it was permitted to give a
stupefying potion, to deaden the sense of pain. This was offered to Jesus; but
when He had tasted it, He refused it. He would receive nothing that could
becloud His mind. His faith must keep fast hold upon God. This was His only
strength. To becloud His senses would give Satan an advantage."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 746.
    13. What was the arrangement of the crosses for those who were to
be crucified? Luke 23:33.
                                  Crucified
    14. Being raised upon the cross, what prayer did Jesus offer for
others? Upon beholding His agony, what did the people, rulers, and
soldiers say? Verses 34-37.
    15. After Jesus was crucified, how was Scripture again fulfilled?
Matt. 27:35; Ps. 22:18.
   Nom.—"The prophecy concerning His garments was carried out without
counsel or interference from the friends or the enemies of the Crucified One.
To the soldiers who had placed Him upon the cross, His clothing was given.
Christ heard the men's contention as they parted the garments among them.
His tunic was woven .throughout without seam, and they said, 'Let us not
rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be."—Ibid.
    16. What writing was placed above the head of Jesus on the cross?
Matt. 27:36, 37.
   NOTE.—"The evangelists differ in the account of this title. Mark (15:26)
says it was 'The King of the Jews'; Luke (23:38), 'This is the King of the
Jews'; John (19:19), 'Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews.' But the
difficulty may be easily removed. John says that the title was written in
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. It is not at all improbable that the inscription
varied in these languages."—Barnes.
    17. Who were crucified with Jesus? Verse 38.
    18. What did those do who passed by? Who besides these joined in
mocking Him? What taunting words did they say? Verses 39-43.
    NorE,—"In their mockery of the Saviour, the men who professed to be
the expounders of prophecy were repeating the very words which inspiration
had foretold they would utter upon this occasion. Yet in their blindness they
did not see that they were fulfilling the prophecy. Those who in derision
uttered the words, 'He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now, if He will
have Him; for He said, I am the Son of God,' little thought that their testi-
mony would sound down the ages. But although spoken in mockery, these
words led men to search the Scriptures as they had never done before. Wise
men heard, searched, pondered, and prayed. There were those who never rested
 until, by comparing scripture with scripture, they saw the meaning of Christ's
mission. Never before was there such a general knowledge of Jesus as when He
hung upon the cross. Into the hearts of many who beheld the crucifixion
                                         [23 1
scene, and who heard Christ's words, the light of truth was shining."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 749.
                         THINK ON THESE THINGS
              "The thorns on His head were worn in my stead;
                 For me the Saviour died;
               For guilt of my sin the nails drove in
                 When Him they crucified."

                          Jesus on the Cross
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matthew 27:44-56; Luke 23:39-49; Mark 15:33-41;
  John 19:25-30.
MEMORY VERSE: "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
  world." John 1:29.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 749-764.
PLACE: The hill called Calvary, the exact site now unknown, a short distance outside
  the wall of Jerusalem; the temple, priests officiating.
PERSONS: Jesus; soldiers; priests and people; the two thieves; Mary, the mother
  of Jesus; John, one of the disciples; a centurion.

                               Mocking Jesus
    1. As Jesus hung on the cross, how was He taunted by the leaders
among the Jews? Matt. 27:41-43.
    NorE.—"The theme that attracts the heart of the sinner is Christ, and Him
crucified. On the cross of Calvary, Jesus stands revealed to the world in
unparalleled love. Present Him thus to the hungering multitudes, and the light
of His love will win men from darkness to light, from transgression to obedience
and true holiness. Beholding Jesus upon the cross of Calvary arouses the
conscience to the heinous character of sin as nothing else can do."—Mrs. E. G.
White, in Review and Herald, Nov. 22, 1892.
    2. Who besides the priests and the multitude joined in railing upon
Him? Verse 44.
    NoTE.—"The enemies of Jesus vented their rage upon Him as He hung upon
the cross. Priests, rulers, and scribes joined with the mob in mocking•the dying
Saviour. At the baptism and at the transfiguration the voice of God had been
heard proclaiming Christ as His Son. Again, just before Christ's betrayal, the
Father had spoken, witnessing to His divinity. But now the voice from heaven
was silent. No testimony in Christ's favor was heard. Alone He suffered
abuse and mockery from wicked men."—*., p. 749.
                             The Penitent Thief
   3. How did the manner and spirit of Jesus finally affect one of the
thieves? Luke 23:39-41.
    4. What request did this man make of Jesus? Verse 42.
                                       [ 24 1
    NOTE.—"To Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one gleam of com-
fort. It was the prayer of the penitent thief. Both the men who were crucified
with Jesus had at first railed upon Him; and one under his suffering, only
became more desperate and defiant. But not so with his companion. This man
was not a hardened criminal ; he had been led astray by evil associations, but
he was less guilty than many of those who stood beside the cross reviling the
Saviour. He had seen and heard Jesus, and had been convicted by His teach-
ing, but he had been turned away from Him by the priests and rulers. Seeking
to stifle conviction, he had plunged deeper and deeper into sin, until he was
arrested, tried as a criminal, and condemned to die on the cross."—Id., p. 749.
    5. What answer did Jesus make to this petition? Verse 43.
    NoTE.—"I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise. Christ
did not promise that the thief should be with Him in Paradise that day.' He
Himself did not go that day to Paradise. He slept in the tomb, and on the
morning of the resurrection He said, 'I am not yet ascended to My Father.'
But on the day of the crucifixion, the day of apparent defeat and darkness,
the promise was given. 'Today,' while dying upon the cross as a malefactor,
Christ assures the poor sinner, 'Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.' "—Id.,
p.751.
   "It is well known that the punctuation of the Bible is not the work of the
inspired writers. Indeed, punctuation is but a modern art, the comma in its
present form having been invented in 1490 by a printer of Venice. We are
therefore at liberty to change the punctuation of Scripture as the sense may
require. In Luke 23:43, place the comma after 'today," and give the direct
instead of the inverted form of the verb, and the text reads, 'Verily I say unto
thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.' There is now no lack of
harmony between this text and Christs later statement, that He had not yet
ascended to His Father."—"The Desire of Ages," Appendix, p. 842, large
edition, Note 4.
               Jesus Makes Provision for His Mother
   6. What women are mentioned as standing by the cross? John 19:25.
   7. Into whose care did Jesus commit His mother? What shows that
John understood the wish of Jesus? Verses 26, 27.
   NOTE.—"0 pitiful, loving Saviour; amid all His physical pain and mental
anguish, He had a thoughtful care for His mother. He had no money with
which to provide for her comfort; but He was enshrined in the heart of John,
and He gave His mother to him as a precious legacy. Thus He provided for
her that which she most needed,—the tender sympathy of one who loved her
because she loved Jesus. And in receiving her as a sacred trust, John was
receiving a great blessing. She was a constant reminder of his beloved Master."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 752.
                                  Darkness
   8. What supernatural occurrence witnessed to the tragedy of the
cross? Matt. 27:45.
   NoTE.—From twelve o'clock until three o'clock.
   "In that thick darkness God's presence was hidden. He makes darkness
His pavilion, and conceals His glory from human eyes. God and His holy
angels were beside the cross. The Father was with His Son. Yet His presence
was not revealed. Had His glory flashed forth from the cloud, every human
beholder would have been destroyed. And in that dreadful hour Christ was
                                    [ 25 ]
not to be comforted with the Father's presence. He trod the winepress alone,
and of the people there was none with Him. In the thick darkness, God veiled
the last human agony of His Son."—Id., p. 753.
    "A nameless terror held the throng that was gathered about the cross. The
cursing and reviling ceased in the midst of half-uttered sentences. Men, women,
and children fell prostrate upon the earth. Vivid lightnings occasionally flashed
forth from the cloud, and revealed the cross and the crucified Redeemer.
Priests, rulers, scribes, executioners, and the mob, all thought that their time
of retribution had come. After a while some whispered that Jesus would now
come down from the cross. Some attempted to grope their way back to the
city, beating their breasts and wailing in fear."—Id., p. 754.
                               Without Hope
    9. About the ninth hour, with what pathetic appeal did Jesus startle
those around the cross? Verse 46.
    NOTE.—Jesus suffered at this moment a sense of separation from the Father
as those at last will suffer who die without God and without hope. To Him it
seemed as if all light and love had been taken away, and that He would be
forever separated from His Father in heaven. Dying for the sins of the world,
He felt as one who is forever lost.
    10. After this what did Jesus say? John 19:28.
    11. What did some of the bystanders say about His cry? What did
one of them straightway do? What protest did others make? Matt.
27:47-49.
    NOTE.—"When the darkness lifted from the oppressed spirit of Christ, He
revived to a sense of physical suffering, and said, 'I thirst.' One of the Roman
soldiers, touched with pity as he looked at the parched lips, took a sponge on
a stalk of hyssop, and dipping it in a vessel of vinegar, offered it to Jesus. But
the priests mocked at His agony. When darkness covered the earth, they had
been filled with fear; as their terror abated, the dread returned that Jesus
would yet escape them. His words, `Eloi, Eloi, lama Sabachthani,' they had
misinterpreted. With bitter contempt and scorn they said, 'This man caileth
for Elias.' The last opportunity to relieve His sufferings they refused. 'Let
be,' they said, 'let us see whether Elias will come to save Him.' "—Ibid.
                                It Is Finished
    12. As Jesus gave up His life, what words of victory did He utter?
Verse 50; Luke 23:46.
    NOTE.—The seven sayings of Jesus on the cross form a remarkable index
to the Christ-life, and a striking epitome of Christian experience:
    (1) "Father, forgive them; for they know.not what they do." Luke 23:34.
    (2) "Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise."
Luke 23:43.
    (3) "Woman, behold thy son!" "Behold thy mother!" John 19:26, 27.
    (4) "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" Matt. 27:46.
    (5) "I thirst." John 19:28.
    (6) "It is finished." John 19:30.
    (7) "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit." Luke 23:46.
    13. As Jesus died, what occurred in the temple in Jerusalem even
while the priests were offering sacrifices? Matt. 27:51, first part.
                                      [ 26 1
    NorE.—Type met antitype when Jesus died. "No longer need sinful, sor-
rowing humanity await the coming of the high priest. Henceforth the Saviour
was to officiate as priest and advocate in the heaven of heavens. It was as if
a living voice had spoken to the worshipers: There is now an end to all
sacrifices and offerings for sin."—Id., p. 757.
    14. When Jesus died what phenomenon occurred in nature? What
other wonderful events came to pass? Verses 51-53.
    NorE.—"Never before had the earth witnessed such a scene. The multitude
stood paralyzed, and with bated breath gazed upon the Saviour. Again
darkness settled upon the earth, and a hoarse rumbling, like heavy thunder,
was heard. There was a violent earthquake. The people were shaken together
in heaps. The wildest confusion and consternation ensued. In the surrounding
mountains, rocks were rent asunder, and went crashing down into the plains.
Sepulchers were broken open, and the dead were cast out of their tombs.
Creation seemed to be shivering to atoms. Priests, rulers, soldiers, executioners,
and people, mute with terror, lay prostrate upon the ground."—Id., p. 756.
    15. What effect did these things have upon the Roman centurion and
the men in his charge? What did they say? Verse 54.
    16. What company stood at a distance witnessing the terrible ordeal?
What relation had they sustained to Jesus in His work? Whose names
are mentioned? Verses 55, 56; Mark 15:40, 41.
                         THINK ON THESE THINGS
                         "Brother, He died for thee;
                            Live thou for Him."

PERSONS: Jesus; the disciples; Joseph of Arimathaea; Nicodemus, a member of the
  Sanhedrin; Pontius Pilate, ruler of Judea; soldiers; Jews; the women; angels.

                             Introductory Note
    Jesus was crucified in the morning on Friday. He died in the middle of
the afternoon. As it was against the Jewish law for criminals to remain on
the cross on the Sabbath, preparations were hastened for the removal of the
bodies. It was customary to bury those who were executed, in a plot of ground
set apart for that purpose. The disciples were greatly troubled, for they did
not want Jesus buried in a place of dishonor. They lingered at the cross after
the death of Jesus, not knowing what to do.
                                        27
   "With the death of Christ the hopes of His disciples perished. They looked
upon His closed eyelids and drooping head, his hair matted with blood, His
pierced hands and feet, and their anguish was indescribable. Until the last
they had not believed that He would die; they could hardly believe that He
was really dead. Overwhelmed with sorrow, they did not recall His words
foretelling this very scene. Nothing that He had said, now gave them comfort.
They saw only the cross and its bleeding victim. The future seemed dark
with despair. Their faith in Jesus had perished; but never had they loved
their Lord as now. Never before had they so felt His worth, and their need
of His presence."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 772.
                 Joseph Obtains the Body of Jesus
   1. Who came to the cross after the death of Jesus? Matt. 27:57.
   NorE.—Joseph was a "counselor," which probably means that he was a
member of the great council of the Sanhedrin. Luke 23:50, 51. Probably no
one but a member of that court would have dared ask such a favor of Pilate,
who alone could give permission for the removal of the body. Joseph had
secretly believed in Christ for some time, having but one friend to whom he
had divulged his feelings, namely, Nicodemus. Together they had decided to
brave indignation, and give the Saviour an honorable burial.
   2. What request did Joseph make of Pilate? How did Pilate respond?
John 19:38.
   3. When Joseph asked for the body of Jesus, what caused Pilate to
express wonder? Mark 15:43-45.
                         Died of a Broken Heart
   4. Why were the Jews anxious for the bodies of the crucified men to
be taken away? With Pilate's permission what did the soldiers do?
Why was an exception made in the case of Jesus? John 19:31-33.
    5. What did one of the soldiers do to make certain of the death of
Jesus? Verse 34.
    6. What scriptures were fulfilled in these proceedings? Verses 36, 37.
    NOTE.—"The Sabbath was now drawing on, and it would be a violation
of its sanctity for the bodies to hang upon the cross. So, using this as a pretext,
the leading Jews requested Pilate that the death of the victims might be
hastened, and their bodies be removed before the setting of the sun. Pilate was
as unwilling as they for the body of Jesus to remain upon the cross. His
consent having been obtained, the legs of the two thieves were broken to
hasten their death; but Jesus was found to be already dead. The rude soldiers
had been softened by what they had heard and seen of Christ, and they were
restrained from breaking His limbs. . . . The priests and rulers were amazed
to find that Christ was dead. Death by the cross was a lingering process; it
was difficult to determine when life had ceased. It was an unheard-of thing
for one to die within six hours of crucifixion. The priests wished to make sure
of the death of Jesus, and at their suggestion a soldier thrust a spear into the
Saviour's side. . . . But it was not the spear thrust, it was not the pain of the
cross, that caused the death of Jesus. That cry, uttered 'with a loud voice,' at
the moment of death, the stream of blood and water that flowed from His
side, declared that He died of a broken heart. His heart was broken by mental
anguish. He was slain by the sin of the world."—Id., pp. 771,772.
                                       [ 28 ]
                          Nicodemus Assisted
    7. What other noted matt came to assist in the burial? What did he
bring? John 19:39.
    8. How did they prepare the body of Jesus for burial? Where was
His body laid? Verses 40-42; Matt. 27:59-61.
    NoTE.—"Gently and reverently they removed with their own hands the
body of Jesus from the cross. Their tears of sympathy fell fast as they looked
upon His bruised and lacerated form. Joseph owned a new tomb, hewn in a
rock. This he was reserving for himself, but it was near Calvary, and he now
prepared it for Jesus. The body, together with the spices brought by Nico-
demus, was carefully wrapped in a linen sheet, and the Redeemer was borne
to the tomb. There the three disciples [Joseph, Nicodemus, and John]
straightened the mangled limbs, and folded the bruised hands upon the pulse-
less breast. The Galilean women came to see that all had been done that
could be done for the lifeless form of their beloved Teacher. Then they saw
the heavy stone rolled against the entrance of the tomb, and the Saviour was
left to rest. The women were last at the cross, and last at the tomb of
Christ."—Id., pp. 773,774.
    9. What was the day called on which Jesus was crucified? What day
was drawing near? Luke 23:54.
    NOTE.-"It was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath." Mark
15:42. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia says of the use of this
word "preparation": "It is used as a technical term indicating the day of the
preparation for the Sabbath, that is, the evening of Friday. /This is its use in
Josephus, 'Antiquities,' XVI, vi, 2."
                     Mating the Sepulcher Sure
    10. What did the hatred of the chief priests and Pharisees lead them
to do on the Sabbath day? What saying of Jesus' did they call to Pilate's
attention? Matt. 27:62, 63.
    Nom—How singular that these murderers of Jesus should remember
repeated prediction that He should rise again in three days, while His own
disciples, according to the testimony of one of the most devoted of them,
"knew not the scripture, that He must rise again," ( John 20:9), but were
found mourning and weeping when Mary Magdalene came to announce thee
resurrection, and even then "believed not." Mark 16:9-11.
    The perfidy and hypocrisy of the priests and rulers who condemned Jesus
is shown in many things, and in none more than in the fact that while they
pretended to believe false witnesses who accused Jesus of desiring to destroy
the temple, and build it again in three days, yet they understood so well
Christ's prediction concerning His resurrection on the third day that they
obtained Pilate's consent, and sealed the tomb with the Roman seal, placing
a strong soldier guard about it.
    11. What request did they make of Pilate? What reasons did they
give for this precaution? What was Pilate's answer? How did they
make the sepulcher sure? Verses 64-66.
   Norn.—"The priests gave directions for securing the sepulcher. A great
stone had been placed before the opening. Across this stone they placed cords,
securing the ends to the solid rock, and sealing them with the Roman seal. The
stone could not be moved without breaking the seal. A guard of one hundred
                                       29
soldiers was then stationed around the sepulcher to prevent it from being
tampered with. The priests did all they could to keep Christ's body where it
had been laid. He was sealed as securely in His tomb as if He were to remain
there through all time."—Id., p. 778.
                    They Rested on the Sabbath
    12. What did the women who came with Jesus do after witnessing
the burial of their Lord? Luke 23:55, 56.
    13. What had they purposed to do to the body of Jesus? When did
they attempt to carry their purpose into effect? Mark 16:1, 2: Luke 24:1.
    NOTE—If possible, read of the observance of that Sabbath day as described
in "The Desire of Ages," page 774.
                               He is Risen!
    14. What had taken place before the women reached the tomb?
What was the appearance of this angel? Matt. 28:2, 3.
    NoTE.—In Jesus' statement concerning His life, "I have power to lay it
down, and I have power to take it again," He coupled the words, "This corn-
mandment have I received of My Father." When Jesus yielded His life on the
cross. He said, "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit." Of that hour
when He received back the life He had thus committed unto the Father,
we read:
    "The earth trembles and heaves as that powerful being from another world
approaches. He is coming on a joyful errand, and the speed and power of his
flight shake the world like a mighty earthquake. Soldiers, officers, and
sentinels, fall as dead men to the earth. . . . One of the commanding angels
who had, with his heavenly company, been keeping watch over the tomb of
his Master, joined the powerful angel who had just come from heaven. To-
gether they advanced to the sepulcher. The angelic commander laid hold of
the great stone at the mouth of the tomb, rolled it away, and sat upon it. His
companion entered the sepulcher and removed the wrappings from the face
and head of Jesus. Then, with a voice that caused the earth to tremble, he
called forth:—
    "'Jesus, Thou Son of God, Thy Father calls Thee!'
    "Then He who had earned the power over death came forth from the tomb
with the tread of a conqueror. As He arose from the dead, the earth reeled, the
lightning flashed, and the thunder rolled. An earthquake marked the hour
when Christ laid down His life. Another earthquake witnessed the moment
when He took it up again in triumph."—"Christ Our Saviour," pp. 140, 141.
    15. How had the presence of the angel affected the guardians of the
tomb? What thrilling experience was theirs? Verse 4.
    NoTE.—"Now, priests and rulers, where is the power of your guard?—
Brave soldiers that have never been afraid of human power, are now as captives
taken without sword or spear. The face they look upon is not the face of
mortal warrior; it is the face of the mightiest of the Lord's host. This mes-
senger is he who fills the position from which Satan fell. It is he who on the
hills of Bethlehem proclaimed Christ's birth. The earth trembles at his
approach, the hosts of darkness flee, and as he rolls away the stone, heaven
seems to come down to the earth. The soldiers see him removing the stone
as he would a pebble, and hear him cry, Son of God, come forth; Thy Father
calls Thee. They see Jesus come forth from the grave, and hear Him proclaim
                                    [301
over the rent sepulcher, 'I am the resurrection and the life.' As He comes forth
in majesty and glory, the angel host bow low in adoration before the Redeemer,
and welcome Him with songs of praise."—Id., pp. 779, 780.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
   Imagine Pilate's thoughts during the time between the crucifixion and the
resurrection.
   The thoughts of the disciples.
   The thoughts of priests and rulers.
   The interest of the angels.

PLACES: At the sepulcher; in Jerusalem.
PERSONS: Mary and the other women; an angel; Peter and John; Jesus.

                    The Women at the Sepulcher
   1. In the early morning following the Sabbath, who came first to the
tomb where she had seen the body of Jesus placed? What astonished
her? What did she do and say? John 20:1, 2.
   2. What did the other women do? Luke 24:1-3.
   NOTE.—"The women had not all come to the tomb from the same direc-
tion. Mary Magdalene was the first to reach the place; and upon seeing that
the stone was removed, she hurried away to tell the disciples. Meanwhile the
other women came up."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 788.
    3. How had the stone been removed from the sepulcher? What effect
had the angel's presence had upon the soldier guard? Matt. 28:2-4.
    4. As the women were perplexed over the empty sepulcher, who
appeared to them? What gentle reproof was given? What comforting
message was given to them?. Verses 5, 6.
    5. Of what were they reminded? Verse 7.
    6. What were the women told to do? Mark 16:7.
    NOTE.—"Tell His disciples and Peter." Poor, discouraged, repentant Peter!
He is not forgotten by his Lord. Now, when risen from the dead, Jesus re-
members His sorrowing disciple, and fearing he will in his despondency
conclude that the Master does not care for him, He asks that Peter especially
be told He is risen from the dead. We have the same loving, compassionate
Saviour today.
    7. What response did the women make? Matt. 28:8.
                                     f 31
                Peter and John Come to the Sepulcher
     8. As soon as Peter and John heard from Mary that the body of Jesus
 was not in the sepulcher, what did they do? Who arrived first? What did
 he do? John 20:3-5.
     9. What did Peter do as soon as he reached the tomb? What did he
 see? Verses 6, 7.
     NOTE.—"The disciples hurried to the tomb, and found it as Mary had
 said. They saw the shroud and the napkin, but they did not find their Lord.
 Yet even here was testimony that He had risen. The graveclothes were not
 thrown heedlessly aside, but carefully folded, each in a place by itself. John
 `saw and believed.' He did not yet understand the scripture that Christ must
 rise from the dead; but he now remembered the Saviour's words foretelling
 His resurrection.
     "It was Christ Himself who had placed those graveclothes with such care.
 When the mighty angel came down to the tomb, he was joined by another,
 who with his company had been keeping guard over the Lord's body. As the
 angel from heaven rolled away the stone, the other entered the tomb, and
 unbound the wrappings from the body of Jesus. But it was the Saviour's hand
 that folded each, and laid it in its place. In His sight who guides alike the
 star and the atom, there is nothing unimportant. Order and perfection are
 seen in all His work."—/d., p. 789.
     10. Seeing Peter's boldness, what did John do? What did these dis-
 ciples not yet know or understand? Verses 8, 9.
     11. After assuring themselves that Jesus was not in the tomb, where
 did these two disciples go? Verse 10.
     NOTE.—The individual characteristics of Peter and John are seen in their
 visit to the tomb. Peter, rash and impetuous, went into the tomb as soon as
 he reached it. John, more cautious and deliberate, first looked in, going in later.
                     Jesus First Appeared to Mary
     12. While the other women went to announce the resurrection (Matt.
2:7, 8) what did Mary Magdalene do? Verse 11.
     NOTE.—After visiting the sepulcher, the disciples went to their home. Not
 so with Mary Magdalene. She could not go home. She had lost her Lord, and
 could not rest till she had found Him. She remained by the sepulcher to weep.
(Often to such anxious souls the Lord appears.) While she wept, her Lord
 appeared with words of comfort. She was the first to greet Him after He had
 risen from the dead.
     13. As Mary looked into the sepulcher, what did she see? What did
 the angels ask her? What was Mary's reply? Verses 12, 13.
     14. As Mary turned to go, whom did she see? What did she not know?
 What did she ask the supposed gardener? Verses 14, 15.
     15. How did Jesus reveal His identity to Mary? What did He then say
 to her? Verses 16, 17.
     NOTE.—"Now in His own familiar voice Jesus said to her, 'Mary' Now
 she knew that it was not a stranger who was addressing her, and turning she
 saw before her the living Christ. In her joy she forgot that He had been
 crucified. Springing toward Him, as if to embrace His feet, she said, aabboni!
                                       32
But Christ raised His hand, saying, Detain Me not; 'for I am not yet ascended
to My Father; but go to My brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto My
Father, and your Father; and to My God, and your God.' And Mary went
her way to the disciples with the joyful message."—/d., p. 790.
               Jesus Appeared to the Other Women
   16. When Jesus returned to earth and met the other women who had
been to the sepulcher, what did He say to them? How did they show
their joy? What message did Jesus send by these women? Matt. 28:9, 10.
                       Disciples Do Not Believe
   17. When Mary and the other women told what they had seen and
heard, how did the disciples receive their message? Luke 24:10, 11;
Mark 16:9-11.
              What the Roman Soldiers Were Doing
    18. While these events were taking place, what were the Roman
soldiers doing? What plan was laid by the priests and elders to prevent
the truth of the resurrection of Jesus from becoming known? Matt. 28:11-13.
    NoTE.—"At sight of the angels and the glorified Saviour the Roman guard
had fainted and become as dead men. When the heavenly train was hidden
from their view, they arose to their feet, and as quickly as their trembling
limbs could carry them, made their way to the gate of the garden. Staggering
like drunken men, they hurried on to the city, telling those whom they met
the wonderful news. They were making their way to Pilate, but their report
had been carried to the Jewish authorities, and the chief priests and rulers sent
for them to be brought first into their presence. A strange appearance those
soldiers presented. Trembling with fear, their faces colorless, they bore testi-
mony to the resurrection of Christ. The soldiers told all, just as they had
seen it; they had not had time to think or speak anything but the truth. With
painful utterance they said, It was the Son of God who was crucified; we
have heard an angel proclaiming Him as the Majesty of heaven, the King
of glory.
   "The faces of the priests were as those of the dead. Caiaphas tried to speak.
His lips moved, but they uttered no sound. The soldiers were about to leave
the council room, when a voice stayed them. Caiaphas had at last found speech.
Wait, wait, he said. Tell no one the things you have seen. A lying report was
then given to the soldiers."—Id., pp. 781, 782.
    19. How did the chief priests plan to keep the Roman soldiers from
receiving the penalty of sleeping on guard? What saying was com-
monly repoited? Verses 14, 15.
    NorE.—"The soldiers were horrified at the thought of bringing upon them-
selves the charge of sleeping at their post. This was an offense punishable with
death. Should they bear false witness, deceiving the people, and placing their
own lives in peril? Had they not kept their weary watch with sleepless
vigilance? How could they stand the trial, even for the sake of money, if they
perjured themselves?
    "In order to silence the testimony they feared, the priests promised to
secure the safety of the guard, saying that Pilate would not desire to have
such a report circulated any more than they did. The Roman soldiers sold
their integrity to the Jews for money. They came in before the priests bur-
                                       '33 1
dened with a most startling message of truth; they went out with a burden
of money, and on their tongues a lying report which had been framed for
them by the priests."—Id., p. 782.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
   The miracle of the resurrection.
   "The dead in Christ shall rise first."
   What the resurrection means to me.

  On the Way to Emmaus; Jesus Appears to the
                  Disciples
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 24:13-48; John 20:19-31; Mark 16:12-14.
MEMORY VERSE: "Be not faithless, but believing." John 20:27.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 795-808.
PLACES: Emmaus, a village about eight miles from Jerusalem; the upper room in
  a house in Jerusalem where Jesus ate the Passover with His disciples.
PERSONS: Jesus; Cleopas and an unnamed believer; the eleven, Thomas specially
  named.

                 Two Disciples Going to Emmaus
    1. Where did two of the believers go on the day of the resurrection?
Of what did they talk? Luke 24:13, 14.
   NoTE.—The name "Emmaus" means "warm springs." This was a little
town about eight miles from Jerusalem. Its location is not now identified with
certainty. Doubtless the disciples left Jerusalem in the afternoon, for the day
was far spent when they reached Emmaus. These two disciples were not of
the twelve, but of "the rest." Luke 24:9.
    2. Who joined them as they walked along the way? Why did they
not know Him? Verses 15, 16.
   NoTE.—"Their eyes were holden." They were so absorbed in the con-
templation of their disappointed hopes, and so sad and troubled at the per-
plexing tidings they had received concerning the empty tomb and the absent
body of Jesus, that they did not observe the Stranger very closely.
    3. What question did Jesus ask? What reply did Cleopas make?
Verses 17, 18.
    4. To the further question of Jesus, what outstanding points were
related? Verses 19-24.

                 The Stranger Expounds Prophecy
    5. How did the "Stranger" reply to their words? Verses 25, 26.
    NoTE.—The word "fools" as here used means "dull," or, as Jesus explained,
"slow" to comprehend.
                                    [ 34
    6. How did Jesus try to help their understanding of what had taken
place? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—"Christ referred to Himself as though He were another person.
They thought that He was one of those who had been in attendance at the
great feast, and who was now returning to his home. He walked as carefully
as they over the rough stones, now and then halting with them for a little rest."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 800.
    Jesus might easily have convinced the disciples of His resurrection by
showing them His wounded hands, or revealing His power in some super-
natural way. But He desired that their belief in Him should rest, not on sight,
or on some miraculous revelation, but on the Scriptures. In like manner He de-
sires that we believe in Him, not because we see some miracle performed, but
on the plain statements of the Scriptures themselves.
                                At Emmaus
   7. As they came near to Emmaus, what did Jesus do? What invitation
did the two disciples extend to Him? Verses 28, 29.
   8. How was Jesus finally revealed to them? What did He then do?
What did they say one to another? Verses 30-32.
   NoTE.—"The simple evening meal of bread is soon prepared. It is placed
before the guest, who has taken His seat at the head of the table. Now He
puts forth His hands to bless the food. The disciples start back in astonish-
ment. Their companion spreads forth His hands in exactly the same way as
their Master used to do. They look again, and lo, they see in His hands the
print of nails. Both exclaim at once, It is the Lord Jesus! He has risen from
the dead ! They rise to cast themselves at His feet and worship Him, but He
has vanished out of their sight."—Ibid.
              The Two Disciples Return to Jerusalem
    9. To what place did the two disciples immediately return? Whom
did they find together? What were the group saying? What did the two
late arrivals have to tell? Verses 33-35.
    NOTE.—"With this great news to communicate they cannot sit and talk.
Their weariness and hunger are gone. They leave their meal untasted, and full
of joy immediately set out again on the same path by which they came, hurry-
ing to tell the tidings to the disciples in the city. . . . They go to the upper
chamber, where Jesus spent the hours of the last evening before His death.. . .
They find the door of the chamber securely barred. They knock for admission,
but no answer comes. All is still. Then they give their names. The door is
carefully unbarred, they enter, and Another, unseen, enters with them. Then
the door is again fastened, to keep out spies."—Id., pp. 800-802.
            Jesus Appears to Them in the Upper Room
    10. While they were thus talking, who appeared to them? With what
words did He salute them? How did His appearance affect them? Verses
36, 37.
    NorE.—"The travelers find all in surprised excitement. The voices of those
in the room break out into thanksgiving and praise, saying, 'The Lord is risen
indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.' Then the two travelers, panting with
the haste with which they have made their journey, tell the wondrous story
of how Jesus has appeared to them. They have just ended, and some are saying
                                     135 1
that they cannot believe it, for it is too good to be true, when behold, another
person stands before them. Every eye is fastened upon the stranger. No one
has knocked for entrance. No footstep has been heard. The disciples are
startled, and wonder what it means. Then they hear a voice which is no other
than the voice of their Master. Clear and distinct the words fall from His
lips, 'Peace be unto you.'"—Id., pp. 802, 803.
    11. How did Jesus reprove them for their unbelief? How did He seek
to convince them of the reality of His presence? Verses 38-40.
    12. What further proof did He give? Verses 41-43.
    13. On what foundation did Jesus establish His words and His mis-
sion? Verses 44, 45.
    14. What reason did Jesus say the Scriptures give for His suffering,
death, and resurrection? What was to be the relationship of His dis-
ciples to those experiences? Verses 46-48.
                            Doubting Thomas
     15. Which of the disciples was absent when Jesus met with them?
What did Thomas say when the disciples told him they had seen the
Lord? John 20:24, 25.
     16. How long a time elapsed before Jesus met again with the
disciples? Who is especially mentioned as being present? How did
Jesus again greet them? Verse 26.
     17. What did Jesus say to Thomas? What was the reply of Thomas?
What lesson, kindly spoken, did Jesus give? Verses 27-29.
    NorE.—"Many who are given to doubt excuse themselves by saying that
if they had the evidence which Thomas had from his companions, they would
believe. They do not realize that they have not only that evidence, but much
more. Many who, like Thomas, wait for all cause of doubt to be removed,
will never realize their desire. They gradually become confirmed in unbelief.
Those who educate themselves to look on the dark side, and murmur and
complain, know not what they do. They are sowing the seeds of doubt, and
they will have a harvest of doubt to reap. At a time when faith and confidence
are most essential, many will thus find themselves powerless to hope and
believe."—/d., pp. 807, 808.
     17. Of what do we not have a complete record? Why are a portion of
Jesus sayings and works recorded? Verses 30, 31.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
   The proof of my acceptance with God.
   The experiences that tempt me to doubt.
   The remedy for doubt.
   The proof in this lesson that Jesus understands my thoughts.

                  An Appointment Previously Made
    1. Before His death, what appointment did Jesus make to meet with
His disciples? Matt. 26:32.
    NOTE.—It is interesting to note the different appearances of Jesus to His
disciples after He had risen from the grave. On the day of His resurrection,
Jesus had appeared to Mary Magdalene (John 20:11-17) ; to the other women
(Matt. 28:5-10) ; to two disciples going to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-31) ; to the
apostles, excepting Thomas (John 20:19-21). "After eight days," Jesus ap-
peared to the apostles, Thomas being present. John 20:24-29. The statement
is made in Luke 24:34 that He had also appeared to Simon Peter, and to
James (1 Cor. 15:3-7), but the occasions of these appearances are not re-
corded.
    2. What reminder of this appointment was given to the disciples?
Matt. 28:5-7.
    NOTE.—"Jesus had appointed to meet His disciples in Galilee; and soon
after the Passover week was ended, they bent their steps thither. . . . Seven
of the disciples were in company. They were clad in the humble garb of fisher-
men; they were poor in worldly goods, but rich in the knowledge and practice
of the truth, which in the sight of Heaven gave them the highest rank as
teachers."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 809.
    3. Where did Jesus meet the disciples? Which of them were together?
John 21:1, 2.
                              A Fishing Group

Verses 3, 4.
    5. How did Jesus address them? What did He tell them to do? Upon

catch of fish? Verses 8-11.
                            "Come and Dine"
   7. What invitation did Jesus give the disciples? What question did
they not dare ask? How was the meal served? How many times had
[esus met with a company of disciples since His resurrection? Verses
12-14.
                           Jesus Talks to Peter
    8. When they had eaten, what did Jesus say to Peter? What answer
did Peter make? How were both question and answer emphasized?
Verses 15-17.
    NorE.—"Three times Peter had openly denied his Lord, and three times
Jesus drew from him the assurance of his love and loyalty, pressing home that
pointed question, like a barbed arrow to his wounded heart. Before the
assembled disciples Jesus revealed the depth of Peter's repentance, and showed
how thoroughly humbled was the once boasting disciple."—Id., p. 812.
    9. What contrast did Jesus next draw between Peter's early life and
the closing scenes in his career? Whom did Peter notice following them?
What was Peter curious to know? Verses 18-21.
    NOTE.—"Jesus thus made known to Peter the very manner of his death ;
he even foretold the stretching forth of his hands upon the cross."—/d., p. 815.
    10. How was Peter's question answered? What false interpretation
was placed upon the words of Jesus? Verses 22, 23.
    NOTE.—"It is the duty of every one to follow Christ, without undue anxiety
as to the work assigned to others."—Id., p. 816.
    11.    what words does John reveal the identity of "that disciple"?
What does he say concerning other things which Jesus said and did
during His earthly ministry? Verses 24, 25.

                        The Appointment Kept
    12. Where did the disciples at last meet as Jesus had appointed?
Matt. 28:16.
    13. Who besides the apostles met with Him at this time? 1 Cor. 15:6.
    14. Notwithstanding the abundant proof of Jesus' resurrection, what
did some do? Matt. 28:17.
    NOTE.—"At the time appointed, about five hundred believers were col-
lected in little knots on the mountainside, eager to learn all that could be
learned from those who had seen Christ since His resurrection. From group
to group the disciples passed, telling all they had seen and heard of Jesus,
and reasoning from the Scriptures as He had done with them. Thomas re-
counted the story of his unbelief, and told how his doubts had been swept
away. Suddenly Jesus stood among them. No one could tell whence or how
He came. Many who were present had never before seen Him; but in His
hands and feet they beheld the marks of the crucifixion; His countenance was
as the face of God, and when they saw Him, they worshiped Him. But some
doubted. So it will always be."—Id., p. 819.
                                    [ 38]
   15. What did Jesus say had been given to Him? What commission
was given to the disciples? How long will He be with His people?
Verses 18-20.
                         The Ascension of Jesus
     16. In His last talk with the eleven, to what promise did He refer?
Where were they to tarry until they received the power of the Holy
Spirit? Luke 24:49.
     17. To•what place did He then lead the little company? Verse 50.
     NOTE.—"As the place of His ascension, Jesus chose the spot so often hal-
lowed by His presence while He dwelt among men. Not Mount Zion, the
place of David's city, not Mount Moriah, the temple site, was to be thus
honored. There Christ had been mocked and rejected. There the waves of
mercy, still returning in a stronger tide of love, had been beaten back by
hearts as hard as rock. Thence Jesus, weary and heart-burdened, had gone
forth to find rest in the Mount of Olives. . . . From this mountain He was
to ascend to heaven. Upon its summit His feet will rest when He shall come
again. Not as a man of sorrows, but as a glorious and triumphant king He
will stand upon Olivet, while Hebrew hallelujahs mingle with Gentile hosannas,
and the voices of the redeemed as a mighty host shall swell the acclamation,
`Crown Him Lord of all.' "—Id., pp. 829, 830.
     18. After giving His beloved disciples His parting blessing, what
 occurred? Verse 51; Acts 1:9.
                                                      •
     19. While the disciples were watching as Jesus returned to heaven,
what promise was made concerning Him? Acts 1:10, 11.
     NoTE.—"These angels were of the company that had been waiting in a
shining cloud to escort Jesus to His heavenly home. The most exalted of the
angel throng, they were the two who had come to the tomb at Christ's resur-
 rection, and they had been with Him throughout His life on earth. With eager
 desire all heaven had waited for the end of His tarrying in a world marred by
 the curse of sin. The time had now come for the heavenly universe to receive
 their King. Did not the two angels long to join the throng that welcomed
 Jesus? But in sympathy and love for those whom He had left, they waited
 to give them comfort, 'Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
 for them who shall be heirs of salvation?'"—Id., pp. 831, 832.
     Read the description of the Saviour's welcome to heaven in "The Desire of
 Ages," pages 833, 834.
     "From that scene of heavenly joy, there comes back to us on earth the
 echo of Christ's own wonderful words, 'I ascend to My Father, and your
 Father; and to My God and your God.' The family of heaven and the family
  of earth are one. For us our Lord ascended, and for us He lives. 'Wherefore
  He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him,
 seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.' "—Id., p. 835.
                        THINK ON THESE THINGS
    The soon return of Jesus to this earth.
    Events connected with His coming.
    What I should be doing while I wait.
