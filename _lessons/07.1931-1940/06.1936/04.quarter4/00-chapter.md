                         BIBLE DOCTRINES
                                Introduction
    "The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by human hands;
and in the varied style of its different books it presents the characteristics of
the several writers. The truths revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God'
(2 Tim. 3:16) ; yet they are expressed in the words of men. The Infinite One
by His Holy Spirit has shed light into the micds and hearts of His servants.
He has given dreams and visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom the
truth was thus revealed, have themselves embodied the thought in human
language.
    "The Ten Commandments were spoken by God Himself, and were written
by His own hand. They are of divine, and not human composition. But the
Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in the language of men, presents a
union of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature of
Christ, who was the Son of God and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the
Bible, as it was of Christ, that 'the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among
us.' " John 1:14. . . .
    "In His word, God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for
salvation. The Holy ScriptUres are to be accepted as an authoritative, infallible
 revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the revealer of
 doctrines, and the test of experience. 'Every scripture inspired of God is also
profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in
 righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely
 unto every good work.' 2 Tim. 3:16, 17, Revised Version.
     "Yet the fact that God has revealed His will to men through His word,
 has not rendered needless the continued presence and guiding of the Holy Spirit.
On the contrary, the Spirit was promised by our Saviour, to open the word to
 His servants, to illuminate and apply its teachings. And since it was the Spirit
 of God that inspired the Bible, it is impossible that the teaching of the Spirit
 should ever be contrary to that of the word."—"The Great Controversy,"
 pp.
                                A New Feature
    In response to earnest requests from the field, we are adding a new feature
to the series of lessons on Bible Doctrines. It is a very brief outline of the
subject which may be of help to those who desire to pass on the truths of the
lesson to neighbors or friends. The outline is not an addition to the lessons.
No new texts are given. The lesson is complete without the outline, and should
receive careful study by all. The points of the lesson with a few of the texts,
are given in outline form for the benefit of any who wish to rearrange the
lesson into a Bible Reading. Some, doubtless, will prefer to use the lesson as
a whole, in missionary work.

God's Word—Its Origin, Inspiration, and Purpose
MEMORY VERSE: "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
  for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness : that the
  man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim.
  3:16, 17.
STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," Introduction, pp. v-vi11.

                          Origin of the Scriptures
    1. After the entrance of sin, how did God speak to the ancient fa-
thers? Heb. 1:1.
   NoTE.—In man's innocence in Eden, God spoke with him face to face; but
since sin entered God has sent His messages through chosen men.
    2. What simple term does our Lord use for the entire Old Testament?
What importance did He attach to these writings? John 5:39.
    NOTE.—"During the first twenty-five hundred years of human history,
there was no written revelation. Those who had, been taught of God, com-
municated their knowledge to others, and it was handed down from father
to son, through successive generations. The preparation of the written word
began in the time of Moses. Inspired revelations were then embodied in an
inspired book. This work continued during the long period of sixteen hundred
years, from Moses, the historian of creation and the law, to John, the recorder
of the most sublime truths of the gospel."—"The Great Controversy," Intro-
duction, p. v.
    "Before the oldest of the world's poets had sung, the shepherd of Midian
[Moses] recorded those words of God to Job."—"Education," p. 159.
    It is conclusive that our. Lord accepted the canon of the Old Testament, as
collected and compiled by Ezra, Nehemiah, and others,—for He cited these
writings as of divine origin.
    3. What three groups of the Old Testament does the Saviour recog-
nize? Luke 24:44.
  4. Who is prominently mentioned among Old Testament writers?
Luke 16:31; 24:27.
   5. Through whom did God give the law? John 1:17; 7:19; Matt. 8:4.
  6. Who of the prophets is especially mentioned by our Saviour?
Matt. 24:15.
  7. From whose writings did Christ and the apostles frequently quote?
Luke 20:42, 43; Acts 1:20; 13:33.
  8. What did Jesus say would enable the apostolic teachers and
writers to testify accurately concerning Himself? John 14:26.
   NOTE.—The Holy Spirit brought to mind the sayings and miracles of our
Lord with accuracy, that succeeding generations might have the testimony of
                                         [ 41
the four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Although guided by the
Holy Spirit, the writers of these four books did not always record identically
the same things; but even in this is evidence of genuine testimony. If four
witnesses in court were to tell the same story, word for word, their testimony
would doubtless be questioned, if not rejected, as having been agreed upon
beforehand. But testimony given from different viewpoints, as well as ob-
servation, yet agreeing in substance, bears the stamp of genuineness.
    9. With what did Peter class the epistles of Paul? 2 Peter 3:15, 16.
    NOTE.—While Peter knew that Paul had written some things hard to under-
stand, yet he recognized his epistles as from God, and classed them among the
"other scriptures," placing them on an equality with the Hebrew Scriptures;
for the wresting of these writings, Scriptures, would result in final destruction.
    10. What did John say concerning any attempt to change the Reve-
lation? Rev. 22:18. 19.
                         Inspiration of the Word
    11. How did Paul say the Scriptures were given? 2 Tim. 3:16.
   12. How did Peter state this same truth? 2 Peter 1:21.
   13. Through whom has the Father spoken to us? Heb. 1:1, 2.
    14. Apart from this direct testimony of the word, what evidence have
believers of its claims? 1 John 5:10.
    NOTE.—The one who has by faith claimed the promises of the word "hath
the witness in himself." He experiences the peace of sins forgiven; the mar-
velous transformation of heart and life are his; and he comes to know the
fellowship of the Spirit, of Christ, and the Father through its heaven-sent
messages.
                 God's Purpose in Giving His Word
    15. What are the Scriptures able to do for us through faith in Christ?
2 Tim. 3:15.
    16. State four specific things for which the word is profitable. Verses
16, 17.
    Non.—The first mentioned is doctrine. What is doctrine as here used?
It is what the Scriptures teach on a given subject. It is because of what the
Bible teaches concerning God that our conception of the Deity differs from
Hindu pantheism, African heathenism, and from eastern Buddhism. Bible
doctrine reveals the personal God and our relationship to Him as our Father.
It makes known His divine attributes—love, mercy, truth, and justice. Were
it not for the doctrines concerning God, redemption through Christ, the mini-
stration of our Lord, the eternal law, the nature of man, the future inheritance,
we might be steeped in heathen superstition, and ruled by fear. How we should
treasure the great truths of the word—the doctrines!
    17. What two objectives does the psalmist say the word will accom-
plish? Ps. 119:9, 11.
    18. By what should all doctrines be tested? Isa. 8:20.
     NorE.—"The Spirit was not given—nor can it ever be bestowed—to super-
sede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the word of God is the
                                       [5 ]
standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. . . . Great
reproach has been cast upon the work of the Holy Spirit by the errors of a class
that, claiming its enlightenment, profess to have no further need of guidance
from the word of God. They are governed by impressions which they regard as
the voice of God in the soul. But the spirit that controls them is not the Spirit
of God. This following of impressions, to the neglect of the Scriptures, can
lead only to confusion, to deception and ruin."—"The Great Controversy,"
Introduction, p. v11.
   19. How are spiritual growth and prosperity assured? Ps. 1:2. 3;
John 6:63.
                                Lesson Outline
    [Many persons have vague ideas of the origin of the Scriptures. To give a reading
to neighbors, embracing the four general topics in this outline, might attract the
attention of some who would like to know more about the Book—the Holy Scriptures.]

                     Lesson 2 for October 10, 1936
           DAILY LESSON STUDY: Place a check mark in the proper space.
  SUNDAY   I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY I SABBATH




     God's Word—Its Scope, Its Study, Its Power
MEMORY VERSE: "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
   needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." 2 Tim. 2:15.
STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 598-602.

                     Scope of Scriptural Teaching
   1. What is the word of God declared to be? John 17:17; Dan. 10:21.
   NoTE.—"It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn
from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light, and encourage
others to follow his example. We should day by day study the Bible diligently,
                                     [6 1
weighing every thought, and comparing scripture with scripture. With divine
help, we are to form our opinions for ourselves, as we are to answer for our-
selves before God."—"The Great Controversy," p. 598.
     "Satanic agencies are clothing false theories in an attractive garb, even as
Satan in the Garden of Eden concealed his identity from our first parents by
speaking through the serpent. These agencies are instilling into human minds
that which in reality is deadly error. The hypnotic influence of Satan will rest
upon those who turn from the plain word of God to pleasing fables."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 8, p. 294.
     2. What should be our attitude toward human tradition? Col. 2:8.
     NorE.—The following extract from the Protest of the Princes sets forth the
Protestant position concerning the true authority in spiritual things:
     "There is no sure doctrine but such as is conformable to the word of God.
. . . The Lord forbids the teaching of any other doctrine. . . . The Holy
Scriptures ought to be explained by other and clearer texts; . . . this holy
Book is, in all things necessary for the Christian, easy of understanding, and
calculated to scatter the darkness. We are resolved, with the grace of God, to
maintain the pure and exclusive preaching of His only word, such as it is con-
tained in the Biblical books of the Old and New,Testaments, without adding
anything thereto that may be contrary to it. This Word is the only truth; it
is the sure rule of all doctrine and of all life, and can never fail or deceive us."
—"History of the Reformation," D'Aubigne, Vol. IV, p. 75. Cited in "The
Great Controversy," p. 203.
    3. What perfect rule of life is contained in the Scriptures? Ex. 20:
3-17; James 2:10-12.
   4. What feature of the Scriptures did the Saviour especially empha-
size? Luke 24:25, 27.
    NorE.—While the Saviour at a later time showed to His disciples His
scarred hands, feet, and side as proof of His resurrection, He first of all directed
the minds of these two to something even more trustworthy than sight—the
prophecies. 2 Peter 1:19. Christ later said to Thomas, after showing him His
hands and feet, "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."
John 20:29. So God has provided us with an unfailing basis of faith—prophecy.
How earnestly we should study the word of prophecy! and how joyfully we
should treasure this phase of the word 1

                  How the Bible Should Be Studied
    5. What was Timothy exhorted to do? 2 Tim. 2:15.
    NoTE.—"To skim over the surface [of the Bible] will do little good.
Thoughtful investigation and earnest, taxing study are required to comprehend
it. There are truths in the word which are like veins of precious ore concealed
beneath the surface. By digging for them, as the man digs for gold and silver,
the hidden treasures are discovered."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education,"
p. 390.
    6. How did the Bereans study the word? Acts 17:11.
    NoTE.—"In daily study the verse-by-verse method is often most helpful.
Let the student take one verse, and concentrate the mind on ascertaining the
thought that God has put into that verse for him, and then dwell upon the
                                       [7]
thought until it becomes his own. One passage thus studied until its significance
is clear, is of more value than the perusal of many chapters with no definite
purpose in view, and no positive instruction gained."—"Education," p. 189.
    7. What method did the apostles employ in scriptural study? 1 Cor.
2:13.
    NorE.—Topical study is interesting and profitable. To search out the texts
bearing on a single subject gives a clear understanding of Bible doctrine. It is
remarkable what unanimity there is in scriptural teaching. Our safety in
scriptural interpretation is in comparing scripture with scripture until a clear
understanding of truth is obtained.
    8. How are the things of God discerned? 1 Cor. 2:14, 15.
    9. Who is the effectual teacher of truth? What promise was made
concerning Him? John 16:13; 14:26.
    10. On what condition may we understand the truths of the word?
John 7:17; 8:43, 47.
    NOTE.—"One reason why many theologians have no clearer understanding
of God's word is, they close their eyes to truths which they do not wish to
practice. An understanding ,of Bible truth depends not so much on the power
of intellect brought to the search as on the singleness of purpose, the earnest
longing after righteousness."—"The Great Controversy," p. 599.
    We have noted the verse-by-verse and the topical method of study. There
is much benefit also in book study of the Bible. To read an entire book through
without thought of chapters or verses (which are man's devices for reference
purposes) gives one a comprehension of the message and its purpose, which is
very essential to a further more minute and comparative study.
                             Power of the Word
    11. By what agencies were the heavens and the earth created?
Ps. 33:6, 9; Gen. 1:1, 3, 6, 9.
    12. In what experiences was this same power manifested through
the words of Christ? Matt. 8:8, 13: Luke 5:12, 13, 18-25.
    13. How is the new birth accomplished? 1 Peter 1:23; John 3:5.
    14. By what does the child of God grow? 1 Peter 2:2; Eph. 4:14, 15.
    15. Through what means may the Christian overcome? How was
this exemplified in the life of Christ? 2 Peter 1:4; Luke 4:4, 8, 12, 13.
                                 Lesson Outline
   [As a Bible reading, Lesson 2 follows Lesson 1 in a very logical way. The topics
suggested are well adapted, if rightly presented, to lead one to the climax of experi-
encing the new birth ; and the way of growth in the Christian life is also made clear.]

           DAILY LESSON STUDY : Place a check mark in the proper space.
  SUNDAY   I   MONDAY    I   TUESDAY WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY   I   FRIDAY   I   SABBATH



                                The Godhead
MEMORY VERSE: "The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
  clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power
  and Godhead." Rom. 1:20.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 668-672.

                                   The Creator
    1. In what way is the true God first brought to view in the Scriptures?
Gen. 1:1.
    2. In what way does Isaiah identify the true God? Isa. 42:5; 45:18.
    NoTE.—In the Scriptures, God frequently identifies Himself by calling
attention to His work of creation, as in the fourth commandment and elsewhere.
                                    The Trinity
    3. What three powers wrought in the work of creation? Eph. 3:9;
John 1:3; Gen. 1:2.
    NOTE.—These scriptures make it plain that the Father, the Son, • and the
Holy Spirit wrought together in creation. God "created all things by Jesus
Christ," and "the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters" in bringing
order out of chaos.
    4. Since man has fallen under the power of sin, how only can he be
restored? 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.
    NoTE.—The only way man can be delivered from the bondage of sin is
through a new creation.
    5. What Christian ordinance represents the new creation? Born. 6:4.
    NOTE.—"Those who have been buried with Christ in baptism are to rise
to newness of life, giving a living representation of the life of Christ."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 9, p. 20.
    Walking in newness of life is a result of the new creation.
    6. In what threefold name are Christians baptized? Matt. 28:19.
    NoTE.—"Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who
are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
                                         [9]
at the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have
forsaken the service of Satan, and have become members of the royal family,
children of the heavenly King."—Id., vol. , p. 91. V/
   7. What term does Paul use in speaking of God? Eph. 1:3, 17.
   8. How does,the Father address the Son? Heb. 1:8.
    9. What is the Holy Spirit called in the Scriptures? Acts 5:3, 4;
2 Chron 15:1; Rom. 8:9.
    NoTE.—It will be noticed that in Acts 5:3, Peter says, "lie to the Holy
Ghost," while in verse 4, he says, "thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God,"
thus using the two names interchangeably. In the other references, the Holy
Spirit is appropriately called "the Spirit of God." Hence in the scriptures
cited in questions 7 to 9, we learn that the name God is used of the Father, of
the Son, and of the Spirit—a kind of heavenly family name. These three con-
stitute the Godhead.
    10. How do the three members of the Godhead who wrought together
in creation, also work together in making salvation possible? John
3:16; Gal. 1:4; Eph. 2:18.
    NoTE.—Summing up these scriptures, we see that God "gave His only-
begotten Son," that Jesus "gave Himself for our sins," that it was "through
the eternal Spirit" (Hebrews 9:14) that Christ offered Himself to God. Thus
the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are united in making salvation possible.
    "The Godhead was stirred with pity for the race, and the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit gave themselves to the working out of the plan of redemp-
tion."—"Counsels on Health," p. 222.
    11. How do the same three give effect to the plan of salvation? Rom.
8:1-3, 8-11.
    NOTE.—These passages give us a marvelous picture of how the Father, the
Son, and the Spirit work together in effecting our salvation. In verses 1-3, God
sends the Son to condemn sin. The Spirit of life in the Son sets us free from
the law of sin and death. We then walk in the Spirit. In verses 8-11, the
Spirit is called both "the Spirit of God" and "the Spirit of Christ." This Spirit
dwelling in us restores us to life from being "dead because of sin."
                         Unity of the Godhead
   12. How is the work of the Son related to that of the Father? John
8:28; 5:19; 14:31.
   NoTE.—Here it is twice stated that the Son can do nothing of Himself, but
that He speaks what the Father gives Him to speak, does what the Father
does, and obeys the Father's commands.
   13. How is the work of the Spirit related to that of the Son? John
15:26; 16:13.
   NOTE.—The Son sends the Spirit as His personal representative. The Spirit
does not speak of Himself (that is, His own words), but what He is given to
speak, calling to remembrance whatever the Son has said.
   14. How is the work of the Spirit related to that of the Father? John
14:26; 15:26.
                                       10
    NOTE.—The Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son, that is, as the
Son's representative. The Spirit "proceedeth from the Father," to do His work
in the earth.
    Hence the Father sends the Spirit, and the Son sends the Spirit. The Son
speaks what the Father gives Him to speak, and the Spirit speaks what the Son
gives Him to speak. The Spirit is both the Spirit of God and the Spirit of
Christ. How could there be more perfect accord, more complete unity?
   15. How is the place of the Son in the Godhead emphasized? Col. 2:9.
    16. How is the unity of the Godhead expressed? John 10:30; 14:11.
    NOTE.—The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. The Spirit
is "the Spirit of God" and "the Spirit of Christ." Hence all three dwell together,
and the three are one.
    17. How may the believer enter into this unity? Eph. 3:17; 1 John 4:15.
    NOTE.—"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us"
in employing all the powers of the Godhead in our behalf as sinners. Nothing
is left undone that could be done for our rescue from sin. Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit work unceasingly and untiringly to win us from an unholy to a
holy life. Their purpose is nothing short of bringing us into full unity with
themselves, of adopting us into the heavenly family. Again we must exclaim,
"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
should be called the sons of God." 1 John 3:1.
                               LESSON OUTLINE

  SUNDAY I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY THURSDAY          FRIDAY     SABBATH




             Deity and Pre-existence of Christ
MEMORY VERSE: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the first born of every
  creature: . . . and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist." Col.
  1:15, 17.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 19-26; "The Great Controversy," p. 524.

                               Deity of Christ
    1. Of whom was Christ begotten? Ps. 2:7; John 1:14.
    2. How much was He like the Father? Heb. 1:3, first part; Col. 1:15.
    NOTE.—"He who had been in the presence of the Father from the beginning,
He who was the express image of the invisible God, was alone able to reveal
the character of the Deity to mankind."—"Ministry. of Healing," p. 422.
    "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and in char-
acter. Christ alone is the express image' of the Father; but man was formed
in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His
mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were pure;
his appetites and passions were, under the control of reason. He was holy and
happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect obedience to His
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 45.
    3. What did the Father call His Son? Heb. 1:8.
    NorE.--,Hebrews 1:4 tells us that the Son's name, God, was "a more excel-
lent name" than the angels received, because He obtained it "by inheritance,"
that is, as "heir of all things." A son is the natural heir, and when God made
Christ His heir, He recognized His sonship. This is why the Son bore the same
name as His Father.
    4. When Jesus was born in the. flesh, by what name was He called?
Matt. 1:23.
    NOTE.—Here again the Son is called by the Father's name, "God." This is
because He "was God." John 1:1.
    5. How does Paul affirm the deity of the Son? 1 Tim. 3:16, middle part.
    NOTE.—Paul's language is equivalent to John's when the latter says, "The
Word was made flesh." John 1:14. He affirms that the Jesus who was "born of
a woman" was really God.
    6. What public announcement of His Son's deity did the Father make
on two different occasions? Matt. 3:17; 17:5.
    7. What testimony concerning His deity did Christ Himself give?
John 16:27, 28; 8:58.
    NOTE.—The direct statement of Jesus, "I came forth from the Father,"
reads literally, "I came out of the Father." Putting with this, His testimony in
John 10:38, "The Father is in Me, and I in Him," we have His personal witness
that He truly was "begotten of the Father," asnoh says in 1:14.
                                      [12 7
                         Pre-existence of Christ
   8. What is the source of the Son's life? John 5:26.
   NOTE.--It is plain that the Son possesses the same kind of life as the Father
—called here "life in Himself."
   9. What kind of life does the Son possess? 1 John 5:11, 20.
   10. When does the prophet say the life of the Son began? Micah
5:2, margin.
   NOTE.—While we cannot comprehend eternity—without beginning and
without ending—yet it is clearly affirmed here that the life which Christ pos-
sesses is "from the days of eternity."
   11. What testimony does Jesus Himself bear concerning His exist-
ence before creation? John 17:5.
   12. What testimony to the same thing do Paul and Peter bear? Eph.
1:4; 1 Peter 1:20.
    13. What outstanding proof of the pre-existence of Christ does the
work of creation give? Col. 1:16, 17.
   NoTE.—Cumulative evidence that the Son existed with the Father before
creation is abundant in the Scriptures. In the few passages we have studied
here, we find that Christ was with the Father "before the world was," "from,
the days of eternity," "before the foundation of the world," "before all things."
He was therefore no part of creation, but was "begotten of the Father" in the
days of eternity, and was very God Himself.
                    Sinner's Access to Eternal Life
    14. Is it possible for the sinner to have access to the eternal life that
is in the Son? 1 John 5:11.
    NOTE.—Thank God, eternal life is available to the sinner, but only as a gift.
When God gave His only-begotten Son, He gave all that was in the Son—life,
truth, and the way of obtaining life.
    15. Is there any other way of obtaining life? Verse 12.
    16. How certain is it that we may have eternal life? Verse 13.
    NoTE.—When we "believe on the name of the Son of God," as twice stated
in verse 13, we may know, beyond all doubt that "he that bath the Son hath
We"—eternal life.
    17. How did Jesus make this truth sure in His prayer? John 17:5.
    NoTE.—The teaching of the scriptures in this lesson is little short of over-
whelming in its marvelous meaning to us in the personal life. The Lord Jesus
 Christ, the Son of God, and God Himself, who existed with the Father "from
 the days of eternity," who made the world and all things therein—even this
 Jesus "gave Himself for our sins," and by believing on the name of this Son of
 God, we obtain the gift of eternal life, and may share it with Him throughout
 the eternal ages, world without end.

           DAILY LESSON STUDY:   Place a check mark in the proper space.
  SUNDAY   I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY I SABBATH




                          The Origin of Evil
MEMORY VERSE: "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
  is the transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4.
STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 33-43; "The Great Controversy,"
  pp. 492-504.

           Lucifer—His Nature and Position in Heaven
    1. What is the meaning of the name Lucifer? Whence did he fall?
Isa. 14:12.
    NOTE.—The word Lucifer itself means "light-bearer." The original means
"shining one." The Septuagint renders it "morning star." Our version trans-
lates it well, "son of the morning."
    2. What was the cause of Lucifer's fall? Isa. 14:13-15.
    NOTE.—"Little by little, Lucifer came to indulge a desire for self-exaltation.
`Thou bast set thine heart as the heart of God'. . . . Instead of seeking to make
God supreme in the affections and allegiance of His creatures, it was Lucifer's
endeavor to win their service and homage to himself. And, coveting the honor
which the infinite Father had bestowed upon His Son, this prince of angels
aspired to power which it was the prerogative of Christ alone to wield."—"The
Great Controversy," p. 494.
    3. Under the name "king of Tyrus," what is said of Lucifer's original
nature? Why can this text not consistently refer to the king of Tyre
reigning at that time? Ezek. 28:12, 13.
    NoTE.—When Lucifer was created, he was perfect. It was his own course
in evil that made him a devil.
    The king here referred to had been in Eden,—the garden or paradise of
God. This certainly could not have been said of the literal king of Tyre; but,
on the contrary, it can be said of Lucifer.
    There are several references in the spirit of prophecy to Ezekiel 28:11-17,
and in each of them application is made to Lucifer. See "Patriarchs and
                                     [14 ]
Prophets," page 35, "The Great Controversy," page 494, "Counsels to
Teachers," page 27, and "The Desire of Ages," page 758.
   4. What position did Lucifer hold in heaven? Verse 14.
   NOTE.—In the typical sanctuary service the ark was in the holy of holies.
Above the ark were two cherubim, or angels, covering the ark with their wings.
Between the cherubim was the Shekinah, the visible manifestation of God's
glory. Reasoning from this representation, we would conclude that Lucifer
was one of the angels that stood in the very presence of God in heaven.
    5. How did Lucifer come into existence? What evidence is given
that the angels are personal beings? Ezek. 28:15; Gen. 19:1-3.
    NOTE.—"I - was shown Satan as he once was, a happy, exalted angel. Then
I was shown him as he now is. He still bears a kingly form. His features are
still noble, for he is an angel fallen. But the expression of his countenance is
full of anxiety, care, unhappiness, malice, hate, mischief, deceit, and every evil."
—"Early Writings," p. 152.
                                 Lucifer's Fall
    6. Who was the originator of sin? How did he carry on his work
against God? John 8:44.
    NOTE.—"Sin originated with him, who, next to Christ, had been most
honored of God." "Working with mysterious secrecy, and for a time concealing
his real purpose under an appearance of reverence for God, he endeavored to
excite dissatisfaction concerning the laws that governed heavenly beings, inti-
mating that they imposed an unnecessary restraint. . . . All the powers of his
master-mind were now bent to the work of deception, to secure the sympathy
of the angels that had been under his command"—"The Great Controversy,"
pp. 493,495, 496.
    7. Under whom were the forces of heaven aligned? Rev. 12:7.
    8. Where were Satan and his angels cast? Rev. 12:9; Luke 10:18.
    NOTE.—The picture is complete. Satan leading his angels, Michael (Christ)
and His angels defending the honor of God. The result could not be otherwise.
Satan and his angels were cast out of heaven.
    9. Why did not God destroy the devil?
    ANswEn.—"Even when he was cast out of heaven, Infinite Wisdom did not
destroy Satan, Since only the service of love can be acceptable to God, the
allegiance of His creatures must rest upon a conviction of His justice and
benevolence. The inhabitants of heaven and of the worlds, being unprepared
to comprehend the nature or consequences of sin, could not then have seen
the justice of God in the destruction of Satan. Had he been immediately blotted
out of existence, some would have served God from fear rather than from love.
The influence of the deceiver would not have been fully destroyed, nor would
the spirit of rebellion have been utterly eradicated."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 42.
                    Satan's Supremacy of the Earth
   10. What term, or title, did our Saviour apply to Satan? John 14:30;
12:31.
                                  1157
    11. When and how did Satan lay claim to this position? On what
grounds did he base his claim? Luke 4:5-7.
    NOTE.—"When Satan declared to Christ, The kingdom and glory of the
world are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it, he stated what
was true only in part, and he declared it to serve his own purpose of deception.
Satan's dominion was that wrested from Adam, but Adam was the vicegerent
of the Creator. His was not an independent rule. The earth is God's, and He
has committed all things to His Son."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 129.
    12. How did Jesus contest the adversary's claim? Luke 11:18-20.
    13. How was the great deceiver unmasked? John 12:31, 32.
    NoTE.—"Not until the death of Christ was the character of Satan dearly
revealed to the angels or to the unfallen worlds. The archapostate had so
clothed himself with deception that even holy beings had not understood his
principles."
    "Satan saw that his disguise was -torn away. His administration was laid
open before the unfallen angels and before the heavenly universe. He had
revealed himself as a murderer. By shedding the blood of the Son of God,
be had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. Hence-
forth his work was restricted. Whatever attitude he might assume, he could
no longer await the angels as they came from the heavenly courts, and before
them accuse Christ's brethren of being clothed with the garments of blackness
and the defilement of sin. The last link of sympathy between Satan and the
heavenly world was broken."—Id., pp. 758,761.
                             The Work of Satan
    14. In what guise does Satan work in this earth? Rev. 12:9; 2 Cor.
11:14.
    NOTE.—Many are the deceptions which Satan, the adversary, has used in
gaining control of men's minds. He spreads abroad today the idea that he does
not exist—except in the imaginations of the mind. He deceives others by
masquerading under the guise of the spirits of the dead.
    15. What is the adversary ever seeking to do? 1 Peter 5:8.
    16. Through what means does he work? 1 Peter 2:11; 1 John 2:15-17.
    NOTE.—"In all ages, temptations appealing to the physical nature [appetite
and passion] have been most effectual in corrupting and degrading mankind.
Through intemperance, Satan works to destroy the mental and moral powers
that God gave to man as a priceless endowment. . . . Through sensual in-
dulgence, Satan seeks to blot from the soul every trace of likeness to God."—
Id., p. 122.
    17. What cheering assurance does Christ give to His disciples?
John 16:33.
    NoTE.—We contend with a defeated foe. The consciousness of his defeat
by the Man Christ Jesus, weakens. Satan's courage. Jesus has conquered the
foe, and by making Him our strength, His victory may be ours. Christ will
make us more than conquerors. Rom. 8:33-37.

  SUNDAY    I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY I SABBATH




                Creation the Direct Act of God
MEMORY VERSE: "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the
  host of them by the breath of His mouth. . . . For He spake, and it was done;
  He commanded, and it stood fast." Ps. 33:6-9.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 44-51, 111-116.

                     Creation the Direct Act of God
   1. How do the Scriptures account for this earth's existence? Gen.
1:1; John 1:1-3, 14; Heb. 1:2.
   Nom.—Repeatedly Bible writers ascribe creation to an act of God. To
deny this truth does not merely involve the rejection of Genesis, chapters one
and two, but a denial of the entire Bible and of its Author.
   2. What Bible statements tell how the world was created? Heb.
11:3; Ps. 33:6, 9.
   NOTE.—We know from the record in Genesis that there were stages in the
process of creation day by day, and the Bible is equally clear that the material
out of which the world was formed was spoken into existence by God.
    3. How long was God in creating the heaven and the earth? Ex.
20:11; 31:17.
                                     [ 17 ]
    NOTE.—The word "day" in these scriptures is exactly the same as used in
scores of other places in the Old Testament, for a twenty-four-hour period.
   "Like the Sabbath, the week originated at creation, and it has been pre-
served and brought down to us through Bible history. God Himself measured
off the first week as a sample for successive weeks to the close of time. Like
every other, it consisted of seven literal days. Six days were employed in the
work of creation; upon the seventh God rested, and He then blessed this day
and set it apart as a day of rest for man."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. in.
    4. What memorial of creation has existed from the earliest times?
Ex. 20:8-11.
   NoTE.—The Sabbath comes to us only through the creation week. This
weekly division of time is not governed by the stars in their courses, by the
moon, the sun, or any of the heavenly bodies. God set the Sabbath apart as a
day of sacred rest, and as such it has come down to us through the ages, pre-
served by Providence against the onslaught of, the enemies of God's law. It is
clearly traceable in the languages of the most ancient people.
    5. What law of nature was established at creation? Gen. 1:11, 12, 21.
    NoTE.—"He who set the starry worlds on high, and tinted with delicate
skill the flowers of the field, who filled the earth and the heavens with the
wonders of His power, when He came to crown His glorious work, to place one
in the midst to stand as ruler of the fair earth, did not fail to create a being
worthy of the hand that gave him life. The genealogy of our race, as given by
inspiration, traces back its origin, not to a line of developing germs, mollusks,
and quadrupeds, but to the great Creator. Though formed from the dust,
Adam was 'the son of God.' "—Id., p. 45.
    6. By whom do all things consist? Col. 1:16, 17.
    NOTE.—"God has ordained laws for the government, not only of living
beings, but of all the operations of nature. Everything is under fixed laws,
which cannot be disregarded. But while everything in nature is governed by
natural laws, man alone, of all that inhabits the earth, is amenable to moral
law."—Id., p. 52. By the laws which He has established, all nature continues
as God made it. The curse which came upon the earth after man's transgres-
sion, while it brought death to all that dwelt upon the earth, did not alter the
law of divine maintenance of all life. The laws of God as expressed in nature
still continue to operate, else death would instantly bring to an end all that
lives upon the earth.
                         Creation Days Literal
    7. In what simple words do the Scriptures describe the creation
days? Gen. 1:5, last part; 8, 13, 19, 23, 31.
    8. What names were given to the evening and the morning? Verse
5, first part.
    9. What great lights did God create to rule the day and the night?
Verses 14-18.
    NorE.—"The Bible recognizes no long ages in which the earth was slowly
evolved from chaos. Of each successive day of creation, the sacred record
declares that it consisted of the evening and the morning, like all other days
that have followed."—Id., p. 112.
                                     L18]
                             A Finished Work
    10. How does God describe His finished work? Gen. 1:31.
    NOTE.—"As the earth came forth from the hand of its Maker, it was exceed-
ingly beautiful. Its surface was diversified with mountains, hills, and plains,
interspersed with noble rivers and lovely lakes; but the hills and mountains
were not abrupt and rugged, abounding in terrific steeps and frightful chasms,
as they now do; the sharp, ragged edges of earth's rocky framework were
buried beneath the fruitful soil, which everywhere produced a luxuriant growth
of verdure. There were no loathsome swamps nor barren deserts. Graceful
shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the eye at every turn. The heights were
crowned with trees more majestic than any that now exist. The air, untainted
by foul miasma, was clear and healthful. The entire landscape outvied in
beauty the decorated grounds of the proudest palace. The angelic host viewed
the scene with delight, and rejoiced at the wonderful works of God."—Id., p. 44.
    11. When was the work of God in creating the world finished? Heb.
4:3, 4; Gen. 1:1.
    NOTE.—"As regards this world, God's work of creation is completed. For
`the works were finished from the foundation of the world.' But His energy is
still exerted in upholding the objects of His creation. It is not because the
mechanism that has once been set in motion continues to act by its own inherent
energy, that the pulse beats, and breath follows breath; but every breath,
every pulsation of the heart, is an evidence of the all-pervading care of Him in
whom 'we live, and move, and have our being.' It is not because of inherent
power that year by year the earth produces her bounties, and continues her
motion around the sun. The hand of God guides the planets, and keeps them
in position in their orderly march through the heavens."—Id., p. 115. (See
Isa. 40:26.)
    12. As the result of sin, what came upon the world? Gen. 3:17-19.
    NorE.—"From that time the race would be afflicted by Satan's temptations.
Instead of the happy labor heretofore appointed them, anxiety and toil were to
be their lot. They would be subject to disappointment, grief, and pain, and
finally to death. Under the curse of sin, all nature was to witness to man of
the character and results of rebellion against God. . . . So long as Adam
remained loyal to Heaven, all nature was in subjection to him. But when he
rebelled against the divine law, the inferior creatures were in rebellion against
his rule. Thus the Lord, in His great mercy, would show men the sacredness
of His law, and lead them, by their own experience, to see the danger of setting
it aside, even in the slightest degree."—Id., pp. 59, 60.
    Mankind was now subject to the "law of sin and death." (Rom. 8:2.) The
earth and all that was therein would "wax old as doth a garment." (Heb.
1:10-12.) Yet God's love and mercy would follow His creatures, wooing them
back to Himself.
    13..Though sin has entered and marred the earth,.for what may man
hope? Isa. 65:17; 2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 21:5.
    NOTE.—"In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called a country. There
the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to fountains of living waters. The tree
of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the service
of the nations. There are everflowing streams, clear as crystal, and beside them
waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the ransomed
                                       [ 19 ]
of the Lord. There the wide-spreading plains swell into hills of beauty, and the
mountains of God rear their lofty summits. On those peaceful plains, beside
those living streams, God's people, so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a
home."—"The Great Controversy," p. 675.
    14. How will creation be commemorated in the new earth? Isa.
66:22, 23.
    NOTE.—"God teaches that we should assemble in His house to cultivate
the attributes of perfect love. This will fit the dwellers of earth for the mansions
that Christ has gone to prepare for all who love Him. There they will assemble
in the sanctuary from Sabbath to Sabbath, from one new moon to another,
to unite in loftiest strains of song, in praise and thanksgiving to Him who
sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever."—"Testimonies," vol.
6, p. 368.
                               LESSON OUTLINE
    [The need for the truths in this lesson to be widely disseminated is apparent.
"Here is clearly set forth the origin of the human race; and the divine record is so
plainly stated that there is no occasion for erroneous conclusions. God created man
in His own image. Here is no mystery. There is no ground for the supposition that
man was evolved, by slow degrees of development, from the lower forms of animal
or vegetable life. Such teaching lowers the great work of the Creator to the level of
man's narrow, earthly conceptions."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 44. 45.]

             DAILY LESSON STUDY:
  SUNDAY       MONDAY TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY THURSDAY I FRIDAY I SABBATH




                 The Creation and Fall of Man
MEMORY VERSE: "So God created man in His own image, in the image of God
  created He him; male and female created He them." Gen. 1:27.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 45-62.

                              Creation of Man
   1. When was man created? Gen. 1:27, 31, last part.
   NOTE.—Man was created on the sixth day of the first week of this world's
existence. He was a product of creation, not of evolution through a long
process.
                                 { 20I
    "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and in
character. Christ alone is the express image' of the Father; but man was
formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of
God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections
were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He
was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect obedience to
His will."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 45.
    2. Out of what did God form man? Gen. 2:7; 3:19. last part.
    NOTE.—God made man from the dust of the earth, which He had already
created. Into man God breathed the breath of life, and man became a living
soul.
    3. How was the woman formed? What lesson of equality and one-
ness may we draw from this? Gen. 2:20-24; Eph. 5:28, 29.
    NOTE.—"God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided 'an help
meet for him,'—a helper corresponding to him,—one who was fitted to be
his companion, and who could be one with him in love and sympathy. Eve
was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was
not to control him, as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior,
but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him. A part
of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self; showing
the close union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this
relation."—"Potriarchs and Prophets," p. 46.
    4. Upon what were Adam and Eve continually dependent for life?
Gen. 3:22, 23.
    NoTE.—"The holy pair . . . were full of the vigor imparted by the tree
of life, and their intellectual power was but little less than that of the angels."
—Id., p. 50.
    "In order to possess an endless existence, man must continue to partake of
the tree of life. Deprived of this, his vitality would gradually diminish until
life should become extinct."—Id., p. 60.
    5. In whose image and likeness was man made? What was true of
him physically and spiritually? Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:1, 2; 1:31; Ecd. 7:29.
    NoTE.—"God made man upright; He gave him noble traits of character,
with no bias toward evil. He endowed him with high intellectual powers, and
presented before him the strongest possible inducements to be true to his
allegiance. Obedience, perfect and perpetual, was the condition of eternal
happiness. On this condition he was to have access to the tree of life."—
Id., p. 49.
                              The Eden Home
    6. What description is given of man's first home? Gen. 2:8, 9.
    NOTE.—"The home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other homes
as their children should go forth to occupy the earth. That home, beautified
by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace. Men, in their pride,
delight in magnificent and costly edifices, and glory in the works of their own
hands; but God placed Adam in a garden. This was his dwelling. The blue
heavens were its dome; the earth, with its delicate flowers and carpet of living
green, was its floor; and the leafy branches of the goodly trees were its canopy.
                                       [ 21 ]
. . . In the surroundings of the holy pair was a lesson for all time,—that
true happiness is found, not in the indulgence of pride and luxury, but in com-
munion with God through His created works."—/bid.
   7. What was appointed to man? Verse 15.
   NOTE.—"Our Creator, who understands what is for man's happiness, ap-
pointed Adam his work. The true joy of life is found only by the working
men and women. . . . The Creator has prepared no place for the stagnating
practice of indolence."—Id., p. 50.
   8. Upon what did man's continuance in this blissful abode depend?
Verse 17.
   NOTE.—"The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has been,
—just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first parents,—perfect
obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness."—"Steps to Christ," p. 67.
                             The Fall of Man
   9. When Satan was cast out of heaven, into what place was he cast?
Rev. 12:9.
   10. In what guise did he appear in Eden? Gen. 3:1.
   NoTE.—"In order to accomplish his work unperceived, Satan chose to
employ as his medium the serpent,—a disguise well adapted for his purpose
of deception. The serpent was then one of the wisest and most beautiful
creatures on the earth. It had wings, and while flying through the air presented
an appearance of dazzling brightness, having the color and brilliancy of
burnished gold. Resting in the rich-laden branches of the forbidden tree, and
regaling itself with the delicious fruit, it was an object to arrest the attention
and delight the eye of the beholder. Thus in the garden of peace lurked the
destroyer, watching for his prey."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 53.
    11. What warning was given our first parents? Gen. 2:16, 17.
    NoTE.—"The angels warned them [Adam and Eve] to be on their guard
against the devices of Satan; for his efforts to ensnare them would be un-
wearied. . . . The angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating herself
from her husband while occupied in their daily labor in the garden; with him
she would be in less danger from temptation than if she were alone. But ab-
sorbed in her pleasing task, she unconsciously wandered from his side. On
perceiving that she was alone, she felt an apprehension of danger, but dis-
missed her fears, deciding that she had sufficient wisdom and strength to
discern evil and to withstand it."—Ibid.
    12. What inducement was offered by the serpent for partaking of
the forbidden tree? Gen. 3:4-6.
    NoTE.—"From God, the fountain of wisdom, proceeds all the knowledge
that is of value to man, all that the intellect can grasp or retain. The fruit of
the tree representing good and evil is not to be eagerly plucked because it is
recommended by one who was once a bright angel in glory. He has said that
if men eat thereof, they shall know good and evil; but let it alone. The true
knowledge comes not from infidels or wicked men. The word of God is light
and truth. The true light shines from Jesus Christ, who `lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.'"—"Counsels to Teachers," pp. 360, 361.
                                      [ 22
    13. What experience came to man after sinning? Upon whom did
man place the blame for his sin? Upon whom did the woman lay the
blame? Verses 8-13.
    NOTE.—"Adam could neither deny nor excuse his sin; but instead of mani-
festing penitence, he endeavored to cast the blame upon his wife, and thus
upon God Himself: 'The woman whom Thou gayest to be with me, she gave
me of the tree, and I did eat.' He who, from love to Eve, had deliberately
chosen to forfeit the approval of God, his home in Paradise, and an eternal
life of joy, could now, after his fall, endeavor to make his companion, and
even the Creator Himself, responsible for the transgression. So terrible is the
power of sin.
    "When the woman was asked, 'What is this that thou hast done?' she
answered, 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.' Why didst Thou create
the serpent? Why didst Thou suffer him to enter Eden?'—theSe were the
questions implied in her excuse for her sin. Thus, like Adam, she charged God
with the responsibility of their fall."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 57, 58.
    14. What sentence was passed upon Adam and Eve? Verses 17-19.
    15. What privilege were the sinful pair denied? Verses 22-24.
    16. What promise was made of ultimate redemption? What does this
promise comprehend? Verse 15; 1 John 3:8.
                                LESSON OUTLINE
   ["Christian ministers, physicians, teachers, have a broader work than many have
recognized. They are not only to minister to the people, but to teach them to minister.
They should not only give instruction in right principles, but educate their hearers to
impart these principles. Truth that is not lived, that is not imparted, loses its life-
giving power, its healing virtue. Its blessing can be retained only as it is shared."—

  SUNDAY   MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY I SABBATH



                          Sin and Its Penalty
MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
  death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12.
STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 67; "The Great Controversy," pp.
  483-491; "Early Writings," pp. 145, 146.

                         Origin and Nature of Sin
   1. By how many did sin enter this earth? Rom. 5:12.
   NorE.—"Many who teach that the law of God is not binding upon man,
urge that it is impossible for him to obey its precepts. But if this were true,
why did Adam suffer the penalty of transgression? The sin of our first
parents brought guilt and sorrow upon the world, and had it not been for the
goodness and mercy of God, would have plunged the race into hopeless despair.
Let none deceive themselves. 'The wages of sin is death.' The law of God can
no more be transgressed with impunity now than when sentence was pro-
nounced upon the father of mankind."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 61.
   2. How is sin defined? What law is here referred to? 1 John 3:4;
James 2:9-12.
   3. What entered that the offense might abound? When and where
did the offense first abound? Rom. 5:20, 17, 19.
   4. What indicates that the law of God was known before it was
given in written form on Mount Sinai? Gen. 26:5; Ex. 16:28.
   5. Under what circumstances was sin first referred to by name?
Gen. 4:7.
   6. With whom did sin originate in heaven? Ezek. 28:14, 16; Ex. 25:20.
   NorE.—"Sin originated with him, who, next to Christ, had been most
honored of God, and was highest in power and glory among the inhabitants of
heaven. Lucifer, 'son of the morning,' was first of the covering cherubs, holy
and undefiled. He stood in the presence of the great Creator, and the ceaseless
beams of glory enshrouding the eternal God, rested upon him."—Id., p. 35.

                                 Results of Sin
   7. What did Lucifer's sin lead God do? Ezek. 28:17; Rev. 12:7-9.
   NOTE.—No place was "found any more in heaven" for Lucifer and his
angels. They had forfeited their right to the purity and joy of heaven and
association with its sinless inhabitants.
   8. What loss did Adam and Eve sustain because of transgression?
Gen. 3:22-24.
   NOTE.—"After their sin, Adam and Eve were no longer to dwell in Eden.
They earnestly entreated that they might remain in the home of their innocency
                                        [24
and joy. They confessed that they had forfeited all right to that happy abode,
but pledged themselves for the future to yield strict obedience to God. But they
were told that their nature had become depraved by sin ; they had lessened
their strength to resist evil, and had opened the way for Satan to gain more
ready access to them. . . . In humility and unutterable sadness they bade
farewell to their beautiful home, and went forth to dwell upon the earth, where
rested the curse of sin."—Id., p. 61.
   9. How far-reaching were the results of Adam's transgression? Rom.
5:12, last part; 19, 21.
    10. What nature have all inherited? What law of heredity rules in
the flesh? Rom. 7:18, 21-23.
    Nora.—The apostle Paul says, "When I would do good, evil is present with
me." The law of evil, by heredity, was the law operating in the nature of Paul
before he found full deliverance. He recognized that deliverance came not from
within, but rather from without. (Rom. 8:3.) The law of sin and death (Rom.
7:23) is without doubt the carnal law working in one's members, and certainly
is not the law of God, as is sometimes claimed. Under the new covenant, God
writes His law in the heart .of the converted; but the law of sin and death is
an evil tyrant which rules, unless broken by the power of Christ, until death
claims its victim—the sinner.
   11. From what did the apostle cry for deliverance? Rom. 7:24, 25.
   NoTE.—It is said that the Romans inflicted a terrible death upon their
criminals by chaining a dead body, or corpse, face to face with the victim.
There was no escape from that putrid form until death claimed the criminal.
Thank God that Jesus has delivered us, if surrendered fully to Him, from
bondage to the sinful nature, which all have inherited.
    12. What has been appointed unto all men? What follows death?
Heb. 9:27.
    NOTE.—Tliis scripture refers to the death that all must die because of sin.
It would not be just for saint and sinner to die in the same manner on this
earth, if that were the ultimate penalty for a course of rebellion and trans-
gression.
   13. What is the wages of sin? Rom. 6:23.
   14. How completely will the sinner be destroyed? Mal. 4:1, 3; Nahum
1:9; Rev. 21:8.
   15. Through whom come justification and life? Rom. 5:17-19; 6:23.
    NoTE.—It is often charged by atheists that there is no fairness on the part
of God in bringing us into this world under the condemnation of death. It
is true that without our will we inherit a dying nature. But God has made
abundant provision for our deliverance. Where sin abounded grace did much
more abound. Our heavenly Father provided that One,Christ Jesus, should
taste death for every man, and that He should be rigt   eousness for all who
accept the gift. If men turn away from the abundant provision for justification,
and continue in sin, then they must die the second death for their own deeds
in the flesh, not for Adam's transgression. John 3:19.

                               LESSON OUTLINE
    ["It was the one with the smallest gift who left his talent unimproved. In this
is given a warning to all who feel that the smallness of their endowments excuses
them from service for Christ. If they could do some great thing, how gladly would
they undertake it ; but because they can serve only in little things, they think them-
selves justified in doing nothing. In this they err."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p.
355.]

  SUNDAY    I MONDAY I TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY I FRIDAY             SABBATH




                      The Plan of Redemption
MEMORY VERSE: "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten
  Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
  John 3:16.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 63-70; "Early Writings," pp.
  125-127.
                                 The Promises
    1. Before Adam and Eve were driven from the garden because of
their sin, what promise was made for their future deliverance? Gen. 3:15.
    NOTE.—"To man the first intimation of redemption was communicated in
the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden. The Lord declared, will
put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed;
it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.' This sentence, uttered
in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a promise. While it foretold
war between man and Satan, it declared that the power of the great adversary
would finally be broken."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 65, 66.
                                       1 26
     "Had not God specially interposed, Satan and man would have entered
into an alliance against Heaven; and instead of cherishing enmity against
Satan, the whole human family would have been united in opposition to God.
. . . It is the grace that Christ implants in the soul which creates in man
enmity against Satan. Without this converting grace and renewing power,
man would continue the captive of Satan, a servant ever ready to do his
bidding."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 505,506.
     2. What did Eve say when her first son was born? Gen. 4:1.
     NorE.—"The Saviour's coming was foretold in Eden. When Adam and Eve
first heard the promise, they looked for its speedy fulfillment. They joyfully
welcomed their first-born son, hoping that he might be the Deliverer. But the
fulfillment of the promise tarried. Those who first received it, died without
the sight."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 31.
     3. To whom was the promise of redemption through the Seed re-
newed? Gen. 12:1-3; 17:4-8.
     4. What promise was made to David? What promise was made con-
cerning the son of David? 2 Sam. 7:12, 13, 16; Isa. 9:6, 7.

                      Christ the Promised Seed,
    5. What announcement was made by the angel to Mary? Luke
1:31-33.
    6. How did the apostle Paul explain "the seed of Abraham"? Gal.
3:16, 29.
    NOTE.—"Through type and promise, God 'preached before the gospel unto
Abraham' And the patriarch's faith was fixed upon the Redeemer to come.
Said Christ to the Jews, 'Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see
My day; and he saw it, and was glad' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 154.
    7. Through what does justification come? Verses 6, 8, 9.
    8. How was the promise of the seed fulfilled? Gal. 4:4, 5.
    9. What will the seed of the woman do to the serpent, or Satan?
Gen. 3:15; Rom. 16:20.
    10. By the lifting up of Christ on the cross, what will be done with
the prince of this world? John 12:31, 32.
    NOTE.—"Satan saw that his disguise was torn away. His administration
was laid open before the unfallen angels and before the heavenly universe.
He had revealed himself as a murderer. By shedding the blood of the Son of
God, he had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings.
Henceforth his work was restricted. Whatever attitude he might assume, he
could no longer await the angels as they came from the heavenly courts, and
before them accuse Christ's brethren of being clothed with the garments of
blackness and the defilement of sin. The last link of sympathy between Satan
and the heavenly world was broken.
    "Yet Satan was not then destroyed. The angels did not even then under-
stand all that was involved in the great controversy. The principles at stake
were to be more fully revealed. And for the sake of man, Satan's existence
must be continued. Man as well as angels must see the contrast between the
 Prince of Light and the prince of darkness."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 761.
                                    1 27]
  11. What purpose concerning Satan was fulfilled by the cross?
Heb. 2:14, 15.
                           Complete Restoration
    12. From what has Christ washed us? Rev. 1:5; Isa. 1:18.
    NOTE.—" 'Come now, and let us reason together,' is the Creator's invitation
                        . God does not force the will of His creatures. He
to the beings He has made
cannot accept an homage that is not willingly and intelligently given. A mere
forced submission would prevent all real development of mind or character; it
would make man a mere automaton. Such is not the purpose of the Creator.
He desires that man, the crowning work of His creative power, shall reach the
highest possible development. He sets before us the height of blessing to which
He desires to bring us through His grace. He invites us to give ourselves to
Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose whether
we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the
sons of God."—"Steps to Christ," p. 48.
   13. What was the direct purpose of the redemptive work of Christ?
Gal. 4:4-6.
   14. What did Jesus come to seek and to save? Luke 19:10.
   NoTE.—Our Lord came into this world to recover all that was lost to man,
eternal life, his Eden home, and the earth, which was his lost dominion. We
may expect, then, the full restoration of all these.
    15. In connection with what event will all things be restored? Acts
3:20i 21.
    NOTE.—The heavens must receive Christ until the restitution of all things.
When the Father sends Jesus, then, the restoration will take place. The apostle
does not here distinguish between the second coming of Christ and the return
at the close of the thousand years. Most of that which was lost will be restored
at the second advent, but the earth is not fully restored till the close of the
millennium.
   16. When and how will immortality be bestowed? 1 Cor. 15:51-54;
1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
    17. What promise is made to those who overcome? Rev. 2:7; 22:14.
    NorE.—"Jesus opens wide the pearly gates, and the nations that have kept
the truth enter in. There they behold the Paradise of God, the home of Adam
in his innocency. . . . Transported with joy, he [Adam] beholds the trees
that were once his delight,—the very trees whose fruit he himself had gathered
in the days of his innocence and joy. He sees the vines that his own hands have
trained, the very flowers that he once loved to care for. . . . The Saviour leads'
him to the tree of life, and plucks the glorious fruit, and bids him eat."—"The
Great Controversy," pp. 646-648.

       The Promise and Work of the Holy Spirit
MEMORY VERSE: "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
  children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them
  that ask Him?" Luke 11:13.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 662-680.

                        Promise of the Comforter
   1. What promise of the Spirit was given through the prophet Joel?
Joel 2:23, 28-32.
    NOTE.—The early rain came in Palestine in the autumn or early winter at
sowing time to cause the grain to begin to grow. The latter rain came toward
spring for ripening the harvest. The promise in these last days is of the early
and latter rain, that the reaper may overtake the sower, and that the work
may be finished speedily.
    2. What assurance did Christ give to His disciples? John 14:16, 17.
    NoTE.—"The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity,
Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest
that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on
earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his location or his
personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible
to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended on
high."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 669.
                                      ( 29 ]
   3. How willing is the heavenly Father to grant the Spirit? What is
necessary to the reception of the gift? Luke 11:13.
   4. Who makes intercession for the saints? Rom. 8:26, 27.
   5. What evidence is there that the Holy Spirit was known in Old
Testament times? Zech. 4:6.
   NoTE.—"Before this the Spirit had been in the world; from the very be-
ginning of the work of redemption He had been moving upon men's hearts.
But while Christ was on earth, the disciples had desired no other helper. Not
until they were deprived of His presence would they feel their need of the
Spirit, and then He would come."—I bid.

                            Work of the Spirit
    6. What special work is the Spirit to do for gospel witnesses? What
assurance have we that the promise is available today? John 14:26;
Matt. 10:18-20.
     NoTE.—The thought in Matthew 10:18, 19 is not that no consideration be
given to the testimony before kings and rulers, but that we "be not anxious"
(A. R. V.) as to our testimony. How often the Holy Spirit brings quickly to
mind a scripture or an incident, when needed, in presenting the truth I
     7. Of what was the Spirit to convince? John 16:8-11; see margin of
verse 8.
    8. What is the one unpardonable sin? Matt. 12:31, 32; compare Eph.
4:30.
     NoTE.—The sin against the Holy Ghost is not just some single great sin for
which there is no forgiveness; but a continual resistance of the Spirit's voice
until the conscience is seared and feels no conviction of wrong. This was true
of the Pharisees. Again and again they refused to believe until they were so
hardened as to attribute the work of the Spirit through Christ to Satan himself.
Consequently there was no hope for them, since they had rejected the only
means for bringing them to repentance.
    "What constitutes the sin against the Holy Ghost?—It is willfully attribut-
ing to Satan the work of the Holy Spirit. For example, suppose that one is a
witness of the special work of the Spirit of God. He has convincing evidence
that the work is in harmony with the Scriptures, and the Spirit witnesses with
his spirit that it is of God. Afterward, however, he falls under temptation;
pride, self-sufficiency, or some other evil trait, controls him; and rejecting all
the evidence of its divine character, he declares that that which he had before
acknowledged to be the power of the Holy Spirit was the power of Satan.
It is through the medium of His Spirit that God works upon the human heart;
and when men willfully reject the Spirit, and declare it to be from Satan, they
cut off the channel by which God can communicate with them. By denying the
evidence which God has been pleased to give them, they shut out the light
which had been shining in their hearts, and as the result they are left in
darkness."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 634.
   9. Who is the effectual teacher of truth? Through what means does
He work? John 16:13; Eph. 6:17.
   NoTE.—By the Spirit came the word of God; but by the same Spirit comes
the understanding of that word. God chose to reveal truth to men specially
                                      [301
chosen by Him, giving evidence of their calling, and through these agencies the
Holy Spirit gave the Scriptures to the world. Let us beware that we do not
listen to another spirit. It is safe to follow a "Thus saith the Lord." We can
never be misguided thus. The word is the voice of the Spirit to the soul. By
neglecting its study or rejecting its precepts we turn away from His instruction
and help.
    10. What means are used in the new birth? John 3:5; 1 Peter 1:23.
    11. How does Christ abide in the heart of the believer? Eph. 3:16, 17;
John 15:7.
    NoTE.—"It is through the word that Christ abides in His followers. This is
the same vital union that is represented by eating His flesh and drinking His
blood. The words of Christ are spirit and life."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 677.
    12. If the Spirit dwells in us, what fruits will be manifested? What
contrast is drawn? Gal. 5:22, 23, 19-21.
                     Our Relationship to the Spirit
    13. By whom are believers to be led in their Christian experience?
Rom. 8:14.
    NoTE.—Being led by the Spirit suggests submission, not only at the begin-
ning of the Christian way, but throughout the life. We cannot use the Spirit;
He must use us. When we thus surrender all to the Spirit, He will guide us,
through the word, in all our ways.
    14. In whose name are we baptized? What relationship does this
establish? Matt. 28:19.
    NOTE.—"There are three living persons of the heavenly trio; in the name
of these three great powers—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—those
who receive Christ by living faith are baptized, and these powers will co-
operate with the obedient subjects of heaven in their efforts to live the new life
in Christ."—"Special Testimonies," Series B, No.7 , page 63.
    Since the divine Trinity is composed of three persons, there is established a
personal relationship between the Godhead and the one baptized. To such an
experience every child of God is invited.
    15. What is the test of genuine Christianity? Rom. 8:9, last part.
    NOTE.—"The promise of the Spirit is not appreciated as it should be. Its
fulfillment is not realized as it might be. It is the absence of the Spirit that
makes the gospel ministry so powerless. Learning, talents, eloquence, every
natural or acquired endowment, may be possessed; but without the presence
of the Spirit of God, no heart will be touched, no sinner be won to Christ. On
the other hand, if they are connected with Christ, if the gifts of the Spirit are
theirs, the poorest and most ignorant of His disciples will have a power that
will tell upon hearts."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 328.
                              LESSON OUTLINE
   ["Discreet and humble women can do a good work in explaining the truth to the
people in their homes. The word of God thus explained will do its leavening work,
and through its influence whole families will be converted."—"Testimonies," vol. 9,
pp. 128, 129.]

                               Conversion
MEMORY VERSE: "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water
  and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." John 3:5.
STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter on "The Sinner's Need of Christ;"
  "The Desire of Ages," pp. 167-177.

                        The Need of Conversion
   1. What did Jesus declare was an essential preparation for enter-
ing the kingdom? Matt. 18:3; John 3:3.
   2. What is necessary to forgiveness of sin? Acts 3:19.
   3. How is man's inability to change his own heart illustrated? Jer.
13:23.
   4. What is impossible to the carnal, or fleshly, mind? Horn. 8:7.
                           Steps in Conversion
     5. Through whom is man freed from bondage to sin? Rom. 7:24, 25.
    6. What is the first step for those to take who are under conviction
of sin? What does godly sorrow work? Acts 2:38; 2 Cor. 7:10.
     Nom.-"Repentance includes sorrow for sin, and a turning away from it.
We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness; until we turn away from
it in heart, there will be no real change in the life.
    "There are many who fail to understand the true nature of repentance.
Multitudes sorrow that they have sinned, and even make an outward reforma-
tion, because they fear that their wrongdoing will bring suffering upon them-
selves. But this is not repentance in the Bible sense. They lament the suffering,
                                     [32]
rather than the sin. Such was the grief of Esau when he saw that the birthright
was lost to him forever."—"Steps to Christ," p. 26.
    7. How does repentance come? Acts 5:31.
    8. Having been brought to sorrow for sin, what is the penitent ad-
monished to do? 1 John 1:9.
    NoTE.—"The conditions of obtaining mercy of God, are simple and just
and reasonable. The Lord does not require us to do some grievous thing in
order that we may have the forgiveness of sin. We need not make long and
wearisome pilgrimages, or perform painful penances, to commend our souls
to the God of heaven or to expiate our transgression; but he that confesseth
and forsaketh his sin shall have mercy."—/d., p. 42.
    "True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges par-
ticular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before God only;
they may be wrongs that should be confessed to individuals who have suffered
injury through them; or they may be of a public character, and should then
be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite and to the
point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty."—Id., p. 43.
    9. In whom do we receive forgiveness for our sins? Eph. 1:7; Acts
10:43.
    NoTE.—If a creditor should cancel a financial obligation, how quickly the
debtor would accept the fact ! Should we be less believing that God indeed
forgives when we confess sin? When faith grasps the promise and rests in the
provision, forgiveness of sins is a fact, and the sinner has peace with God.
    10. What does God further promise to do? 1 John 1:9, last part;
Ezek. 36:26.
     NoTE.—"It is the will of God to cleanse us from sin, to make us His chil-
dren, and to enable us to live a holy life. So we may ask for these blessings,
and believe that we receive them, and thank God that we have received them.
It is our privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law
without shame or remorse."—Id., pp. 55, 56.
     11. How does the Saviour illustrate the change in man's nature? By
what means is it effected? John 3:3-5; 1 Peter 1:23.
     NoTE.—"The plants and flowers grow not by their own care or anxiety or
 effort, but by receiving that which God has furnished to minister to their life.
 The child cannot, by any anxiety or power of its own, add to its stature. No
 more can you, by anxiety or effort of yourself, secure spiritual growth. The
 plant, the child, grows by receiving from its surroundings that which ministers
 to its life,—air, sunshine, and food. What these gifts of nature are to animal
 and plant, such is Christ to those who trust in Him."—Id., p. 72.
     12. Upon entering into this experience, what is the child of God said
 to be? 2 Cor. 5:17.
     13. What is expected of the converted? By what means attained?
1 Peter 2:1, 2.
                          Rendering Obedience
    14. Unto what are we created in Christ Jesus? Eph. 2:10.
    15. Upon what condition is eternal life offered? Matt. 19:16-19.
                                      [33]
    NOTE.—"The conditions of eternal life, under grace, are just what they were
in Eden,—perfect righteousness, harmony with God, perfect conformity to
the principles of His law. . . . God has made provision that we may become
like unto Him, and He will accomplish this for all who do not interpose a
preverse will, and thus frustrate His grace."—"Thoughts From tke Mount of
Blessing," p. 116.
   This perfect obedience we can render only through Christ. Phil. 1:11.
   16. What is evidence that a person has been justified? By what will
the just finally be adjudged worthy? James 2:21, 22, 10-12.
                                LESSON OUTLINE

                         Justification by Faith
MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
  through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom. 5:1.
STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter on "Faith and Acceptance;" "Acts of
  the Apostles," p. 476.

                              The Penalty Paid
    1. What has been the experience of all men? Were there no provi-
sion of grace, what would be the ultimate result? Rom. 3:23; 6:23.
    2. According to the first promise, through whom would deliverance
come? Gen. 3:15; Matt. 1:21.
    NorE.—The very first promise of redemption indicates that salvation ulti-
mately would come through another,—the seed of the woman,—and not
through mere human effort.
   3. Who paid the penalty of sin for every man? Matt. 20:28; 1 Cor. 15:3.
   4. In addition to the payment of the penalty, what gift was provided
for the sinner? Rom. 5:17; 2 Cor. 5:21.
                                        [ 34 1
   Nom.—"Only the covering which Christ Himself has provided, can make
us meet to appear in God's presence. This covering, the robe of His own right-
eousness, Christ will put upon every repenting, believing soul. 'I counsel thee,'
He says, 'to buy of Me . . . white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and
that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.'
   "This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one thread of human
devising. Christ in His humanity wrought out a perfect character, and this
character He offers to impart to us."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 311.
    5. To what is this righteousness likened? How was this illustrated
in the return of the prodigal? Isa. 61:10; Luke 15:21, 22.
    NOTE.—"Your heavenly Father will take from you the garments defiled
by sin. In the beautiful parabolic prophecy of Zechariah, the high priest
Joshua, standing clothed in filthy garments before the angel of the Lord,
represents the sinner. And the word is spoken by the Lord, 'Take away the
filthy garments from him. And unto him He said, Behold, I have caused thine
iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. . . .
So they set a fair miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments.' [Zech.
3:3-5.1 Even so God will clothe you with the 'garments of salvation,' and
cover you with 'the robe of righteousness.' "—Id., p. 206.

                         Righteousness Imputed
    6. How was Abraham accounted righteous? Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6.
    7. On what condition only was Abraham justified, or freed from guilt?
What cannot the keeping of the law do for any man? Rom. 4:1-4; 3:20.
    NoTE.—Man stands before heaven's judgment bar as a sinner. There is
nothing he can do within himself to atone for past sin. Could he live a perfect
life in full harmony with law, that could not satisfy justice for past guilt. He
owes obedience to the law. There can be no working up of merit for justi-
fication.
    8. By what is man freely justified? Rom. 3:24; Eph. 2:8, 9.
    NOTE.—Grace is unmerited favor. Man does not merit justification—it is a
free gift.
    "Men need to learn that the blessings of obedience, in their fullness, can
be theirs only as they receive the grace of Christ. It is His grace that gives man
power to obey the laws of God. It is this that enables him to break the
bondage of evil habit. This is the only power that can make him and keep him
steadfast in the right path."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 115.
    9. In what way must we accept justification? Rom. 5:1.
    NOTE.—"You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them away. You
have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and ask that He will
wash away your sins, and give you a new heart. Then believe that He does
this because He has promised." "If you believe the promise,—believe that you
are forgiven and cleansed,—God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just
as Christ gave the paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was
healed. It is so if you believe it. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole,
but say, 'I believe it; it is so, not because I feel it, but because God has
promised."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 53, 55.
                                      { 35]
                           Imparted Righteousness
    10. Does the grace of God in forgiving our past sins free us from
obligation to obey the law? Born. 6:14, 15.
   11. How is the law established in the heart of the believer? Rom. 3:31.
    12. If one commit sin after being justified, what does he prove himself
to be? Gal. 2:17, 18.
    13. What is the purpose of setting men free from the "law of sin and
death"? Born. 8:2, 4.
   14. Being justified, in what do we stand? Horn. 5:1, 2.
    15. By what means are we enabled to live righteous lives? Horn.
5:10; Eph. 3:17-19.
    NOTE.-When we give ourselves to God, He forgives our sins and gives us
His righteousness, accepting us just as if we had never sinned. This is God's
imputed righteousness. But this is not all. He changes the heart and abides in
our hearts day by day, enabling us to live righteously. This is God's imparted
righteousness. (See "Steps to Christ," page 67.)
   "The righteousness by which we are justified is imputed. The righteousness
by which we are sanctified is imparted. The first is our title to heaven; the
second is our fitness for heaven."-Review and Herald, June 4, 1895, quoted in
"Christ Our Righteousness," p. 118.
   16. At every stage in Christian growth, in whom are we complete?
Col. 2:10.
   NOTE.-"The proud heart strives to earn salvation; but both our title to
heaven and our fitness for it are found in the righteousness of Christ."-"The
Desire of Ages," p. 300.
                               LESSON OUTLINE

                           Sanctification
MEMORY VERSE: "Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth." John
  17:17.
STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pp. 461-478; "Acts of the Apostles," p.
  560; "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 65-67.

                    Sanctification at Conversion
   1. By what significant name are God's people designated? Ps. 34:9;
Rom. 1:7.
   NoTE.—The original word for "saint" means set apart, to make holy, etc.;
therefore saint means a person sanctified, or set apart from the sinful world,
even as the Sabbath was sanctified, or set apart from the common days of the
week for a holy use.
   2. From what are God's sons and daughters called? 2 Cor. 6:14, 16-18.
   NOTE.—God calls for a separation from unbelievers in thought, word, deed,
and from intimate association with them. Those who are thus separated are
called sons and daughters of God. In this sense they are sanctified; but the
work of sanctification, unlike justification, is a progressive work, continued
throughout the Christian experience.
   3. What truth, which all should know, did Paul accept? With this
recognition, what did he do? 1 Tim. 1:15; Phil. 3:13, last part; 14.
    NOTE.—We would not understand from these texts that Paul was living in
known sin, but in these expressions he stated his feeling of unworthiness and
the longing for greater perfection of character. The nearer a soul draws to
God, the less he sees in self of which to boast.
    "There can be no self-exaltation, no boastful claim to freedom from sin,
on the part of those who walk in the shadow of Calvary's cross. They feel
that it was their sin which caused the agony that broke the heart of the Son of
God, and this thought will lead them to self-abasement. Those who live nearest
to Jesus discern most clearly the frailty and sinfulness of humanity, and their
only hope is in the merit of a crucified and risen Saviour."—"The Great Con-
troversy," p. 471.
  4. Among the ancient prophets, what two outstanding examples of
humility are presented? Isa. 6:5; Dan. 9:3-5.
  5. In whom are we sanctified? 1 Cor. 1:2; 6:11.

                       Sanctification in the Life
   6. What shows that sanctification is a progressive work in the life?
2 Peter 3:18, first part.
   NoTE.—"The Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification is
                                      1 371
progressive. When in conversion the sinner finds peace with God through the
blood of the atonement, the Christian life has just begun. Now he is to 'go on
unto perfection.'"—"The Great Controversy," p. 470.
    "Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, a day, but of a
lifetime. It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the result of con-
stantly dying to sin, and constantly living for Christ. Wrongs cannot be
righted nor reformations wrought in the character by feeble, intermittent
efforts. It is only by long, persevering effort, sore discipline, and stern conflict,
that we shall overcome. We know not one day how strong will be our conflict
the next. So long as Satan reigns, we shall have self to subdue, besetting sins
to overcome; so long as life shall last, there will be no stopping place, no point
which we can reach and say, I have fully attained. Sanctification is the result
of lifelong obedience."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 560, 561.
    7. By what means is sanctification experienced? John 17:17; Rom.
15:16.
    NOTE.—There is no true sanctification aside from the word, and the work
of the Holy Spirit.
    "Great reproach has been cast upon the work of the Holy Spirit by the
errors of a class that, claiming its enlightenment, profess to have no further
need of guidance from the word of God. They are governed by impressions
which they regard as the voice of God in the soul. But the spirit that controls
them is not the Spirit of God. This following of impressions, to the neglect of
the Scriptures, can lead only to confusion, to deception and ruin."—"The
Great Controversy," Introduction, p. vii,
    8. What is the result of obedience and sanctification? 1 Peter 1:2.
    '.NOTE.—"Since the law of God is 'holy, and just, and good,' a transcript
of the divine perfection, it follows that a character formed by obedience to
that law will be holy. Christ is a perfect example of such a character. He
says, 'I have kept My Father's commandments.' I do always those things
that please Him.' The followers of Christ are to become like Him,—by the
grace of God, to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy
law. This is Bible sanctification."—"The Great Controversy," p. 469.
   9. What are we admonished to pursue if we wish to see the Lord?
Heb. 12:14.
   NOTE.—The Revised Version rendering of Hebrews 12:14 is, "Follow after
peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the
Lord."
   10. Of what should we be partakers? What contributes to this ex-
perience? 1 Peter 1:15; Heb. 12:10.
   NOTE.—"When tribulation comes upon us, how many of us are like Jacob!
We think it the hand of an enemy; and in the darkness we wrestle blindly
until our strength is spent, and we find no comfort or deliverance. To Jacob
the divine touch at break of day revealed the One with whom he had been
contending,—the Angel of the covenant; and, weeping and helpless, he fell
upon the breast of Infinite Love, to receive the blessing for which his soul
longed. We also need to learn that trials mean benefit, and not to despise the
chastening of the Lord, nor faint when we are rebuked of Him."—"Thouglits
From the Mount of Blessing," p. 25.
                                      [ 38 7
   11. What standard must the Christian reach? 1 Thess. 5:23.
    12. Who will bring to perfection this work of grace? Phil. 2:12, 13; 1:6.
    NOTE.— It is God who brings to perfection the work begun at conversion.
It is our part to surrender to the work of the Spirit through the word. This is
our first work. Then it remains for us to co-operate with divine agencies. The
apostle James says, "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and
he will flee from you." James 4: 7. It is for us to submit and then resist. Divine
power, working through human minds and hearts will develop character
acceptable to God.

   ["It, is not the Lord's purpose that ministers should be left to do the greatest part
of the work of sowing the seeds of truth. Men who are not called to the ministry are
to labor for their Master according to their several ability."—"Testimonies," vol.
9, p. 128.]

                    NDEX    ANOTHER INVALUABLE AID



  F OR locating a comment on any particular scripture, the
  Index is invaluable. For example: Suppose in your Sab-
  bath school lesson you have John 1:29, and you want to
  know if this text is commented on in the writings of Mrs.
  White. Turning to your Index, you will find that this text
  has been quoted or commented upon forty-six times in the
  various books of the spirit of prophecy. Similarly you will
  find John 3:16 referred to sixty times.
     There are 1,195 places in the writings that mention some
  part of John's Gospel, and 1,075 places where you will find
  portions of the book of Isaiah used in some way. This will
  give you just a little idea of how valuable a help the Index
  really can be in the study of the Sabbath school lessons, or,
  in fact, in any phase of Bible study.

  A Bible Teacher says:
      "Next to the Bible and the Testimonies themselves I believe this
  volume will be most helpful for our people. To anyone who desires to
  know what is contained in the messages to God's people in these days
  this book is almost indispensable. Get one at once, is my advice."
