                              God's Family
   MEMORY VERSE: "Christ . . . loved the church, and gave Himself for it; that
He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that He
might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish." Eph. 5:25-27.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Ministry of Healing," pp. 415-426; "Church ManuaL"
pp. 7, 8; "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 9-11.

                  From the Earthly to the Heavenly
    1. Who constitute the church of God? 1 Cor. 12:12, 13, 25-28.
    NoTE.—"The church is God's fortress, His city of refuge, which He holds in
a revolted world. Any betrayal of the church is treachery to Him who has
bought mankind with the blood of His only-begotten Son. From the beginning,
faithful souls have constituted the church on earth. In every age the Lord has
had His watchmen, who have borne a faithful testimony to the generation in
which they lived. These sentinels gave the message of warning ; and when they
were called to lay off their armor, others took up the work. God brought these
witnesses into covenant relation with Himself, uniting the church on earth
with the church in heaven. He has sent forth His angels to minister to His
church, and the gates of hell have not been able to prevail against His people."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 11.
    2. In addition to the earthly record, where are the names of church
members recorded? Heb. 12:23; Luke 10:20.

    NoTE.—"The I AM is the Daysman between God and humanity, laying
His hand upon both. He who is 'holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from

sinners,' is not ashamed to call us brethren. In Christ the family of earth and
the family of heaven are bound together. Christ glorified is our brother.
Heaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is enfolded in the bosom of
Infinite Love."-"The Desire of Ages," pp. 25, 26.
                     A Marvelous Transformation
     5. What are we by nature? Eph. 2:2, 3; 1 John 3:10.
     6. By what means is this change from the earthly to the heavenly family
accomplished? John 3:3, 7; Gal. 4:1-7.
     7. What is the first step toward membership in God's family? Heb.
11:6; Gal. 3:26.
    NOTE.-"The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders itself to
God. Then that power which no human eye can see, creates a new being in
the image of God."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 173.
     8. What is essential? John 1:12; Rev. 3:20.
    9. What change will then be wrought in the life? 2 Cor. 5:17.
    NoTE.-"Through this simple act of believing God, the Holy Spirit has be-
gotten a new life in your heart. You are as a child born into the family of God,
and He loves you as He loves His Son."-"Steps to Christ," p. 56.
     10. Of whose nature do we then partake? What must we do? 2 Peter
1:4; 1 John 3:1-3.
    NOTE.-"You cannot change your heart, you cannot of yourself give to God
its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You can give Him your will;
He will then work in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure.
Thus your whole nature will be brought under the control of the Spirit of
Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him, your thoughts will be in
harmony with Him."-"Steps to Christ," p. 52.
    "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes possession of
the new heart. A change is wrought which man can never accomplish for
himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural element into human
nature."-"The Desire of Ages," pp. 323, 324.
     11. What is Christ's desire concerning the church? Eph. 5:25-27.
     12. Who is the father of this family? Matt. 6:9.
                  Named With That Worthy Name
    13. Whose name does this family bear? Matt. 28:19; Eph. 3:14, 15.
    14. What should all do who bear this family name? 2 Tim. 2:19, last
part; 1 Cor. 10:31.
    15. What will distinguish the remnant church? Rev. 14:1; 22:4.
    NorE.-The Father's name stands for His character. Ex. 33:18, 19; 34:5-7.
His character is the reflection of the moral law. Ps. 19:7; 119:142, 172. Under
the new covenant, Christ writes the law on the fleshy tables of every surrendered
heart. Heb. 8:10; 2 Cor. 3:3. Thus the life, the character, is conformed to
the image of Christ. 1 John 3:1, 2. This is the experience of the faithful
members of the remnant church, gathered from "every nation, and kindred,
and tongue, and people." Rev. 14:6, 12; 12:17.
    "The central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every other in the
                                       {4 }
whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the restoration in the human soul
of the image of God. From the first intimation of hope in the sentence pro-
nounced in Eden to that last glorious promise of the Revelation, 'They shall see
His face; and His,name shall be in their foreheads,' the burden of every book
and every passage of the Bible is the unfolding of this wondrous theme,—man's
uplifting,—the power of God, 'which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ.'"—"Education," pp. 125, 126.

         The Church the Object of God's Love
   MEMORY VERSE: "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they' may forget, yet will I not

continually before Me." Isa. 49:15, 16.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 11-16.

                          God's Great Purpose
    1. For what purpose did God choose Abraham? Gen. 26:4.
    2. What was God's purpose concerning the church in the wilderness?
Acts 7:38; Deut. 7:6-8.
    3. If God's people had been perfectly obedient, what would have been
the result? Deut. 28:1, 13.
    NOTE.—"To God's people and His institutions in this generation as well as
to ancient Israel belong the words written by Moses through the Spirit of
Inspiration. . . . Even these words fail of reaching the greatness and the
glory of God's purpose to be accomplished through His people."—"Medical
Ministry," p. 26.
    4. On what condition only would God have thus highly exalted His
people? Deut. 4:9; 7:9.
                      God's Love for His Church
    5. What is the measure of God's love for His church? Jer. 31:3;
Eph. 5:25.
    6. How is Christ's interest and care for His church symbolized? Rev.
1:12, 13, 20; 2:1.
    NoTE.—"Christ is spoken of as walking in the midst of the golden candle-
sticks. Thus is symbolized His relation to the churches. He is in constant com-
munication with His people. He knows their true state. He observes their
order, their piety, their devotion. Although He is high priest and mediator in
the sanctuary above, yet He is represented as walking up and down in the midst
of His churches on the earth. With untiring wakefulness and unremitting
vigilance, He watches to see whether the light of any of His sentinels is burning
dim or going out. If the candlesticks were left to mere human care, the
                                      [6]
flickering flame would languish and die; but He is the true watchman in the
Lord's house, the true warden of the temple courts. His continued care and
sustaining grace are the source of life and light."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 586.
    "God's love for His church is infinite. His care over His heritage is unceas-
ing. He suffers no affliction to come upon the church but such as is essential
for her purification, her present and eternal good. He will purify His church
even as He purified the temple at the beginning and close of His ministry on
earth. All that He brings upon the church in test and trial comes that His
people may gain deeper piety and more strength to carry the triumphs of the
cross to all parts of the world. He has a work for all to do. There must be
constant enlargement and progress. The work must extend from city to city,
from country to country, and from nation to nation, moving continually on-
ward and upward, established, strengthened, and settled."—"Testimonies,'.'
vol. 9, p. 228.
    7. Where is Christ always to be found? Matt. 18:20.
    8. What assurance does He give to such? Verse 19.
    NoTE.—"We may tell the Lord, with the simplicity of a child, exactly what
we need. We may state to Him our temporal matters, asking Him for bread
and raiment as well as for the bread of life and the robe of Christ's righteous-
ness. . . .
    "The gifts of Him who has all power in heaven and earth are in store for
the children of God. Gifts so precious that they come to us through the costly
sacrifice of the Redeemer's blood; gifts that will satisfy the deepest craving of
the heart; gifts lasting as eternity, will be received and enjoyed by all who will
come to God as little children. Take God's promises as your own, plead them
before Him as His own words, and you will receive fullness of joy."—"The
Mount of Blessing," pp. 190, 191.
    "At times the Lord may seem to have forgotten the perils of His church,
and the injury done her by her enemies. But God has not forgotten. Nothing
in this world is so dear to the heart of God as His church. It is not His will that
worldly policy shall corrupt her record. He does not leave His people to be
overcome by Satan's temptations. He will punish those who misrepresent Him,
but He will be gracious to all who sincerely repent. To those who call upon
Him for strength for the development of Christian character, He will give all
needed help."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 590.
                              God's Vineyard
   9. What figure does the prophet Isaiah employ to represent the church?
Isa. 5:7, first part.
   10. Who is the keeper of this vineyard? Isa. 27:2, 3, first part.
   11. How constant and tender is the keeper's care for His vineyard?
Isa. 27:3; Ps. 121:2-8.
              The Object of Christ's Supreme Regard
   12. What assurance is given that God will never forget one of His
children? Isa. 49:14, 15.
   NOTE.—"Though enemies may thrust them into prison, yet dungeon walls
cannot cut off the communication between their souls and Christ. One who
                                       [6j
sees their every weakness, who is acquainted with every trial, is above all
earthly powers; and angels will come to them in lonely cells, bringing light
and peace from heaven. The prison will be as a palace; for the rich in faith
dwell there, and the gloomy walls will be lighted up with heavenly light, as
when Paul and Silas prayed and sung praises at midnight in the Philippian
dungeon."—"The Great Controversy," p. 627.
    13. Where are their names engraved? Isa. 49:16.
    14. What is the object of Christ's supreme regard? Eph. 1:22, 23;
Acts 20:28.
    NbTE.—"Nothing else in this world is so dear to God as His church. Nothing
is guarded by Him with such jealous care."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 42.
    "The church, enfeebled and defective, needing to be reproved, warned, and
counseled, is the only object upon earth upon which Christ bestows His supreme
regard."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 49.
    "The Elder Brother of our race is by the eternal throne. He looks upon
every soul who is turning his face toward Him as the Saviour. He knows by
experience what are the weaknesses of humanity, what are our wants, and
where lies the strength of our temptations; for He was 'in all points tempted
like as we are, yet without sin.' He is watching over you, trembling child of
God. Are you tempted? He will deliver. Are you weak? He will strengthen.
Are you ignorant? He will enlighten. Are you wounded? He will heal. The
Lord lelleth the number of the stars;' and yet 'He healeth the broken in heart,
and bindeth up their wounds' . .
    "Human love may change; but Christ's love knows no change. When we
cry to Him for help, His hand is stretched out to save."—"The Ministry of
 Healing," pp. 71, 72.

  SABBATH I SUNDAY 1 MONDAY I TUESDAY 1 WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY



              The Church the Temple of God
   MEMORY VERSE: "In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation
of God through the Spirit." Eph. 2:22.
   STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 35-37.

                               The Building
   1. What is the church said to be? Eph. 2:21, 22; 1 Cor. 3:9, 16, 17;
Heb. 3:6.
    2. Who is its builder? Matt. 16:17, 18.
   3. What prophecies are being fulfilled in the building of Christ's
spiritual temple? Zech. 6:12, 13; Amos 9:11, 12.
                             The Foundation
   4. What is the foundation of this wonderful structure? 1 Cor. 3:11.
   NOTE.—" 'Upon this rock,' said Jesus, 'I will build My church.' In the
presence of God, and all the heavenly intl
                                        ligences, in the presence of the un-
                                   C7
seen army of hell, Christ founded His church upon the living Rock. That Rock
is Himself,—His own body, for us broken and bruised. Against the church built
upon this foundation, the gates of hell shall not prevail."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 413.
    5. What is the Rock upon which it rests? Deut. 32:3, 4; 1 Cor. 10:4.
    NorE.—"Human power and human might did not establish the church of
God, and neither can they destroy it. Not on the rock of human strength, but
on Christ Jesus, the Rock of Ages, was the church founded, 'and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it.' The presence of God gives stability to His
cause. 'Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man,' is the word that
comes to us. 'In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.' God's
glorious work, founded on the eternal principles of right, will never come to
nought. It will go on from strength to strength, 'not by might, nor by power,
but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.' "—"Prophets and Kings," pp.
595, 596.
    6. What is said of this foundation? 2 Tim. 2:19, first part.
    NOTE.—"Let none seek to tear away the foundations of our faith—the
foundations that were laid at the beginning of our work, by prayerful study
of the word and by revelation. Upon these foundations we have been building
for the last fifty years. Men may suppose that they have found a new way, and
that they can lay a stronger foundation than that which has been laid. But this
is a great deception. Other foundation can no 'man lay than that which has
been laid.
    "In the past, many have undertaken the building of a new faith, the estab-
lishment of new principles. But how long did their building stand? It soon
fell; for it was not founded upon the Rock.
    "Did not the first disciples have to meet the sayings of men? Did they not
have to listen to false theories, and then, having done all, to stand firm, saying,
`Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid'?
    "So we are to hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end."
 —"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 296, 297.
    7. When the storm breaks, how will the church, built on this foundation,
be affected? Matt. 7:24, 25.
    NOTE.—"How feeble the church appeared when Christ spoke these words !
There was only a handful of believers, against whom all the power of demons
and evil men would be directed; yet the followers of Christ were not to fear.
Built upon the Rock of their strength, they could not be overthrown.
    "For six thousand years, faith has builded upon Christ. For six thousand
years the floods and tempests of Satanic wrath have beaten upon the Rock of
our salvation; but it stands unmoved."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 413.
                  Kind of Material for the Building
    8. What materials does God desire to use in the construction of His
church? 1 Cor. 3:12, first part.
    NoTE.—"Of surpassing beauty and unrivaled splendor was the palatial build-
ing which Solomon and his associates erected for God and His worship. Gar-
nished with precious stones, surrounded by spacious courts with magnificent
approaches, and lined with carved cedar and burnished gold, the temple struc-
ture, with its broidered hangings and rich furnishings, was a fit emblem of the
living church of God on earth, which through the ages has been building in
                                     [8I
accordance with the divine pattern, with materials that have been likened to
`gold, silver, precious stones,' polished after the similitude of a palace' Of this
spiritual temple Christ is 'the chief cornerstone ; in whom all the building fitly
framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.' "—"Prophets and
Kings," p. 36.
    9. What will result from the use of wood, hay, and stubble? 1 Cor. 3:12,
last part, 13.
    NOTE.—"Paul and the other apostles, and all the righteous who have lived
since then, have acted their part in the building of the temple. But the structure
is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have a work to do, a part
to act. We are to bring to the foundation material that will stand the test of
fire,—gold, silver, and precious stones, 'polished after the similitude of a palace.'
To those who thus build for God, Paul speaks words of encouragement and
warning: 'If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.' The Christian who faithfully pre-
sents the word of life, leading men and women into the way of holiness and
peace, is bringing to the foundation material that will endure, and in the king-
dom of God he will be honored as a wise builder."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 599.
    10. What other illustrations are used to show Christ's relation to the
church? 1 Peter 2:3, 4; Isa. 28:16.
    11. When laid upon the living stone, what do the lifeless stones from
the quarry of the world become? 1 Peter 2:5.
    NOTE.—"Christ, the true foundation, is a living stone; His life is imparted
to all that are built upon Him. 'Ye also, as living stones, are built up a
spiritual house.' Each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a
holy temple in the Lord.' The stones become one with the foundation; for a
common life dwells in all. That building no tempest can overthrow; for—
                      " 'That .which shares the life of God,
                           With Him surviveth all.'"
                                            —"The Mount of Blessing," p. 216.
                                A Quiet Work
    12. In building Solomon's temple, where was the work of preparing the
stones done? 1 Kings 6:7, first part.
    13. What precaution was taken against noise or confusion in the work
of building? 1 Kings 6:7, second part.
    NOTE.—"The Jewish temple was built of hewn stones quarried out of the
mountains; and every stone was fitted for its place in the temple, hewed,
polished, and tested, before it was brought to Jerusalem. And when all were
brought to the ground, the building went together without the sound of ax
or hammer. This building represents God's spiritual temple, which is com-
posed of material gathered out of every nation, and tongue, and people, of all
grades, high and low, rich and poor, learned and unlearned. These are not dead
substances, to be fitted by hammer and chisel. They are living stones, quarried
out from the world by the truth ; and the great Master Builder, the Lord of the
temple, is now hewing and polishing them, and fitting them for their respective
places in the spiritual temple. When completed, this temple will be perfect in
all its parts, the admiration of angels and of men; for its Builder and Maker
is God."—"Te stimonies," vol. 9, p. 180.

                     . God's Dwelling Place
 . 14. While God's dwelling place is in heaven, where did He promise also
to dwell? Ex. 25:8; 1 Kings 6:11-13.
    15. Where will God by His Spirit dwell today? Where will He reveal
His glory? Eph. 2:22; Isa. 60:1-3.
    NoTE.—"The Lord has provided His church with capabilities and blessings,
that they may present to the world an image of His own sufficiency, and that
His church may be complete in Him, a continual representation of another,
even the eternal world, of laws that are higher than earthly laws. His church
is to be a temple built after the divine similitude, and the angelic architect has
brought his golden measuring rod from heaven, that every stone may be hewed
and squared by the divine measurement, and polished to shine as an emblem
of heaven, radiating in all directions the bright, clear beams of the Sun of
Righteousness. The church is to be fed with manna from heaven, and to be
kept under the sole guardianship of His grace. Clad in complete armor of light
and righteousness, she enters upon her final conflict. The dross, the worthless
material, will be consumed, and the influence of the truth testifies to the world
of its sanctifying, ennobling character. .
    "To His church, Christ has given ample facilities, that He may receive a
large revenue of glory from His redeemed, purchased possession. The church,
being endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His depository, in which
the wealth of His mercy, His love, His grace, is to appear in full and final
display. The declaration in His intercessory prayer, that the Father's love is
as great toward us as toward Himself, the only-begotten Son, and that we
shall be with Him where He is, forever one with Christ and the Father, is a
marvel to the heavenly host, and it is their great joy. The gift of His Holy
Spirit, rich, full, and abundant, is to be to His church as an encompassing wall
of fire, which the powers of hell shall not prevail against. In their untainted
purity and spotless perfection, Christ looks upon His people as the reward of
all His suffering, His humiliation, and His love,•and the supplement of His
glory,—Christ, the great center from which radiates all glory. 'Blessed are they
which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.' "—"Testimonies to
 Ministers," pp. 17-19.

                       The Kingdom of God
   MEMORY VERSE: "The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the
kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the
Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve
and obey Him." Dan. 7:27.
   STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pp. 61-70; "The Desire of Ages," pp.
829-835.
                  The Kingdoms of Grace and Glory
   1. What was the burden of the message proclaimed by John the Baptist?
also by Jesus? Matt. 3:1, 2; 4:17.
                                      [103
    NOTE.-"All who come to Christ for a clearer knowledge of the truth, will
receive it. He will unfold to them the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
and these mysteries will be understood by the heart that longs to know the
truth. A heavenly light will shine into the soul-temple, and will be revealed to
others as the bright shining of a lamp on a dark path."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," p. 36.
    2. How did Jesus answer questions of the Pharisees concerning His
kingdom? Luke 17:20, 21.
    NOTE.—"Not by the decisions of courts or councils or legislative assemblies,
not by the patronage of worldly great men, is the kingdom of Christ established,
but by the implanting of Christ's nature in humanity through the work of the
Holy Spirit. 'As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on His name; which were born, not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.' Here is
the only power that can work the uplifting of mankind. And the human agency
for the accomplishment of this work is the teaching and practicing of the word
of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 509.
    3. For what are Christians to pray? 'When will this prayer be answered?
Matt. 6:9, 10; 2 Tim. 4:1.
    NorE.—"The disciples of Christ were looking for the immediate coming of
the kingdom of His glory; but in giving them this prayer Jesus taught that the
kingdom was not then to be established. They were to pray for its coming as
an event yet future. But this petition was also an assurance to them. While
they were not to behold the coming of the kingdom in their day, the fact that
Jesus bade them pray for it, is evidence that in God's own time it will surely
come.
    "The kingdom of God's grace is now being established, as day by day
hearts that have been full of sin and rebellion yield to the sovereignty of His
love. But the full establishment of the kingdom of His glory will not take place
until the second coming of Christ to this world. 'The kingdom and dominion,
and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,' is to be given to
`the people of the saints of the Most High.' They shall inherit the kingdom
prepared for them 'from the foundation of the world' And Christ will take to
Himself His great power and will reign."—"The Mount of Blessing," p. 159.
    4. Who is the king in this kingdom? John 18:37.
    5. What is the territory of this kingdom? Ps. 103:19-22.
    NorE.—"If you cultivate faithfully the vineyard of your soul, God is mak-
ing you a laborer together with Himself. And you will have a work to do not
only for yourself, but for others. In representing the church as the vineyard,
Christ does not teach that we are to restrict our sympathies and labors to our
own numbers. The Lord's vineyard is to be enlarged. In all parts of the
earth He desires it to be extended. As we receive the instruction and grace of
 God, we should impart to others a knowledge of how to care for the precious
 plants. Thus we may extend the vineyard of the Lord. God is watching for
evidence of our faith, love, and patience. He looks to see if we are using every
spiritual advantage to become skillful workers in His vineyard on earth, that
we may enter the Paradise of God, that Eden home from which Adam and
 Eve were excluded by transgression."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 282.
     6. Who are the subjects of this kingdom? Eph. 2:19; Rev. 14:12;
 Dan. 7:27.
                                       [ 11 I
    NOTE.—"If the church will put on the robe of Christ's righteousness, with-
drawing from all allegiance with the world, there is before her the dawn of a
bright and glorious day. God's promise to her will stand fast forever. He will
make her an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. Truth, passing by
those who despise and reject it, will triumph. Although at times apparently
retarded, its progress has never been checked. When the message of God meets
with opposition, He gives it additional force, that it may exert greater influence.
Endowed with divine energy, it will cut its way through the strongest barriers,
and triumph over every obstacle."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 601.
    7. What has God promised to do under the new covenant? By what
agency will it be accomplished? Heb. 8:10; Ezek. 36:26, 27; 2 Cor. 3:3.
    NOTE.—"He who has God's law written in the heart, will obey God rather
than men, and will sooner disobey all men than deviate in the least from the
commandment of God. God's people, taught by the inspiration of truth, and
led by a good conscience to live by every word of God, will take His law,
written in their hearts, as the only authority which they can acknowledge or
consent to obey. The wisdom and authority of the divine law are supreme."—
"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 361.
    8. How will God's law be- regarded by each loyal subject? With what
result? Ps. 119:97, 165; Rom. 3:31.
    NOTE.—"The beauty of holiness is to appear in its native luster in contrast
with the deformity and darkness of the disloyal, those who have revolted from
the law of God. Thus we acknowledge God, and recognize His law, the founda-
tion of His government in heaven and throughout His earthly dominions. His
authority should be kept distinct and plain before the world; and no laws are
to be acknowledged that come in collision with the laws of Jehovah. If in
defiance of God's arrangements the world be allowed to influence our decisions
or our actions, the purpose of God is defeated. However specious the pretext,
if the church waver here, there is written against her in the books of heaven
a betrayal of the most sacred trusts, and treachery to the kingdom of Christ."
—"Testimonies to Ministers," pp. 16, 17.
    9. What was Christ's attitude toward His Father's law? Ps. 40:7, 8;
Matt. 5:17.
                       The Breadth of God's Law
   10. For what should we ever pray? Why? Ps. 119:18, 19.
   NorE.—"To this day there are still aspects of truth which are dimly seen,
connections that are not understood, and far-reaching depths in the law of
God that are uncomprehended. There is immeasurable breadth, dignity, and
glory in the law of God."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education," p. 238.
    11. What constitutes the duty of all men? Eccl. 12:13, 14.
                                                                                +-

                   Southern African Division
                                                                                4—
                                       [12]
    NoTE.—"This is the end of the matter; all hath been heard: Fear God, and
keep His commandments; for this is the duty of all men." R. V., margin.
    "God justly claims the love and obedience of all His creatures. He has given
them in His law a perfect standard of right. But many forget their Maker, and
choose to follow their own way in opposition to His will. They return enmity
for love that is as high as heaven and as broad as the universe. God cannot
lower the requirements of His law to meet the standard of wicked men; neither
can man, in his own power, meet the demands of the law. Only by faith in
Christ can the sinner be cleansed from guilt, and be enabled to render obedience
to the law of his Maker."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 425.
                           The Eternal Throne
    12. How is God's throne related to His dwelling place? Ps. 11:4; 80:1;
1 Kings 8:30.
    NorE.—"The throne was the symbol of supreme power and dignity. Simi-
larly, 'to sit upon the throne' implied the exercise of regal power."—Smith's
Bible Dictionary.                                               •
    13. Where, also, does Christ reign in His spiritual kingdom? Isa. 57:15;
Eph. 3:17.
                                   Worship
    14. Who is worthy of adoration? of worship? Ps. 100:3, 4; Rev. 4:11.
    NoTE.—"Although God dwells not in temples made with hands, yet He
honors with His presence the assemblies of His people. He has promised that
when they come together to seek Him, to acknowledge their sins, and to pray
for one another, He will meet with them by His Spirit. But those who
assemble to worship Him should put away every evil thing. Unless they wor-
ship Him in spirit and truth and in the beauty of holiness, their coming to-
gethei will be of no avail. Of such the Lord declares: 'This people draweth
nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their
heart is far from Me. But in vain they do worship Me.' Those who worship
God must worship Him 'in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such
to worship Him'
    " 'The Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before
Him.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 50.
    15. How should true worship be rendered? Ps. 95:1-3, 6; John 4:23, 24.
    NorE.—"The religion that comes from God is the only religion that will
lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the divine
Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the mind, giving us a new capacity
for knowing and loving God. It will give us a willing obedience to all His
requirements. This is true worship. It is the fruit of the working of the Holy
Spirit. By the Spirit every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer is ac-
ceptable to God. Wherever a soul reaches out after God, there the Spirit's
working is manifest, and God will reveal Himself to that soul. For such wor-
shipers He is seeking. He waits to receive them, and to make them His sons and
daughters."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 189.
    "Reverence should be shown also for the name of God. Never should that
 name be spoken lightly or thoughtlessly. Even in prayer its frequent or needless
 repetition should be avoided. 'Holy and reverend is His name.' Angels, as
 they speak it, veil their faces. With what reverence should we, who are fallen
 and sinful, take it upon our lips l"—"Education," p. 243.

  SABBATH SUNDAY   MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY' THURSDAY I FRIDAY



                 Allegiance Founded on Love
    MEMORY VERSE: "Know ye that the Lord He is God: it is He that bath
made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture."
Ps. 100:3.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pp. 436-438; "Patriarchs and
Prophets," pp. 147-153.

                   The Creation and Its Memorial
    1. With what sublime words does God's sacred Book open? Gen. 1:1.
    2. When God spoke His law from Sinai, what reason did He give for the
observance of the seventh-day Sabbath? Ex. 20:8-11.
    3. What is the true ground of worship? Rev. 4:10, 11.
    NOTE.—" 'The importance of the Sabbath as a memorial of creation is that
it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to God,'—because He
is the Creator, and we are His creatures. 'The Sabbath, therefore, lies at the
very foundation of divine worship; for it teaches this great truth in the most
impressive manner, and no other institution does this. The true ground of
divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely, but of all worship, is
found in the distin,ction between the Creator and His creatures. This great
fact can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.' It was to keep
this truth ever before the minds of men, that God instituted the Sabbath in
Eden; and so long as the fact that He is our Creator continues to be a reason
why we should worship Him, so long the Sabbath will continue as its sign and
memorial. Had the Sabbath been universally kept, man's thoughts and affec-
tions would have been led to the Creator as the object of reverence and
worship, and there would never have been an idolater, an atheist, or an infidel.
The keeping of the Sabbath is a sign of loyalty to the true God, 'Him that made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.' It follows that
the message which commands men to worship God and keep His command-
ments, will especially call upon them to keep the fourth commandment."
—"The Great Controversy," pp. 437, 438.
    4. At this time, when the theory of evolution is competing with the
doctrine of creation, what message is due the world? Rev. 14:6, 7.
                        A Sublime Act of Faith
   5. Of whom was Abraham the father? What was he called? Rom. 4:11;
James 2:21-23.
                                                                  4-

                                      14
     6. How did God prove Abraham when preparing him for this high
honor? Gen. 22:1, 2.
     NorE.—The Revised Version of Genesis 22:1 reads, "God did prove Abra-
ham," instead of "tempt" as in the King James Version.
     "The command was expressed in words that must have wrung with anguish
that father's heart: 'Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest,
. . . and offer him for a burnt offering.' Isaac was the light of his home, the
solace of his old age, above all else the inheritor of the promised blessing. The
loss of such a son by accident or disease would have been heart-rending to the
fond father; it would have bowed down his whitened head with grief; but he
was commanded to shed the blood of that son with his own hand. It seemed
to him a fearful impossibility."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 148.
      7. What was Abraham's attitude toward this command that must have
wrung his heart with anguish? Gen. 22:3.
      8. When nearing the place of offering, what did Abraham say to the
young man accompanying them? What was done on the mount? Verses
5, 9, 10.
      NorE.—"As they were about to begin the journey of the third day, the
 patriarch, looking northward, saw the promised sign, a cloud of glory hovering
over Mount Moriah, and he knew that the voice which had spoken to him was
from heaven."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 151.
      On reaching the place of sacrifice, the altar was erected. Isaac yielded a
willing submission, and so he became a sharer in his father's faith.
      "Now the last words of love are spoken, the last tears are shed, the last
 embrace is given."—/d., p. 152.
                           God and His Throne
    9. What forms the foundation of God's throne? Ps. 89:14, R. V.;
97:2, R. V.
    NorE.—In the Revised Version the word translated "habitation" is rendered
"foundation."
    In the most holy place of the earthly sanctuary, and later of the temple,
was the ark of the testament. Within this ark was placed by Moses the law
of God (Deut. 10:1-5) ; above the law was the mercy seat with two cherubim
of gold overshadowing the mercy seat.
    "Above the mercy seat was the Shekinah, the manifestation of the divine
presence; and from between the cherubim, God made known His will." This
was "but a dim reflection of the glories of the temple of God in heaven, the
great center of the work for man's redemption."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 349.
                                 Divine Love
    10. What is the outstanding attribute of God's character? In what two
commandments is God's law comprehended? 1 John 4:8, 16; Matt. 22:36-40.
    Nora.—"The law of love being the foundation of the government of God,
the happiness of all intelligent beings depends upon their perfect accord with
its great principles of righteousness. God desires from all His creatures the
service of love,—service that springs from an appreciation of His character.
He takes no pleasure in a forced obedience; and to all He grants freedom of
will, that they may render Him voluntary service."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 34.
                                       15
    11. How do we become partakers of the love of God? What will this
love do for us? Rom. 5:5.
    NOTE.—"The love which Christ diffuses through the whole being is a vitaliz-
ing power. Every vital part—the brain, the heart, the nerves—it touches with
healing. By it the highest energies of the being are roused to activity. It frees
the soul from the guilt and sorrow, the anxiety and care, that crush the life
forces. With it come serenity and composure. It implants in the soul joy that
nothing earthly can destroy,—joy in the Holy Spirit,—health-giving, life-
giving joy."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 115.
    12. What is the purpose of the law? 1 Tim. 1:5.
   NOTE.—The word in this verse translated "charity" in the Authorized
Version is rendered "love" in the Revised.
   " 'God is love.' His nature, His law, is love. It ever has been ; it ever will
be."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 33.

                         Love Among Brethren
    13. Since the law of God is the sovereign law of the church, what will
prevail among its members? John 13:34; 1 John 4:21.
    NorE.—"The completeness of Christian character is attained when the im-
pulse to help and bless others springs constantly from within. It is the atmos-
phere of this love surrounding the soul of the believer that makes him a savor
of life unto life, and enables God to bless his work.
    "Supreme love for God and unselfish love for one another,—this is the best
gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is not an impulse, but a
divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart cannot originate
or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found. 'We love Him,
because He first loved us.' In the heart renewed by divine grace, love is the
ruling principle of action. It modifies the character, governs the impulses,
controls the passions, and ennobles the affections. This love, cherished in the
soul, sweetens the life, and sheds a refining influence on all around."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p.'551.
    14. Whatever our profession, if we do not love our brethren truly, what
is our condition? 1 John 3:14; 4:20.
    15. Where love prevails, what will be the result? John 17:21-23.
    NoTE.—"Suppose Christ should abide in every heart, and selfishness in all
its forms should be banished from the church; what would be the result?
Harmony, unity, and brotherly love would be seen as verily as in the church
which Christ first established. Christian activity would be seen everywhere.
The whole church would be kindled into a sacrificial flame for the glory of
God. Every Christian would cast in the fruit of his self-denial to be consumed
upon the altar. There would be far greater activity in devising fresh methods
of usefulness, and in studying how to come close to poor sinners to save them
from eternal ruin"—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 206.

                    Organization and Order •
   MEMORY VERSE: "God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
churches of the saints." "Let all things be done decently and in order." 1 Cor.
14:33, 40.
   STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 374-377; "The Acts of the
Apostles," pp. 560-564.
                     God's Orderly Arrangements
    1. How should all things be done in the church? 1 Cor. 14:40, 33.
    NOTE.—"The God of heaven is a God of order, and He requires all His
followers to have rules and regulations, and to preserve order. All should have
a perfect understanding of God's work."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 274.
    "There' is perfect order in heaven, perfect concord and agreement."—
"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 199.
    2. What are some of the advantages of organization? Neh. 4:13-16;
Deut. 1:15; Mark 6:35-41.
    NOTE.—"God's children are not only to pray in faith, but to work with
diligent and provident care. They encounter many difficulties, and often hinder
the working of Providence in their behalf, because they regard prudence and
painstaking effort as having little to do with religion. Nehemiah did not
regard his duty done when he had wept and prayed before the Lord. He
united his petitions with holy endeavor, putting forth earnest, prayerful efforts
for the success of the enterprise in which he was engaged. Careful consideration
and well-matured plans are as essential to the carrying forward of sacred
enterprises today as in the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls."—
"Prophets and Kings," pp. 633, 634.
    "The church of Christ is in constant peril. Satan is seeking to destroy the
people of God, and one man's mind, one man's judgment, is not sufficient to be
trusted. Christ would have His followers brought together in church capacity,
observing order, having rules and discipline, and all subject one to another,
esteeming others better than themselves. Union and confidence are essential
to the prosperity of the church. If each member of the church feels at liberty
to move independently of the others, taking his own peculiar course, how can
the church be in any safety in the hour of danger and peril? The prosperity
and very existence of a church depend upon the prompt, united action and
mutual confidence of its members. When, at a critical time, one sounds the
alarm of danger, there is need of prompt and active work, without stopping
to question and canvass the whole subject from end to end, thus letting the
enemy gain every advantage by delay, when united action might save many
souls from perdition."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 445.
    3. What instruction was given to Moses regarding the organization of
the church in the wilderness? Ex. 18:17-22.
    NoTE.—"From the outset of the journey from Egypt, lessons had been given
for their training and discipline. Even before they left Egypt a temporary
organization had been effected, and the people were arranged in companies,
                                      [ 17 )
under appointed leaders. At Sinai the arrangements for organization were
completed. The order so strikingly displayed in all the works of God was
manifest in the Hebrew economy. God was the center of authority and govern-
ment. Moses, as His representative, was to administer the laws in His name.
Then came the council of seventy, then the priests and the princes, under these
`captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties,
and captains over tens,' and, lastly, officers appointed for special duties. The
camp was arranged in exact order, the tabernacle, the abiding place of God, in
the midst, and around it the tents of the priests and the Levites. Outside of
these, each tribe encamped beside its own standard."—"Education," pp. 37, 38.
                 The Human Body and the Church
   4. What figure is employed to represent the church? Eph. 1:22, 23;
1 Cor. 12:27.
   5. How may one become a member of the body of Christ? Acts 2:38, 39;
1 Cor. 12:13.
   6. Who is the head of this spiritual body? Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:22.
                              A Perfect Body
    7. How perfectly are the members of the body joined together? Eph.
4:15, 16.
    NoTE.—"In the creation of man was manifest the agency of a personal God.
When God had made man in His image, the human form was perfect in all its
arrangements, but it was without life. Then a personal, self-existing God
breathed into that form the breath of life, and man became a living, intelligent
being. All parts of the human organism were set in action. The heart, the
arteries, the veins, the tongue, the hands, the feet, the senses, the faculties of
the mind, all began their work, and all were placed under law. Man became a
living soul. Through Christ the Word, a personal God created man, and en-
dowed him with intelligence and power. . . .
    "Above all lower orders of being, God designed that man, the crowning
work of His creation, should express His thought and reveal His glory."—"The
Ministry of Healing," p. 415.
    This most wonderful organism, the human body, is employed to represent
the church.
    "Christian is to be united with Christian, church with church, the human
instrumentality co-operating with the divine, every agency subordinate to the
Holy Spirit, and all combined in giving to the world the good tidings of the
grace of God."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 96.
    8. How are the members placed in the body? How many members are
necessary? 1 Cor. 12:18, 21, 22.
    9. What is God's plan for the church? 1 Cor. 12:25, first - part; 1:10.
    10. What close and tender ties exist, binding the members of the church
each to the other? 1 Cor. 12:25, last part, 26.
                                   Growth
    11. What is the standard of attainment for the church? Eph. 4:11-13.
    12. How is this standard to be reached? Verses 15, 16; 2 Peter 3:18.
    13. What is essential to spiritual growth? 1 Peter 2:2; John 6:63, 33.
   NoTE.—"The plants and flowers grow not by their own care or anxiety or
effort, but by receiving that which God has furnished to minister to their life.
                                     t 18 )
The child cannot, by any anxiety or power of its own, add to its stature. No
more can you, by anxiety or effort of yourself, secure spiritual growth. The
plant, the child, grows by receiving from its surroundings that Which ministers
to its life,—air, sunshine, and food. What these gifts of nature are to animal
and plant, such is Christ to those who trust in Him. . . .
    "In the matchless gift of His Son, God has encircled the whole world with
an atmosphere of grace, as real as the air which circulates around the globe.
All who choose to breathe this life-giving atmosphere will live, and grow up
to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus."—"Steps to Christ," p. 72.
    14. What should be the attitude of each individual member, also of
the church as a body, as to their present attainments? Phil. 3:12-14.
    NOTE.—"The closer you come to Jesus, the more faulty you will appear in
your own eyes; for your vision will be clearer, and your imperfections will be
seen in broad and distinct contrast to His perfect nature. This is evidence that
Satan's delusions have lost their power; that the vivifying influence of the
Spirit of God is arousing you.
    "No deep-seated love for Jesus can dwell in the heart that does not realize
its own sinfulness. The soul that is transformed by the grace of Christ will
admire His divine character; but if we do not see our own moral deformity,
it is unmistakable evidence that we have not had a view of the beauty and
excellence of Christ.
    "The less we see to esteem in ourselves, the more we shall see to esteem in
the infinite purity and loveliness of our Saviour. A view of our sinfulness
drives us to Him who can pardon; and when the soul, realizing its helpless-
ness, reaches out after Christ, He will reveal Himself in power. The more our
sense of need drives us to Him and to the word of God, the more exalted views
we shall have of His character, and the more fully we shall reflect His image."
 —"Steps to Christ," p. 70.
     15. What wonderful provision has the Lord made that the church may
become, even now, a glorified body? Eph. 3:20, 21; Col. 2:9, 10.
    NOTE.—"Christ has made every provision that His church shall be a trans-
formed body, illumined with the Light of the world, possessing the glory of
Immanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a
spiritual atmosphere of light and peace. He desires that we shall reveal His
own joy in our lives."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 720.

                    Authority in the Church
   MEMORY VERSE: "Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the
government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful,
Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Isa. 9:6.
   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 140-142.
                    Forms of Church Government
   1. What form of church government existed from Adam to Moses?
   ANSWER.—The patriarchal system. Gen. 8:20; 12:6 -8; 26:24, 25; 33:18-20.
                                ( 19 3
    NOTE.—"Abraham's household comprised more than a thousand souls.
Those who were led by his teachings to worship the one God, found a home
in his encampment; and here, as in a school, they received such instruction as
would prepare them to be representatives of the true faith. Thus a great
responsibility rested upon him. He was training heads of families, and his
methods of government would be carried out in the households over which
they should preside.
    "In early times the father was the ruler and priest of his own family, and
he exercised authority over his children, even after they had families of their
own. His descendants were taught to koo up to him as their head, in both
religious and secular matters. This patriarchal system of government Abraham
endeavored to perpetuate, as it tended to preserve the knowledge of God. It
was necessary to bind the members of the household together, in order to build
up a barrier against the idolatry that had become so widespread and so deep-
seated. Abraham sought, by every means in his power, to guard the inmates
of his encampment against mingling with the heathen and witnessing their
idolatrous practices; for he knew that familiarity with evil would insensibly
corrupt the principles. The greatest care was exercised to shut out every form
of false religion, and to impress the mind with the majesty and glory of the
living God as the true object of worship."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 141.
    2. What form of government existed in Israel from Moses to Saul? 1
Sam. 8:6, 7.
    ANSWER.—A theocratic form. (Psalm 47.)
    NOTE.—"Theocracy. 1. A government among men recognizing the im-
mediate sovereignty of God and receiving His revelations as its civil law.
2. . . . The Hebrew state from Moses to the monarchy; by emphasis, a
direct government by God."—Standard Dictionary.
    "The government of Israel was administered in the name and by the au-
thority of God. The work of Moses, of the seventy elders, of the rulers and
judges, was simply to enforce the laws that God had given; they had no
authority to legislate for the nation. This was, and continued to be, the con-
dition of Israel's existence as a nation. From age to age, men inspired by God
were sent to instruct the people, and to direct in the enforcement of the laws."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 603.

                           Supreme Authority
   3. In all ages who alone has the right to exercise supreme authority in
the church? Isa. 9:6, 7; Acts 15:2, 6, 13-19, 22.
    NoTE.—"The council which decided this case [in Acts 15] was composed
of apostles and teachers who had been prominent in raising up the Jewish and
Gentile Christian churches, with chosen delegates from various places. Elders
from Jerusalem and deputies from Antioch were present, and the most in-
fluential churches were represented. The council moved in accordance with
the dictates of enlightened judgment, and with the dignity of a church estab-
lished by the divine will."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 196.
    4. What spiritual authority has the Lord conferred upon His church?
Matt. 18:18; John 20:22, 23.
    NorE.—"On the church in its organized capacity He places a responsibility
for the individual members. Toward those who fall into sin, the church has a
                                    20
duty, to warn, to instruct, and if possible to restore. 'Reprove, rebuke, exhort,'
the Lord says, 'with all long-suffering and doctrine.' Deal faithfully with
wrongdoing. Warn every soul that is in danger. Leave none to deceive them-
selves. Call sin by its right name. Declare what God has said in regard to
lying, Sabbathbreaking, stealing, idolatry, and every other evil. 'They which
do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.' If they persist in sin,
the judgment you have declared from God's word is pronounced upon them
in heaven. In choosing to sin, they disown Christ; the church must show that
she does not sanction their deeds, or she herself dishonors her Lord. She must
say about sin what God says about it. She must deal with it as God directs,
and her action is ratified in heaven. He who despises the authority of the
church, despises the authority of Christ Himself."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 805, 806.
    "The world's Redeemer has invested great power with His church. He
states the rules to be applied in cases of trial with its members. After He has
given explicit directions as to the course to be pursued, He says, 'Verily I say
unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and
whatsoever [in church discipline] ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven' Thus even the heavenly authority ratifies the discipline of the church
in regard to its members, when the Bible rule has been followed.
    "The word of God does not give license for one man to set up his judgment
in opposition to the judgment of the church, neither is he allowed to urge his
opinions against the opinions of the church. If there were no church discipline
and government, the church would go to fragments; it could not hold together
as a body."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 428.
                            Church Discipline
    5. How far may the church go in the exercise of the power to discipline
its members? 2 Thess. 3:6; 1 Tim. 6:3-5; Matt. 18:17.
    NOTE.—"Upon it [the church] rests the responsibility of excluding from
its fellowship those who are unworthy, who by their unchristlike conduct
would bring dishonor on the truth: Whatever the church does that is in
accordance with the directions given in God's word will be ratified in heaven."
—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 263.
    6. Where only is this authority vested? Matt. 18:17.
    NorE.—"Shall a few persons in a board meeting take upon themselves the
responsibility of disfellowshiping the erring one? 'If he shall neglect to hear
them, tell it unto the church.' Matt. 18:17. Let the church take action in regard
to its members.
    " Tut if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen
man and a publican.' Matt. 18:17. If he will not heed the voice of the church,
if he refuses all the efforts made to reclaim him, upon the church rests the
responsibility of separating him from fellowship. His name should then be
stricken from the books."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 262.
     7. What instruction does Christ give concerning the exercise of arbitrary
authority in the church? Matt. 20:25-28; 1 Peter 5:1-3.
    8. How is an erring member to be treated? Matt. 18:15, 16; Gal. 6:1, 2;
James 5:20.
    NOTE.—"Do not suffer resentment to ripen into malice. Do not allow the
wound to fester and break out in poisoned words, which taint the minds of
                                       [ 21 )
those who hear. Do not allow bitter thoughts to continue to fill your mind
and his. Go to your brother, and in humility and sincerity talk with him about
the matter.
   "Whatever the character of the offense, this does not change the plan that
God has made for the settlement of misunderstandings and personal injuries.
Speaking alone and in the spirit of Christ to the one who is in fault will often
remove the difficulty. Go to the erring one, with a heart filled with Christ's
love and sympathy, and seek to adjust the matter. Reason with him calmly
and quietly. Let no angry words escape your lips. Speak in a way that will
appeal to his better judgment. Remember the words, 'He which converteth the
sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide
a multitude of sins.' James 5:20.
   "Take to your brother the remedy that will cure the disease of disaffection.
Do your part to help him. For the sake of the peace and unity of the church,
feel it a privilege as well as a duty to do this. If he will hear you, you have
gained him as a friend."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 261.
                    A Divinely Appointed Ministry
    9. What divine agencies co-operate in the appointment of the ministry?
Mark 3:13, 14; Acts 13:2; Heb. 5:4.
   NoTE.—"God has a church, and she has a divinely appointed ministry."—
"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 52.
   " 'There were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and
teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manaen, . . . and Saul. As they ministered to the Lord, and
fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them.' Before being sent forth as missionaries to the
heathen world, these apostles were solemnly dedicated to God by fasting and
prayer and the laying on of hands. Thus they were authorized by the church,
not only to teach the truth, but to perform the rite of baptism, and to organize
churches, being invested with full ecclesiastical authority."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," pp. 160, 161.
    10. What was the purpose of the appointment of the twelve disciples?
Mark 3:14; 16:15, 16; Luke 9:1, 2.
    11. What other purpose is to be accomplished through the divinely ap-
pointed leadership in the church? Eph. 4:11-13; 1 Thess. 2:10-12.
   NorE.—"The Lord has His appointed agencies, and a church that has lived
through persecution, conflict, and darkness. Jesus loved the church, and gave
Himself for it, and He will replenish, refine, ennoble, and elevate it, so that it
shall stand fast amid the corrupting influences of this world. Men appointed
of God have been chosen to watch with jealous care, with vigilant perseverance,
that the church may not be overthrown by the evil devices of Satan, but that
she shall stand in the world to promote the glory of God among men."—"Testi-
monies to Ministers," pp. 52, 53.
                      Love, Submission, Humility
   12. What authority is given the shepherd of God's flock? What is with-
held? 1 Peter 5:2, 3.
   13. What should be the attitude of all believers one toward another?
Verse 5, first part; Eph. 5:21.
                                  [221
   14. With what should all be clothed? 1 Peter 5:5-7.
   NOTE.—"Truly great men are invariably modest. Humility is a grace which
sits naturally upon them as a garment. Those who have stored their minds with
useful knowledge, and who possess genuine attainments and refinement, are
the ones who will be most willing to admit the weakness of their own under-
standing. They are not self-confident nor boastful; but in view of the higher
attainments to which they might rise in intellectual greatness, they seem to
themselves to have but just begun the ascent. It is the superficial thinker, the
one who has but a beginning or smattering of knowledge, who deems himself
wise, and who takes on disgusting airs of importance."—"Testimonies," vol. 4,
pp. 338, 339.

         The Depository of Heavenly Treasure
    MEMORY VERSE: "As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that
love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth
all things, yea, the deep things of God." 1 Cor. 2:9, 10.
    STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 103-121.

                  The Treasure Conunitted to Israel
   1. What advantage had the Jews? Rom. 3:1, 2.
   2. What did this include? Rom. 9:4, 5.
   3. Who today are the true successors of the Jews, or Israelites? Rom.
2:28, 29; Gal. 3:29.
                         The Heavenly Treasure

   NOTE.—"In the parable the field containing the treasure represents the Holy
Scriptures."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 104.
    5. What is the treasure?
    ANSWER.—"The gospel is the treasure. The earth itself is not so interlaced
with golden veins and filled with precious things as is the word of God."—Ibid.
    6. In value with what can we compare this treasure? Rom. 11:33; Job
28:14-18.
   NOTE.—"The value of this treasure is above gold or silver. The riches of
earth's mines cannot compare with it. . . .
   "The Bible is the mine of the unsearchable riches of Christ."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 107.
                         The Unsearchable Riches
   7. With what other likeness is the kingdom of heaven compared? Matt.
13:45, 46.
   8. What is this pearl of great price? Eph. 3:8; 1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 2:9, 10.
                                       ( 23 )
    NOTE.—"Christ Himself is the pearl of great price. In Him is gathered all
the glory of the Father, the fullness of the Godhead."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. 115.
    Truly, "the gospel is the treasure ;" the field containing this treasure is "the
Holy Scriptures;" Jesus is "the pearl of great price." But it requires all that
we have to buy the field; all to secure the pearl of -great price. How carefully
should these precious treasures be guarded!
    9. From whom is this treasure hidden and why? 2 Cor. 4:3, 4; 1 Cor.
2:14.
    10. By what means alone may the riches of God's word be discovered?
1 Cor. 2:9-12.

    11. What is its price? Isa. 55:1, 2; Rev. 22:17.
    NoTE.—"The gospel of Christ is a blessing that all may possess. The poorest
are as well able as the richest to purchase salvation; for no amount of worldly
wealth can secure it. It is obtained by willing obedience, by giying ourselves
to Christ as His own purchased possession. . . .
    "We cannot earn salvation, but we are to seek for it with as much interest
and perseverance as though we would abandon everything in the world for
it."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 117.                                 •
    12. What language does Peter employ to describe the value of the
gospel? 2 Peter 1:1.
    NorE.—That is precious which is of great value. Christ is precious (1 Peter
2:3, 4) ; His blood is precious (1 Peter 1:18, 19) ; the 'word of the Lord is
precious (1 Sam. 3:1) • its promises are precious (2 Peter 1:4) ; one of these
promises is, "I will make a man more precious than fine gold" (Isa. 13:12) ;
the faith we hold in common is precious.
    13. Where have these precious things been deposited? Jude 3.
    NOTE.—"The faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints." R. V.
    "The church, being endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His deposi-
tory, in which the wealth of His mercy, His love, His grace, is to appear in full
and final display."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 18.
    "The church is God's appointed agency for the salvation of men. It was
organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to the world. From
the beginning it has been God's plan that through His church shall be reflected
to the world His fullness and His sufficiency. The members of the church,
those whom He has called out of darkness into His marvelous light, are to
show forth His glory. The church is the repository of the riches of the grace
of Christ; and through the church will eventually be made manifest, even to
`the principalities and powers in heavenly places,' the final and full display of
the love of God."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 9.
    14. What does Paul say about our possession of this treasure? 2 Cor.
4:6, 7.
    NOTE.—"The purpose which God seeks to accomplish through His people
today is the same that He desired to accomplish through Israel when He
brought them forth out of Egypt. By beholding the goodness, the mercy, the
justice, and the love of God revealed in the church, the world is to have a repre-
sentation of His character. And when the law of God is thus exemplified in
                                       [243
the life, even the world will recognize the superiority of those who love and
fear and serve God above every other people on the earth. The Lord has His
eye upon every one of His people; He has His plans concerning each. It is His
purpose that those who practice His holy precepts shall be a distinguished
people."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 12.

   1. Describe the figure employed by the prophet to represent the apostolic
church. Rev. 6:1, 2.
   2. In speaking of Christ as the rider, what three things are mentioned
by the psalmist as the reason for His prosperity? Ps. 45:1-4.
                                The Truth
    3. In speaking to Thomas what did Jesus say of Himself? John 14:6.
    NOTE.—"By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He
lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an example
of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey. It was Christ
who from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to Moses saying, 'I AM THAT
I AM. . . . Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent
me unto you.' This was the pledge of Israel's deliverance. So when He came 'in
the likeness of men,' He declared Himself the I AM. The Child of Bethlehem,
the meek and lowly Saviour, is God 'manifest in the flesh.' And to us He says,
 "I AM the Good Shepherd." "I AM the living Bread." "I AM the Way, the
Truth, and the Life." "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth."
"I AM the assurance of every promise." "I AM; be not afraid." '          with
us' is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the assurance of our power to
obey the law of heaven."--"The Desire of Ages," pp. 24, 25.
    4. What does Jesus say about the truth? John 8:32.
     5. On what condition may we know the truth? John 7:17.
    NOTE.—"Whoever will prayerfully study the Bible, desiring to know the
truth, that be may obey it, will receive divine enlightenment. He will under-
stand the Scriptures."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 459.

            "As God bath prospered,"—that's the rule

    6. Having surrendered to do the will of God, how may we be guided into
all truth? John 16:13-15.
    NOTE.—"The Spirit is constantly seeking to draw the attention of men to
the great offering that was made on the cross of Calvary, to unfold to the
world the love of God, and to open to the convicted soul the precious things
of the Scriptures. . . . The Spirit will take the things of God and stamp them
on the soul. By His power the way of life will be made so plain that none
need err therein."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 52, 53.
                              Truth Enthroned
    7. Where should truth be enthroned? Ps. 119:11; 51 : 6.
    8. What will truth do for the one who surrenders to it?
    ANSWER.—(1) It has purifying, sanctifying power. 1 Peter 1:22; John
17:17.
    (2) It serves as a shield and buckler. Ps. 91:4.
    (3) It leads to heaven. Ps. 43:3; Isa. 26:2.
    NOTE.—"Received into the heart, the leaven of truth will regulate the
desires, purify the thoughts, and sweeten the disposition. It quickens the facul-
ties of the mind and the energies of the soul. It enlarges the capacity for
feeling, for loving."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 101.
    9. How long will truth endure? Ps. 100:5; 117:2.
    10. What is said of God's law? Ps. 119:142, 151.
    NOTE.—"By the word and the Spirit of God are opened to men the great
principles of righteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is
`holy, and just, and good,' a transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a
character formed by obedience to that law will be holy. Christ is a perfect
example of such a character. . . .
    "This work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power
of the indwelling Spirit of God. Paul admonishes believers, 'Work out your
own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you
both to will and to do of His good pleasure.' The Christian will feel the prompt-
ings of sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it. Here is where
Christ's help is needed. Human weakness becomes united to divine strength,
and faith exclaims, 'Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.' "—"The Great Controversy," pp. 469, 470.
    11. What course should we take? 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Cor. 4:2.
                                Falling Away
   12. Knowing what was coming upon the church, what warning did Paul
give the elders assembled at Miletus? Acts 20:28-31.
    13. Into what would this false teaching develop? 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.
    14. In Daniel's foreview of this apostasy, what did he see would be
done to truth? Dan. 8:12.
    Nora—When truth was cast down to the ground, error was exalted to take
its place. But "truth is inspired and guarded by God; and it will triumph over
all opposition." "His law is linked with His throne, and no power of evil can
destroy it."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 12.
                                      [ 26 ]
                            Truth Triumphant
    15. What is the effect upon the receiver, and upon others, when error
instead of truth is received? 2 Tim. 2:17, 18.
   16. What counsel did Paul give Timothy? 1 Tim. 4:13-16; 2 Tim. 4:1-4.

  SABBATH SUNDAY         MONDAY       TUESDAY 1WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY




                       The Church Militant
   MEMORY VERSE: "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
have the testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 826, 827; "The Great Controversy,"
pp. 61-68; "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 349-353.
                         The Great Commission
    1. Before leaving His disciples what did Jesus command them to do
and to teach? Matt. 28:19, 20.
    NoTE.—"The gospel is to be presented, not as a lifeless theory, but as a
living force to change the life. God desires that the receivers of His grace shall
be witnesses to its power. Those whose course has been most offensive to Him
He freely accepts; when they repent, He imparts to them His divine Spirit,
places them in the highest positions of trust, and sends them forth into the
camp of the disloyal to proclaim His boundless mercy. He would have His
servants bear testimony to the fact that through His grace men may possess
Christlikeness of character, and may rejoice in the assurance, of His great love.
He would have us bear testimony to the fact that He cannot be satisfied until
the human race are reclaimed and reinstated in their holy privileges as His
sons and daughters."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 826.
   2. In His life, and in the message He bore, whom did Jesus represent?
John 14:9, 10.
   3. In obeying the Saviour's command what were the disciples to be?
John 15:27; Acts 1:8.
                           Hatred, Persecution
    4. What comes to those who will live godly in Christ Jesus? John 15:19;
2 Tim. 3:12.
    5. What came upon the woman—the church? Rev. 12:9, 13.
    6. When persecuted, what protection did the Lord provide? Rev. 12:6,
14, 16.
    NoTE.—"Behind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains,—in all ages the refuge
of the persecuted and oppressed,—the Waldenses found a hiding place. Here
the light of truth was kept burning amid the darkness of the Middle Ages.
Here, for a thousand years, witnesses for the truth maintained the ancient faith.
                                       ( 27
    "God had provided for His people a sanctuary of awful grandeur, befitting
the mighty truths committed to their trust."—"The Great Controversy,"
pp. 65, 66.
    "Thus was the primitive church preserved in the Alps to the very period
of the Reformation. The Vaudois are the chain which unites the reformed
churches with the first disciples of our Saviour. It is in vain that popery,
renegade from evangelical verities, has a thousand times sought to break this
chain; it resists all her efforts. Empires have crumbled—dynasties have fallen—
but this chain of scriptural testimony has not been broken, because its strength
is not from man, but from God."—"The Israel of the Alps," vol. 1, first part,
chap. 1, p. 29.                                     •
     7. What assurance of protection of the treasures of truth, as well as
of the church, has the Lord given? Ps. 12:6, 7; Isa. 27:2, 3.
     NorE.—"The faith which for many centuries was held and taught by the
Waldensian Christians, was in marked contrast to the false doctrines put forth
from Rome. Their religious belief was founded upon the written word of
 God, the true system of Christianity. But those humble peasants, in their
obscure retreats, shut away from the world, and bound to daily toil among
their flocks and their vineyards, had not by themselves arrived at the truth
 in opposition to the dogmas and heresies of the apostate church. Theirs was
 not a faith newly received. Their religious belief was their inheritance from
 their fathers. They contended for the faith of the apostolic church, `the
 faith which was once delivered unto the saints.' The church in the wilderness,'
 and not the proud hierarchy enthroned in the world's great capital, was the
 true church of Christ, the guardian of the treasures of truth which God
 has committed to His people to be given to the world."—"The Great Contro-
 versy," p. 64.
     "Through ages of darkness and-apostasy, there were Waldenses who denied
 the supremacy of Rome, who rejected image worship as idolatry, and who kept
 the true Sabbath. Under the fiercest tempests of opposition they maintained
 their faith. Though gashed by the Savoyard spear, and scorched by the Romish
 fagot, they stood" unflinchingly for God's word and His honor."—Id., p. 65.
                         Light Out of Darkness
    8. Describe the breaking forth of light from darkness, just before the
end. Rev. 14:6, 7; 18:1.
    NoTE.—"It is the darkness of misapprehension of God that is enshrouding
the world. Men are losing their knowledge of His character. It has been mis-
understood and misinterpreted. At this time a message from God is to be pro-
claimed, a message illuminating in its influence and saving in its power. His
character is to be made known. Into the darkness of the world is to be shed
the light of His glory, the light of His goodness, mercy, and truth."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 415.
    "Those who wait for the Bridegroom's coming are to say to the people,
`Behold your God.' The last rays of merciful light, the last message of mercy
to be given to the world, is a revelation of His character of love. The children
of God are to manifest His glory. In their own life and character they are to
reveal what the grace of God has done for them."—/d., pp. 415, 416.
    "The revelation of His own glory in the -form of humanity, will bring
heaven so near to men that the beauty adorning the inner temple will be seen
                                      f 28 )
in every soul in whom the Saviour dwells. Men will be captivated by the glory
of an abiding Christ. And in currents of praise and thanksgiving from the
many souls thus won to God, glory will flow back to the great Giver."—Id.,
p. 420.
    9. What effect does this light have on the kingdom of darkness? Rev.
12:12, 17; 14:12.
    NoTE.—"The same spirit that in ages past led men to persecute the true
church, will in the future lead to the pursuance of a similar course toward those
who maintain their loyalty to God. Even now preparations are being made
for this last great conflict."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 605.
    10. What great work of reform will the bearers of this light carry
forward? Isa. 58:8, 12, 13.
    NorE.—"The prophet here describes a people who, in a time of general
departure from truth and righteousness, are seeking to restore the principles
that are the foundation of the kingdom of God. They are repairers of a breach
that has been made in God's law,—the wall that He has placed around His
chosen ones for their protection, and obedience to whose precepts of justice,
truth, and purity, is to be their perpetual safeguard. •
    "In words of unmistakable meaning, the prophet points out the specific
work of this remnant people who build the wall."
    "In the time of the end, every divine institution is to be restored. The
breach made in the law at the time the Sabbath was changed by man, is to be
repaired. God's remnant people, standing before the world as reformers, are
to show that the law of God is the foundation of all enduring reform, and
that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is to stand as a memorial of
creation, a constant reminder of the power of God. In clear, distinct lines
they are to present the necessity of obedience to all the precepts of the Deca-
logue. Constrained by the love of Christ, they are to co-operate with Him in
building up the waste places. They are to be repairers of the breach, restorers
of paths to dwell in."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 677, 678.
    "The Sabbath is a golden clasp that unites God and His people. But the
Sabbath command has been broken. God's holy day has been desecrated. The
Sabbath has been torn from its place by the roan of sin, and a common working
day has been exalted in its stead. A breach has been made in the law, and
this breach is to be repaired. The true Sabbath is to be exalted to its rightful
position as God's rest day"—"Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 351, 352.
    11. What experience will come to those who enter into the true spirit of
Sabbath reform? Isa. 58:14.
    NOTE.—Lesser's translation reads as follows: "Then shalt thou find delight
in the Lord; and I will cause thee to tread upon the high places of the earth,
and I will cause thee to enjoy the inheritance of Jacob thy father; for the
mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."
    "The Sabbath was hallowed at the creation. As ordained for man, it had
its origin when 'the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
shouted for joy.' Peace brooded over the world; for earth was in harmony
with heaven. 'God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very
good;' and He rested in the joy of His completed work.
    "Because He had rested upon the Sabbath, 'God blessed the seventh day,
and sanctified it,'—set it apart to a holy use. He gave it to Adam as a day of
rest. It was a memorial of the work of creation,-and thus a sign of God's power
                                       [29]
and His love. The Scripture says, 'He hath made His wonderful works to be
remembered.' The things that are made,' declare 'the invisible things of Him
since the creation of the world,' even His everlasting power and divinity.' "
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 281.
    "To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative and redeem-
ing power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight themselves in
Him. The Sabbath points them to the works of creation as an evidence of His
mighty power in redemption. While it calls to mind the lost peace of Eden, it
tells of peace restored through the Saviour. And every object in nature repeats
His invitation, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I
will give you rest.' "—Id., p. 289.
                       The Last Work of Reform
   12. What world-wide message calling for complete reformation is to be
given to the world? Rev. 14:6, 7.
   13. What does God say of those who accept and proclaim it? Verse 12.
   14. What supreme event will follow? Verse 14.

  SABBATH     SUNDAY     MONDAY     TUESDAY !WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY



                Life and Good, Death and Evil
   MEMORY VERSE: "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee. Trust ye in the Lord forever: for in the Lord
Jehovah is everlasting strength." Isa. 26:3, 4.
   STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 387-394; "The Great Contro-
versy," pp. 539-545.
                       Warnings Against Unbelief
    1. When Israel were on their way to Canaan, why did so many fall in
the wilderness? Heb. 3:17-19.
    2. With what similar danger are we confronted today? Heb. 4:1, 11.
    NOTE.—"It was not the will of God that Israel should wander forty years
in the wilderness; He desired to lead them directly to the land of Canaan, and
establish them there, a holy, happy people. But 'they could not enter in
because of unbelief.' Because of their backsliding and apostasy, they perished
in the desert, and others were raised up to enter the Promised Land. In like
manner, it was not the will of God that the coming of Christ should be so
long delayed, and His people should remain so many years in this world of
sin and sorrow. But unbelief separated them from God. As they refused to do
the work which He had appointed them, others were raised up to proclaim
the message. In mercy to the world, Jesus delays His coming, that sinners may
have an opportunity to hear the warning, and find in Him a shelter before the
wrath of God shall be poured out."—"The Great Controversy," p. 458.
                                     (30 1
   3. What are we admonished to do? Against what are we warned? Heb.
3:12, 13.
    NOTE.—"Like the hard-beaten path, trodden down by -the feet of men and
beasts, is the heart that becomes a highway for the world's traffic, its pleasures
and sins. Absorbed in selfish aims and sinful indulgences, the soul is 'hardened
through the deceitfulness of sin.' The spiritual faculties are paralyzed. Men
hear the word, but understand it not. They do not discern that it applies to
themselves. They do not realize their need or their danger. They do not per-
ceive the love of Christ, and they pass by the message of His grace as something
that does not concern them."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 44.
   "Let none flatter themselves that sins cherished for a time can easily be
given up by and by. This is not so. Every sin cherished weakens the character
and strengthens habit; and physical, mental, and moral depravity is the result.
You may repent of the wrong you have done, and set your feet in right paths;
but the mold of your mind and your familiarity with ,evil will make it difficult
for you to distinguish between right and wrong. Through the wrong habits
formed, Satan will assail you again and again."—/d., p. 281.
    4. To what does a hard, unbelieving heart lead? Heb. 3:12.
    5. Why did the Jews reject their Saviour? Rom. 11:19, 20, first part.
                         Victory Through Faith
     6. In view of the rejection of the Jewish people, what should be our atti-
tude? What is our only hope? Rom. 11:20, last part, 21; Heb. 3:14.
     7. 'When confronted with imminent peril from their enemies, what did
Jehoshaphat urge Judah to do? What was the result of perfect obedience?
2 Chron. 20:22-24.
     NoTE.—"Often the Christian life is beset by dangers, and duty seems hard
to perform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before, and bondage or
death behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, 'Go forward.' We should
obey this command, even though our eyes cannot penetrate the darkness, and
we feel the cold waves about our feet. The obstacles that hinder our progress
will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit. Those who defer
obedience till every shadow of uncertainty disappears, and there remains no
risk of failure or defeat, will never obey at all. Unbelief whispers, `Let us wait
till the obstructions are removed, and we can see our way clearly;' but faith
courageously urges an advance, hoping all things, believing all things."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 290.
                            Believe, Obey, Rest
   8. What comes to those who believe God and who keep His command-
ments? Heb. 4:3; Isa. 48:18.
   NorE.—"He who walks in the way of God's commandments is walking in
company with Christ, and in His love the heart is at rest."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 331.
   9. What should we not do, and why? Heb. 10:35.
   NOTE.—"But even here Christians may have the joy of communion with
Christ; they may have the light of His love, the perpetual comfort of His
presence. Every step in life may bring us closer to Jesus, may give us a deeper
experience of His love, and may bring us one step nearer to the blessed home
                                       [ 81 )
of peace. Then let us not cast away our confidence, but have firm assurance,
firmer than ever before. 'Hitherto bath the Lord helped us,' and He will help
us to the end. Let us look to the monumental pillars, reminders of what the
Lord has done to comfort us and to save us from the hand of the destroyer.
Let us keep fresh in our memory all the tender mercies that God has shown
us,—the tears He has wiped away, the pains He has soothed, the anxieties
removed, the fears dispelled, the wants supplied, the blessings bestowed,—thus
strengthening ourselves for all that is before us through the remainder of our
pilgrimage."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 130, 131.
    10. On what should our minds be stayed? In whom should we trust?
What comes to those who heed this counsel? Isa. 26:3, 4.
    11. How will the just live who are waiting for the coming of Jesus?
Heb. 10:37, 38, first part.
    12. If any man draws back, what will he incur? To what will he draw
back? Verses 38, last part, 39.
                                Two Ways
    13. What two ways are set before us? Jer. 21:8; Deut. 30:15; Rom.
6:23.
    NOTE.—"God sets before man life and death. He can have his choice.
Many desire life, but still continue to walk in the broad road. They choose
to rebel against God's government, notwithstanding His great mercy and
compassion in giving His Son to die for them."—"Early Writings," p. 221.
    14. How does the way of death seem to man? Prov. 14:12.              '
    NorE.—"If men choose any other path than that of strict obedience, they
will find that 'the end thereof are the ways of death.' "—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 361.                       •
    "In deciding upon any course of action, we are not to ask whether we can
see that harm will result from it, but whether it is in keeping with the will
of God."—Id., p. 634.
    "From the beginning, Satan has portrayed to men the gains to be won by
transgression. Thus he seduced angels. Thus he tempted Adam and Eve to sin.
And thus he is still leading multitudes away from obedience to God. The path
of transgression is made to appear desirable; 'but the end thereof are the ways
of death.' Happy they who, having ventured in this way, learn how bitter are
the fruits of sin, and turn from it betimes. God, in His mercy, did not leave
David to be lured to utter ruin by the deceitful rewards of sin."—Id., p. 720.
                            The Way of Life
   15. What should be our constant prayer? Ps. 139:23, 24.
   16. What is our only safe guide? Acts 20:32; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
    NOTE.—"Christ calls upon His people to believe and practice His word.
Those who receive and assimilate this word, making it a part of every action,
of every attribute of character, will grow strong in the strength of God. It
-+
         Christ guides the stars, both small and great;
         Let Him guide you, and you won't come late.

will be seen that their faith is of heavenly origin. They will not wander into
strange paths. Their minds will not turn to a religion of sentimentalism and
excitement. Before angels and before men, they will stand as those who have
strong, consistent Christian characters."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 300.

  SABBATH     SUNDAY     MONDAY'       TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY I         FRIDAY




                Importance of Sound Doctrine
   MEMORY VERSE: "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you,
neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the
Lord your God which I command you." Deut. 4 :2.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 473-477; 578-581.

                         A Distinguished People
   1. What made ancient Israel a distinguished people above all other
peoples of the earth? Ex. 19:5; Deut. 4:5-8.
   2. What will characterize the church of God? Titus 2:11-14.
                            The Gospel of God
    3. How is this marvelous change accomplished? Rom. 1:16.
    NOTE.—"For I am not ashamed of the good news. It is God's power which
is at work for the salvation of everyone who believes."—Weymouth's Trans-
lation.
    Sin separated man from God, while the gospel is the new and living way
back to the Father. This way is revealed in the perfect life of Jesus, in His
vicarious death, His triumphant resurrection and ascension to His Father, His
mediatorial work as our great High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, His
coming in power and great glory, His work of judgment, and in the complete
and final restoration of all things lost in the fall.
    The gospel embraces the entire plan of salvation,—the story of redemption,
—the pure system of religious teaching as found in the Bible and committed
to the church, the "faith of God's elect," the "doctrine of Christ."
    4. How alone did the gospel come to man? Gal. 1:11, 12.
                       Adding to or Taking From
    5. How much may we add to or take from what God has revealed?
Eccl. 3:14; Deut. 4:2.
    6. What will be the result of attempting any change in God's word?
Rev. 22:18, 19.
    NOTE.—"Such are the warnings which God has given to guard men against
changing in any manner that which He has revealed or commanded. These
solemn denunciations apply to all who by their influence lead men to regard
lightly the law of God. They should cause those to fear and tremble who
flippantly declare it a matter of little consequence whether we obey God's law
                                        ( 33   7
or not. All who exalt their own opinions above divine revelation, all who
would change the plain meaning of Scripture to suit their own convenience, or
for the sake of conforming to the world, are taking upon themselves a fearful
responsibility. The written word, the law of God, will measure the character
of every man, and condemn all whom this unerring test shall declare wanting."
—"The Great Controversy," p. 268.
                              Another Gospel
   7. If one accepts another gospel, what does he do to the gospel of Christ?
Gal. 1:6, 7.
   8. However exalted one may be, what is the result of preaching another
gospel? Verses 8, 9.
   9. What will be the result of refusing to obey the gospel of Christ?
2 Thess. 1:6-9.
                           The Greatest Peril
    10. Against what great peril is the church warned? Acts 20:29, 30.
    NOTE.—"Christ had foretold that deceivers would arise, through whose
influence 'iniquity' should 'abound,' and 'the love of many' should 'wax cold.'
He had warned the disciples that the church would be in more danger from
this evil than from the persecution of her enemies. Again and again Paul warned
the believers against these false teachers. This peril, above all others, they
must guard against; for by receiving false teachers, they would open the door
to errors by which the enemy would dim the spiritual perceptions and shake
the confidence of those newly come to the faith of the gospel."—"The Acts of
the Apostles," pp. 473, 474.
    11. How may these fatal errors creep into the church? Col. 2:8; Eph.
4:14.
    NoTE.—"As the years went by and the number of believers grew, John
labored with increasing fidelity and earnestness for his brethren. The times
were full of peril for the church. Satanic delusions existed everywhere. By
misrepresentation and falsehood the emissaries of Satan sought to arouse oppo-
sition against the doctrines of Christ; and in consequence dissensions and
heresies were imperiling the church. Some who professed Christ claimed that
His love released them from obedience to the law of God. . . Some held
that Christ was a good man, but denied His divinity. Some who pretended to
be true to the cause of God were deceivers, and in practice they denied Christ
and His gospel. Living themselves in transgression, they were bringing
heresies into the church. Thus many were being led into the mazes of
skepticism and delusion.
    "John was filled with sadness as he saw these poisonous errors creeping into
the church. He saw the dangers to which the church was exposed, and he met
the emergency with promptness and decision."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
pp. 553, 554.
    "But after a time the zeal of the believers began to wane, and their love
for God and for one another grew less. Coldness crept into the church. Some
forgot the wonderful manner in which they had received the truth. One by
one the old standard-bearers fell at their post. Some of the younger workers,
who might have shared the burdens of these pioneers, and thus have been
prepared for wise leadership, had become weary of oft-repeated truths. In
their desire for something novel and startling, they attempted to introduce new
                                       [34)
phases of doctrine, more pleasing to many minds, but not in harmony with
the fundamental principles of the gospel. In their self-donfidence and spiritual
blindness they failed to discern that these sophistries would cause many to
question the experiences of the past, and would thus lead to confusion and
unbelief."—Id., p. 580.
                             Watch and Pray
    12. In this time of peril, what kind of servants will the Lord place over
His household? Matt. 24:45, 46; Isa. 62:6, 7.
    NOTE.—"God has promised that where the shepherds are not true He will
take charge of the flock Himself. God has never made the flock wholly de-
pendent upon human instrumentalities."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 80.
    13. While waiting for the coming of Jesus, wherein lies the only safety
of each individual believer? Matt. 26:41; Luke 21:36.
    14. What condition should now prevail in the church? 1 Cor. 1:10;
Eph. 4:3-6.
    15. What, therefore, is the duty of each member and of the church as a
body? Titus 1:9; Heb. 10:23, 35-37.
    NOTE.—"The follower of Christ will meet with the 'enticing words' against
which the apostle warned the Colossian believers. He will meet with spiritual-
istic interpretations of the Scriptures, but he is not to accept them. His voice
is to be heard in clear affirmation of the eternal truths of the Scriptures. Keep-
ing his eyes fixed on Christ, he is to move steadily forward in the path marked
out, discarding all ideas that are not in harmony with His teaching. The truth
of God is to be the subject for his contemplation and meditation. He is to
regard the Bible as the voice of God speaking directly to him. Thus he will
find the wisdom which is divine."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 474, 475.
    "We are to hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.
Words of power have been sent by God and by Christ to this people, bringing
them out from the world, point by point, into the clear light of present truth.
With lips touched with holy fire, God's servants have proclaimed the message.
The divine utterance has set its seal to the genuineness of the truth proclaimed."
—Mrs. E. G. White, in "Review and Herald," March 3, 1904.
    "I saw a company who stood well guarded and firm, givinc, no countenance
to those who would unsettle the established faith of the body. God looked
upon them with approbation. I was shown three steps,—the first, second, and
third angels' messages. Said my accompanying angel, Woe to him who shall
move a block or stir a pin of these messages. The true understanding of these
messages is of vital importance. The destiny of souls hangs upon the manner
in which they are received.' I was again brought down through these messages,
and saw how dearly the people of God had purchased their experience. It had
been obtained through much suffering and severe conflict. God had led them
along step by step, until He had placed them upon a solid, immovable platform.
I saw individuals approach the platform and examine the foundation. Some
with rejoicing immediately stepped upon it. Others commenced to find fault
with the foundation. They wished improvements made, and then the platform
would be more perfect, and the people much happier. Some stepped off the
platform to examine it, and declared it to be laid wrong. But I saw that nearly
all stood firm upon the platform, and exhorted those who had stepped off to
cease their complaints; for God was the Master Builder, and they were fighting
against Him. They recounted the wonderful work of God, which had led them
                                      [35 1
to the firm platform, and in union raised their eyes to heaven, and with a loud
voice glorified God. This affected some of those who had complained and left
the platform, and they with humble look again stepped upon it."—"Early
Writings," pp. 258, 259.

    "I saw that our heavenly Father has bestowed upon us the great blessing of
light upon the health reform, that we may obey the claims which He has upon
us, and glorify Him in our bodies and spirits which are His, and finally stand
without fault before the throne of God."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 488.
    "The requirements of God must be brought home to the conscience. Men
and women must be awakened to the duty of self-mastery, the need of purity,
freedom from every depraving appetite and defiling habit. They need to be
impressed with the fact that all their powers of mind and body are the gift
of God, and are to be preserved in the best possible condition for His service."
—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 130.

Isa. 60:1-3; Ps. 50:2.
    NOTE.—Lesser's translation of Psalm 50:2 reads: "Out of Zion, the perfec-

    "The day of deliverance is at hand. . . .
    "The Holy Spirit is implanting the grace of Christ in the heart of many a
noble seeker after truth, quickening his sympathies contrary to his nature,
contrary to his former education. The 'Light, which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world,' is shining in his soul; and this Light, if heeded, will
guide his feet to the kingdom of God."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 376, 377.
                               Eternal Verities

    NorE.—"The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of
God." 2 Cor. 4:4, R. V.
    "God is leading a people out from the world upon the exalted platform of
eternal truth, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."—"Testi-
monies to Ministers," p. 29.
    "The third angel, flying in the midst of heaven, and heralding the com-
mandments of God and the testimony of Jesus, represents our work. The
message loses none of its force in the angel's onward flight; for John sees it
increasing in strength and power until the whole earth is lightened with its
glory. The course of God's commandment-keeping people is onward, ever
onward. The message of truth that we bear must go to nations, tongues, and
peoples. Soon it will go with a loud voice, and the earth will be lightened with
its glory. Are we preparing for this great outpouring of the Spirit of God?"
—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 383.
    "This is the last message. There are no more to follow; no more invitations
of mercy to be given after this message shall have done its work. What a
trust I What a responsibility is resting upon all to carry the words of gracious
invitation."—/d., pp. 206, 207.
    14. With what degree of certainty may we know the time and the
message? Luke 21 : 29-33 ; John 8:32.
    NorE.—"The light we have received upon the third angel's message is the
true light. The mark of the beast is exactly what it has been proclaimed

    "No line of truth that has made the Seventh-day Adventist people what
they are, is to be weakened. We have the old landmarks of truth, experience,
and duty, and we are to stand firmly in defense of our principles, in full view
of the world."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 17.
    "The faith and feelings of men may change; but the truth of God, never.
The third angel's message is sounding; it is infallible. . . .
    "It is as certain that we have the truth as that God lives; and Satan, with all
his arts and hellish power, cannot change the truth of God into a lie."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 4, p. 595.
    15. How fierce will be the last conflict? In what will God's people find
their safety? Rev. 12:12, 17; Isa. 26:20, 21; Ps. 91:1-4.
    NOTE.—"We are in the time when tribulations such as the world has never
yet seen shall prevail. . . . But God has set bounds that Satan cannot pass.
Our most holy faith is this barrier; and if we build ourselves up in the faith,
we shall be safe in the keeping of the Mighty One."—"Testimonies," vol. 5,
p. 297.
    16. Describe the final triumph. Rev. 15:1-3; 1 Cor. 15:57, 58.
    NcrrE.—"The darkest hour of the church's struggle with the powers of evil,
is that which immediately precedes the day of her final deliverance."
    "Clad in the armor of Christ's righteousness, the church is to enter upon
her final conflict. 'Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army
with banners,' she is to go forth into all the world, conquering and to conquer.
—"Prophets and Kings," p. 725.
    "In vision I saw two armies in terrible conflict. One army was led by
banners bearing the world's insignia; the other was led by the bloodstained
banner of Prince Emmanuel. .
    "The battle raged. Victory alternated from side to side. Now the soldiers
of the cross gave way, 'as when a standard-bearer fainteth. Isa. 10:18. But
their apparent retreat was but to gain a more advantageous position. Shouts
of joy were heard. A song of praise to God went up, and angel voices united
in the song, as Christ's soldiers planted His banner on the walls of fortresses till
then held by the enemy. The Captain of our salvation was ordering the battle,
and sending support to His soldiers. His power was mightily displayed, en-
couraging them to press the battle to the gates. He taught them terrible things
in righteousness as He led them on step by step, conquering and to conquer.
    "At last the victory was gained. The army following the banner with the
inscription, 'The commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus,' was gloriously
triumphant. The soldiers of Christ were close beside the gates of the city, and
with joy the city received her King. The kingdom of peace and joy and ever-
lasting righteousness was established."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 41, 42.

THE NEW
SABBATH SCHOOL TEACHERS' TRAINING COURSE
      The one called to be a Sabbath school teacher is not merely a dispenser of
information. The genuine teacher is a builder of character, and as such should
endeavor to secure the best possible preparation for his sacred responsibility..
"The true teacher is not satisfied with second-rate work. He is not satisfied
with directing his students to a standard lower than the highest which it is
possible for them to attain."—"Education," p. 29.
      "The teacher must have aptness for his work. He must have the wisdom
and tact required in dealing with minds. . . . A teacher's advantages may
have been limited, so that he may not possess as high,literary qualifications
as might be desirable; yet if he has true insight into human nature; if he had
a genuine love for his work, an appreciation of its magnitude, and a determina-
 tion to improve; if he is willing to labor earnestly and perseveringly, he ;will
comprehend the need of his pupils, and, by his sympathetic, progressive spirit,
will inspire them to follow as he seeks to lead them onward and upward."--/d.,
 pp. 278, 279.                                                            •
      The Sabbath School Teachers' Training Course is conducted in three sec-
 tions. Section No. 1 covers thirteen consecutive weeks of classwork. The
 texts used consist of "Principles of Sabbath School Teaching" and "Primer
 on Teaching," with supplementary material from "Education."
      Section No. 2 covers thirteen consecutive weeks of classwork also. The
 textbooks are: "Better Methods of Sabbath School Teaching" and "Practical
 Pedagogy in the Sabbath School," with supplementary material from "Fun-
 damentals of Christian Education."
       Section No. 3 (in preparation). This will cover thirteen weeks of con-
 secutive classwork. The books will include a practical treatise on the laws
  of learning as applied to Sabbath school teaching, and a helpful volume en-
  titled "Psychology for Bible Teachers." There will be supplementary material
  prepared for this final section of the Training Course.
       Sections 1 and 2 are available NOW. Your conference Sabbath school
  secretary will cheerfully furnish information as to the organization and con-
  duct of these training course classes, and your Book and Bible House will
  supply the textual material.
       Do not delay the organization of this training class in your Sabbath school.
  "He who discerns the opportunities and privileges of his work will allow noth-
  ing to stand in the way of earnest endeavor for self-improvement. He will
  spare no pains to reach the highest standard of excellence."—"Education,"

            The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, June 24

is devoted to the Southern African Division. The special projects of greatest
need in this field are hospitals. Let us enter wholeheartedly into giving a large
offering that there may be a liberal overflow. A special Thirteenth Sabbath
envelope has been prepared, which your school can supply you, and in which
you can save your offerings during the quarter, that your gift may be a generous
one on June 24.
   We hope the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will reach $90,000. When our
world Sabbath schools give $60,000 as a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, $2,000
of this amount is applied as an "overflow," as well as 20 per cent of the excess
above $60,000. Thus if our Sabbath schools give $90,000, there will be an
overflow of $8,000 for the work in this needy Southern African Division. We
can do it if we will !
