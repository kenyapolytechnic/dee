                In the Beginning God Created
   MEMORY VERSE: "By Him were all things .created, that are in heaven, and
that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers; all things were created by Him, and for Him; and He is
before all things, and by Him all things consist." Col. 1:16, 17.
   STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 44-46, 111-116; "Back to the
Bible," George McCready Price, pp. 133-158.

                                 Introduction
    "We need a divine Teacher. In order that the world might not remain in
darkness, in eternal spiritual night, God met us in Jesus Christ. Christ is 'the
true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.' 'The light
of the knowledge of the glory of God' is revealed 'in the face of Jesus Christ.'
The light of Christ, illuminating our understanding, and shining upon the face
of nature, enables us still to read the lesson of God's love in His created works."
—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 256.
               Creation Reveals Divine Workmanship
    1. What subjects are proper objects of our study? Deut. 29:29.
    NoTE.—"All that man needs to know or can know of God has been revealed
in the life and character of His Son."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 286.
    "The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for our study.
This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to penetrate.
The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in conjectures regard-
ing the nature of God, but the effort will be fruitless. This problem has not
been given us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God. None are to
indulge in, speculation regarding His nature. Here silence is eloquence. The
Omniscient One is above discussion."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 429.
     2. What has God told us regarding the origin of all things? Gen. 1:1;
John 1:1-3.
    3. How may this great primary truth be recognized even in lands where
the Bible is not known? Rom. 1:19, 20; Ps. 19:1-3; Job 12:7-9.

                                         [3)
    4. How do we know that God created the very material (called matter)
of which the earth, the sun, and all the rest of the universe is composed?
Col. 1:16; Heb. 11:3.
    NoTE.—It was an old pagan notion that the material composing the uni-
verse has always existed. Most systems of philosophy from the time of the
Greeks down even to our own day have taught this pagan doctrine of the eter-
nity of matter. Only in very recent years has physical science felt compelled
to recognize that matter must have been created. "Everything points with
overwhelming force to a definite event, or series of events, of creation at some
time or times, not infinitely remote. The universe cannot have originated by
chance out of its present ingredients, and neither can it have been always the
same as now."—"Eos," p. 55, Sir James H. Jeans, Secretary of the Royal So-
ciety, London, 1928.
                     God's Word-Creation's Agent
     5. What method did God- employ in the work of creation? Ps. 33:6, 9;
 Ps. 148:5. (Compare "And God said," which is used so frequently in the
first chapter of Genesis.)
    NOTE.—"The work of creation can never be explained by science. What
science can explain the mystery of life?
    "The theory that God did not create matter when He brought the world
into existence, is without foundation. In the formation of our world, God was
not indebted to pre-existing matter. On the contrary, all things, material or
spiritual, stood up before the Lord Jehovah at His voice, and were created for
His own purpose. The heavens and all the host of them, the earth and all
things therein, are not only the work of His hand: they came into existence
by the breath of His mouth."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 258, 259.
    This is what scholars term a fiat creation—the calling into being of things
which were not in existence before. This original creation was literally ex
nihilo, or a creation "out of nothing." After this primary creation, then the
record is that "the earth brought forth." But even this was also a true primary
creation; for living things do not now come forth thus out of the earth; all
our modern animals and plants come only from other animals and plants
already. existing. This modern process of origin we call reproduction; but,
first of all, the various kinds of plants and animals were really created, though,
like the first man (Gen. 2:7), they are said to have been "formed" out of the
dust of the ground.
    6. Why can we not fully comprehend the work of creation?
    ANSWER.—"Just how God accomplished the work of creation He has
never revealed to men; human science cannot search out the secrets of the
Most High. His creative power is as incomprehensible as His existence."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 113.
                                                                          •
    7. Since man and all the plants and animals were "formed," or "made,"
out of previously existing materials (Gen. 2:19), may we still say that they
were "created"? Gen. 1:27, 21.
   NoTE.—The first man, also the first of each kind of animal and of each kind
of plant, were made by methods vastly different from those methods which
God now emplOys to perpetuate or reproduce these forms of life today. (See
"A History of Some Scientific Blunders," chapter IX.) We call the modern
process reproduction by "natural law," while we call the other "creation."
                                    [4I
Both are equally due to the directly exercised power of Jehovah; and while we
moderns sometimes think that we understand "natural law," we are ever in
danger of forgetting the God behind both these natural processes and the pri-
mal process of creation. The record in the Bible is that creation was definitely
completed at a certain time in the past, and is not now going on. The utter
failure of modern biology to show how any living thing can come into exist-
ence either from the inorganic ("spontaneous generation"), or by transform-
ism from some different kind, is the best of proof (if such scientific proof were
needed) that the Bible record of creation is a record of actual fact, not a mere
myth or legend. Because of our modern scientific knowledge, we now know
that only by a real creation can we account for the beginnings of the animals
and plants of our world.
    8. What was the earth like when first created? Gen. 1:2.
    NoTE.—The original Hebrew expression which is here translated "without
form, and void" occurs in only one other place throughout the Old Testament,
in Jeremiah 4:23. The Septuagint, which doubtless was made by scholars who
understood the ancient Hebrew far better than any modern scholars, translates
this "invisible and unfurnished." A translation of the Latin Vulgate of Jerome
(cir. 390-404) makes it "void and empty." Thus there is not the slightest inti-
mation either in the original Hebrew or in any of the early versions that the
earth had been peopled with living beings and had been made desolate. Clearly
the meaning is that the earth was at this time still empty arid had not yet been
stocked with plants and animals. Nor is there the slightest scholarly authority
for changing the verb "was" into the verb "became," making the phrase read:
"The earth became waste and void." To do so would be to twist the word of
God to fit a fantastic theory which has no scriptural foundation.
               The Harmony and Unity of Creation
    9. What evidence have we that "the beginning," of Genesis 1:1, is defi-
nitely a part of the story of creation as recorded in the entire chapter?
Ex. 20:11.
    NOTE.—We need to remember that in this present study of creation we are
dealing only with what we term our solar system. But this part of the fourth
commandment says plainly that during these first six days, God made "heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." This last clause, "all that in them
is," makes it impossible that the fossils and the rocky materials in which we
find them buried can be the relics or ruins of a previous creation. This part of
the fourth commandment forever rules out this "ruin and reconstruction"
theory which is now so widely taught.
    10. In what respects does the order of creation, as given in Genesis 1,
flatly contradict the alleged evolution of plants and animals, as pictured
by the popular geology? Gen. 1:11, 12, 20-22.
    NoTE.—In the Genesis record, the land vegetation, even including the fruit
trees, is said to have appeared before the marine life of the ocean; the winged
fowl appeared at the same time as the first of the ocean life ; while the "creep-
ing things" (verses 24, 25) appeared only after the birds or "winged fowl."
This is all completely out of joint with the order of events as given by evolu-
tionary geology, which makes the creeping things come first. The two can
never be made to fit even moderately well.
     11. After the account of the creation of the various kinds of plants and
                                       (6 )
animals, what is said about the creation of the first man and woman? Gen.
1:26, first part; verse 27.
    12. What is the origin of all the races of mankind? Acts 17:26, first
part.
    NoTE.—Less than a hundred years ago, Louis Agassiz and many others were
teaching the multiple origin of the various races of men, saying that this crea-
tion in Genesis has reference only to the origin of the white race. This is now
known to have been one of the many blunders of "science." Obviously, any
departure from the plain, literal interpretation of the Bible record of the first
days of our world is certain to lead us into confusion and gross errors.
    13. What indicates that at the end of time God will again seek to unite
His people from all nations? Matt. 24:14.

     The Entrance of Sin, Suffering, and Death
   MEMORY VERSE: "The servants of the householder came and said unto him,
Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then bath it tares? He said
unto them, An enemy hath done this." Matt. 13:27, 28.
    STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 46-62; "The Great Contro-
versy," pp. 492-499 (new ed., pp. 559-566); "Back to the Bible," pp. 94-104.

                                  Introduction
   The most obvious and the most important respect in which the evolution
theory is contrary to the Christian religion is in its denial of the fall of man.
Evolution denies the Bible account of the original sinless condition of man-
kind; and hence it denies the Bible's explanation of sin, suffering, and death.
For this reason it is of the greatest importance that we should know what the
Bible says on these subjects.
                              The Edenic Home
    1. What was the earth like when God finished it? Gen. 1:31, first part.
    NOTE.—"As the earth came forth from the hand of its Maker, it was ex-
ceedingly beautiful. Its surface was diversified with mountains, hills, and
plains, interspersed with noble rivers and lovely lakes; but the hills and moun-
tains were not abrupt and rugged, abounding in terrific steeps and frightful
chasms, as they now do; the sharp, ragged edges of earth's rocky framework
were buried beneath the fruitful soil, which everywhere produced a luxuriant
growth of verdure. There were no loathsome swamps nor barren deserts.
Graceful shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the eye at every turn. The heights
were crowned with trees more majestic than any that now exist. The air, un-
tainted by foul miasma, was clear and healthful. The entire landscape outvied
in beauty the decorated grounds of the proudest palace. The angelic host
viewed the scene with delight, and rejoiced at the wonderful works of God."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 44.
                                         (6)
     2. What place was especially prepared as the bridal home of our first
parents? Gen. 2:8, 9, 15.
    NOTE.—"The home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other homes
as their children should go forth to occupy the earth. . . . In the surround-
ings of the holy pair was a, lesson for all time,—that true happiness is found,
not in the indulgence of pride and luxury, but in communion with God through
His created works. If men would give less attention to the artificial, and would
cultivate greater simplicity, they would come far nearer to answering the pur-
pose of God in their creation. Pride and ambition are never satisfied, but those
who are truly wise will find substantial and elevating pleasure in the sources
of enjoyment that God has placed within the reach of all."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," pp. 49, 50.
    3. What was to be man's occupation? Verse 15.
    NorE.—"To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden,
`to dress it and to keep it' Their occupation was not wearisome, but pleasant
and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to occupy his
mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In mental and phys-
ical activity, Adam found one of the highest pleasures of his holy existence.
And when, as a result of his disobedience, he was driven from his beautiful
home, and forced to struggle with a stubborn soil to gain his daily bread, that
very labor, although widely different from his pleasant occupation in the gar-
den, was a safeguard against temptation, and a source of happiness. Those
who regard work as a curse, attended though it be with weariness and pain,
are cherishing an error. The rich often look down with contempt upon the
working classes; but this is wholly at variance with God's purpose in creating
man. What are the possessions of even the most wealthy, in comparison with
the heritage given to the lordly Adam? Yet Adam was not to be idle. Our
Creator, who understands what is for man's happiness, appointed Adam his
work. The true joy of life is found only by the working men and women. The
angels are diligent workers; they are the ministers of God to the children of
men. The Creator has prepared no place for the stagnating practice of indo-
lence."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 50.
     4. What was provided as man's food? Gen. 1:29.
     5. What kind of food was provided for the animals? Verse 30.
    Nors.—It is not necessary to suppose that the original food of such animals
as the lion, the vulture, the serpent, and the anteater was that upon which they
now subsist. It has been found that at times, even now, almost every flesh-
eating animal likes to eat some form of vegetable food. All carnivorous ani-
mals seem to require more protein food that they can readily obtain from the
ordinary vegetable foods. We may conclude that back in the earth's primitive
condition, before the Flood destroyed the original stock of plants and the earth
lost its mild springlike climate, every type of animal had some particular form
of plant food on which it lived. But the beasts were affected by the curse as
was man, and following the Flood, the instincts of the animal world, influenced
by the effects of the curse, became increasingly bloodthirsty. The Flood also
left them as it did man without their normal food, resulting in the more wide-
spread devouring of other animals for food. But with the "restitution of all
 things" (Acts 3:21), the instincts of the animals will again be like those in the
 Edenic world when God pronounced everything "very good." Isa. 11: 6-9 ;
65:25.

                  Sin Destroys Man's Perfect Estate
    6. What conditions now prevailing were brought about by the entrance
of sin? Matt. 13:27, 28, first part; Gen. 3:17-19.
    7. How was there brought to our first parents the first suggestion of
doubt regarding God's wisdom and goodness? Gen. 3:1.
    NoTE.—"It was distrust of God's goodness, disbelief of His word, and re-
jection of His authority, that made our first parents transgressors, and that
brought into the world a knowledge of evil. It was this that opened the door
to every species of falsehood and error."—"Education," p. 25.
    8. Trace the successive steps by which the woman was 'ensnared. Gen.
3:2-5.
    9. How was it that the woman "saw" just what the tempter wanted her
to see? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—Eve yielded to the lust of the eyes. She saw the beauty of the tree
and its fruit, permitted doubt to form in her heart concerning God's prohibi-
tion and its justice, and yielded to the persuasive sophistry of the devil. Under
his influence, she joined in transgression and rebellion against God's command.
(See "Ministry of Healing," p. 243, first part.)
    10. When convicted of sin, what excuses did each of the guilty pair
offer to God? Gen. 3:12, 13.
    NOTE.—"The spirit of self-justification originated in the father of lies; it
was indulged by our first parents as soon as they yielded to the influence of
Satan, and has been exhibited by all the sons and daughters of Adam."—"Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," p. 58.
    11. What curse was pronounced on the serpent? Verse 14.
    NOTE.—"Since it had been employed as Satan's medium, the serpent was to
share the visitation of divine judgment. From the most beautiful and admired
of the creatures of the field, it was to become the most groveling and detested
of them all, feared and hated by both man and beast."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 58.
    It is interesting in this connection to note that in the rocks of many coun-
tries have been found the fossil skeletons of serpents which prove that these
creatures had large wings rendering them capable of easy, graceful flight and
that, moreover, they possessed much larger brains in proportion to the size of
their bodies than most animals now have,—far larger than any reptiles of
today.
    12. Show that Adam's sin was much more deliberate and willful than
Eve's. 1 Tim. 2:14.
    13. How does Paul witness to the origin of sin in mankind and its evil
results? Rom. 5:12. •
    NoTE.—The evolution theory, and modernism, which is the religious phase
of this theory, flatly deny what this text teaches.
      Modernism of Evolution Refuted by the Scriptures
   14. What further light do the Scriptures give us concerning the incep-
tion of sin? 1 John 3:8; Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-19.
   NorE.—These scriptures do not "explain" the origin of sin, in the sense of
                                      {8)
giving a real reason for its existence. To "explain" it in this sense would be
to defend it. Sin is and ever must be without justification, without explana-
tion. It was not due to any neglect or lack of foreknowledge on the part of
God. It was due to an abuse of freedom, a deliberately wrong choice by a
being absolutely dependent upon the Creator, who nevertheless deliberately
rebelled against this dependence and wished to become independent of God.
This evil spirit of rebellion was then imparted by the first rebel to other created
beings, and finally to the first of the human race. And in the wake of this first
sin of mankind has developed the long, sad history of its evil consequences,—
sickness, suffering, death, as its direct physical results, with the shameful record
of rebellion and sin in all its forms down through the centuries.
    15. What rule given by the Master ought we to apply to the theory of
evolution? Matt. 7:16, 17.
    NOTE.—This is the best kind of rule to apply to the logic of a theory. Since
the evolution theory denies the fall of man, and denies God's entire scheme of
atonement for sin, we have a right to say that there must be something wrong,
something radically and horribly wrong with its teachings about the origin
of the world and the things in it. The entire system of the Christian religion
stands or falls with the Bible record of the first chapters of Genesis.

                Creation Not Now Going On
    MEMORY VERSE: "The works were finished from the foundation of the
world." Heb. 4 : 3, last part.
    STUDY HELPS: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 409-438; "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 115; "Back to the Bible," pp. 133-158.

                                 Introduction
    For many centuries there have been those whose philosophy has run di-
rectly contrary to the positive teachings of the word of God. These appeared
in the early Christian church, influenced by the philosophic teachings of Plato
and other heathen teachers of the time. Professing to be Christian, they sought
to harmonize heathen philosophy and scientific thought with Biblical teach-
ings, accepting tenets of the logic of the heathen in place of plain Bible thought.
In modern times, the heresy of a "continuous creation" or evolution, has en-
sconced itself in the heart of the professed Christian church, leading the mem-
bership away from God's word and the plain, simple Bible story that tells
us God "spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast." Evolu-
tion, or modernism, leads but to one objective—disbelief in and rejection of
the Inspired Record.
      The Sabbath Institution Marks a Complete Creation
   1. What fact is of first importance in indicating the proper relation-
ship between us and God? Gen. 1:1; Ps. 100:3; Isa. 64:8.
                                        [9)
     2. What divine memorial of this eternal relationship of the creature to
the Creator did God give to mankind? Ex. 31:13, 16, 17; Ezek. 20:20.
    Ncrrz.—The prime fact of God as our Creator is the foundation of all moral
obligation, first to God Himself, then to our fellow men, for they also were
created by God. And very appropriately the memorial of this relationship and
this obligation becomes the "seal of God," the badge of all moral obligation.
     3. What facts in connection with the origin of the Sabbath prove that
at that time God's work of creation had come to an end? Gen. 2:1, 3; Ex.
20:8-11.
    NOTE.—While evolution denies that there ever was a creation in the sense
of God's speaking the earth and the heavens into existence, the Sabbath stands
as a memorial of a completed creation at a definite time in the past. The Sab-
bath would be meaningless if evolutionary theories were true. The Sabbath,
therefore, is an everlasting protest against the teachings of evolution.
     4. What further scripture shows that, so far as this world is concerned,
creation is a completed work? Heb. 4:3.
     NoTE.—"As regards this world, God's work of creation is completed. For
`the works were finished from the foundation of the world.' But His energy is
still exerted in upholding the objects of His creation."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 115.
     The primary meaning of "rest," used in Genesis 2, in the fourth command-
ment, and in Hebrews 4:10, confirms the fact that the work of creation defi-
nitely ended at the close of the sixth day. The first definition of "rest" in a dic-
tionary is, to cease activity, to stop doing what one is engaged in. This idea is
retained in the common legal phrase, "I rest here," used by lawyers when they
have gone as far in their argument at court as they desire. It contains not the
slightest hint that they are tired out. Similarly the Creator was not weary
from the labor of creation; but having completed what He set out to do, He
rested from this work. And He gave mankind the Sabbath as the divine me-
morial of this event.
                   God's Power Sustains His Works
    5. What is God still actively engaged in doing for the world and its
inhabitants? Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:17; Isa. 40:26.
    6. When Jesus was arraigned before the Sanhedrin on the charge of
violating the Sabbath, what did He declare about God's present-day activ-
ity? John 5:17.
    NorE.—"Nature is the servant of her Creator. God does not annul His
laws, or work contrary to them; but He is continually using them as His in-
struments. Nature testifies of an intelligence, a presence, an active energy,
that works in and through her laws. There is in nature the continual work-
ing of the Father and the Son. Christ says, 'My Father worketh hitherto, and
I work.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 114. (See also "The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 206, 207.)
    7. How else does the Bible speak of God's active care in sustaining the
things which He has made? Neh. 9:6; Ps. 104 : 24-28.
    NoTE.—"It is not because the mechanism that has once been set in motion
continues to act by its own inherent energy, that the pulse beats, and breath
follows breath; but every breath, every pulsation of the heart, is an evidence
                                     ( 10 )
of the all-pervading care of Him in whom 'we live, and move, and have our
being.' It is not because of inherent power that year by year the earth pro-
duces her bounties, and continues her motion around the sun. The hand of
God guides the planets, and keeps them in position in their orderly march
through the heavens. . . . It is through His power that vegetation flourishes,
that the leaves appear and the flowers bloom. . . . Every living creature,
from the smallest insect up to man, is daily dependent upon His providential
care."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 115.
      The Warning Message Against Latter-day Heresies
    8. What prophecy gives us a picture of the latter-day attitude of scien-
tists and religious teachers toward God's word? 2 Peter 3:4.
    Nom—Evolutionists and the scientific world generally, rejecting the story
of creation as recorded in the Bible, put in its place a creation brought about
through evolutionary processes, and extending over countless centuries. They
assume that the world had no real beginning, but even now is developing into
new and higher orders. By this reasoning they say in effect that "all things
continue as they were;" there is no danger now, for there never was a world
flood; man never fell; the danger of the destruction of the world by fire is nil,
for there has never been, and never will be a world destruction. Thus, in re-
jecting the Bible record of creation, of the Flood, etc., and substituting their
own fanciful theories for the word of God, they pave the way for doubt, for
infidelity, and the final rejection of God as the creator of all things, leading in
the end to paganism, already strongly entrenched in some lands where God is
set completely at nought.
    9. What great world disaster does the apostle say these last-day mock-
ers have overlooked? 2 Peter 3:5, 6.
    NorE.—Both the history of science and the logic of the problem prove that
the entire evolution theory rests primarily upon a denial of the universal
Flood, just as Peter predicted would be the case. The Flood will account for
the fossils and for all the other phenomena of the stratified rocks. But evolu.!"
tionary geologists adopt the theory of putting these fossils in a long series of
successive ages, denying that there ever was a Flood, and seeking to explain
the record of the rocks by modern, everyday processes. Peter, in describing
their peculiar philosophy, says that the scoffers of the last days "willfully
ignore" (Moffatt's translation) the fact that the world was once destroyed by
a universal deluge. And Peter adds that this former universal deluge is good
 evidence that God will someday again destroy the world, this time by fire.
2 Peter 3:7, 8.
     10. What portion of the special message for our day seems to have
 been specially timed for just this condition of the modern world? Rev. 14:7.
     11. What timely exhortation is given for believers living in these last
 days? Luke 21:34-36.
     NorE.—The correctness of our views about any truth of the Bible will never
 suffice to save us or, make us ready for heaven. Each of us must have a living,
 daily connection with the Living Vine. Individually we must be followers of
 the God of heaven.

                           The Literal Week
' MEMORY VERSE: "In six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
day, and hallowed it." Ex. 20:11.
     STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 111-116; "Testimonies to
Ministers," pp. 134-136.
                                  Introduction
    Probably most of us do not realize that Seventh-day Adventists are about
the only people who still believe in a real creation of the earth and of the ani-
mals and plants in six literal days. Yet we are convinced that this truth must
be of profound importance to the world of our day, else a reform on the mat-
ter of the Sabbath would not have been divinely timed for this day.
                    God's Creative Power Unlimited
    1. What are we told about the manner in which the creation was brought
about? Ps. 33:6, 9.
    NOTE.—Notice how many times the expression, "God said," is repeated in
the first chapter of Genesis. This is what scholars call a "fiat" creation, or a
creation brought about by the expressed wish or the spoken will of God.
    2. When God "spake, and it was," what things were called into exist-
ence at His word? John 1:3; Heb. 11:3.
    NOTE.—The American Revised Version reads: "By faith we understand
that the worlds have been framed by the word of God so that what is seen
hath not been made out of things which appear." Moffatt renders the latter
part of the verse: "and thus the visible was made out of the invisible." This
latter is very closely like the original Greek; but we must not get the impres-
sion that there was some previously-existing substance out of which God made
the worlds. The original creation was literally a creation out of nothing
    3. How do we know that the days of creation must have been literal
days, similar to those that we now have? Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31.
    NorE.—Since each one of the creation days is expressly said to have had
its "evening" and "morning," it is obvious that common, literal days are in-
tended. Also the Sabbath is commanded because God occupied six days in
creating, and on the seventh He ceased this work, and rested, or "took de-
light," in what He had made, commanding mankind henceforth to do as He
had done.
    "This reason appears beautiful and forcible when we understand the days
of creation to be literal. The first six days of each week are given to man for
labor, because God employed the same period of the first week in the work
of creation. On the seventh day man is to refrain from labor, in commemora-
tion of the Creator's rest."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 111.
     4. What erroneous interpretation is often given to the record of the
days of creation?
                                         [ 12 I
    ANSWER.—The day-age theory, or the view that the days of creation were
long periods of time.
    NoTE.—It is admitted that the Hebrew word for day (yom) is sometimes
used for an indefinitely long period of time, just as we often use the English
word day (as when we speak of what happens in "our day") ; but the context
in Genesis shows conclusively that such is not its meaning here.
    "The assumption that the events of the first week required thousands upon
thousands of years, strikes directly at the foundation of the fourth command-
ment. It represents the Creator as commanding men to observe the week of
literal days in commemoration of vast, indefinite periods. This is unlike His
 method of dealing with His creatures. It makes indefinite and obscure that
 which He has made very plain. It is infidelity in its most insidious and hence
 most dangerous form; its real character is so disguised that it is held and taught
 by many who profess to believe the Bible."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 111.
     5. Since this day-age theory is termed "infidelity in its most insidious
 and hence most dangerous form," what statement of the apostle Paul seems
 to fit this case? Rom. 1:22.
         Sabbath Reform Restores Correct Conception of
                       Creation Record
     6. Mat prediction tells us the reason why the scoffers of the "last
days" would adopt false ideas about the creation of the world? 2 Peter
3:5, 6.
    NorE.—Peter's language means that these last-day scoffers have got into
the errors which they hold because they have grown accustomed to ignoring
the divine record of a universal deluge. Historically and logically the now
popular evolution doctrine is founded on the denial of a universal deluge.
     7. What explanation of scientists is there for these long geological
"ages" during which, they say, the earth was slowly becoming what it is
today?
     ANSWER.—This idea of the geological "ages" has been built upon (1) a flat
denial that the earth ever experienced a universal deluge; and (2) a purely
artificial classification of the fossils, by which some of them are assigned to one
"age" and some to another, making thus a long series of successive "ages,"
which, however, are of an arbitrary or artificial character; for the Flood theory
of geology explains everything in a straightforward manner and satisfactorily.
The Protestant churches, by ignoring entirely the Bible record of a universal
 deluge, have prepared the way for the almost universal acceptance of the evo-
 lution doctrine.
     8. What are the three current interpretations of the fossils which are
 found buried in the earth?
     ANSWER.—There are only three possible methods of dealing with the fos-
sil plants and animals with reference to the creation:
     (1) Some say they lived before the creation of Genesis 1; this is the pre-
 Adamite theory.
     (2) Others say they lived during a long-drawn-out creation; this is the
 day-age theory.
     (3) The Bible teaching of the universal Flood is that they were buried
 long after the original creation.
                                        [131
    9. In other respects, how does the account of the Flood compare with
the other theories?
    ANSWER.—The two theories always get us into difficulty with reference to
other parts of the Bible. The Flood explanation makes absolute harmony
with the entire Bible, and enables us to take the record of creation at its full
face value. Modern scientific discoveries show that there can be no genuine
scientific objections to it as an explanation of the facts of the stratified rocks.
    NOTE.—"In the history of the Flood, inspiration has explained that which
geology alone could never fathom. In the days of Noah, men, animals, and
trees, many times larger than now exist, were buried, and thus preserved as
an evidence to later generations that the antediluvians perished by a Flood.
God designed that the discovery of these things should establish faith in in-
spired history; but men, with their vain reasoning, fall into the same error as
did the people before the Flood,—the things which God gave them as a benefit,
they turn into a curse by making a wrong use of them."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 112.
    10. In these days, when the theory of long evolutionary ages is almost
universally believed, show how a Sabbath reform message is specially ap-
propriate. Gen. 2:2; Ex. 20:8-11; Rev. 14:7.

           Natural Law and Miracle of Grice
    MEMORY VERSE: "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a
man soweth, that shall he also reap." Gal. 6:7.
    STUDY HELPS: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 413-438; "Back to the Bible,"
pp. 105-122.
                                 Introduction
    There are those who seek to make a sharp distinction between the natural
and the supernatural. That this distinction is a false one will appear from the
following:
    "In dwelling upon the laws of matter and the laws of nature, many lose
sight of, if they do not deny, the continual and direct agency of God. They
convey the idea that nature acts independently of God, having in and of itself
its own limits and its own powers wherewith to work. In their minds there
is a marked distinction between the natural and the supernatural. The natural
is ascribed to ordinary causes, unconnected with the power of God. . . . This
is false science; there is nothing in the word of God to sustain it. . . . God is

Nature in her work testifies of the intelligent presence and active agency of
a Being who moves in all His works according to His will."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 8, pp. 259, 260.
       Cause and Effect in Nature and Human Conduct
   1. Why do calamities come? Prov. 26:2, last part.
   2. What cannot evil men do against God's people? Num. 23:8.
   Nom—This entire history of Balaam is an outstanding proof that evil
men, or men and demons combined, have no power to destroy God's people,
except as God permits it for the advancement of His kingdom. All such satanic
incantations as are supposed to accompany witchcraft or the action of the
"evil eye," are of the devil, and can have no harmful influence upon the
people of God so long as they place their trust wholly in Him.
   3. What natural law controls cause and effect both in the spiritual and
physical or natural realms? Gal. 6:7; Rom. 2:6.
   4. What is it that keeps God from bestowing blessings upon nations and
upon individuals? Isa. 59:1, 2; Jer. 5:25.
   NOTE.—Sin is here spoken of as a spiritual insulator, keeping the blessings
of God from flowing out to us, just as we might insulate against electricity
by means of rubber or glass.
        God Helps and Blesses Those Who Turn to Him
    5. Under what circumstances may God's promise of good be changed?
Jer. 18:7-10.
    6. How is natural law seen in God's dealings with the sinner? Ex. 20:5.
    NorE.—"This necessarily implies—if the children walk in the steps of
their fathers; for no man can be condemned by divine justice for a crime of
which he was never guilty. (See Ezekiel 18.) Idolatry is however particularly
intended, and visiting sins of this kind refers principally to national judg-
ments. By withdrawing the divine protection the idolatrous Israelites were
delivered up into the hands of their enemies, from whom the gods in whom
they had trusted could not deliver them. This God did to the third and fourth
generation, i. e., successively; as may be seen in every part of the Jewish his-
tory, and particularly in the book of Judges. And this, at last, became the
grand and the only effectual and lasting means in His hand of their final de-
liverance from idolatry; for it is well known that after the Babylonish cap-
tivity the Israelites were so completely saved from idolatry, as never more to
have disgraced themselves by it as they had formerly done."—Clarke's Com-
mentary.
    7. How are God's superabounding grace and kindness shown in the
same connection? Ex. 20:6.
    Nora.—"Even those who love God and keep His commandments merit
nothing from Him, and therefore the salvation and blessedness which these
enjoy come from the mercy of God: 'Showing mercy,' etc. What a dispropor-
tion between the works of justice and mercy.! Justice works to the 'third' or
'fourth,' mercy' to 'thousands' of generations l"—Clarke's Commentary.
    8. How willing is God to rescue the repentant sinner from the natural
 results of sin? Ezek. 33:11.
                                     [ 15 )
   9. What does God pledge Himself to restore to penitent souls? Joel
2:25.
              There Is Safety Only as We Trust in God
    10. What therefore should be our attitude toward such love and mercy?
Jer. 10:23; Prov. 3:5, 6.
   11. What special promise do we have of protection against the delu-
sions and deceptions of the last days? Rev. 3:10.

The Significance of the Modern Sabbath Reform
   MEMORY VERSE: "Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign
between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."
Ezek. 20:12.
   STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 60, 61; vol. 9, p. 16; "Back to the
Bible," pp. 133-158.
                                 Introduction
    "The Sabbath question is to be the issue in the great final conflict in which
all the world will act a part."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 352.
       The Sabbath a Sign of Creation and Sanctification
    1. Who besides the children of Israel would keep the Sabbath'? Isa.
56:6, 7.
    2. What admonition concerning obedience was given through Jere-
miah? Jer. 6:16.
    3. What promise is given to all who observe the Sabbath? Isa. 58:
13, 14.
    NOTE.—While this prophecy of Isaiah doubtless referred to a current
needed reform, such a reform is especially needed today as we near the close
of the great conflict between good and evil. Surely now as never before, God's
salvation is near to come, and His righteousness to be revealed, and the call
to Sabbath observance is surely part of the last-day reformation.
    4. What was the Sabbath originally established to commemorate? Gen.
2:2; Ex. 20:8-11.
    5. What is the special significance of Sabbath reform in these days?
    NoTE.—"For more than a generation now, it has become increasingly clear
that the opening chapter of Genesis is the central point of attack of all the
skeptical forces, either inside or outside the church. Both skeptics and be-
lievers confess that the whole edifice of Bible religion, the whole plan of sal-
vation, rests upon this opening record in Genesis. . . .
                                       f 16 )
    "We are saying only the obvious when we declare that the fight today rages
around the belief in the Genesis story of creation. Couple with this the fact
that the seventh-day Sabbath is the memorial of the events described in the
opening Genesis chapters, and there follows the inevitable condusion that
the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the most important
religious institution for all who call themselves Fundamentalists, for all who
believe the Bible. . . .
    "When we began the preaching of the seventh-day Sabbath, a generation
ago, its great significance was not so evident to many devout religious people.
But as the years have passed and the great religious war of our present-day
centers more and more around the citadel of the creation record, the signifi-
cance of the seventh-day Sabbath becomes increasingly plain."—Francis D.
Nichol, in "Review and Herald," Sept. 29, 1932.
    6. What further religious meaning was attached to Sabbathkeeping
for the Israelites? Ex. 31:13, 16, 17.
    NorE.—This religious meaning still attaches to the Sabbath. "The Sab-
bath given to the world as the sign of God as the creator is also the sign of
Him as the sanctifier. The power that created all things is the power that re-
creates the soul in His own likeness. To those who keep holy the Sabbath
day it is the sign of sanctification."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 350.
     7. How is this same idea expressed many centuries latet through the
prophet Ezekiel? Ezek. 20:12.
                       Entering Into God's Rest
    8. What will be the experience of everyone who seeks to be justified by
keeping God's law? Rom. 3:19, 20; Gal. 3:11.
   NoTE.—"The principle that man can save himself by his own works, lay at
the foundation of every heathen religion; it had now become the principle of
the Jewish religion. Satan had implanted this principle. Wherever it is held,
men have no barrier against sin." —"The Desire of Ages," p. 36.
    9. When we struggle so hard to be righteous, but find that we always
fail, what does Christ invite us to do? Matt. 11:28; Phil. 2:13.
    10. How is this spiritual relief connected with the observance of the
Sabbath? Heb. 4:10.
    NorE.—The obvious meaning of this text is that if we would enter into
God's rest of soul, we must cease from our own works to make ourselves
righteous, and must trust to the work of Christ, already finished and com-
pleted for us, awaiting only our demand and reception. And this ceasing from
our own works is compared to God's resting on the seventh day. Hence the
Sabbath becomes the memorial of the rest from the works of self-justification,
and the rest of soul that comes to those who trust in what God through Christ
has accomplished for us.
                 Sabbath Observance the Final Test
   11. How universal is the requirement of Sabbath observance? Mark
2:27.
   NoiE.—All men, all nations, all races need the blessed truths represented
by the Sabbath; and no people ever needed them more than the peOple of
our day.
                                     [ 17I
    12. What was the practice of the apostle Paul with reference to the
Sabbath when preaching to Jews and Gentiles? Acts 13:42; 16:13; 17:2;
18:4, 11.
    13. What call to worship is to be given to the people of the last days?
Rev. 14:7.
    14. What other worship is placed in direct contrast to this worship of
the Creator? Rev. 14:9; 13:15.
    NOTE.—It is clear that the crisis of the ages is to be a test, a final rallying
call to mankind on the part of these two powers, each calling for the obedi-
ence and worship of the entire race.
    The present-day vogue of the evolutionary theory, denying as it does the
facts of a literal creation as described in the early chapters of the Bible, sets
up a tendency among professing Christians which will demand a choice for
or against the teaching of God's word. The Sabbath is inevitably involved.
If one accepts the literal creation, he must accept the Sabbath—its memorial.
Only so can he be said truly to worship the Creator. True Sabbathkeeping
thereby becomes a sign of acceptance of the Creator as God, of His record of
creation as the only true and authentic factual account.

  SABBATH SUNDAY          MONDAY      TUESDAY    I WEDNESDAY1 THURSDAY FRIDAY




                  Why God Permits Suffering
   MEMORY VERSE: "We know that all things work together for good to them
that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose." Rom. 8:28.
   STUDY HELP: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 247-259; 469-482.

                                 Introduction
    "Those who surrender their lives to His guidance and to His service will
never be placed in a position for which He has not made provision."—"Min-
istry of Healing," p. 248.
    "We are never called upon to make a real sacrifice for God. Many things
He asks us to yield to Him, but in doing this we are but giving up that which
hinders us in the heavenward way. Even when called upon to surrender those
things which in themselves are good, we may be sure that God is thus work-
ing out for us some higher good.
    "In the future life, the mysteries that here have annoyed and disappointed
us will be made plain. We shall see that our seemingly unanswered prayers
and disappointed hopes have been among our greatest blessings."—"Ministry
of Healing," pp. 473, 474.
           Suffering a Corrective Leading to Perfection
   1. How does the experience of Job illustrate the fact that Satan tries
to make God's people unhappy? Job 1:10, 12; 2:3-6.
   Nom—This action of Satan was mere provocation, trying to make Job
miserable in order to cause him to sin against God. The record shows that
                                       [181
Satan brought everything he was permitted to bring against Job in order to
induce him to rebel against God.
    2. How is the disciplinary purpose of suffering brought out by Hosea?
Hosea 6:1.
    NOTE.—"Each fiery trial is God's agent for their [God's children's] refin-
ing. Each is fitting them for their work as colaborers with Him. Each con-
flict has its place in the great battle for righteousness, and each will add to
the joy of their final triumph. Having this in view, the test of their faith and
patience will be cheerfully accepted rather than dreaded and avoided."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 306.
    3. Show how the sufferings of the prodigal son resulted in repentance
and a return to his father. Luke 15:11-19.
    4. What language by Paul brings out this disciplinary or educative
purpose of the sufferings which God allows to come upon His people?
1 Cor. 11:32.
    5. How does God seek to teach us that He is our Father? Heb. 12:5-8.
                   The Father's Hand in Affliction
    6. We know that God is infinite; He controls the entire universe in all
of its most minute details; how may we know that He will do nothing that
is not for our ultimate good? Rom. 8:28, 32.
    NorE.—"God never leads His children otherwise than they would choose
to be led, if they could see the end from the beginning, and discern the glory
of the purpose which they are fulfilling as coworkers with Him. Not Enoch,
who was translated to heaven, not Elijah, who ascended in a chariot of fire,
was greater or more honored than John the Baptist who perished alone in the
dungeon. 'Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on
Him, but also to suffer for His sake.' And of all the gifts that Heaven can be-
stow upon men, fellowship with Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty
trust and the highest honor."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 225.
    7. How does the psalmist express his confidence in the wisdom and
effectiveness of God's providences? Ps. 34:7, 10.
    8. How is this same idea further expressed? Prov. 16:7.
    9. How does another prophet express the educative purpose of trials
and sufferings? Mal. 3:3.
    NOTE.—"It is right to be dissatisfied with the way in which we perform
duty, but we are not to be dissatisfied with the duty itself because we would
rather do something else. In His providence God places before human beings
service that will be as medicine to their diseased minds. Thus He seeks to lead
them to put aside the selfish preference, which, if gratified, would disqualify
them for the work He has for them. If they accept and perform this service,
their minds will be cured. If they refuse•it, they will be left at strife with
themselves and others."—"Gospel Workers," p. 270.
    10. In order that we may reach spiritual maturity and may bear more
 fruit, what does Jesus say will be done? John 15:2.
                       God's Purpose Vindicated
   11. Show the remedial purpose in the driving of the first pair out of
the Garden of Eden. Gen. 3:23, 24.
                                      [ 19
    NOTE.—Adam and Eve, who had been placed in God's garden "to dress
it and to keep it," were henceforth to till the soil and earn their bread in the
sweat of their faces. Yet this toil was to be for their own good. To have
perpetuated evil forever would have cursed the universe of God for all eter-
nity. Man chose to disobey—he must now suffer separation from the comforts
of his previous holy state, and through toil in the elements from which he
came, so occupy his days that in his sinful weakened state he would not find
time to indulge his evil tendencies. Of Sodom later it was said that she was
destroyed because her inhabitants were cursed by "fullness of bread, and
abundance of idleness." Ezek. 16:49. God placed upon man the task of win-
ning subsistence from the earth, and this for his own good, lest an idle hand
and idle mind become the devil's workshop to his eternal loss.
    12. Was there not a merciful purpose in God's destruction of the earth
by the first great world disaster? Gen. 6:7, 13.
    Nom—The following wise remarks are from Dr. John Woodward's "Es-
say Toward a Natural History of the Earth," published in 1695, one of the
first books which gave a sound scientific treatise on Flood geology:
    "The first earth was suited to the first state of mankind, who were the
inhabitants of it, and for whose use 'twas made. But when human nature had,
by the fall, suffered so great a change, 'twas but necessary that the earth should
undergo a change too, the better to accommodate it to the condition that
mankind was then in: and such a change the Deluge brought to pass."—

    13. What experiences, are we told, will have been passed through by the
redeemed who at last stand triumphant before God? Rev. 7:14.

                   How Does Apostasy Arise?
   MEMORY VERSE: "Take heed lest there shall be anyone that tnaketh spoil of
you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men." Col. 2:8, R. V.
   STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 113, 117-124; "The Great
Controversy," pp. 582-592 (new ed., pp. 657-667); "Back to the Bible," pp. 133-136,
232-235, 117.
                                  Introduction
    It is a great mistake to think that the religions of Greece and Rome, of
Egypt and Babylon, of India and China, were always merely a blind worship
of images and a following of magical incantations. Such do heathen religions
seem to be, when we view them in their full development, in their maturity.
But in their beginnings, and even later, to the initiated, or those who knew
the inner teachings of their heathen faith, there was more than images and
magic. All seem to have originated as supposedly wise systems of "explain-
ing" the various phenomena of nature, as attempts to' account for the origin
of things, or as efforts to "explain" man's relationship to the universe and to
                                      [20 7
the mysterious Power at the head of the universe. All heathen systems seem
to have had about the same origin. Modernism, or what is often termed
"theistic evolution," is exactly another apostate religion in the making. Should
time last, the world would probably see another colossal apostate paganism
founded on the theories taught in the name of "modern science."
                    Man Exalted Above the Creator
    1. What powers over nature were given to man in the beginning? Gen.
1:28.
    Norm.—In addition to the "dominion" over the living things of nature,
man was also commanded to "subdue" the earth. In our modern engineering
and applied sciences of chemistry and physics we see the partial, though long-
delayed, fulfillment of this command to subdue the earth. However, these
vast powers over nature are full of danger and menace when they are possessed
by rebels against God, by beings at war against the wise and beneficent laws
of the Creator. As Sir Alfred Ewing remarked in his presidential address be-
fore the British Association for the Advancement of Science, September, 1932,
man is wholly unprepared to use wisely these vast powers now within his
reach, for he "is still unfitted for the tremendous responsibility it entails. The
command of nature has been put into his hands before he knows how to com-
mand himself."
    2. How does Paul describe the apostasy of men in the long ago? Rom.
1:25.
    Norz.—The original word here translated "creature" means anything that
has been created. These men in ancient times, like those of our day, became
absorbed in acquiring and using the things made or created by God, instead
of being intent on worshiping and serving the Creator of these things.
    3. What does the apostle say was the real reason behind these ancient
apostasies? Rom. 1:21; compare John 1:9.
    NOTE.—This is the real explanation of all apostasy ;—the rejection of
Christ, of the true light, knowing God but failing to glorify Him as God. Thus
darkness flooded men's minds so that the "world by wisdom knew not God."
                   Rejecting Light Invites Disaster
    4. What is said of the condition of the antediluvian world? Gen. 6:5.
    5. What light do we have on the moral decay of Sodom? Gen. 13:13;
Ezek. 16 : 49.
    6. What evil trend did Judah and Jerusalem follow? 2 Chron. 36:14-16.
    7. How does God deal with nations as such? Gen. 15:16; Lev. 18:24-28.
    Norz.—"Prophecy has traced the rise and fall of the world's great em-
pires,—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each of these, as with
nations of less power, history repeated itself. Each had its period of test, each
failed, its glory faded, its power departed, and its place• was occupied by
another."—"Education," p. 177.
    "With unerring accuracy, the Infinite One still keeps an account with all
nations. While His mercy is tendered, with calls to repentance, this account
will remain open; but when the figures reach a certain amount which God
has fixed, the ministry of His wrath commences. The account is closed. Divine
                                       21
patience ceases. There is no more pleading of mercy in their behalf."—"Tes-
timonies," vol. 5, p. 208.
    8. What effect did a special manifestation of God's presence have upon
Job, a righteous man? Job 42:5, 6.
    9. What very different effect did a similar manifestation of God from
Sinai have upon many of the Israelites who were still unregenerate? Ex.
20:19.
    NorE.—Where man is living in full harmony with the principles of God's
kingdom, he is not fearful of direct contact and speech with his Maker. Israel
was faithless and disobedient, only shortly out of slavery in Egypt. They
desired an intermediary. Men today, through their rejection of the teachings
of God's word, and because of placing their confidence upon human wisdom,
make a cleavage between themselves and God. He can no longer speak to
their hearts. Their dependence is placed wholly on the wisdom of this world.
In effect they say, "We cannot hear God, nor understand what He says. These
human teachings we can understand. We will accept these in place of God's
speaking to us." But such a course cannot result otherwise than in the ulti-
mate rejection of all that God has revealed for our learning. The end will be
infidelity, and a revival of paganism. This we already see in many parts of
the world.
    10. What followed the rejection of the special light given to the Israel-
ites? Ex. 32:1-6, 26-28.
              Advent Message Exposes Last Apostasy
    11. What warning did Paul give Timothy regarding the false and dan-
gerous theories of science prevalent in their day? 1 Tim. 6:20, 21.
    12. What part did these false scientific or philosophic theories have
in the making of the great apostasy which followed soon after the apostles
were dead? Col. 2:8; 2 Thess. 2:10, last part, 11, 12.
    NOTE.—The semipaganism was the blending of ancient philosophy with
the outward forms of Christianity which resulted in the first great apostasy;
the blending of the modern world-view is in our day resulting in the great
modern apostasy. The former produced the "beast"; the latter will produce
—what? The image to the beast.
    13. What peculiar mixture of religion and false science does Peter say
will prevail in the "last days"? 2 Peter 3:3, 4.
    14. What will result from this modern apostasy's obtaining control
of the civil governments of the world in the last days? Rev. 13:11-14.
    15. What timely warning does God send to the world to counteract this
modern apostasy? Rev. 14:7-12.
    16. Finally, what are God's true people exhorted to do? Rev. 18:4.


   Plan your gifts to the cause of God as you plan for your
                        personal needs.

                                 Probation
    MEMORY VERSE: "That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel
after Him, and find Him." Acts 17:27, first part.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 321, 322, 587; "The Great Contro-
versy," pp. 428, 490, 491 (new ed., pp. 489, 556. 557).

                                 Introduction
    All life is a probation. God's love embraces every human being; and life
and consequently probation will be prolonged just so long as God in His infi-
nite wisdom sees that there is any possibility that the individual, the nation,
or the world will improve this probation in the right way. "To every erring
son and daughter of Adam He gives the privilege of another trial."—Mrs.
Ellen G. White, in "Signs of the Times," May 21, 1902. And yet, "all around
us are souls going down to ruin as hopeless, as terrible, as that which befell
Sodom. Every day the probation of some is closing. Every hour some are
passing beyond the reach of mercy."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 140.
                Divine Light Illumines Our Pathway
    1. What is given for the illumination of every human life? John 1:9.
    Norn.—"Among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit of
kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon their ears, they have be-
friended the missionaries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own
lives. Among the heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to
whom the light is never brought by human instrumentality, yet they will not
perish. Though ignorant of the written law of God, they have heard His
voice speaking to them in nature, and have done the things that the law re-
quired. Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts,
and they are recognized as the children of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 638.
    2. Having been given light, what is man's position before God? Rom.
1:20, last part.
    3. What is taken into consideration by the Lord in judging the lives of
men? Ps. 87:4-6.
    4. How only may we obtain acceptance with God? Eph. 2:8; Rom. 4:
13, 16.
    NoTE.—We obtain acceptance with God through faith. It is God's gift
through our choice, our desire. God gives us His righteousness, and no knowl-
edge of the theory of truth will avail us without our yielding ourselves to
God, and our acceptance of His righteousness through living faith. "Genuine
faith is life."
             Responsibility for Making Right Decision
   5. What does Jesus teach concerning our accountability for light given
us? John 12:35.
   NorE.—"If you wait for light to come in a way that will please everyone,
                                   (281
you will wait in vain. If you wait for louder calls or better opportunities, the
light will be withdrawn, and you will be left in darkness. Accept every ray
of light that God sends. Men who neglect to heed the calls of the Spirit and
word of God, because obedience involves a cross, will lose their souls."—"Tes-
timonies," vol. 5, p. 720.
    6. What is God's purpose in His dealing with all peoples? Acts 17:
26, 27.
   7. How long will God bear with peoples and nations? Gen. 15:16;
Matt. 23:31, 32.
   8. To what is the church of God compared? Matt. 5:14, 13.
   9. What will God do to those who have turned from Him and lost their
love for His truth? Rev. 18:2-8.
                    No Second Probation After Death
    10. With what parable did Jesus illustrate the probation extended to
the individual or to the nation? Luke 13:6-9.
    11. With what other parable did Jesus seek to illustrate the fact that
there can be no second probation, or probation after death? Luke 16:26.
    NOTE.—"Thus Christ represented the hopelessness of looking for a second
probation. This life is the only time given to man in which to prepare for
eternity."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 263.
    "The unconditional pardon of sin never has been, and,never will be. Such
pardon would show the abandonment of the principles of righteousness which
are the very foundation of the government of God. It would fill the unfallen
universe with consternation. God has faithfully pointed out the results of
sin, and if these warnings were not true, how could we be sure that His prom-
ises would be fulfilled? That so-called benevolence which would set aside
justice, is not benevolence, but weakness."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 522.

Lessons From Nature and From God's Providences
    MEMORY VERSE: "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created
these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by
the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth." Isa. 40:26.
   STUDY HELPS: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 51-58; "Education," pp. 99-101;
"Counsels to Teachers," pp. 185-190.

                                  Introduction
   There can be little doubt that we have not sufficiently accustomed our-
selves to thinking of God's providential care for us in connection with His
care for the great universe around us. God's care for His universe ought to
convince us that He can and will care for us His children.
                                         [ 24 ]
    "While the Bible should hold the first place in the education of children
and youth, the book of nature is next in importance."—"Counsels to Teach-
ers," p. 185.
         God's Wisdom and Care Revealed in Creation
    1. How is God spoken of in contrast with the inanimate idols of the
heathen? Jer. 10:10, first part.
    NOTE.—The term "living" attached to the second Name implies that He
is constantly engaged in maintaining the universe which He has created, and
that He is just as unceasingly ordering all the providences which attend our
lives.
    "Above the distractions of the earth He sits enthroned; all things are open
to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He orders that
which His providence sees best."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 417.
    2. What promise is given to them who seek for true wisdom in any de-
partment of life or of knowledge? Prov. 2:1-5; James 1:5.
    NOTE.—"Whatever line of investigation we pursue, with a sincere purpose
to arrive at truth, we are brought in touch with the unseen, mighty Intelli-
gence that is working in and through all."—"Education," p. 14.
    3. What may we learn from the larger aspects of the universe? Ps.
19:1-4.
    NoTE.—"Upon all created things is seen the impress of the Deity. Nature
testifies of God. The susceptible mind, brought in contact with the miracle
and mystery of the universe, cannot but recognize the working of infinite
power. Not by its own inherent energy does the earth produce its bounties,
and year by year continue its motion around the sun. An unseen hand guides
the planets in their circuit of the heavens."—"Education," p. 99.
    4. What may we learn from the smaller aspects of nature? Matt. 10:
29, 30.
    NoTE.—The wonders of the miscroscope, the sciences of chemistry and
physics, have opened up some of the ways in which the Creator manages the
details of His universe. The scientific law of the conservation of energy tells
us that all the various forms of energy are but the same at last; they are but
variant manifestations of the very same Power, maintaining in orderly array
a thousand million suns, and at the same time controlling without any mis-
takes the molecules, atoms, protons, and electrons of which our bodies and all
the rest of nature are composed.
    5. What personal encouragement may we receive from these facts?
Matt. 6:28-30.
    6. How is God's care for His creatures expressed by the psalmist? Ps.
145:9, 15, 16.
              The Regenerative Power of the Gospel
    7. What promise was given to our first parents that God would implant
a counterworking power against the evil that is working in all the world?
Gen. 3:15.
   NoTE.—"This sentence, spoken in the hearing of our first parents, was to
them a promise. Before they heard of the thorn and the thistle, of the toil and
sorrow that must be their portion, or of the dust to which they must return,
                                    t25)
they listened to words that could not fail of giving them hope. All that had
been lost by yielding to Satan could be regained through Christ."—"Educa-
tion," p. 27.
    8. What impressive language is used by Isaiah to describe the power
and wisdom of the Creator? Isa. 40:26.
    9. For more than the first two thousand years of human history, men
had no Bible, no written word of God. What did the people of those times
have by which to learn the will of their Creator? Rom. 1:20; Acts 14:17.
    NorE.—They had (1) the book of nature; (2) they had the providential
dealings of God with themselves personally, and with their companions and
with their forefathers, as given by tradition; and (3) they had the direct voice
of God speaking to their souls.
    "The whole natural world is designed to be an interpreter of the things of
God.. . . The most effective way to teach the heathen who know not God, is
through His works. In this way, far more readily than by any other method,
they can be made to realize the difference between their idols, the works of
their own hands, and the true God, the Maker of heaven and earth. . . . There
is a simplicity and purity in these lessons direct from nature that makes them
of the highest value to others besides the heathen."—"Counsels to Teachers,"
p. 186.
    "The poet and the naturalist have many things to say about nature, but it
is the Christian who enjoys the beauty of the earth with the highest apprecia-
tion, because he recognizes his Father's handiwork, and perceives His love in
flower and shrub and tree."—"Steps to Christ," p. 91.
    10. What far-reaching principle was announced in Christ's words to
Nicodemus? John 3:3-7.
    NOTE.—Christ taught Nicodemus that God through the work of the Holy
Spirit could transform and regenerate man so that he would be reborn, a new
creature. This new life is the life of God pulsating in the channel fully sur-
rendered and open to His life. One of the most important discoveries of mod-
ern times is that living things can come only from previously living things of
the same kind. All life comes from the living God, the Creator. He, too, is the
regenerator, making us new creatures in Christ Jesus. "I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me." Gal. 2:20.
    11. Mat further statement of this fact do we find in Paul's writings?
2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.
                      Trustfully Abiding in God
    12. Since the work of creation was "finished from the foundation of the
world (Heb. 4:3) how is the present orderly system of nature maintained?
John 5:17; Heb. 1:3.
    NOTE.—It is a paganlike view of nature which would suppose that God
started the universe running and thenceforth allowed it to run on its endowed
or inherent energy. God's power is still ceaselessly exercised in "upholding all
things by the word of His power" (Heb. 1:3), that same divine word by which
the universe was originally called into existence.
    13. What sublime statement of trust in the wisdom and goodness of the
Creator is expressed by the prophet Habakkuk? Hab. 3:17, 18.
                                      [26]
    14. What incident in the career of Elijah illustrates God's care for
those who obey Him? 1 Kings 17:13-16.
 • 15. What great scientific fact has God recorded in the earth in order
to protect the people of our day from such false teachings as those of or-.
ganic evolution? Ps. 104:6-9; 2 Peter 3:3-7.
    NOTE.—Since we have been told that "God designed that the discovery of
these things [the fossil animals and plants] should establish faith in inspired
history" ("Patriarchs and Prophets," page 112), we may conclude that it is
proper for His people in these last days to point to the fossils as a result of the
Flood. An intelligent recognition of the Flood as having been the cause of the
burial of the fossils would protect any logical-minded man from the delusions
of the evolution theory. And such a recognition would be one of the most
helpful ideas in strengthening faith in the Bible and in the Christian religion.

  SABBATH     SUNDAY      MONDAY      TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY FRIDAY




              The First Great World Disaster
   MEMORY VERSE: "As in the days that were before the Flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
the ark, and knew not until the Flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be." Matt. 24:38, 39.
   STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 90-104; "The Geological-Ages
Hoax," Price, pp. 93-106; "The New Geology," Price, pp. 679-692.

                                 Introduction
    The relatively large space occupied by the record of the Flood in the book
of Genesis, where all the other events of the early days of the world are re-
corded so very briefly, ought to indicate the vital importance of this record
of the world's first great disaster. By a proper study of this subject, it will
be seen that this record in Genesis is of especial importance to the people liv-
ing in the very last days of earth's history, just before the second great world
disaster; for these two events are constantly associated in the teachings of
Christ and in the writings of the apostles.
            Man's Corruption Brings Warning of Flood
    1. After the murder of Abel, what was done regarding the murderer?
Gen. 4:13-15.
   NoTE.—"In sparing the life of the first murderer, God presented before the
whole universe a lesson bearing upon the great controversy. The dark history
of Cain and his descendants was an illustration of what would have been the
result of permitting the sinner to live on forever, to carry out his rebellion
against God. The forbearance of God only rendered the wicked more bold
and defiant in their iniquity. Fifteen centuries after the sentence pronounced
upon Cain, the universe witnessed the fruition of his influence and example, in
the crime and pollution that flooded the earth. It was made manifest that the
                                        [27 3
sentence of death pronounced upon the fallen race for the transgression of
God's law was both just and merciful. The longer men lived in sin, the more
abandoned they became. The divine sentence cutting short a career of un-
bridled iniquity, and freeing the world from the influence of those who hail
become hardened in rebellion, was a blessing rather than a curse."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p. 78.
      2. What do we know of the state of civilization before the Flood?
Gen. 6:1-7.
     Norz.—"Notwithstanding the wickedness of the antediluvian world, that
age was not, as has often been supposed, an era of ignorance and barbarism.
. . . Their mental powers were early developed, and those who cherished the
fear of God and lived in harmony with His will, continued to increase in knowl-
edge and wisdom throughout their life. . .
     "The antediluvians were without books, they had no written records; but
with their great physical and mental vigor, they had strong memories, able to
grasp and to retain that which was communicated to them, and in turn to
transmit it unimpaired to their posterity. And for hundreds of years there
were seven generations living upon the earth contemporaneously, having the
opportunity of consulting together, and profiting each by the knowledge and
experience of all.
     "The advantages enjoyed by men of that age to gain a knowledge of God
through His works have never been equaled since. And so far from being an
era of religious darkness, that was an age of great light. All the world had
opportunity to receive instruction from Adam, and those who feared the Lord
had also Christ and angels for their teachers. And they had a silent witness
to the truth, in the garden of God, which for so many centuries remained
among men."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 82, 83.
      3. Why did God finally decide to destroy the entire world by a Flood?
Gen. 6:11-13.
      NoTE.—"The world was in its infancy; yet iniquity had become so deep
and widespread that God could no longer bear with it; and He said, 'I will
destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth.' He declared
that His Spirit should not always strive with the guilty race. If they did not
cease to pollute with their sins the world and its rich treasures, He would blot
them from His creation, and would destroy the things with which He had de-
lighted to bless them; He would sweep away the beasts of the field, and the
vegetation which furnished such an abundant supply of food, and would trans-
form the fair earth into one vast scene of desolation and ruin."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 92.
      4. How completely did God say He would destroy the animals and
plants? Gen. 7:4, margin.
      5. How completely does the record say this was carried out? Verses
19-23.
                    •     Noah Enters the Ark
      6. What day marks the beginning of the Flood? Verse 11.
      7. When, therefore, did Noah actually enter the ark? Verses 7, 10.
             The Agencies of Destruction at Work
    8. What agencies besides the rain were employed to produce the de-
struction? Gen. 6:17.
                                     [ 28 )
    Nom—Prof. Eduard Suess, the noted geologist, says that the Hebrew
word majim here translated "of waters" may properly be regarded as maijam,
"from the sea." However this may be, it is clear that in the record of how the
Flood was accomplished (Gen. 7:11), the expression "the fountains of the
great deep" must refer to the ocean; for throughout the Old Testament the
terms "the deep" and "the great deep" are used for the ocean. This breaking
up of the.fountains of the great deep must refer to something like a series of
huge tidal waves (or earthquake waves) which rolled in from the oceans over
the lands.
     9. How is this fact of the ocean's part in the Flood expressed in other
scriptures? Ps. 104:5-7, 9; Job 38:8, 11.
     NorE.—It is a very common thing, in the rocks formed by the Flood, to
find great numbers of layers or beds containing land forms alternating with
others containing the remains of creatures from the deep ocean. It is the or-
dinary condition for the coal beds, which were formed of land plants and trees,
to occur alternately with other beds containing sea animals. Such conditions
seem to indicate an alternate moving of the waters back and forth, like the flow
and ebb of the tide, only on an enormous scale. Indeed, an abnormal tidal
action seems to be implied in the Psalms and in Job as among the chief factors
in producing the Flood.
     10. If the waters on earth were again to be released, how completely
would these cover the land areas?
     ANswxR.—The average depth of the ocean is about 13,000 feet, and the
average height of the dry land is about 2,250 feet. Thus the ocean is nearly
six times as deep as the land is high, in general average. And as the ocean's
 surface is about three times that of the dry land, there is nearly eighteen times
as much water below sea level as         is dry land above it. If all the dry lands
 were to be sunk beneath the sea, the water would be raised only a few hundred
 feet above-its present level. Furthermore, if the solid part of the earth were
 to be smoothed out to a perfectly even surface, the water of the ocean would
 cover the entire earth to a depth of nearly 9,000 feet, or about 1.56 miles. A
 very slight disturbance of the present delicate balance of land and water would
 be required to spill the oceans all over the lands. It is a striking manifestation
 of the watchcare of the Creator that the ocean keeps so obediently within the
 bounds set for it since the Flood. "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further."
 Job 38:11.
      11. How long did it take for the Flood to reach its maximum of destruc-
 tiveness? Gen. 7:12, 17.
      12. After this first period of forty days, when the Flood was increasing
 to its maximum, what length of time did the Flood waters "prevail" over
 the earth? Verse 24.
      13. What other similar period of time is next mentioned? Gen. 8:3.
      14. When was the land finally left dry? Gen. 8:14; Ps. 104:7, 8.
      Nom—The American Revised Version of the latter text reads as follows:
 "At Thy rebuke they [the waters] fled; at the voice of Thy thunder they
 hasted away (the mountains rose, the valleys sank down) unto the place
  which Thou hadst founded for them."
      15. What then is the total period of the Flood, from its beginning until
  at least some of the dry land appeared? Compare Gen. 7:11 with 8:13, 14.
  This makes a year and ten days.
                                       [ 29 )
     16. What language clearly indicates something like the ebb and flow
 of enormous tides in the subsidence of the Flood as well as in its oncoming?
 Gen. 8:3, margin. .
                           The Lesson of the Flood
    17. What covenant did God establish with Noah immediately after the
 Flood? Gen. 9:12-17.
    18. What important facts may we learn from the Bible record of the
Flood?
    ANSWER.—A candid study of the Flood as recorded in the Bible estab-
lishes the following important facts:
    (a) The Flood came as a special act of God to destroy the race and the
world as it then was. Gen. 6:13.
    (b) The Flood was universal over the globe. Gen. 7:19.
    (c) The Flood lasted long enough to destroy all land animal life outside
the ark, and was violent enough to destroy many marine animals, and to bury
trees, plants, and animals under deep beds of sand and clay. Gen. 7:21, 22.
    (d) After the waters abated, God expressly set bounds so that never again
should they cover the earth with another Flood. Ps. 104:9.
    (e) The rainbow is the sign of God's promise never to bring another uni-
versal Flood. Gen. 9:12-17.

                     The Effects of the Flood
    MEMORY VERSE: "There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after
their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His corning? for since the fathers
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For
this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old,
and the earth standing out of the water and in the water; whereby the world that
then was, being overflowed with water, perished: but the heavens and the earth, which
are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
judgment and perdition of ungodly men." 2 Peter 3:3-7.
    STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 105-112; "The Geological-Ages
Hoax," pp. 28-106; "Back to the Bible," pp. 45-77; "The New Geology," pp. 679-692.

                                 Introduction
    There are a thousand and one subjects of scientific study and investigation
in these days, but the most important of them all is the proper understanding
of what was actually accomplished by the Flood. A correct understanding of
this matter is of especial importance for the people of God in these last days,
because this subject holds the key to all the current scientific problems, includ-
ing those of the evolution theory, and because we are living now just before
the earth is to be again destroyed by another world catastrophe, a destruction
by fire.
                                        ( 80 )
                     Changes Caused by the Flood
     1. What was the condition of the earth after God created it? Gen. 1:31.
     2. What scriptures indicate that up to the time of the Flood the atmos-
phere must have been in many respects different from that of our day,
since up to that time rain had never fallen? Gen. 2:5, 6; Heb. 11:7.
     Nora.—"The world before the Flood reasoned that for centuries the laws
of nature had been fixed. The recurring seasons had come in their order.
Heretofore rain had never fallen; the earth had been watered by a mist or
dew. The rivers had never yet passed their boundaries, but had borne their
waters safely to the sea. Fixed decrees had kept the waters from overflowing
their banks."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 96, 97.
     3. After the Flood, what beautiful sign appeared for the first time?
Gen. 9:14.
     Nara.—The rainbow is produced by certain conditions of the atmosphere;
but since these conditions did not prevail in the antediluvian world, there was
no rainbow. When the necessary conditions prevailed after the Flood, Noah
saw a rainbow.
      4. If the Flood actually inundated the entire earth, and if the ocean
waters were repeatedly carried back and forth (as indicated by the expres-
sion "going and returning," Gen. 8:3, margin), what would these ocean
waters, as well as the land waters produced by the torrential rains, inevit-
ably produce in enormous and widespread geological changes?
     ANswEs.—"The entire surface of the earth was changed at the Flood. A
third dreadful curse rested upon it in consequence of sin. As the water began
to subside, the hills and mountains were surrounded by a vast, turbid sea.
Everywhere were strewn the dead bodies of men and beasts. The Lord would
 not permit these to remain to decompose and pollute the air, therefore He
made of the earth a vast burial ground. A violent wind which was caused to
 blow for the purpose of drying up the waters, moved them with•great force,
 in some instances even carrying away the tops of the mountains, and heaping
 up trees, rocks, and earth above the bodies of the dead. . . .
     "The earth presented an appearance of confusion and desolation impossi-
 ble to describe. The mountains, once so beautiful in their perfect symmetry,
 had become broken and irregular. Stones, ledges, and ragged rocks were now
 scattered upon the surface of the earth. In many places, hills and mountains
 had disappeared, leaving no trace where they once stood; and plains had given
 place" to mountain ranges. These changes were more marked in some places
 than in others. Where once had been earth's richest treasures of gold, silver,
 and precious stones, were seen the heaviest marks of the curse. And upon
 countries that were not inhabited; and those where there had been the least
 crime, the curse rested more lightly."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 107, 108.
      5. Since up to the time of the Flood no such convulsion of the waters
 had ever occurred, and since God promised that never again would such a
  Flood be allowed to desolate the earth (Gen. 8:21, 22), what must have
 caused the burial of the fossils?
      ANSWER.—Everyone who wishes to take the Bible at its full face value
 acknowledges that the Flood was the cause of the great geological changes,
 and the cause of the burial in the earth of all the remarkable prehistoric forms
  of life, including the beds of coal, the innumerable remains of fossil fishes, and
                                        ( 81 )
the large extinct animals, such as the dinosaurs and the elephants, with innu-
merable others. The pre-Adamite theory of the fossils is unscriptural and un-
scientific; the day-age theory is unreasonable and in many ways unscientific,
and is contrary to the entire plan of Christian faith and doctrine. It leads
inevitably to the evolution theory. The only possible view that is in harmony
with the Bible is that the Flood caused the geological changes.
    6. 'What permission was given to man respecting his food after the
Flood? Gen. 9:3-5.
    NoTE.—"Before this time God had given man no permission to eat animal
food; He intended that the race should subsist wholly upon the productions
of the earth; but now that every green thing had been destroyed, He allowed
them to eat the flesh of the clean beasts that had been preserved in the ark."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 107.
    "God saw that the ways of man were corrupt, and that he was disposed to
exalt himself proudly against his Creator, and to follow the inclinations of his
own heart. And He permitted that long-lived race to eat animal food to
shorten their sinful lives. Soon after the Flood the race began to rapidly de-
crease in size, and in length of years. There were a class of very large animals
which perished at the Flood. God knew that the strength of man would de-
crease, and these mammoth animals could not be controlled by feeble man."
—"Spiritual Gifts," vol. 4, p. 121.
          Man's Scheme of World Dominion Thwarted
    7. How did God plan that the now desolated earth should again become
peopled with human beings and again stocked with plant and animal life?
Gen. 9:1; 8:17.
    8. As time went on, how did some of the people try to counteract this
command of God to scatter abroad over the earth? Gen. 11:4.
    9. How did God break up their rebellious scheme and scatter them
abroad? Verses 6-9.
   NoTE.—"God had directed men to disperse throughout the earth, to re-
plenish and subdue it; but these Babel builders determined to keep their com-
munity united in one body, and to found a monarchy that should eventually
embrace the whole earth. Thus their city would become the metropolis of a
universal empire: its glory would command the admiration and homage of
the world, and render the founders illustrious. The magnificent tower, reach-
ing to the heavens, was intended to stand as a monument of the power and
wisdom of its builders, perpetuating their fame to the latest generations. . . .
The whole undertaking was designed to exalt still further the pride of its pro-
jectors, and to turn the minds of future generations away from God, and lead
them into idolatry."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 119.
               Nature's Lesson of Divine Guidance
    10. By what illustrations does God indicate that the animal world is
instinctively more obedient than mankind? Jer. 8:7; Isa. 1:3.
    NoTE.—Scientists have always had a difficult time in explaining the geo-
graphical distribution of the animals without some special divine guidance
after the Flood. We see many examples of the migration of birds, of butter-
flies, and of eels in our modern world; hence it is reasonable to suppose that
the peculiar circumstances confronting the animals as they came forth from
                                     1321
the ark on the desolated earth, would call for some special manifestation of
divine guidance to scatter them abroad over the world. And it would be only
the usual thing if, while men were disobedient, the dumb brutes obeyed the
guiding call of their Creator.
    11. What lessons do all the things of nature teach the attentive child
of God? Job 12:7-9.
    12. How absolutely are both men and animals dependent upon the
Creator? Verse 10.
    13. What are some of the practical lessons that we may learn from the
ways in which the living things all, around us obey the guiding voice of the
Creator? Prov. 6:6-8; Matt. 6:26.

  Creation as a Part of the Last-Day Message
   MEMORY VERSE: "Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His
judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
the fountains of waters." Rev. 14:7.
   STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 603-612 (new ed., pp. 681-691).

                                 Introduction
    The evolutionary theory has become a basic creed of life for the vast ma-
jority of educated people throughout the civilized world. Hence it is only
to be expected that God's special message for these days will be timed and
adapted to these modern conditions, this intellectual and religious crisis.
    "Despite all superficial continuity, a remarkable change has come about
within the last seventy-five years. The change is nothing less than the sub-
stitution of paganism for Christianity as the dominant view of life. Seventy-
five years ago Western civilization, despite inconsistencies, was still predomi-
nantly Christian; today it is predominantly pagan."—"Christianity and Lib-
eralism," Prof. I. G. Machen, p. 65.
    The logical and literary symmetry of the Bible is missed entirely, if we fail
to see how the first part of God's Book is intimately connected with the last
part of it, and its complement. Not only does the last of Revelation deal with
a new heaven and a new earth, but the last gospel message to mankind is indis-
solubly connected with the record of creation (including the Sabbath) given
in the first chapters of Genesis. The final disposal of sin and sinners harks
back to—
                    ". . man's first disobedience, and the fruit
                    Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
                    Brought death into the world, and all our woe."

          Increased Knowledge to Speed Gospel Message
   1. what prophetic utterance foretells a great advance in scientific
knowledge in the last days? Dan. 12:4.
                                        [ 33 ]
   2. How is this increase of knowledge to be made use of in the procla-
mation of the gospel? Matt. 24:14.
   3. Into what two parts is the gospel message, as adapted to the last
days, divided? Rev. 14:7.
               Sabbath Reform Exalts God as Creator
    4. In close connection with Isaiah's wonderful description of the Crea-
tor's power, what special message is Zion commanded to proclaim? Isa.
40:9.
    5. For what time was this message intended? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—This implies that the world in general will be ignoring the Creator
and His claims upon them; for God's messages are timely, always adapted to
meet some crisis in the life of mankind.
    These verses in Isaiah 40 indicate that the knowledge of the Creator will
be lacking with most people in the latter days just prior to our Lord's return.
They call for the making known to men of God, the Creator of heaven and
earth, and for obedience to His commands. God's special messages are always
timely, but they are adapted to the condition of the times for which they are
specially given.
    6. What memorial has God given to keep His creative power and His
claims upon their worship and obedience before the minds of men? Ex.
20:8-11; Ps. 111:4; 135:13.
   NorE.—A reform on the Sabbath is specifically adapted to counteract the
modern widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution. Such a reform is
also clearly implied in Rev. 14:12.
           Science "Falsely So Called" Leads to Idolatry
     7. Christ repeatedly compared the intellectual attitude of the people
of the last days with that of the people in the days of Noah. Wherein are
the two periods said to be alike? Matt. 24:38, 39.
    NorE.—The people of Noah's day are said not to have known "until the
Flood came, and took them all away;" although God's special warning had
been sounding in their ears for one hundred twenty years. This result followed
because these antediluvians were following "the teachings of a deceptive
philosophy," just as at the present time. Referring to the last days, we are
told: "Then, as in the world before the Flood, iniquity will prevail. Follow-
ing the promptings of their corrupt hearts and the teachings of a deceptive
philosophy, men will rebel against the authority of Heaven."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 89.
    8. What has been the result of the false science of our day, so far as the
Bible is concerned?
    ANSWER.—A neglect of the Bible, with ignorance of its spiritual teachings,
on the part of most of mankind.
    NOTE.—"A day of great intellectual darkness has been shown to be favor-
able to the success of the papacy. It will yet be demonstrated that a day of
great intellectual light is equally favorable for its success. In past ages, when
men were without God's word, and without the knowledge of the truth, their
eyes were blindfolded, and thousands were ensnared, not seeing the net spread
for their feet. In this generation there are many whose eyes become dazzled by
                                     [84)
the glare of human speculations, 'science falsely so called;' they discern not the
net, and walk into it as readily as if blindfolded. God designed that man's
intellectual powers should be held as a gift from his Maker, and should be
employed in the service of truth and righteousness; but when pride and ambi-
tion are cherished, and men exalt their own theories above the word of God,
then intelligence can accomplish greater harm than ignorance. Thus the false
science of the present day, which undermines faith in the Bible, will prove
as successful in preparing the way for the acceptance of the papacy, with its
pleasing forms, as did the withholding of knowledge in opening the way for its
aggrandizement in the Dark Ages."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 572, 573.
    9. 'What results inevitably follow when people cease to worship their
Creator? Rom. 1:21-23, 28.
     10. How is covetousness defined in Paul's letter to the Colossians?
Col. 3:5.
    11. How else may idolatry make itself manifest besides worship of gods
of gold, silver, wood, and stone?
     AwswER.—"It is as easy to make an idol of false doctrines and theories as
to fashion an idol of wood or stone. By misrepresenting the attributes of God,
Satan leads men to conceive of Him in a false character. With many, a philo-
sophical idol is enthroned in the place of Jehovah; while the living God, as
He is revealed in His word, in Christ, and in the works of creation, is wor-
shiped by but few. Thousands deify nature, while they deny the God of
nature. Though in a different form, idolatry exists in the Christian world
today as verily as it existed among ancient Israel in the days of Elijah. The
god of many professedly wise men, of philosophers, poets, politicians, jour-
nalists,—the god of polished fashionable circles, of many colleges and univer-
sities, even of some theological institutions,—is little better than Baal, the sun-
god of Phoenicia."—"The Great Controversy," p. 583.
     12. What picture does Isaiah give that accurately describes the world
in the last days? Isa. 2:7-9.
              The Impending Doom of the Unrighteous
    13. How does Peter connect the rejection of the message about the sec-
ond coming of Christ with false scientific theories which deny the Flood and
turn creation into evolution? 2 Peter 3:3-7.
    Nom—The leading teachers of evolution have been outspoken in scoffing
at the idea that the world is soon to end by destruction, predicting on the other
hand that man is destined to progress indefinitely in the future. Charles Dar-
win, in the very closing sentences of his "Origin of Species," argues (just as
Peter predicted) that since no great cataclysm has ever desolated the whole
world, "we may look with some confidence to a secure future of great length.
And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all
corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress toward perfection."
    This boundless, unreasoning optimism was a favorite theme of Herbert
Spencer: "Progress is not an accident but a necessity. What we call evil and
immorality must disappear. It is certain that man must become perfect."
    Again Spencer says: "The ultimate development of the ideal in man is
certain,—as certain as any conclusion in which we place the utmost faith; for
instance, that all men will die."
                                       [ 86
    14. What solemn warning is given in Ezekiel regarding God's dealings
with the idolaters of the last days? Ezek. 8:15, 16; 9:4-6, 11.
    NorE.—It is evident that the special light which we now have on the sub-
ject of creation has been designed by God to enable us in these days to appre-
ciate what it means to have a Creator, what it is to be creatures, in a truer
way than could be appreciated by those of other days. We cannot doubt that
these truths have been brought to our attention at this time to aid us in carry-
ing to the world the message of Revelation 14:7, and to help us to proclaim
the Sabbath "more fully," as predicted in "Early Writings," page 85, new
edition.

   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," pp. 89-96.

                                 Introduction
   "None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible
will stand through the last great conflict."—"The Great Controversy," p. 593.
   "The infinite mercy and love of Jesus, the sacrifice made in our behalf, call
for the most serious and solemn reflection. We should dwell upon the char-
acter of our dear Redeemer and Intercessor. We should meditate upon the
mission of Him who came to save His people from their sins. As we thus con-
template heavenly themes, our faith and love will grow stronger, and our
prayers will be more and more acceptable to God, because they will be more
and more mixed with faith and love. They will be intelligent and fervent.
There will be more constant confidence in Jesus, and a daily, living experience
in His power to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him."—
"Steps to Christ," pp. 93, 94.
                          The Knowledge of God
    1. In what beautiful words does the apostle picture the joy of know-
ing God? Rom. 11:33.
    NoTE.—"There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than
the study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts,
to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If
God's word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind,
a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose that is rarely seen in these
times."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 94, 95.
    2. How does the apostle express his own positive knowledge of the real-
ity of Christ? 2 Tim. 1:12.
    NOTE.—The scene is in a Roman prison. The missionary apostle is soon
to die. But here is no discouragement. Instead: "This man of faith beholds
                                       [ 86
the ladder of Jacob's vision, representing Christ, who has connected earth
with heaven, and finite men with the infinite God. His faith is strengthened
as he calls to mind how patriarchs and prophets have relied upon the One
who is his support and consolation, and for whom he is giving his life. From
these holy men who from century 10. century have borne testimony for their
faith, he hears the assurance that God is true. His fellow apostles, who, to
preach the gospel of Christ, went forth to meet religious bigotry and heathen
superstition, persecution, -and contempt, who counted not their lives dear unto
themselves that they might bear aloft the light of the cross amidst the dark
mazes of infidelity,—these he hears witnessing to Jesus as the Son of God, the
Saviour of the world."—"The Acts of the' Apostles," p. 512.
    3. What had a knowledge of God through the Scriptures done for the
youthful Timothy? 2 Tim. 3:15-17.
                    •
             Faith in Christ as Our Personal Saviour

    6. Concerning Himself, what does He declare? John 14:6.
    7. What treasures are to be found in accepting and knowing Christ as
Saviour? Col. 2:3.
    NoTE.—"Jesus Christ is the knowledge of the Father, and Christ is our
great teacher sent from God. Christ has declared in the sixth chapter of John
that He is that bread sent down from heaven. 'Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life.'"
   "Christ came in the form of humanity to live the law of God. He was the
word of life. He came to be the gospel of salvation to the world, and to fulfill
every specification of the law. Jesus is the word, the guidebook, which must
be received and obeyed in every particular. How necessary that this mine of
truth be explored, and the precious treasures of truth be discovered and se-
cured as rich jewels."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education," pp. 383, 385.
    8. If Christ be in us, with what will our hearts and minds be filled?
Eph. 3:17-19.
                           Love for the Truth
    9. What danger lurks today even in the church environment? 2 Tim.
4:4; Rom. 1:25.
   NOTE.—"God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and
the Bible only, as the standard of all doctrines, and the basis of all reforms.
The opinions of learned men, the deductions of science, the creeds or decisions
of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous and discordant as are the churches
which they represent, the voice of the majority,—not one nor all of these
should be regarded as evidence for or against any point of religious faith. . . .
   "Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man in the place
of God. He leads the people to look to bishops, to pastors, to professors of
theology, as their guides, instead of searching the Scriptures to learn their duty
for themselves. Then, by controlling the minds of these leaders, he can influ-
ence the multitudes according to his will."—"The Great Controversy," p. 595.
    10. For what did Christ pray? John 17:17.
                                       ( 37 1
    11. By what will all men eventually be judged? Ps. 96:13.
    NoTE.—Men will be judged in the last day by their acceptance or rejection
of the truths of God. His righteous standards will be the measuring rod of
that day when every man must appear before the judgment seat. He who
is Himself the way, the truth, and the life will stand as advocate for those who
have received Him. How happy the state of those who have learned to know
Him "whom to know is life everlasting."
                       Strict Obedience Essential
    12. How fully will one who knows the truth be obedient? 2 Cor. 10:5.
    13. Who -will first be judged? Who stand in greatest danger? 1 Peter
4:17.
    NoTE.—"Every man's work passes in review before God, and is registered
for faithfulness or unfaithfulness. Opposite each name in the books of heaven •
is entered, with terrible exactness, every wrong word, every selfish act, every
unfulfilled duty, and every secret sin, with every artful dissembling. Heaven-
sent warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted moments, unimproved opportuni-
ties, the influence exerted for good or for evil, with its far-reaching results, all
are chronicled by the recording angel."—"The Great Controversy," p. 482.
    "In the typical service, only those who had come before God with con-
fession and repentance, and whose sins, through the blood of the sin offering,
were transferred to the sanctuary, had a part in the service of the Day of
Atonement. So in the great day of final atonement and investigative judg-
ment, the only cases considered are those of the professed people of God. The
judgment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and takes place at a
later period."—Id., p. 480.
    14. What will be characteristic of the remnant, or last-day church of
God? Rev. 12:17; 14:12.
                           Faithful at All Costs
    15. If unbelieving, what may we expect? Heb. 3:18.
    NOTE.-Of Israel, God swore that those who failed to believe or refused to
accept of His commands should not enter into His rest. Only the faithful, souls
whose loyalty to principle is unquestioned and apparent to God and men,
may enter into the rest of God. "The wicked are like the troubled sea, when
it cannot rest. . . . There is no peace . . . to the wicked." Isa. 57:20, 21.
Loyalty, faithfulness, obedience bring peace to the soul, and that peace is en-
hanced and will be glorified in His kingdom of peace where we "shall run, and
not be weary ; and . . . shall walk, and not faint." Isa. 40:31.
    16. What constancy is essential to the saving of the soul? Heb. 10:39.
    17. What blessed promises are made to those who, having believed and
accepted Christ, remain faithful? Rev. 2:10, 25-28; 3:11.
    NoTE.—The "overcomer" is promised life eternal. They who are faithful
receive the crown of life. It is in holding fast that the test comes in human
life. All God's promises are to these loyal, faithful ones. Those who on the sea
of glass sing the song of Moses and the Lamb will have come "out of great
tribulation." As Christ came into this world by personal choice to endure the
scorn and rejection of men, to suffer, to die, so He expects of His followers
that when called upon they should low    ol in His steps. But in return, it is
theirs to receive the fulfillment of all His promises.

  AFRICAN MISSION                                                 rine
           OF THE                                                          Toi

 NORTHERN EUROP
     DIVISION

          THE THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                          September 30, 1939
    Our mission responsibility for this quarter is the East and West
African mission fields of the Northern European Division, as seen by
the accompanying map. In this territory live fifty-seven million people.
The greatest need of these fields so far as our denominational work is
concerned is the training of African workers and teachers. In order to
train such workers, we need to establish training schools under com-
petent leadership, and to provide the necessary equipment.
    When we gave to this same mission field the fourth quarter of 1937,
the Thirteenth Sabbath offering amounted to $93,080.02; thus there was
an "overflow" of $8,616, which went to this needy field. The gifts of
our loyal Sabbath school members, which made this overflow possible,
were greatly appreciated, and it is hoped as we give again to East and
West Africa, the hearts of our people will be touched to give liberally
of their means.
    When the Thirteenth Sabbath offering reaches $60,000, remember
there is an overflow of $2,000. Our Sabbath school members can make
this overflow as large as they wish, for it is increased by 20 per cent of all
that is given beyond $60,000. Let every member do his best to help
toward the training of workers and teachers in this African field.
