APPROPRIATIONS OF PAST THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERINGS TO
    THE MISSIONS OF THE NORTHERN EUROPEAN DIVISION
    The mission fields of Northern Europe have benefited substantially in past
years by the overflows of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings, although only
thrice have such overflows been assigned to these fields.
    The work in the East and West African Mission fields in 1920 received
$38,363.61 for the reopening of activities following the World. Wai-. In 1930
a gift of $5,000 was made to Northern Europe, with which the work was
opened in the French Cameroons and a new station at Kampala, Uganda. In
1934 another overflow of $1,532.08 went to the African missions of the North-
ern European Division.
    Remember the mission fields of Northern Europe this quarter with liberal
offerings on the Thirteenth Sabbath. When $60,000 is reached on December
25, these fields will receive an overflow of $2,000; we can make this overflow
as large as we wish, for it will be increased by 20 per cent of all that is given
beyond $60,000. Shall we not give as never before at this time that the work
of God may go forward?

                        The Gospel in Type
MEMORY VERSE: "I will put enmity between thee and the w.Jman, and between
  thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
  Gen. 3:15.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 343-358.

                            THE FALL OF MAN
    1. Through disobedience to God's law, what have the people of
this world become? Rom. 5:19; 3:23.
   2. Into what helpless condition did man come as a result of sin?
Rom. 3:9-18; 5:12.
   NOTE .—Through the fall, man lost all that a loving God had originally pro-
vided for him. Home, health, happiness, and even life itself were forfeited. Sin
had fixed a,gulf which of himself man could not cross, leaving him without God
and without hope in the world. Of himself he.had no ransom price for his soul.
    3. What is the sure result of sin? Gen. 2:17; Rom. 6:23.

                          A WAY OF ESCAPE
   4. In what promise did God give man assurance of a Saviour?
Gen. 3:14, 15.
   5. What promise concerning the seed did God make to Abraham?
Gen. 17:19.
   6. To whom does "the seed" refer? Gal. 3:16.
   NOTE.—The Seed of Abraham and of Isaac, who will receive not only the
land of Canaan, but also the whole earth from the hand of His Father, is the
same seed promised to Eve. He who was to bruise the serpent's head declared,
"The prince of this world cometh, and bath nothing in Me." John 14:30. He
whom the great red dragon tried to devour was caught up to God and to His
throne. Rev. 12:4, 5.
    7. When Christ came, what was He to do for man? Matt. 1:21;
Rom. 5:9.
                                     31
    8. In order for Christ to deliver man from sin and its penalty, what
was it necessary for Him to do? Rom. 5:6, 8; 1 Cor. 15:3.
    NOTE.—Man's redemption could not be accomplished with corruptible
things such as silver and gold, for the penalty of his sin had to be paid, and
"sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death." James 1:15. This penalty had
been made known to Adam in the beginning. If man transgressed, he must
"surely die." The plan of redemption must, therefore, provide the death of an
acceptable substitute. There was only one being in the universe who was qual-
ified to become man's redeemer, and whose blood could atone for his guilt.
That one was Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
    When the prorhise of salvation was made in Eden, there was no setting aside
of the death penalty. The Son of God would suffer on the sinner's behalf.
The whole plan of redemption centers in the idea of a substitute's dying in
man's place,—the innocent suffering for the guilty. Christ alone was able to
take the sinner's place, bear the full load of his guilt, and pay the full penalty
for the same by His own sacrificial death.
    "Angels . . . offered to become a sacrifice for man. But an angel's life
could not pay the debt; only He who created man had power to redeem him."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 64, 65.
  Thus the integrity of God's immutable law could be upheld in the death of
Christ, and the sinner redeemed by His blood.
                    THE SANCTUARY SERVICE A TYPE
   9. Through what sacrificial ceremony did God anciently teach man
the plan of redemption? Gen. 4:4; 22:13.
    NOTE.—"These brothers were tested, as Adam had been tested before them,
to prove whether they would believe and obey the word of God. They were
acquainted with the provision made for the salvation of man, and understood
the system of offerings which God had ordained. They knew that in these
offerings they were to express faith in the Saviour whom the offerings typified,
and at the same time to acknowledge their total dependence on Him for par-
don; and they knew that by thus conforming to the divine plan for their
redemption, they were giving proof of their obedience to the will of God.
Without the shedding of blood, there could be no remission of sin; and they
were to show their faith in the blood of Christ as the promised atonement, by
offering the firstlings of the flock in sacrifice. Besides this, the first fruits of
the earth were to be presented before the Lord as a thank offering."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p. 71.
    10. After their deliverance from Egypt, what were the children of
Israel instructed to make, and why? Ex. 25:8.
    11. Describe the tabernacle and its articles of furniture. Heb. 9:2-5.
   12. What was the purpose of the service that was performed in the
sanctuary? Heb.- 9:1, 9, 10.
   13. Of what were the gifts and sacrifices there offered a shadow or
type? Heb. 8:4, 5; 10:1.
   Not-E.—During the wilderness journey the children of Israel, acting under
the instruction of God through Moses, erected a sanctuary where the typical
service could be carried on as a regular system. Priests were appointed whose
duty it was to conduct this service, and a regular daily and yearly routine was
                                      [4)
established by direct command of God. The service was so arranged as to
teach the whole gospel plan. The sanctuary, for instance, was to represent the
heavenly sanctuary, which Paul declares in Hebrews 8:2 was pitched by the
Lord and not man. The priests represented Christ as the perfect high priest.
The offerings that were made represented Christ as the sacrifice for guilty man.
    14. From what source did Moses receive the law that was given to
govern all the ceremonies of this typical service? Lev. 7:37, 38.
    NoTE.—The whole system of the sanctuary service was given to Israel to
teach them what constituted acceptable worship of Jehovah, and how they
could receive forgiveness of sin, through the blood of Christ.
    15. How long was this sacrificial system to continue? Heb. 9:8-12;
10:9, 10.
    NoTE.—It was "a figure for the time then present, . . . imposed on them
until the time of reformation." This law therefore was limited, and extended
only to the time when Christ should be offered as the perfect sacrifice on man's
behalf. (See Heb. 10:12-14.) When He died on the cross, the services of the
first, or earthly, sanctuary were "taken away," that the service of the second,
new covenant, sanctuary might be established. (See Heb. 10:8-10.)
    16. Of what was this sacrificial service of the earthly sanctuary
declared to be a pattern and a figure? Heb. 9:23, 24.
    NoTE.—Although in the shed blood of the sacrificed animals there could be
no atonement for sin, yet this service pointed forward to Christ, to His shed
blood on Calvary, which made atonement for sin. Therein lay the efficacy of
this typical service. It was God's purpose that the Jews should see in this
sacrificial service a daily illustration of the death of the Son of God, who shed
His blood in sacrifice for the sins of men.

                         The Lamb of God
MEMORY VERSE: "The next day John sceth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
  Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." John 1:29.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 63-70.

                            THE LAMB OF GOD
    1. What did John the Baptist declare Jesus to be? John 1:29.
    2. What was Jesus' attitude toward the offering He was to make?
Titus 2:14; John 10:15, 17, 18.
    NOTE.—"He [Christ] then made known to the angelic host that a way of
escape had been made for lost man. He told them that He had been pleading
with His Father, and had offered to give His life a ransom, to take the sentence
of death upon Himself, that through Him man might find pardon; that throng]
the merits of His blood, and obedience to the law of God, they could have th.
favor of God, and be brought into the beautiful garden, and eat of the frui
of the tree of life."—".Early Writings," p. 149.
                              IN MAN'S STEAD
    2. As Christ was a sin offering for man, what did God lay upon Him?
Isa. 53:4, 6; 2 Cor. 5:21.
    NOTE.—"He came to our world and took our sins upon His own divine soul,
that we might receive His imputed righteousness. He was condemned for our
sins, in which He had no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness,
in which we had no share."—Mrs. E. G. White, Review and Herald, March
21, 1893.
    4. As He hung upon the cross, what agony filled the heart of Jesus?
Matt. 27:46.       '
    NOTE.—"But bodily pain was but a small part of the agony of God's dear
Son. The sins of the world were upon Him, also the sense of His Father's wrath
as He suffers the penalty of the law transgressed. It was these that crushed
His divine soul. It was the hiding of His Father's face—a sense that His own
dear Father had forsaken Him—which brought despair. The separation that
sin makes between God and man was fully realized and keenly felt by the
innocent, suffering Man of Calvary. He was oppressed by the powers of dark-
ness. He had not one ray of light to brighten the future. . . . It was in this
terrible hour of darkness, the face of His Father hidden, legions of evil angels
enshrouding Him, the sins of the world upon Him, that the words were
wrenched from His lips, 'My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?'"
—"Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 214, 215.
    5. On whose behalf did Christ thus suffer the penalty of sin? Isa.
53:5, 8; Rom. 5:6.
    NOTE.—So complete, in fact, was Christ's identification with the sinner that
He actually carried the entire load of the sinner's guilt. "Jehovah bath laid on
                                      { 6]
Him the iniquity of us all." Isa. 53:6, A. R. V. He suffered death for every
man, not for His own sins, but for man's. He had taken the sinner's place, and
He must suffer the fearful penalty of the sinner's guilt.

                             FREED FROM SIN
    6. Since Christ died as man's substitute, what did His death accom-
plish for those who accept Him by faith? 2 Cor. 5:21; Eph. 1:7; Matt. 26:28.
    7. What does the apostle Paul say of those who accept Christ's death
for the remission of sins? Rom. 6:6-8.
    NoTE.-"He that is dead is freed from sin." Rom. 6:7. The penalty for our
sins was paid by Christ. As soon as our faith lays hold of this fact, and we
yield our heart to God to do His will, He counts us righteous. Christ suffered
in our stead. The law no longer condemns us. Christ has substituted His death
for ours, and therefore sin's wages have been paid. We are "free from sin."
   8. What contrast is made between the typical offerings of the earthly
sanctuary service, and the efficacious offering of Christ? Heb. 10:4;
1 John 1:7; 1 Peter 1:18, 19.

                     THE ALL-SUFFICIENT SACRIFICE
    9. From how much of the past life of sin is one justified through faith
in Jesus? Rom. 3:24-26.
    10. What does the blood of Christ accomplish for the soul? Col. 1:14;
Rom. 5:11.
    11. What prophecy of Zechariah was thus fulfilled by the death of
Jesus? Zech. 13:1.
    12. How completely will the blood of Christ bring cleansing to the
sinner? 1 John 1:7-9.
    13. What is said of those who make up the company of the redeemed?
Rev. 7:13, 14; 19:8.
                               LESSON OUTLINE
I. THE LAMB OF GOD
      1. Christ "the Lamb of God." John 1:29.
      2. A willing sacrifice. Titus 2:14; John 10:15, 17, 18.
11. IN MAN'S STEAD
      1. Of necessity Christ took man's sin. Isa. 53:4, 6; 2 Cor. 5:21. '
      2. Christ died for us while we were yet sinners. Isa. 53:5, 8; Rom. 5:6.
I11. FREED FROM SIN
      1. Christ's death brought forgiveness of sins to man. 2 Cor. 5:21; Eph. 1: 7.'
      2. Freed from sin, man lives no longer therein. Rom.. 6:6-8.
IV. THE ALL-SUFFICIENT SACRIFICE
     1. Justified from all transgression. Rom. 3:24-26.
     2. Christ's shed blood makes atonement for the soul. Col. 1:14; Rom.
        5:11.
     3. Made white in the blood of the Lamb. Rev. 7:13, 14; 19:8.
     4. The cleansing work of Christ is complete. 1 John 1:7-9.

                    The Sanctuaries of God
MEMORY VERSE: "Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among
  them." Ex. 25:8.
STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 409-422.

                       THE WORLDLY SANCTUARY
   1. How many sanctuaries of God are specifically brought to view in
the Bible? Heb. 9:1; 8:1, 2, 5.
    2. Into how many rooms was the earthly sanctuary divided? Ex.
26:33; Heb. 9:2, 3.
   NoTE.—The American Revised Version of Hebrews 9:2, 3 reads: "There
was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein were the candlestick, and the
table, and the shewbread; which is called the holy place. And after the second
veil, the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies."
    There were two apartments, or rooms. The first was called "the holy
place;" the second, "the most holy place," or "the holy of holies."
   3. What divided the one room from the other? Ex. 26:31-33.
   4. What formed the entrance door to the first apartment? Ex. 26:36.
          THE SANCTUARY FURNISHINGS AND PRIESTHOOD
    5. What sacred object was to be kept in the most holy place? Ex.
26:33, 34. (See also Ex. 25:10-22.)
    NoTE.—"The law of God, enshrined within the ark, was the great rule of
righteousness and judgment. That law pronounced death upon the trans-
gressor; but above the law was the mercy seat, upon which the presence of
God was revealed, and from which, by virtue of the atonement, pardon was
granted to the repentant sinner. Thus in the work of Christ for our redemp-
tion, symbolized by the sanctuary service, 'mercy and truth are met together;
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 349.
    6. What furnishings were placed in the first apartment, which was
known as the holy place? Ex. 40:22-27.
    NoTE.—"No language can describe the glory of the scene presented within
the sanctuary,—the gold-plated walls reflecting the light from the golden
candlestick, the brilliant hues of the richly embroidered curtains with their
shining angels, the table, and the altar of incense, glittering with gold; beyond
the second veil the sacred ark, with its mystic cherubim, and above it the holy
Shekinah, the visible manifestation of Jehovah's presence; all but a dim reflec-
tion of the glories of the temple of God in heaven, the great center of the work
for man's redemption."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 349.
   7. With what was the sanctuary proper SW:TP141:14cd? Exodus 40:8.
                                      r83
   8. What furnishings were found within the court of the tabernacle?
Verses 6, 7.
   9. Who were set apart for the work of the priesthood in the earthly
sanctuary? Ex. 28:1; Num. 8:10, 11, 14, 15, 19.
                          THE SANCTUARY SERVICES
    10. What daily service did the priests perform? Ex. 29:38, 39, 42;
30:7, 8.
    NoTE.—"The daily service consisted of the morning and evening burnt
offering, the offering of sweet incense on the golden altar, and the special offer-
ings for individual sins. And there were also offerings for sabbaths, new moons,
and special feasts.
    "Every morning and evening a lamb of a year old was burned upon the
altar, with its appropriate meat offering, thus symbolizing the daily consecra-
tion of the nation to Jehovah, and their constant dependence upon the atoning
blood of Christ. God expressly directed that every offering presented for the
service of the sanctuary should be 'without blemish.' The priests were to
examine all animals brought as a sacrifice, and were to reject every one in
which a defect was discovered. Only an offering 'without blemish' could be a
symbol of His perfect purity who was to offer Himself as 'a lamb without
blemish and without spot.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 352.
    11. In which apartment ,of the sanctuary was the daily service per-
formed? Heb. 9:6.
     12. Whenever a priest, the congregation, a ruler, or one of the com-
mon people sinned ignorantly, what was to be done? Leviticus 4.
     In case of a priest. Lev. 4:3-12.
     In case of the congregation. Verses 13-21.
     In case of a ruler. Verses 22-26.
     In case of one of the common people. Verses 27-35.
     NoTE."Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
the transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4. Paul states in Romans 6:23 that
"the wages of sin is death." To make possible the release of the sinner from
sin's penalty, these sacrifices, representing the death of Christ and the shedding
of His blood in man's behalf, were made daily in the service of the sanctuary.
     The Scripture references given after Question 12 outline the procedure re-
quired to make an atonement. Verses 20, 26, 31, 35. This was a daily ministra-
 tion for the sins of the congregation. Heb. 7:27; Ex. 29:38. In transferring the
sins of the transgressor to the sanctuary, either the blood of the sin offering
was taken by the priest into the holy place (Heb. 13:11), or a portion of the
 flesh was eaten- by the priest (Lev. 6:16, 26).
     "In the sin offerings presented during the year, a substitute had been ac-
cepted in the sinner's stead; but the blood of the victim had not made full
atonement for the sin. It had only provided a means by which the sin was
transferred to the sanctuary. By the offering of blood, the sinner acknowledged
the authority of the law, confessed the guilt of his transgression, and expressed
his faith in Him who was to take away the sin of the world; but he was not
entirely released from the condemnation of the law. On the Day of. Atonement
the high priest, having taken an offering for the congregation, went into the
most holy place with the blood, and sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, above
the tables of the law."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 355, 356.
                                         9
    13. When this service had been faithfully performed, what was done
with the sin of the individual? Lev. 4:35, last part.
    NOTE.—"The most important part of the daily ministration was the service
performed in behalf of individuals. The repentant sinner brought his offering
to the door of the tabernacle, and placing his hand upon the victim's head,
confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them from himself to the innocent
sacrifice. By his own hand the animal was then slain, and the blood was carried
by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the veil, behind
which was the ark containing the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this
ceremony the sin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary.
In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy place; but the flesh was
then to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed the sons of Aaron, saying,
`God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation.' Lev. 10:17.
Both ceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from the penitent to
the sanctuary."—"Patriarch's and Prophets," pp. 354, 355.
                       THE HEAVENLY SANCTUARY

Heb. 8:4, 5; 9:8, 9, 23, 24.
    15. What furnishings did John see in the sanctuary in heaven?
Rev. 4:5; 8:3; 11:19.
    NOTE.—"I was then bidden to take notice of the two apartments of the
heavenly sanctuary. The curtain, or door, was. opened, and I was permitted
to enter. In the first apartment I saw the candlestick with seven lamps, the
table of shewbread, the altar of incense, and the censer. All the furniture of
this apartment looked like purest gold, and reflected the image of the one who
entered the place. The curtain which separated the two apartments was of
different colors and material, with a beautiful border, in which were figures
wrought of gold to represent angels. The veil was lifted, and I looked into the
second apartment. I saw there an ark which had the appearance of being of
the finest gold. As a border around the top of the ark, was most beautiful
work representing crowns. In the ark were tables of stone containing the Ten
Commandments."—"Early Writings," pp. 251, 252.

monished to do? Heb. 10:21, 22.

               The Sacrificial System Fulfilled
MEMORY VERSE: "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
  for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that He by the grace of
  God should taste death for every man." Heb. 2:9.
STUDY HELP: "The Cross and Its Shadow," pp. 19-27.

                THE END OF THE SANCTUARY SERVICES
   1. When Christ died on Calvary, how did God indicate that the
earthly sanctuary service had ended? Matt. 27:50, 51.
   NOTE.—"When the loud cry, 'It is finished,' came from the lips of Christ,
the priests were officiating in the temple. It was the hour of the evening sacri-
fice. The lamb representing Christ had been brought to be slain. Clothed in
his significant and beautiful dress, the priest stood with lifted knife, as did
Abraham when he was about to slay his son. With intense interest the people
were looking on. But the earth trembles and quakes; for the Lord Himself
draws near. With a rending noise the inner veil of the temple is torn from top
to bottom by an unseen hand, throwing open to the gaze of the multitude a
place once filled with the presence of God. In this place the Shekinah had
dwelt. Here God had manifested His glory above the mercy seat. No one but
the high priest ever lifted the veil separating this apartment from the rest of
the temple. He entered in once a year to make an atonement for the sins of the
people. But lo, this veil is rent in twain. The most holy place of the earthly
sanctuary is no longer sacred.
    "All is terror and confusion. The priest is about to slay the victim; but the
knife drops from his nerveless hand, and the lamb escapes. Type has met anti-
type in the death of God's Son. The great sacrifice has been made. The way
into the holiest is laid open. A new and living way is prepared for all. No
longer need sinful, sorrowing humanity await the coming of the high priest.
                                       [ 11
Henceforth the Saviour was to officiate as priest and advocate in the heaven
of heavens. It was as if a living voice had spoken to the worshipers: There is
now an end of all sacrifices and offerings for sin. The Son of God is come ac-
cording to His word, `Lo,'I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of Me,)
to do Thy will, 0 God.' By His own blood' He entereth 'in once into the holy
place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.'"—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 756, 757.
    Thus the rending of the veil indicated that the entire earthly sacrificial
system had ended with the death of Christ, the Lamb of God. Type had met
antitype. The shadow had met the substance, and had therefore passed away.
It also declared that Christ had completed His earthly life, had atoned for
sin, meeting its full penalty.
    2. With the changing of the priesthood, what other change also
became necessary? Heb. 7:12.
    NOTE.—Two distinct codes of law are set forth in the Bible; one law, com-
prising the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments, constitutes the standard of
God's moral government. The other code deals with the rites and ceremonies
pertaining to the sanctuary service, and also certain civil regulations. While it
is clear from the context that Hebrews 7:12 refers primarily to the law which
confined the priesthood to the tribe of Levi, it is evident that with the passing
of the Levitical priesthood would go also all the laws relating to the ceremonial
services. This is made plain in other scriptures.

                   MORAL AND CEREMONIAL LAWS
    3. How was the Ten Commandment law, or Decalogue, exalted
above all others? Ex. 31:18; 32:16.
    NoTE.—God exalted the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments, often spoken
of as the moral law, by writing this law with His own finger upon tables of
stone and giving them to Moses. In the writing of the other laws Moses was the
human instrument, writing under direct instruction of God while he com-
muned with Him on Mount Sinai. God thus signally honored the Ten Com-
mandments, and emphasized their importance to man.
    4. How was the great importance of God's Ten Commandment law
made known to Israel? Deut. 4:12, 13; 33:2.
    5. In addition to the moral law, what was Moses commanded to teach
the people? Deut. 4:14.
    6. Of what did the ceremonial law consist? Heb. 9:9, 10; 10:1.
    NOTE.—The law of God which is contained in the Decalogue, or Ten Com-
mandments, deals only with moral duties, and not at all with types and
shadows. That portion of the law of Moses dealing with the sacrificial service
was ceremonial, consisting of instruction given to the Israelites concerning the
intricate and varied forms of service connected with the Aaronic priesthood.
It specified how special offerings should be made for special occasions; how to
prepare these sacrifices; who should minister in the sanctuary, and how; when
the priests should wash their clothes; what portion of the flesh offered should-
be eaten by the priests, etc. It "stood only in meats and drinks, and divers
washings, and carnal ordinances." Heb. 9:10. It was therefore a shadow of
things to come since its sacrifices and priestly service pointed forward to the ,
sacrifice and priestly ministry of Jesus.
                                     [12)
           CHRIST'S DEATH ENDS THE SACRIFICIAL SYSTEM
     7. What does the apostle Paul. declare Christ did to this sacrificial
law? Heb. 10:8, 9.
     NOTE.—When Jesus died on Calvary, the typical service had no further
significance. Before the cross the offering of these sacrifices was an evidence
of faith in the promise of a Redeemer to come, who would deliver from sin.
But, after the cross, it would have been a denial of faith in Christ to continue
these sacrificial offerings, for the atoning blood had been shed, and there was
no longer need for a ceremony prefiguring it. After the crucifixion scenes had
passed, the Jewish church resumed its round of ceremonies and typical services
just as before; they had rejected the Messiah, who was typified by these serv-
ices, and they have, to this day, continued to look for another. Their service
quickly deteriorated into a hollow form; and it soon became evident that the
glory had departed, and their temple had been left to them desolate.
     8. What assurance have we that only the blood of Christ is efficacious
in blotting sin from the life? Heb. 9:13-15, Heb. 10:1; 1 John 1:7.
     9. What kind of fountain is described by the prophet Zechariah?
What clew does he give to guide those who are in search of this foun-
tain? Zech. 13:1, 6.
     NOTE.—" 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away.' The fire that consumes the wicked purifies
the earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally burning hell
will keep before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.
     "One reminder alone remains: Our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of
His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon His side, His hands and feet,
are the only traces of the cruel work that sin has wrought. Says the prophet,
beholding Christ in His glory, 'He had bright beams coming out of His side:
and there was the hiding of His power.' That pierced side whence flowed the
crimson stream that reconciled man to God,—there is the Saviour's glory, there
`the hiding of His power.' "—"The Great Controversy," p. 674.
     10. What illustration does the Lord give of the change that takes
place in the life that is saved and cleansed by the blood of Jesus?
Isa. 1:18.

  SUNDAY     MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY I SABBATH




                      Our Great High Priest
MEMORY VERSE: "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
  the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
  without sin." Heb. 4 : 15.
STUDY HELP: "The Cross and Its Shadow," pp. 69-78.

                      THE PRIESTHOOD—ITS ORIGIN
    1. Who is now high priest? Heb. 4:14.
    2. In what sanctuary does He serve? Heb. 8:1, 2.
   NOTE.—"What was done in type in the ministration of the earthly sanctu-
ary, is done in reality in the ministration of the heavenly sanctuary. After His
ascension, our Saviour began His work as our high priest. Says Paul, 'Christ is
not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the
true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.' "—
"The Great Controversy," p. 420.
    3. Under the ceremonial law, who only had the right to serve in the
priesthood? Heb. 7:5; Num. 18:23.
    4. Of what tribe was Jesus? Heb. 7:14; Rev. 5:5.
    5. What therefore was necessary in order for Jesus to become a
priest? Heb. 7:12.
    NoTE.—Christ's priestly ministry in the sanctuary above could not begin
until the priesthood of Aaron closed, since the antitype does not parallel the
type, but follows it. It was the changing of the priesthood from the house of
Aaron to Christ that involved the changing of the ceremonial law which gov-
erned the priestly ministry of the earthly sanctuary.
    6. From among whom were the earthly priests chosen? Why was
this necessary? Heb. 5:1, 2.
    7. How was Christ qualified to become our high priest? Heb. 2:14-18.
    NoTE.—"In stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a
character the opposite of the character of Satan. But He stepped still lower
in the path of humiliation. 'Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled
Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.' As
the high priest laid aside his gorgeous pontifical robes, and officiated in the
white linen dress of the common priest, so Christ took the form of a servant,
and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. 'He was wounded
for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of
our peace was upon Him.'"—"The Desire of Ages," p. 25.
                  CHRIST'S WORK AS HIGH PRIEST
   8. Under the Hebrew economy, for what was every high priest or-
dained? Heb. 8:3, first part.
                                      [ 14 ]
    9. In order for Christ to serve as priest, what was it necessary for
Him to have? Verse 3, last part.
    10. Where did Christ begin His ministry as our high priest? Heb.
6:19, 20.
    NoTE.—There were two veils to the sanctuary, one at the entrance to the
first apartment, and the second separating the holy and the most holy places.
In Hebrews 9:3 Paul speaks of the "second veil" separating the two apart-
ments. He does not say that Christ had entered within this "second veil," but
simply within "the veil," signifying the beginning of the work in the first
apartment.
    "The ministration of the priest throughout the year in the first apartment
of the sanctuary, 'within the veil' which formed the door and separated the
holy place from the outer court, represents the work of ministration upon
which Christ entered at His ascension. It was the work of the priest in the
daily ministration to present before God the blood of the sin offering, also the
incense which ascended with the prayers of Israel. So did Christ plead His
blood before the Father in behalf of sinners, and present before Him also, with
the precious fragrance of His own righteousness, the prayers of penitent be-
lievers. Such was the work of ministration in the first apartment of the sanctu-
ary in heaven."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 420, 421.
    11. Upon His ascension, into whose presence did Christ go? Heb.
9:24; 8:1.
    NorE.—It may be thought by some that the fact that Christ appeared in
the presence of His Father and before the throne to begin His priestly ministry
constitutes evidence that He went immediately into the "most holy" place, or
second room of the sanctuary. This idea is based upon the assumption tha     t
the throne of God is permanently located in the second apartment of the
temple, and that it corresponds to the ark of the earthly sanctuary.
    Prophetic visions of the throne of God are found in Revelation, chapters
4, 5, and 7, also Isaiah 6, and Ezekiel 10 and 11. From a study of these scrip-
tures, one is made to realize how difficult it is to describe in human language
the glories of heaven and God's throne, and how small, after all, is our com-
prehension of the magnitude of God and His dwelling place.
    Compare "Early Writings," pages 55, 32, 252.
    12. Since Jesus is ministering as our high priest, what are we ad-
monished to do? Heb. 4:14-16.
                               LESSON OUTLINE
I. THE PRIESTHOOD AND ITS ORIGLN
     1. Christ becomes our high priest, serving in the holy place. Heb. 4:14;
        8:1, 2.
     2. In the earthly sanctuary the Levites only served as priests. Heb. 7:5.
     3. Jesus was of the tribe of Judah, and became high priest when the priest-
        hood of Aaron ended. Heb. 7:12.
     4. To qualify Himself for the priesthood, Christ took humanity upon
        Himself. Heb. 2:14-18.
11. CHRIST'S WORK AS HIGH PRIEST
     1. The work of the priesthood was temple ministration. Heb. 8:3.

                     Christ Fulfills the Types
MEMORY VERSE: "Who His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree,
  that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye
  were healed." 1 Peter 2:24.
STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 681-702.

                       CHRIST AND THE PRIESTHOOD
    1. Of what was the earthly sanctuary a pattern? Heb. 9:23, 24.
    2. Of what was the service of the priests who ministered in the earthly
sanctuary an example? Heb. 8:4, 5.
    NOTE.—"There are priests that offer gifts according to the law." Obviously
Paul here refers to the Levitical priests since only the Levites could serve in
the priesthood under the ceremonial law. (See verse 5). It is of these priests,
therefore, that he also speaks when he adds: "Who serve unto the example and
shadow of heavenly things." Thus in the service of the Levitical priesthood we
find an example or illustration of the priestly ministry of Christ in the heavenly
sanctuary. The entire earthly service, with its sanctuary, priesthood, and sac-
rifices, was a great lesson book in which was taught the plan of redemption
through the sacrifice of Christ and His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
    3. In His call to the priesthood, to whom was Christ similar? Heb.
7:11, 15.
    4. How did the Levites become priests? Verses 5, 28, first part.
    NOTE.—The descendants of Aaron in the tribe of Levi received the priestly
office by inheritance. It was a family succession. It descended from one mem-
ber of the family to another. In order for one to prove, his right to this office,
it was necessary for him to be able to show his pedigree in the house of Aaron.
 • 5. What is recorded of the priesthood of Melchisedec? Heb. 7:3, 6.
    NoTE.—Hebrews 7:3 in the Syriac reads as follows: "Of whom neither his
father nor his mother are written in the genealogies; nor the commencement
of his days nor the end of his life."
    Melchisedec had no inheritance in the priesthood. "His descent is not
counted from them" (the L evites). His parentage, being unknown, he could
not trace his pedigree to some particular tribe or family, and thus prove his
right to the priestly office. He therefore had to be made a priest.
    6. Wherein is Christ's origin similarly described by the apostle?
Verses 13-15.
    7. How, then, did Jesus become a priest? Verses 20, 21, 28.
 • NoTE.—Jesus, like Melchisedec, was made a priest by an oath, rather than
by inheritance. God's plan to do this made necessary the abolition of the law
of the priesthood which designated that the Levites only should be the priests.
Christ was therefore "called" to His priestly work after the order of Melchis-
edec, and not after the order of Aaron. Heb. 7:11.
                                     116 ]
   8. In what way is the priesthood of Jesus superior to the Aaronic
priesthood? Heb. 7:16, 17, 28.
   9. What is Jesus therefore able to do? Verses 24, 25.
                          CHRIST OUR SACRIFICE
    10. What was done with the blood of the sin offering in the first
apartment service of the earthly sanctuary for any who had sinned?
Lev. 4:6-8, 29, 30.
    NorE.—"Day by day the repentant sinner brought his offering to the door
of the tabernacle, and placing his hand upon the victim's head, confessed his
sins, thus in figure transferring them from himself to the innocent sacrifice.
The animal was then slain. . . . The broken law of God demanded the life of
the transgressor. The blood, representing the forfeited life of the sinner, whose
guilt the victim bore, was carried by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled
before the veil, behind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner
had transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through the blood, transferred
in figure to the sanctuary. In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy
place; but the flesh was then to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed the
sons of Aaron, saying, 'God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the con-
gregation.' Both ceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from the
penitent to the sanctuary."—"The Great Controversy," p. 418.
    11. What did Christ do with sin? John 1:29, margin; 1 Peter 2:24.
                          CHRIST OUR ADVOCATE
    12. What does John the beloved declare Jesus to be? 1 John 2:1.
    13. What work does the apostle Paul say Jesus does for us? Heb.
7:25; Rom. 8:34.
    NOTE.—This, then, was Jesus' work in the first apartment of the sanctuary,
and this work is to be completed in the second apartment during the investi-
gative judgment. As sinners come to God for pardon, and plead the shed blood
of Jesus on their behalf, Jesus becomes their advocate, and makes intercession
for them before God. He offers up their prayers with sweet incense to the
Father, and pleads that since His blood has been shed on behalf of sinners, and
since these have now accepted Him as their sacrifice, they should receive par-
don. Thus in the heavenly sanctuary is registered a record of pardoned sins
that sustains the same relation to the atonement as did the daily sprinkling of
blood in the earthly sanctuary to the typical Day of Atonement.
    So, likewise, Jesus performed a continual service in the holy place until the
time came for Him to enter upon His work in the most holy place. Just as in
the earthly sanctuary the altar fires were to be kept burning continually (Lev.
6:13) in readiness to consume the sacrifice for sinners who would seek pardon,
so Christ stands ready, day and night, to receive sinners, and to minister His
shed blood on their behalf. His loving invitation to sinners still is, "Come unto
Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest." Matt.
11:28. He gives them rest by taking away their load of sin, lifting the burden
entirely from their shoulders, and ministering pardon and grace to them.
"Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows." Isa. 53:4.
    14. What was it impossible for the sacrifices in the earthly sanctuary
to do? Heb. 10:1, 4.
    15. What will the blood of Christ, the "Lamb of God," do for those
who accept Him? 1 John 1:7; Heb. 9:11-14.

        The Cleansing of the Earthly Sanctuary
MEMORY VERSE: "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white rai-
  ment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess
  his name before My Father, and before His angels." Rev. 3:5.
STUDY HELP: "The Cross and Its Shadow," pp. 181-186.

                  THE DAY OF ATONEMENT SERVICES
     1. How often did the high priest enter the second apartment of the
earthly, sanctuary? Heb. 9:6, 7.
     2. How was the high priest instructed to prepare himself for this
service? Lev. 16:2-4, 11-14.
     NorE.—The words "holy place" used in verse 2, refer to the second apart-
ment, as is clear from the fact that in it, "within the veil," is the "mercy seat,
which is upon the ark." The mercy seat was above the ark of the covenant
between the cherubims, and in the second apartment of the sanctuary, or, as
it is more often spoken of, the "most holy place."
     3. What animals were furnished by the congregation for use in the
sacrificial services of the day? Verse 5.
     4. How was choice to be made between the two goats? Whom did
they represent? Verses 7, 8.
     NorE.—Concerning "Azazel," the Variorum edition of the Bible says in a
footnote: "Verses 8, 10, 26, for Azazel (the name of an evil spirit)." On this
point the Jewish Encyclopedia, article, "Azazel," says: "Far from involving
                                      [18]
the recognition of Azazel as a deity, the sending of the goat was, as stated by
Nahmanides, a symbolic expression of the idea that the people's sins and their
evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin, the
source of all impurity. The very fact that the two goats were presented before
YHwH [Jehovah] before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the
wilderness, was proof that Azazel was not ranked with Yawn, but regarded
simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous gov-
ernment of YHWEL"
    5. What was to be done with the Lord's goat? Verse 9.
   6. Where was the blood of this offering sprinkled? Verses 15, 18.
    7. What was accomplished by the sprinkling of the blood? From
what was the sanctuary cleansed? Verses 16, 19, 29, 30.
    NOTE.—"The ministration of the earthly sanctuary consisted of two divi-
sions; the priests ministered daily in the holy place, while once a year the high
priest performed a special work of atonement in the most holy, for the cleans-
ing of the sanctuary. Day by day the repentant sinner brought his offering to
the door of the tabernacle, and placing his hand upon the victim's head, con-
fessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them from himself to the innocent
sacrifice. The animal was then slain. 'Without shedding of blood,' says the
apostle, there is no remission of sin. 'The life of the flesh is in the blood.' The
broken law of God demanded the life of the transgressor. The blood, repre-
senting the forfeited life of the sinner, whose guilt the victim bore, was carried
by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the veil, behind which
was the ark containing the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this cere-
mony the sin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary.
In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy place; but the flesh was
then to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed the sons of Aaron, saying,
`God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation.' Both cere-
 monies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from the penitent to the
sanctuary.
    "Such was the work that went on, day by day, throughout the year. The
sins of Israel were thus transferred to the sanctuary, and a special work became
 necessary for their removal. God commanded that an atonement be made for
each of the sacred apartments. 'He shall make an atonement for the holy place,
 because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their trans-
gressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congre-.
 gation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.' An
 atonement was also to be made for the altar, to "cleanse it, and hallow it from
 the uncleanness of the children of Israel.'
    "Once a year, on the great Day of Atonement, the priest entered the most
 holy place for the cleansing of the sanctuary. The work there performed com-
 pleted the yearly round of ministration."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 418,
419.
    8. When the cleansing, or atoning, work within the sanctuary was
 completed, and the priest came out of the sanctuary, what was to be
 done with the scapegoat, which was still alive? Lev. 16:10, 20-22.
     NorE.—"On the Day of Atonement the high priest, having taken an offer-
 ing for the congregation, went into the most holy place with the blood, and
 sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, above the tables of the law. Thus the claims
                                    ' [19]
of the law, which demanded the life of the sinner, were satisfied. Then in his
character of mediator the priest took the sins upon himself, and leaving the
sanctuary, he bore with him the burden of Israel's guilt. At the door of the
tabernacle he laid his hands upon the head of the scapegoat, and confessed
over him 'all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions
in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.' And as the goat bear-
ing these sins was sent away, they were with him regarded as forever separated
from the people. Such was the service performed 'unto the example and
shadow of heavenly things.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 356.
    "As in the final atonement the sins of the truly penitent are to be blotted
from the records of heaven, no more to be remembered or come into mind, so
in the type they were borne away into the wilderness, forever separated from
the congregation.
    "Since Satan is the originator of sin, the direct instigator of all the sins that
caused the death of the Son of God, justice demands that Satan shall suffer the
final punishment. Christ's work for the redemption of men and the purification
of the universe from sin, will be closed by the removal of sin from the heavenly
sanctuary and the placing of these sins upon Satan, who will bear the final
penalty. So in the typical service, the yearly round of ministration closed with
the purification of the sanctuary, and the confessing of the sins on the head
of the scapegoat."—Id., p. 358.
                          A DAY OF JUDGMENT
   9. Upon this solemn Day of Atonement, what were the people ad-
monished to do? Lev. 16:29; 23:27-30.
    NOTE.—"Every man was to afflict his soul while the work of atonement was
going forward. All business was laid aside, and the whole congregation of Israel
spent the day in solemn humiliation before God, with prayer, fasting, and deep
searching of heart."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 355.
    10. What was to be done with those who failed to heed this instruc-
tion? Lev. 23:29, 30.
    NOTE.—On the Day of Atonement all work was to cease, and every mem-
ber of the tribes of Israel, together with the strangers who sojourned among
them, was to humble himself, afflict his soul, and get right with God. It was
the most solemn, heart-searching occasion of the year. If a person turned to
labor on this sacred occasion, one of the yearly sabbaths of Israel's ceremonial
system, he was under sentence of destruction. Lev. 23:30-32; Heb. 10:28. The
one who regarded the Day of Atonement lightly, not heeding its sacred char-
acter, taking no personal part in this solemn occasion, was to be "cut off,"
separated from the tribe and nation. He was to be an outcast from Israel.
    The Jewish people have always regarded the Day of Atonement as a final
day of judgment for the year, a day of separation to the families of Israel. The
Jewish Encyclopedia says: "In rabbinic Judaism the Day of Atonement com-
pletes the penitential period of ten days that begins with New Year's Day, the
season of repentance and prayer. . . . New Year's and atonement days are
days of serious meditation. The former is the annual day of judgment, when
all creatures pass in review before the searching eye of Omniscience. . . .
    "All depends on whether a man's merits outweigh the demerits put to his
account. It is therefore desirable to multiply good deeds before the final
account on the Day of Atonement. Those that are found worthy are entered
in the book of life. • . . Hence the prayer: 'Enter us in the book of life' ("in-
                                      { 201 '
scribe us;" but "seal us," that is, "seal our fate"-in.the closing prayer on the
Day of Atonement)."
     11. What earnest admonition does Paul give to those who live under
the new covenant? Heb. 10:29; 2:1-3.
     12. In the day of final judgment, what similar experience awaits us?
2 Cor. 5:10.
                               LESSON OUTLINE
I. THE DAY OF ATONEMENT SERVICES
      1. Once each year the priests went into the holiest. Heb. 9:6, 7; Lev. 16:
         2-4, 11-14.

      The Cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary
MEMORY VERSE: "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso con-
  fesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy." Prov. 28:13.
STUDY HELP: "The Cross and Its Shadow," pp. 209-219.

            THE ANTITYPICAL SANCTUARY-ITS CLEANSING
    1. What work must of necessity be done in the heavenly sanctuary?
Heb. 9:22, 23.
    2. With what "better" sacrifice is the heavenly sanctuary to be
purified or cleansed? Verses 12, 26.
    3. What does Christ purpose to put away in His work in the heavenly
sanctuary? Verse 26, last part.
    4. How may sin be transferred from the sinner to the sanctuary?
Lev. 4:16-18, 33-35; Heb. 13:11.
    NoTE.-In the daily sin offering of the Levitical service, the sinner had to
lay his hands upon the head of the sacrifice-an act of repentance and confes-
sion-before his sins could be transferred from him to the sacrificial victim.
    So it is today. We separate ourselves from sin by confession (1 John 1:9).
"He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and for-
saketh them shall have mercy." Proverbs 28:13.
    "As anciently the sins of the people were by faith placed upon the sin offer-
ing, and through its blood transferred, in figure, to the earthly sanctuary; so
in the new covenant the sins of the repentant are by faith placed upon Christ,
and transferred, in fact, to the heavenly sanctuary."-"The Great Contro-
versy," p. 421.
                                        21
   5. Before our sins are forever blotted out, what solemn work must
be done? Acts 17:31; Heb. 9:27.
    6. Why cannot sins be irrevocably blotted out before the judgment?
Ezek. 33:12, 13.
   NOTE.—If the forgiven sinner does not continue to exercise faith, all his past
sins will be imputed to him again. Jesus will not plead before the Father for
the unrepentant backslider in the final judgment; for although the man's sins
were once forgiven, he has not continued in faith, and Christ does not confess
his name. "Be thou faithful unto death," says Jesus, "and I will give thee a
crown of life." Rev. 2:10. It is not the beginning of the race that gives assur-
ance of the crown of life; it is the successful finishing of that race.
    In the parable of the unmerciful servant, Jesus shows that the man who
was once forgiven a debt of ten thousand talents (Matt. 18:23-35) later was
condemned for the entire amount of the debt, because he proved unworthy of
forgiveness. So it will be with those who, although once forgiven, afterward
repudiate their Saviour, return to their sinful ways, and die unrepentant.
             THE BOOKS OF RECORD AND THE JUDGMENT
    7. What records are kept by the Lord in heaven? Rev. 21:27; Phil.
4:3; Mal. 3:16.
   8. What part will these record books play in the work of the judg-
ment? Dan. 7:10, last part; Rev. 20:12.
    9. After the searching of the records, what will be done with the
sins of the faithful? Acts 3:19, 20.
    NorE.—Since a careful investigation of the records must be made before
final sentence can be passed upon the impenitent and the sins of the righteous
blotted out, it is evident that this is part of the work of cleansing the sanctuary.
On the Day of Atonement, in the earthly sanctuary, it was decided who should
continue with Israel and who should be "cut off." The cleansing of the heav-
enly sanctuary can be accomplished only as a decision is reached in each case,
and final disposition made of the records of each individual. The cleansing of
the sanctuary and the judgment are simply two phases of one work.
    10. With whom will the judgment begin? 1 Peter 4:17.
    NOTE.—"In the typical service, only those who had come before God with
confession and repentance, and whose sins, through the blood of the sin offer-
ing, were transferred to the sanctuary, had a part in the service of the Day of
Atonement. So in the great day of final atonement and investigative judgment,
the only cases considered are those of the professed people of God. The judg-
ment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and takes place at a later
period. 'Judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us,
what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel?'
    "The books of record in heaven, in which the names and the deeds of men
are registered, are to determine the decisions of the judgment. Says the
prophet Daniel, The judgment was set, and the books were opened.' The
revelator, describing the same scene, adds, 'Another book was opened, which
is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were
written in the books, according to their works.' "—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 480.
   11. What only can redeem the sinner? I Peter 1:18, 19.
                                I22)
   12. Setting a noble example in preparation for the judgment, which
in his day was still future, what did the apostle Paul do? 2 Tim. 4:6-8.
                               LESSON OUTLINE
I. THE ANTITYPICAL SANCTUARY—ITS CLEANSING
      1. The sanctuary cleansed from sin. Heb. 9:22, 23.
      2. Christ's blood the cleansing stream. Heb. 9:12, 26.
      3. The work of judgment must precede the final cleansing of the sanctu-
         ary. Acts 17:31; Heb. 9:27; Ezek. 33:12, 13.
11. THE BOOKS OF RECORD AND THE JUDGMENT
      1. Books of record will be used in the judgment. Rev. 21:27; Mal. 3:16;
         Dan. 7:10, last part.
      2. Repentance needed befo're sins removed. Acts 3:19, 20.
      3. Judgment begins with church of God. 1 Peter 4:17.
      4. A life of victory is an essential preparation for redemption. 2 Tim.
         4:6-8.

       The Time of Cleansing and of Judgment
MEMORY VERSE: "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
  sanctuary be cleansed." Dan. 8 : 14.
STUDY HELP: "The Cross and Its Shadow," pp. 187-197.

                    THE VISION OF DANIEL EIGHT
   1. What definite time was appointed for the cleansing of the heavenly
sanctuary? Dan. 8:14.
    2. Describe briefly the vision given to Daniel in the third year of the
reign of Belshazzar. Verses 1-12.
    3. What conversation did the prophet hear concerning this vision?
Verses 13, 14.
    NOTE.—"How long shall be the vision?" that is, how long will these deso-
lating powers be permitted to prosper in their efforts against God's people,
Jesus Christ, the Prince of the host, and against the saints and the sanctuary?
The answer is that at the end of 2300 days the sanctuary shall be cleansed.
    4. What else is said about the time to which this vision especially
applies? Dan. 8:17, 19, 26.
    NOTE.—"He said unto me, Understand, 0 son of man; for the vision be-
longeth to the time of the end." Verse 17, R. V.
    "He said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of
the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end." Verse 19,
R. V.
    "Shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come." Verse
26, R. V.
                                     ( 23 )
    From these verses it is clearly evident that the culminating point of this
vision would not be reached in Daniel's day, but the time period reached to
the last days of human history, to a time known as "the time of the end." This
is a last-day prophecy, and depicts some event of great importance that is to
take place near the close of time.
    5. Applying the Bible method of measuring prophetic days, what
period of time is actually covered by this vision? Ezek. 4:6, margin.
    NOTE.—Since in prophecy a day is a symbol of a year, this period covers
2300 literal years. It is therefore after 2300 years that the sanctuary is to be
cleansed. This language could not possibly refer to the cleansing of the earthly
sanctuary, for two reasons: first, the earthly sanctuary was cleansed annually;
second, the vision applies to the time of the end, and not to the Jewish dis-
pensation.
                       THE MEANING OF THE VISION
    6. What explanation was given to Daniel as to the meaning of the
ram and the rough goat seen in the vision? Dan. 8:20-22.
    7. What is said of the power of the little horn? Verses 23-25.
    Nom—Rome followed Grecia as a world power, and the prophetic speci-
fications of this little horn were fulfilled by her, partly in her pagan form and
partly in her papal form. It is a composite picture of Rome as a whole.
    8. What part of the vision did the angel Gabriel next begin to ex-
plain to Daniel? Dan. 8:26, 14, margin.
    NOTE.—The angel's reference here to the vision of the "evenings and morn-
ings" clearly refers to the time element of the vision in the 2300 days of verse 14.
    9. While this part of the vision was being made plain to Daniel,
how was he affected? Verse 27.
                 AFTER TWENTY-THREE HUNDRED YEARS
    10. Subsequent to Daniel's recovery, concerning what did he pray?
Dan. 9:17.
    11. Who came to him during his prayer? For what had he returned?
Verses 20-22.
    12. What did Gabriel tell Daniel to consider? Verse 23.
    Nora.—Since Gabriel is come to complete his explanation of the vision, it
is natural to expect that he would begin just where he left off when Daniel
fainted.. This was with the time element, the 2300 days.
    13. What event did Gabriel say would mark the beginning of the
prophetic period? Dan. 9:25.
    NorE.—We find this decree given first by Cyrus, king of Persia (Ezra 1:
2-4) repeated by Darius (Ezra 6:6-12), and again repeated by Artaxerxes
(Ezra 7:12-26). In Ezra 6:14 we read these words: "The elders of the Jews
builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet
and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according
to the 'commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment
of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaicerxes king of Persia."
    The conimandment to' restore and build Jerusalem was, then, according to
the scripture itself, a threefold decree, given lastly by Artaxerxes in 457 B. C.
                                       [24]
From this date we begin to count the seventy weeks as well.as that long period
of 2300 years reaching to 1844.
     14. What portion of the twenty-three hundred years was to be allotted
to the Jewish nation? Dan. 9:24.
     NOTE.—" `Determined'—'cut off'—`are determined.' The word here used
. . . occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. It properly means, according to
Gesenius, to cut off, to divide; and hence, to determine, to destine, to appoint."
—Barnes, quoted in "Source Book for Bible Students," p. 554.
     This subdivision of seventy weeks, 490 years, was therefore to reach down
to the rejection of the Jews as the people especially chosen of God.
      15. What event was to mark the close of the first 69 weeks, or 483
years, of this seventy-week period? Dan. 9:25.
     NOTE.—"Unto Messiah the Prince." Jesus was anointed as the "Messiah"
by the Holy Spidt at the time of His baptisni, in 27 A.D. John 3 :34 ; Luke 3:21,
22 ; Acts 10:38. Reckoned from the midst of the year 457 B.c., when the decree
of Artaxerxes went forthi the 483 years reach to 27 A.D.
      16. What was to take place in the midst of the last seven years, or
the seventieth week? Verses 26, 27.
      NoTE.—"He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." The event
that fulfilled these specifications of the prophecy was the crucifixion of Jesus.
 His death brought an end to the entire sacrificial service of the earthly
sanctuary.
      17. What was to be confirmed among the Jews during the seventieth
 week? Verse 27.
      NOTE.—The whole of the last, or seventieth, week was to be devoted espe-
 cially to the Jews. "He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week."
 Dan. 9:27. This was fulfilled by Christ's personal ministry of three and a half
 years, and by the ministry of His apostles, who for another three and 'a half
 years labored almost exclusively for the Jews. After that time the Jews were
 no longer to be considered the specially chosen people of God.
      Beginning with Christ's ministry in 27 A. D. this week, or seven literal years,
 would reach to 34 A. D. It was about that time that Stephen died as a martyr
 to Jewish hatred.
      In rejecting Christ and His gospel, the Jews had rejected the only means of
 salvation, and God could no longer count them His chosen people. Ten years
 later it was announced that the disciples had turned to the Gentiles. "Then
 Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of
 God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and
 judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For,
 so bath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the
 Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth."
 Acts 13:46, 47.
      18. What great event was scheduled to take place at the end of the
 twenty-three hundred years, or in the year 1844? Dan. 8:14.
      NoTE.—These considerations bring us face to face with the stupendous fact
 that in the year 1844 A. D., the hour struck for Jesus, our high priest, to pass
 into the most holy place, and begin the solemn work of cleansing the sanctuary.
 And since the cleansing of the sanctuary is a work of judgment, we must con-
 clude that at that time the great investigative judgment began in heaven.
                                         [25]
    This work of examination of character and of determining who are to be
accounted worthy of eternal life and of a home in God's eternal kingdom is
the investigative judgment, and the investigative judgment is the closing work
to be performed in the heavenly sanctuary. When this work is completed, the
sanctuary is cleansed from all record of sin and defilement. The line will then
be drawn between saints and sinners. Human probation will be closed.

                  The Judgment-Hour Message
MEMORY VERSE: "I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
  everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation,
  and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give
  glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made
  heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." Rev. 14:6, 7.
STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 451-460.

                  THE MESSAGE AND THE MESSENGERS
    1. What mighty threefold message did John the revelator see sweep-
ing over the earth, in preparation for Christ's second advent? Rev.
14:6-10, 14-16.
    2. When would the message announcing, "the, hour of God's judg-
ment is come," become due to the world?
    Answer.—At the time of the opening of the judgment in heaven. This was
in 1844. (See Lesson 9, note after Question 18.) Not until then could it be
truly said, that the judgment hour had been reached.
    3. In addition to announcing the fact of the opening of the judgment,
what will the heralds of this message preach? Rev. 14:6.
    NOTE.—The everlasting gospel is the "good news" concerning God's Son,
how through faith in His vicarious sacrifice men may be saved from sin
and have eternal life.
    4. Why will this message tell the people to fear and glorify God?
Rev. 14:7, first part.
    5. What will they believe and teach concerning creation? Verse 7,
last part.
    6. What will be their relationship to God's commandments? Verse 12.
    NoTE.--Although the great judgment-hour message is to go to the world
in a period of doubt, skepticism, and outright apostasy, yet the heralds of this
                                    [ 28 1
message still believe the old gospel fundamentals. They believe in a personal
God, and that He is the Creator. They therefore reject the theory of evolution,
and every other teaching that rules out God as the ultimate source of all things.
They believe in Jesus Christ as revealed through the gospel, and in His power
to deliver from sin; they keep God's commands. They are also Sabbathkeepers,
since the seventh-day Sabbath rest is enjoined in one of God's commandments.
    7. What conditions will prevail among the nations during the time
of the judgment? Rev. 11:18.
    NOTE.—"The nations were angry." The greatest war in human history has
been fought since the opening of the judgment in 1844. This strife and slaughter
among the nations will terminate in the Battle of Armageddon,.after the close
of probation.
    8. To how many of the earth's inhabitants must the judgment-hour
message be given? Rev. 14:6.
    NOTE.—Here is a message which is to be heralded to every tribe and nation
of earth after the hour of God's judgment begins. It will constitute God's last
appeal to the people of earth to turn to Him and be saved. It will result in
preparing a people from among the nations for the return of Jesus, leading
them to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. (Rev. 14:
12-16). It will be a mighty message of reform, and, as on the Day of Atone-
ment in the earthly sanctuary service, the people were bidden to afflict their
souls before God and confess their sins in final preparation for the judgment,
so this message will lead men and women of all nations to turn to God in
preparation for judgment before the great tribunal of heaven.
    9. On the Day of Atonement in the earthly tabernacle service, what
were the priests bidden to do? Lev. 25:9.
    NOTE.—The great message of Revelation 14:6, 7 is the antitypical blowing
of trumpets for the real Day of Atonement and the final judgment in heaven.
As of old, the warning is to sound throughout the land. It is a world-wide
message, going to every kindred, tongue, and people. (See Joel 2:1, 12, 13.)
    "'On the tenth day of the seventh month, in the Day of Atonement,' the
trumpet of the jubilee was sounded. Throughout the land, wherever the Jew-
ish people dwelt, the sound was heard, calling upon all the children of Jacob
to welcome the year of release. On the great Day of Atonement, satisfaction
was made for the sins of Israel, and with gladness of heart the people would
welcome the jubilee."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 533.
    10. What religious movement had its beginning at the time of the
opening of the judgment?
    Answer.—As the time for the fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy of chapter
8:14 neared, religious leaders in both Europe and America began to unfold the
prophecies concerning the second coming of Christ. Even earlier, among the
Reformers there was a definite conviction that the coming of the Lord was
nearing. Luther, Knox, and others voiced this "blessed hope." During the
earlier years of the nineteenth century Faber wrote his "Dissertation on the
Prophecies," Lacunza's "The Second Coming of the Messiah in Glory and
Majesty" was translated from the Spanish by Mr. Irving, and William Cuning-
hame published his "Dissertation on the Seals and Trumpets." J. Hatley
Frere's "Combined View of the Christian Prophecies" did much to intensify
interest in the second advent in a large part of the world.
                                      [293
    Thus was the foundation laid for the launching of the last gospel message
to the world as outlined in Revelation 14:6-14. In the providence of God, the
remnant church had its beginning in North America, where the disappointment
concerning the advent in 1844 was most poignant. (See Rev. 10:9.) Then it
was that godly men and women, convinced of the accuracy of Daniel's proph-
ecy in chapter 8:14, united in prayerful study of the Scriptures, and with the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, unfolded the wonderful truths of the gospel of
Christ for the last generation of human history. The advent movement linked
with the judgment message has marvelously extended its work until now it is
represented in nearly six hundred languages, and is established in 353 countries,
islands, and island groups. Its literature is printed in 171 languages, and its
medical missionary institutions belt the world. In accurate fulfillment of the
judgment-hour prophecy, this advent movement began at the close of Daniel's
prophecy of two thousand three hundred years, and it is gathering out of all
the world a people "that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
Jesus." Rev. 14:12.
                  REACHING THE JUDGMENT STANDARD
    11. By what great righteous standard are men tested in the judgment?
James 2:10-12; Rom. 2:12-16.
    NoTE.—It is evident that a man's being reckoned guilty or innocent will
depend entirely upon whether or not he has made Christ his Saviour; and that
fact is attested by his obedience to God's commandments. If it is revealed in
the judgment that, through faith in Jesus Christ, he has confessed his sins and
yielded his heart to obey God's holy law, and that wherein he has failed he
has accepted Christ's righteousness as a covering for his failure, he will be
acquitted; there is no condemnation, for the law finds no fault in him. If, on
the other hand, it is found that he has broken even one of its precepts, and this
transgression has not been confessed or covered by Christ's righteousness, he
will be dealt with just as if he had broken all ten. A man's love for the whole
law is no stronger than his love for each particular commandment contained
in it.
    12. What will be declared concerning those who have kept God's
commands? Rev. 22:14.
    13. What is the one thing that separates man from God? -Isa. 59:1, 2;
Rom. 6:23.
    14. What is sin? 1 John 3:4.
    15. What, then, is our duty in the light of the judgment-hour message?
Eccl. 12:13.
    16. How fully can unaided human beings reach the high • standard
set for them in the law of God? John 15:5.
    17. How, then, is it possible for us to keep the law? Phil. 4:13; Gal. 2:20.
    NorE.—If we but permit Him, Christ Jesus will come into the life and do
the Father's will in and through us. He comes and condemns sin in the flesh,
and supplies the power which makes it possible, "that the righteousness of the
law might be fulfilled in us." Rom. 8:4. Only let Him in, in the fullness of His
power, and the difficulty is past. The beautiful fruits of righteousness will then
appear in the life as naturally as the lilies bloom in the springtime; and this
will take away all fear of the judgment.
                                      [ 30 1
   Thus the judgment-hour message will be a message of reform, calling men
and women away from the paths of sin and worldliness to an acceptance of
Christ as their Saviour and the keeping of God's great moral law.

          Full Pardon Through the Atonement
MEMORY VERSE: "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though
  your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
  crimson, they shall be as wool." Isa. 1:18.
STUDY HELP: "The Cross and Its Shadow," pp. 230-238.

                SALVATION IN CHRIST COMPLETE
   1. 1101.7 complete is the salvation provided for repentant sinners
through the atoning work of Christ? Jer. 33:8; 1 John 1:7, 9.
    2. How far does Christ remove transgression from those.who believe?
Ps. 103:11, 12.
    NOTE.—"If you give yourself. to Him, and accept Him as your Saviour,
then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted right-
eous. Christ's character stands in place of your character, and you are accepted
before God just as if you had not sinned."="Steps to Christ," p. 69.
    3. What redemptive price was paid in order to make such complete
salvation possible? 1 Peter 1:18, 19.
    NoTE.—No merely human or angelic savior could have paid such a price,
and purchased our redemption. The demands of the broken law were not
merely legal. Sin perverted all the principles of righteousness, and destroyed
the true relation between man and God. Divine government must be upheld,
and the honor of the divine law must be vindicated for the sake of the creature.
A perfect obedience must be restored. Angels could never accomplish this. It
                                       [81
required the divine Son of God incarnate to do it. And when He did it, He did
a perfect work. He did not purchase a half pardon; He did not provide a legal
blotting out only, but a restoration as full and deep as had been the transgres-
sion. Yes, and even more, for we read that "where sin abounded, grace did
much more abound." Rom. 5:20.
   4. How many are included in God's gracious provision for salvation?
Rev. 22:17; Isa. 55:1.
    5. How complete is the pardon granted to those who seek the Lord
and turn from their wicked ways? Isa. 55:6, 7 (see margin).
    NOTE.-0 soul, bowed down with a sense of guilt, look up and behold your
full pardon in the bleeding hand of your great High Priest in heaven. Take it
today from His hand that still bears the mark of crucifixion, and go on your
way rejoicing. Your full emancipation was proclaimed when Jesus came forth
from the tomb. He tasted death for every man, and His blood, when offered
before God in the sanctuary on our behalf, is a price more than sufficient to
atone for every sin.
    6. How full and complete will be the deliverance of the vilest sinner
from his iniquities? Isa. 1:18.
    NOTE.—"Jesus loves to have us come to Him just as we are, sinful, helpless,
dependent. We may come with all our weakness, our folly, our sinfulness, and
fall at His feet in penitence. It is His glory to encircle us in the arms of His
love, and to bind up our wounds, to cleanse us from all impurity.
    "Here is where thousands fail: they do not believe that Jesus pardons them
personally, individually. They do not take God at His word. It is the privi-
lege of all who comply with the conditions to know for themselves that pardon
is freely extended for every sin. Put away the suspicion that God's promises
are not meant for you. They are for every repentant transgressor. Strength
and grace have been provided through Christ to be brought by ministering
angels to every believing soul. None are so sinful that they cannot find
strength, purity, and righteousness in Jesus, who died for them. He is waiting
to strip them of their garments stained and polluted with sin, and to put upon
them the white robes of righteousness; He bids them live, and not die."—
"Steps to Christ," p. 57.
    "We have been great sinners, but Christ died that we might be forgiven.
                                   cient to present to the Father in our behalf.
The merits of His sacrifice are suffi
Those to whom He has forgiven most will love Him most, and will stand near-
est His throne to praise Him for His great love and infinite sacrifice."—Id.,
p. 41.
    7. How completely will the sins written against the record of the
redeemed be removed? Jer. 50:20; 31:34.
   8. What illustration does the Lord use to indicate the complete
removal of sin from the sinner when He accepts the plan of redemption?
Micah 7:18, 19.
   9. What does the apostle Paul say of those who are in Christ Jesus?
Rom. 8:1.
   NOTE.—The justice of God demanded a sacrifice equal to the enormity of
man's transgression, and in Jesus this demand was fully met. The vilest trans-
gressor, therefore, may come to Him today confessing his guilt, and receive
                                       32
pardon for his every sin. "There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus."

     10. How many stand in need of redemption from sin? Rom. 3:23.
    11. What assurance have we that grace is sufficient for all sinners?
Rom. 5:20, 21; Heb. 7:25.
     12. What is God's message of appeal to all who are still in sin?
Isa. 55:6, 7; Acts 2:37, 38.

                 The Lord Our Righteousness
MEMORY VERSE: "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul .shall be joyful in
  my God; for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered
  me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments,
  and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels." Isa. 61:10.

                            JUSTIFIED OF GOD
    1. What experience is assured to those who believe in Christ? Acts
13:38, 39.
    NOTE.—"Justified from all things." Justification has to do with a man's
changed relationships, or standing, with God as a result of His acceptance of
Christ. By nature man is a sinner, a rebel, unclean, corrupt, and, because of
his transgressions, is condemned to die. Through acceptance of Christ as his
righteousness, man is reckoned by God as righteous, and as an heir of eternal
life. The death sentence is set aside, and the man goes free.
    2. What does Scripture declare would be the condition of one whom
Christ made free? Rom. 6:6-8.
  3. What is the condition before Him of those whom God has justified?
Rom. 8:31-34.
                                           [ 33 I
    NOTE.—In the New Testament in Modern Speech, by Weymouth, this trans-
lation is given of Romans 8:31-34:
    "What then shall we say to this? If God is on our side, who is there to
appear against us? He who did not withhold even His own Son, but gave Him
up for all of us, will He not also with Him freely give us all things? Who shall
impeach those whom God has chosen? God declares them free from guilt.
Who is there to condemn them? Christ Jesus died, or rather has risen to life
again. He is also at the right hand of God, and is interceding for us."
    "The Greek of this passage, differently punctuated, might be rendered
somewhat freely, Will God Himself impeach them? Why, He declares them
free from guilt! Who is there to condemn them? Will Christ Jesus condemn
them? Why, He died for them !"—Ibid.
    4. How can God •be just and yet justify sinners by declaring guilty;
condemned men innocent and free? Rom. 3:23-26; 2 Cor. 5:21.
    NOTE.—Not only does Christ's blood cleanse from all past sin, but His right-
eousness is declared to be ours. While upon earth Christ wrought out a perfect
righteousness. He lived a perfect, sinless life in human flesh like ours. He met
every requirement of the Father's law.
    Now this life of righteousness was wrought out for us. It was for us that
He obeyed the law's every precept. Therefore when we accept Him as our
Substitute and Saviour, He imputes His lawkeeping to us, and reckons that
we have kept it. He did it in our name; it was for us. He therefore sets this
all down to our credit, and there now appears in our record book in heaven a
transcript of His life and character. This is imputed righteousness, and comes
to us as a free gift from God.
    5. With what did Isaiah declare the Lord had covered him? Isa. 61:10.
    6. 'What wonderful change was experienced by Joshua? Zech. 3:3-5.

                            THE SONS OF GOD
   7. What do those who are thus forgiven anti justified become?
1 John 3:1, 2; John 1:12.
    8. What kind of life does the justified person live? Rom. 6:4; Eph.
4:22-24; Col. 3:10.
    9. What does God purpose to fulfill in us? Rom. 8:4.
   NoTE.—These scriptures clearly reveal the fact that it is God's purpose that
pardoned and justified man should be a different man. How can they "that
are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" Rom. 6:2. There should, therefore,
now appear in the life a revelation of that obedience which Christ imputed to
them at the time they accepted Him. "The righteousness of the law" should
"be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
    10. Since it is impossible for human beings, unaided by Christ and
His Spirit, to keep God's holy law, what provision has been made for
us? Heb. 8:10; 2 Cor. 10:3-5.
   NoTE.—Here is more than imputed righteousness. This righteousness is
imparted. It actually touches our flesh and brings its actions into harmony
with God's law; the nature is changed; the precepts of the law are written
upon the heart, and instead of transgression appearing in the life, obedience
appears.
                                     [34]
    No more God-dishonoring doctrine could be preached than that the atone-
ment of Christ has freed men from the obligation to obey God's moral law.
To make it possible for men to obey was its highest and holiest object. Is it
reasonable that Christ should die to save men from the guilt of transgression,
give them a free pardon for the past, and then say to them, "Now you are free
to break the law of God"? No 1 a thousand times, no ! Saved men are not free
to break the law of God. True, they are free from its condemnation for sins
of the past which they were powerless to undo, but which God has now freely
pardoned; but license has not been given them to presume upon God's good-
ness by continuing in transgression. A man who has never kept the law can be
forgiven and justified before God, but he cannot remain in this justified state
without keeping it. He does not keep the law in order to become a Christian,
but, having become a Christian, he will keep it in a manner that becomes one
in whom Christ abides.
    11. How close is to be the relationship between Christ and the con-
verted sinner? Eph. 3:17.
    12. How much can He do for us when His power works in us? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—"There are two errors against which the children of God—particu-
larly those who have just come to trust in His grace—especially need to guard.
The first, already dwelt upon, is that of looking to their own works, trusting
to anything they can do, to bring themselves into harmony with God. He
who is trying to become holy by his own works in keeping the law, is attempt-
ing an impossibility. All that man can do without Christ is polluted with
selfishness and sin. It is the grace of Christ-alone, through faith, that can make
us holy.
    "The opposite and no less dangerous error is, that belief in Christ releases
men from keeping the law of God; that since by faith alone we become par-
takers of the grace of Christ, our works have nothing to do with our redemp-
tion."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 64, 65.
    13. What experience is made possible through the blood of the ever-
lasting covenant? Heb. 13:20, 21.
    NOTE.—This high standard of obedience cannot be accomplished through
human effort. Even after conversion, we are still only human, only sinners
saved by grace from past sins, and are still much too weak to render any
acceptable obedience to a holy law. It is still through Christ. Only now, in-
stead of living the life of obedience without us and then imputing it to us, as
though we had done it, He lives His life in us, actually imparting to us His
righteousness and making it our very own. Thus the apostle Paul declares, "I
have been crucified with Christ ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth
in me: and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith which
is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself up for me." Gal. 2:20,
A. R. V.
    "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes possession of
the new heart. A change is wrought which man can never accomplish for him-
self. It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural element into human
 nature."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 323, 324.
    14. How only may these blessings of pardon, justification. and the
indwelling power of the Spirit be received? Mark 11:24; Acts 13:39;
Rom. 3:22, 26, 28; Eph. 3:17.
    NoTE.—It is by faith that we grasp the promise of sins forgiven; by faith
we are to be justified; and by faith the just are to live. Jesus dwells in our
                                       (35)
hearts "by faith." It is therefore they that believe who experience these mar-
velous blessings.
    "This is the lesson which Jesus taught while He was on earth, that the gift
which God promises us, we must believe we do receive, and it is ours. Jesus
healed the people of their diseases when they had faith in His power.. .
    "You cannot atone for your past sins, you cannot change your heart, and
make yourself holy. But God promises to do all this for you through Christ.
You believe that promise. You confess your sins, and give yourself to God.
You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you do this, God will fulfill His word
to you. If you believe the promise,—believe that you are forgiven and
cleansed,—God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as Christ gave the
paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was healed. It is so
if you believe it.
    "Do not wait to feel that you are made whole, but say, 'I believe it; it is
so, not because I feel it, but because God has promised"'—"Steps to Christ,"
pp. 54, 55.
    15. Having therefore such an all-sufficient Saviour. what are we
admonished to do? Heb. 4:14-16.

                      A Valuable Help--The INDEX
                      For locating a comment on any particular scripture, the
                      Index is invaluable. For example: Suppose in your Sab-
                      bath school lesson you have John 1:29, and you want to
                      know if this text is commented on in the writings of Mrs.
                      White. Turning to your Index, you will find that this text
                      has been quoted or commented upon forty-six times in the
                      various books of the spirit of prophecy. Similarly you
                      will find John 3:16 referred to sixty times.
