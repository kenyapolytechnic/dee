   The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow for this quarter goeeto medical work
   in the territory within the dark coast line and double dotted line in Northern
   Africa. The action at the recent General Conference is that $2,000 should be
   set aside from the first $60,000 of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, and 20 per
   cent of all that is raised above the $60,000, thus doubling the former allotment.




God's Book                              This is the text selected for the 1927
                                        Sabbath School Workers' Training
       By Carlyle B. Haynes
                                        Course. And the "Sabbath School
                                        Worker" also is included in the
          course. "God's Book" deals with the Holy Bible, its structure,
          history, preservation, unity, accuracy, canonicity, versions, mes-
          sage, writers, its study and interpretation. It is in the clear, force-
          ful, simple style of this masterly writer. Surely all who bear re-
          sponsibilities in Sabbath school work—the church at Bible study
          —and other devoted Christians need
          to understand well in these days of
          cavil and doubt the basic foundation        Order Bible House
          upon which their faith rests. The book

                           INTRODUCTION

                                 DIG DEEPER
   "We do not go deep enough in our search for truth. Every soul who believes
present truth will be brought where he will be required to give a. reason of
the hope that is in him. The people of God will be called upon to stand before
kings, princes, rulers, and great men of the earth, and they must know that
they do know what is truth. They must be converted men and women. God
can teach you more in one moment by His Holy Spirit than you could learn
from the great men of the earth. The universe is looking upon the controversy
that is going on upon the earth. At an infinite cost, God has provided for every
man an opportunity to know that which will make him wise unto salvation.
How eagerly do angels look to see who will avail himself of this opportunity !
When a message is presented to God's people, they should not rise up in
opposition to it ; they should go to the Bible, comparing it with the law and
the testimony, and if it does not bear this test, it is not true. God wants our
minds to expand. He desires to put His grace upon us. We may have a feast
of good things every day; for God can open the whole treasure of heaven to
us."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, Feb. 18, 1890.

  SUNDAY    I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I     FRIDAY I SABBATH




                                 Prophecy
MEMORY VERSE: "I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end from
  the beginning." Isa. 46:9, 10.
STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 536, 538; "Testimonies to Ministers,"
  pp. 115-118.

                         DEFINITION AND PURPOSE
    1. What three terms are used in the Bible to designate the one
through whom God speaks? 1 Sam. 9:9; Haggai 1:12, 13.
    NoTE.—A prophet is God's messenger. The message may be one of warning,
of comfort, of exhortation, or of reproof ; it may deal with the past, the present,
or the future. In this series of lessons we shall deal mostly with prophecies
foretelling things of the future.
                                         3
    2. What purpose does prophecy serve? 2 Peter 1:19.
    NOTE.—How dark the future would be were it not for the "sure word of
prophecy"! That word "lights up the darkest gloom, and points the way to
heaven." (See Isa. 46:9-11; 41:21-23.)                              •
    "Even the prophets who were favored with the special illumination of the
Spirit, did not fully comprehend the import of the revelations committed to
them. The meaning was to be unfolded from age to age, as the people of God
should need the instruction therein contained. . . .
    "Witness those holy men of God as they 'inquired and searched diligently'
concerning revelations given them for generations that were yet unborn. Con-
trast their holy zeal with the listless unconcern with which the favored ones
of later ages treat this gift of Heaven. What a rebuke to the ease-loving, world-
loving indifference which is content to declare that the prophecies cannot be
understood."—"The Great Controversy," p. 344.
                    PROMINENCE IN THE SCRIPTURES
    3. How does Christ speak of the many Old Testament prophecies
concerning His life and work? Luke 24:44.
    NOTE.—In the Old Testament Scriptures are found many references, direct
or indirect, to the Messiah. In Genesis He is "the Seed of the woman ;" in
Deuteronomy He is "that Prophet" like unto Moses; in Job He is "My
Redeemer;" in the Psalms He is David's Lord; in Proverbs He is "Wisdom"
personified; in Isaiah He is called "Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God,
The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."
    4. How does the apostle Peter also refer to many Bible predictions?
Acts 3:24.
    NOTE.—Not only do the Old Testament writers refer to the times and
work of the Messiah, but most of the prophets set forth in unmistakable terms
the conditions which shall prevail in the last days.
                     METHODS OF COMMUNICATION
    5. What were some of God's ways of conveying His messages to His
servants? Num. 12:6.
    6. How would He reveal His word to Moses? Verses 7, 8; Ex. 33:11,
first part.
    7. By what means did Jeremiah receive God's message? Jer. 1:4-9.
    8. In what striking way was God's message for Israel given to the
prophet Ezekiel? Ezek. 2:1-3, 7 to 3:4.
    9. By what means was God's word conveyed to Daniel? Dan. 2:19;
7:13; 9:21-23.
    NOTE.—"The truths revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God' (2 Tim.
3:16) ; yet they are expressed in the words of men. The Infinite One by His
Holy Spirit has shed light into the minds and hearts of His servants. He has
given dreams and visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom the truth
was thus revealed, have themselves embodied the thought in human language."
—"The Great Controversy," Introduction, p. v.
    10. What, then, can we be assured is the source of all Bible prophecy?
2 Peter 1:21; 2 Tim. 3:16.
                                      [4]
                          ANCIENT EXAMPLES
    11. Into what three sections were the Old Testament Scriptures
divided by the Jews? What may be said to be a part of all?
    ANswER.—The Jews divided the Hebrew Scriptures into three parts,—
that is, the Law, the Prophets, and the Holy Writings. The latter division is
represented by the Psalms. Interspersed throughout the books of the law and
the Psalms will be found prophecies concerning the Messiah and concerning
Israel. Prophecy is a golden thread running through them all.
    12. What examples are there in the Old Testament of women who
were endowed with the gift of prophecy? Ex. 15:20; Judges 4:4, 5; 2 Chron.
34:21-23.
    NOTE.—"Aaron and Miriam had occupied a position of high honor and
leadership in Israel. Both were endowed with the prophetic gift, and both
had been divinely associated with Moses in the deliverance of the Hebrews....
In the affections of the people and the honor of Heaven she [Miriam] stood
second only to Moses and Aaron."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 382.

                        IN THE CHRISTIAN AGE
   13. What prediction does the prophet Joel make concerning the gift
of prophecy in the Christian age? Joel 2:28, 29.
   14. On the Day of Pentecost, what reference did Peter make to this
prophecy? Acts 2:16-18.
   NOTE.—Peter speaks of this prophecy as pertaining to "the last days."
Therefore the complete fulfillment of Joel's prophecy, though begun at Pente-
cost, will not be consummated until the end of time.
   15. What special gifts were to be manifested in the church of the
Christian dispensation? 1 Cor. 12:28.
   16. What purpose were these gifts to serve in the church? Eph.
4:11-13.
                             FALSE PROPHETS
   17. What caution does Jesus give to those who are living in the last
days? Matt. 24:23-25.
    18. How may Christ's followers distinguish between the false and
the true? Matt. 7:15, 16.
    19. What other test is given by the prophet Isaiah? Isa. 8:19, 20.
    NOTE.—"Not all who profess His name and wear His badge are Christ's.
Many who have taught in My name, said Jesus, will •be found wanting at
last."—"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," p. 209.

the Saviour's coming. Upon this event they had rested their brightest hopes.
                                  [6)
In song and prophecy, in temple rite and household prayer, they had enshrined
His name. And yet at His coming they knew Him not. . . . Yet God had
chosen Israel. He had called them to preserve among men the knowledge of
His law, and of the symbols and prophecies that pointed to the Saviour."-
"Thz Desire of Ages," p. 27.
    3. What is the first promise of a Saviour and Deliverer? Gen. 3:15.
    NOTE.-"The Saviour's coming was foretold in Eden. When Adam and Eve
first heard the promise, they looked for its speedy fulfillment. They joyfully
welcomed their first-born son, hoping that he might be the Deliverer. But
the fulfillment of the promise tarried. Those who first received it, died without
the sight. From the days of Enoch the promise was repeated through patriarchs
and prophets, keeping alive the hope of His appearing, and yet He came not."
-Id., p. 31.
    4. What promise was made to Abraham? Gen. 17:1-3; 22:17, 18.

                             THE VIRGIN BIRTH
    10. What did the angel Gabriel testify as to the ancestry of the child
that was to be born of the virgin Mary? Luke 1:30-33.
    11. How does the prophet describe the child that was to be born?
Isa. 9:6, 7.

    NOTE.-The "seventy weeks" of Daniel 9:24-26 were to begin 457 B. C.,
when Artaxerxes granted to Ezra the commission "to restore and to build
 Jerusalem." "Taking this as the starting point, there was perfect harmony in
 the application of all the events foretold in the explanation of that period in
Dan. 9:25-27. Sixty-nine weeks, the first 483 of the 2300 years, were to reach
                                       [7]
to the Messiah, the Anointed One; and Christ's baptism and anointing by the
Holy Spirit, A. D. 27, exactly fulfilled the specification. In the midst of the
seventieth week, Messiah was to be cut off. Three and a half years after His
baptism, Christ was crucified, in the spring of A. D. 31."—"The Great Contro-
versy," p. 410.
                THE WORK AND SUFFERING OF CHRIST
   17. What did the prophet say of the work that the Messiah should
do when He appeared? Isa. 61:1-3.
   18. What indicates that Jesus understood this prophecy to refer to
Himself? Luke 4:16-21.

when He should appear among them? Isa. 53:3.
   21. In what striking language are His suffering and death set forth?
Verses 7-9.
   22. Why did the Sinless One endure all this shame and suffering?
Verse 5.
   NOTE.—"Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He
deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we
might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered
the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. 'With
His stripes we are healed.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 25.

                              LESSON OUTLINE
    [Faith in Christ as tne Son of God, our Saviour and Redeemer, is confirmed and
strengthened by an understanding of the prophecies concerning Him, and their
fulfillment in His life and ministry. Without the background of prophecy, the son-
ship of Christ is to many a mystery.]

I. THE SEED AND THE DELIVERER
    1. Christ used Old Testament prophecies to teach His disciples concerning
       Himself. Luke 24:27, 44.
    2. The seed mentioned in Genesis 3:15 ; 22:17, 18 is primarily Christ, the
       son of David.
    3. Christ was recognized while among men as the Messiah, the one of
       whom Old Testament writers spoke. John 1:45.
11. THE VIRGIN BIRTH
    1. The angel Gabriel testified that the Child Jesus was the Son of God,
       the seed of David. Luke 1:30-33.
    2. Christ's miraculous birth was predicted by Isaiah, who is quoted by
       Matthew. Isa. 7:14.
    3. Daniel predicted the year of His baptism. Dan. 9:24-26.
I11. THE WORK AND SUFFERING OF CHRIST

                          Ancient Babylon
MEMORY VERSE: "Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before
  a fall." Prov. 16:18.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 117-124.

                           ORIGIN AND PURPOSE
    1. Who was the founder of Babylon? How is he described? Gen.
10:8-10.
    NOTE.—"Babylon" is the Greek form of the Hebrew Babel. According to
the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, it seems to be derived from
the old Assyrian Bab-ili meaning the "Gate of God."
    Spurrell translates Genesis 10:8, 9 as follows: "Also Cush begat Nimrod
who was the first to be a despot on the earth. He was an overbearing tyrant
in Jehovah's sight." A Jewish translation gives the same rendering.
    2. Besides building the city of Babylon, what other structure did the
men of Babel design? What purposes was this tower designed to serve?
Gen. 11:1-4.
    NoTE.—The descendants of Noah journeyed to the plain of Shinar, and
determined to make their home there. "Here they decided to build a city, and
in it a tower of such stupendous height as should render it the wonder of the
world. These enterprises were designed to prevent the people from scattering
abroad in colonies. God had directed men to disperse throughout the earth,
to replenish and subdue it; but these Babel builders determined to keep their
community united in one body, and to found a monarchy that should eventually
embrace the whole earth. Thus their city would become the metropolis of a
universal empire; its glory would command the admiration and homage of
 the world, and render the founders illustrious. The magnificent tower, reaching
to the heavens. was intended to stand as a monument of the power and wisdom
 of its builders, perpetuating their fame to the latest generations. . . . One
 object before them in the erection of the tower was to secure their own safety
in case of another deluge."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 118, 119.
     Unbelief, disobedience, pride. self-exaltation. salvation by their own works.
 and a desire to rule the world, traits of character and a desire which could only
 mean tyranny, were revealed in the Babel builders
     3. How did God regard the work of these builders? Verses 5-7.
                       PRIDE AND SELF-EXALTATION
    4. How does the prophet describe the outstanding sin of the cities
of the ancient world? Ezek. 16:49.
    NOTE.—"The whole undertaking [of the Babel builders] was designed to
exalt still further the pride of its projectors, and to turn the minds of future
generations away from God, and lead them into idolatry. . . . The people
rejoiced in their success, and praised the gods of silver and gold, and set them-
                                        E9I
selves against the Ruler of heaven and earth."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 119.
    5. What fate befell the tower and its builders? Gen. 11:8, 9.
    NOTE.—"Suddenly the work that had been advancing so prosperously was
checked. Angels were sent to bring to nought the purpose of the builders. . . .
All work came to a standstill            Their confederacy ended in strife and
bloodshed. Lightnings from heaven, as an evidence of God's displeasure, broke
off the upper portion of the tower, and cast it to the ground."—/d., pp. 119, 120.
    6. What has the word "Babel" ever since meant? Verse 9, margin.
    NoTE.—All human plans that ignore God, and that attempt to secure salva-
tion by human works will end in confusion.
    7. Who first revealed these characteristics of the men of Babel? Isa.
14:12-14.
    8. What will be the result to Lucifer of his self-exaltation? Verses
15-19.
    9. Compare the spirit of Lucifer with that of Jesus, and note the.result
in each case. Isa. 14:12-15; Phil. 2:6-11.
                              THE SIN OF PRIDE
    10. What is God's attitude toward pride? Prov. 8:13.
    NOTES.—Why does God so abominate pride and self-exaltation? God can-
not do for the proud heart what He desires to do. Pride manifests itself in
many ways. There is pride of opinion, of wealth or position. Some are proud
of their learning, or their good looks, or their good clothes; some are even
proud of their humility.
    "Pride feels no need, and so it closes the heart against Christ and the infinite
blessings He came to give."—"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," p. 19.
    "There is nothing so offensive to God, or so dangerous to the human soul,
as pride and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the most hopeless, the most in-
curable."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 154.

               RELATION OF BABYLON TO GOD'S WORK
    11. What was the attitude of Babylon toward God's people? 2 Chron.

    NoTE.—Nebuchadnezzar, the great king of Babylon, is here spoken of as
"the king of the Chaldees."
    12. How did the king of Babylon reveal the characteristics of the
original founders of Babylon? Dan. 3:19, 20; 4:29, 30.
    NOTE.—Pride, self-exaltation, and a determination to establish their .city
as a permanent symbol of defiance against God's power filled the hearts of the
original Babel builders. Nebuchadnezzar here manifests the same lofty pride
and rebellion.
    13. What judgment came upon the king because of his pride and
self-exaltation? Verses 31-33.
    14. What description do the prophets give of the evil that was to
come upon ancient Babylon because of her ill-treatment of God's
people? Isa. 47:9-11; Jer. 50:17, 18.

   15. What fate was predicted for Babylon by the prophet? Isa. 13:19-22.
   NOTE.—"Thus 'the broad walls of Babylon' became 'utterly broken, and
her high gates . . . burned with fire.' Thus did Jehovah of hosts 'cause the
arrogancy of the proud to cease,' and lay low 'the haughtiness of the terrible.'
Thus did 'Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excel-
lency,' become as Sodom and Gomorrah,—a place forever accursed."--
"Prophets and Kings," pp. 532, 533.

                               LESSON OUTLINE
   ("Missionaries for God are wanted, faithful men and women who will not shirk
responsibility. Judicious labor will accomplish good results. There is real work to
be done. The truth should be brought before people in a careful manner by those
who unite meekness with wisdom."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 73.]
I. ORIGIN AND PURPOSE
     1. Babylon was established by Nimrod, a tyrant or despot. Gen. 10:8, 9.
     2. In Babylon an immense tower was built,—one purpose among others,
        protection against the acts of God. Gen. 11:1-4.
     3. God confused their language—scattering men as originally purposed.
        Gen. 11:5-9.
11. PRIDE AND SELF-EXALTATION
      1. The great sin of the ancient cities was pride. Ezek. 16:49.
      2. Pride originated with Satan in heaven. Isa. 14:12-14.
      3. Lucifer's and Christ's ideals are opposites. Phil. 2:6-11 with above.

                           Prophecy of Daniel 2
MEMORY VERSE: "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His
  secret unto His servants the prophets." Amos 3:7.
STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 479-502; "Beacon Lights of Prophecy"
  (Spicer), pp. 43-51.

                           THE HISTORICAL SETTING
  1. What calamity came upon Jerusalem in the reign of Jehoiakim?
Dan. 1:1, 2.
    2. How was a heathen king able to take possession of . God's sacred
city and temple? Verse 2, first part.
    NOTE.—This judgment upon Israel was not merely for the purpose of
punishment. God desired to teach His people lessons which they refused to
learn in prosperity; He also wished to reveal Himself to the people of Babylon.
                                       11
   3. What four Jewish youth are especially mentioned? How are these
young men described? What was the purpose of the king in educating
them? Verses 3-6.
   4. What request concerning diet did Daniel make? With what result?
Verses 8-16.
    5. After three years' special training, what did the king discern con-
cerning the wisdom of these four young men? Verses 18-20.
    Nom—How did these Jewish captives in a foreign land make such a
splendid record?
   "They obtained their knowledge by the faithful use of their powers, under
the guidance of the Holy Spirit. They placed themselves in connection with
the Source of all wisdom, making the knowledge of God the foundation of
their education. . . . They avoided that which would weaken their powers,
and improved every opportunity to become intelligent in all lines of learning.
They followed the rules of life that could not fail to give them strength of
intellect. They sought to acquire knowledge for one purpose,—that they
might honor God."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 486.

                           THE KING'S DREAM
  6. In the second year of his reign, what perplexity came to King
Nebuchadnezzar? Dan. 2:1.
   7. Upon whom did the king call to reveal the mystery? What were
these worldly-wise men finally compelled to confess? Verses 2, 10, 11.
   8. How was the decree of the king made known to Daniel? Verses
12-15.
   9. What did Daniel then do? What did he promise? How was Daniel
enabled to reveal the king's dream? Verses 16-19.
   Nom—Daniel's education was superior to that of the wise men of Babylon.
He was acquainted with a God whose dwelling is in the hearts of 'those who
yield to Him, and who can and will reveal to them the mystery of the gospel.
The wise men of Babylon knew no such• God.
    10. What had the king of Babylon seen in a dream? Verses 31-35.
    Nom—In these few words, as we shall see by the prophet's interpretation
of the dream, the Lord had revealed the history of the world from the days
of Babylon to the setting up of Christ's everlasting kingdom.
   11. What did the golden head of the image represent? Verses 36-38.
   Nom—The prophet Isaiah had called Babylon "the glory of kingdoms,"
and the "golden city." Isa. 13:19 and 14:4. It was at the height of its power
in Nebuchadnezzar's day. On one of the bricks now dug out of its ruins this
king had written, "May it last forever."
   12. But what did the prophet say as he told the meaning of the breast
and arms of silver? Verse 39, first part.
   NOTE.—The Medes and Persians overthrew Babylon in 538 B. c., in the
days of Belshazzar, who was evidently Nebuchadnezzar's grandson. So quickly
came the change of empire,
                                     12 1
   13. What next was to come in the history? Verse 39, last part.
   NoTE.—Grecia followed Medo-Persia, the great third empire, represented
by the sides of brass in the image. Led by Alexander the Great, the Greeks
gained the final victory over Darius, the Persian, at Arbela, not far from
ancient Nineveh, in 331 B. c.
    14. How did the prophet Daniel describe the fourth great empire,
represented in the image by the legs of iron? Verse 40.
    NoTE.—Rome followed Grecia. Historians date its entrance upon world
dominion from 168 B. c., when Roman arms defeated the Greeks, or Mace-
donians, at Pydna. Rome was "strong as iron."
    Edward Gibbon, the historian, testifies to the greatness and the work of
the fourth kingdom of Daniel's prophecy. He says:
   ."The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in battle, always vic-
torious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the
Rhine, and the ocean; and the images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might
serve to represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken by
the iron monarchy of Rome."—"The History of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire," vol. 3, p. 634, edition, 1876.
    The new Babylonian Empire of these times, symbolized by the head of
gold, began with Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, about
625 B. c. and ended with the capture of the city of Babylon by Cyrus in 538
B. c. The breast and arms of silver, the next great world power, represents
the Medo-Persian Empire, which was overthrown by Grecia at the Battle of
Arbela, 331 B. C. Alexander the Great, ruler of Grecia, established a third
universal kingdom, represented by the brass of the image. Rome followed
Grecia, coming into world dominion at the Battle of Pydna, 168 B. c. This
fourth kingdom of Rome, symbolized by the legs of iron, and toes of iron and
clay, ran its predicted course, and the empire was finally divided into ten
kingdoms through the invasion and conquests by the various barbarian tribes
 of northern Europe. This took place between the years 351 and 476 A. D.
    15. What change in the fourth great kingdom was represented by
the mixture of the clay with the iron in the feet and toes of the image?
Verses 41-43.
    NOTE.—"The kingdom shall be divided." Verse 41. The old Roman Empire
was broken up into ten parts, as the tribes of northern Europe invaded the
territory and founded kingdoms. These are at present represented by the king-
doms or nations of western Europe—some strong, some weak. The prophecy
foretold that the kingdoms of divided Rome would not be reunited into one
great empire. Verse 43. And so has it been in history.

               ESTABLISHMENT OF CHRIST'S KINGDOM
   16. What did the prophet say would take place in the days of these
kingdoms? What is said of the duration of the kingdom which God will
establish? Verses 44, 45.
   17. How was the king of Babylon affected by this wonderful revela-
tion? What confession did he make? Dan. 2:46, 47.
   18. How was Daniel rewarded for his loyalty to God, and to the king?
Verses 48, 49.
                               113
                               LESSON OUTLINE
    l"God expects us to bear much fruit. He expects greater zeal and faithfulness,
more affectionate and earnest efforts, by the individual members of the church for
their neighbors, and for those who are out of Christ."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 495.]

I. THE HISTORICAL SETTING
      1. God punished Israel by banishment because of their rebellion.

      1. At the end of earthly kingdoms Christ sets up His kingdom. Verses
         44, 45.
      2. Definite qualifications are required to be a citizen of God's kingdom.
         Matt. 5:3, 5, 10.
      3. Even the heathen king's heart was softened by the revelation of God's
         plan. Dan. 2:46, 47.

of Christ. . . . But when the Saviour yielded up His life, and with His expiring
breath cried out, 'It is finished,' then the fulfillment of the plan of redemption
was assured. The promise of salvation made to the sinful pair in Eden was
ratified. The kingdom of grace, which had before existed by the promise of

STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 627-631; "The Great Controversy,"
  pp. 644-646.
                                      [ 16 ]
                 THE PROMISES OF CHRIST'S COMING
    1. When Jesus was about to leave this world, what promise did He
make to His disciples? John 14:1-3.
    Nora.—"The Saviour's promise to His disciples is a promise to His church
to the end of time. God did not design that His wonderful plan to redeem
men should achieve only insignificant results."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 667.
    "For your sake I came into the world. am working in your behalf. When
I go away, I shall still work earnestly for you. I came into the world to reveal
Myself to you, that you might believe. I go to the Father to co-operate with
Him in your behalf. The object of Christ's departure was the opposite of
what the disciples feared. It did not mean a final separation. He was going
to prepare a place for them, that He might come again, and receive them unto
Himself. While He was building mansions for them, they were to build
characters after the divine similitude."—Id., p. 663.
    2. How does Paul express the same great truth that Jesus would
come again to this earth? Heb. 9:27, 28.
    3. For what event, then, should the Christian be looking and pre-
parine? Titus 2:11-14.

                     THE MANNER OF HIS COMING
   4. What consoling message did the angels bring to the disciples at
the time of our Lord's ascension? Acts 1:10, 11.
   NOTE.—"This same Jesus,"—personal, literal, visible, as He ascended, so
will He come again.
   "Christ had ascended to heaven in the form of humanity. The disciples
had beheld the cloud receive Him. The same Jesus who had walked and talked
and prayed with them; who had broken bread with them; who had been
with them in their boats on the lake; and who had that very day toiled with
them up the ascent of Olivet,—the same Jesus had now gone to share His
Father's throne. And the angels had assured them that the very One whom
they had, seen go up into heaven, would come again even as He had ascended."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 832.
    5. To what extent will Christ's coming be visible? Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:27.
   6. What warning does Jesus give in view of the false conceptions
concerning the manner of His coming? Verses 23-26.
    NOTE.—"This prophecy was spoken also for the last days. This sign is
given as a sign of the second advent. Even now false christs and false prophets
are showing signs and wonders to seduce His disciples. Do we not hear the
cry, 'Behold, He is in the desert'? Have not thousands gone forth into the
desert, hoping to find Christ? And from thousands of gatherings where men
profess to hold communion with departed spirits, is not the call now heard,
`Behold, He is in the secret chambers'? This is the very claim that spiritualism
puts forth. But what says Christ?—`Believe it not. For as the lightning cometh
out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the
Son of man be.' "—Id., p. 631.
    7. How does Paul set forth the deceptive character of the work of
Satan and his ministers? 2 Cor. 11:13-15.
    NOTE.—"As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan
                                      1171
himself will personate Christ. The church has long professed to look to the
Saviour's advent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the great deceiver
will make it appear that Christ has come. In different parts of the earth, Satan
will manifest himself among men as a majestic being of dazzling brightness,
resembling the description of the Son of God given by John in the Revelation.
The glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that mortal eyes
have yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings out upon the air, 'Christ has
come! Christ has come!' The people prostrate themselves in adoration before
him, while he lifts up his hands, and pronounces a blessing upon them, . . .
then, in his assumed character of Christ, he claims to have changed the Sab-
bath to Sunday, and commands all to hallow the day which he has blessed. . . .
This is the strong, almost overmastering delusion."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 624.
                  THE PURPOSE OF CHRIST'S COMING
   8. Why should Jesus desire to return to this sinful world? Gal. 1:3. 4:
1 Thess. 4:16.
   NOTE.—"He will come to raise the dead, and to change the living saints
from glory to glory. He will come to honor those who have loved Him, and
kept His commandments, and to take them to Himself. He has not forgotten
them nor His promise."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 632.
   9. What shows that the living saints will have no advantage over
those who sleep in Jesus? 1 Thess. 4:15, 17.
   NOTE.—The Revised Version renders verse 15 as follows: "For this we say
unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto
the coming of the Lord, shall in nowise precede them that are fallen asleep."

                        CONTEMPORARY EVENTS
     10. What event, to which the saints have long looked forward with
joyful anticipation, will take place at the glorious appearing of our
Lord? 1 Thess. 4:16.
    NOTE.—"With a shout." The Greek word means "a summons," "a shout of
command," as a king or general leading an army.
    "Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror. . . . And the armies in heaven
follow Him.' With anthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a vast, un-
numbered throng, attend Him on His way. The firmament seems filled with
radiant fOrms,—`ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.'
No human pen can portray the scene; nor mortal mind is adequate to conceive
its splendor."—"The Great Controversy," p. 641.
     11. What terrible calamity awaits the finally impenitent and ungodly
at the coming of the Lord? 2 Thess. 1:6-10.
   12. What solemn event does Paul connect with the coming of Christ?
   ANSWER.—The judgment hour. 2 Tim. 4:1.
   13. How many must appear before the judgment bar? For what
purpose? 2 Cor. 5:10.
   14. How does Jesus set forth the fact that the saints will be "gathered"
("caught up") at His glorious appearing? Matt. 24:30, 31. (See 1 These.
4:17.)
                                     [18]
    NOTE.—"The living righteous are changed 'in a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye.' At the voice of God they were glorified; now they are made im-
mortal, and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air.
Angels 'gather together the elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
to the other.' Little children are borne by holy angels to their mothers' arms.
Friends long separated by death are united, never more to part, and with songs
of gladness ascend together to the city of God."—"The Great Controversy," 645.
    "From the prison house of death they come, clothed with immortal glory,
crying, '0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?' And the
living righteous and the risen saints unite their voices in a long, glad shout of
victory."—Id., p. 644.
                               LESSON OUTLINE
   ["The doctrine of the second advent is the very keynote of the Sacred Scriptures."
—"The Great Controversy," p. 299.
   "We should feel it our special duty to work for those living in our neighborhood.
Study how you can best help those who take no interest in religious things. As you
visit your friends and neighbors, show an interest in their spiritual as well as in
their temporal welfare. Speak to them of Christ as a sin-pardoning Saviour."—"The
Ministry of Healing," p. 162.]

                  Our Lord's Great Prophecy
MEMORY VERSE: "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the word
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." Matt. 24:14.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 627-630; "The Great Controversy,"
  pp. 26-35; "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 463-467.

                   QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE END
    1. When the magnificence of the Jewish temple was pointed out to
Jesus, what startling prediction did He make? Matt. 24:1, 2.
    2. Later what twofold question did the disciples ask with reference
to this prediction? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—The disciples evidently thought that such a calamity as the destruc-
tion of the temple could not take place until the end of the world.
    "Jesus did not answer His disciples by takino- up separately the destruction
of Jerusalem and the great day of His coming. '     He mingled the description of
these two events. . . . In mercy to them He blended the description of the
two great crises, leaving the disciples to study out the meaning for themselves.
  . . This entire discourse was given, not for the disciples only, but for those
who should live in the last scenes of this earth's history."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 628.
    3. Before answering their question directly, what warning did Jesus
give to His disciples?? Verses 4. 5.
    4. What was said to show that the complete fulfillment of His
prophecy was not immediately imminent? Verses 6, 7.
    5. Through what trying experiences were the followers of. Jesus to
pass? Verses 9-11.
    Norc.—"All this the Christians suffered. Fathers and mothers betrayed
their children. Children betrayed their parents. Friends delivered their friends
up to the Sanhedrin. The persecutors wrought out their purpose by killing
Stephen, James, and other Christians."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 629.
    6. What great work must be done before the end of the world can
come? Verse 14.
    7. What sign did Jesus then give that His disciples might know when
the destruction of their city was near? Verse 15.
    8. How did Jesus explain the meaning of the expression, "The abomi-
nation of desolation?" Luke 21:20.
    9. When the Christians in Jerusalem saw this sign, what were they
to do? Matt. 24:16-18; Luke 21:21, 22.
    Norc.—"When the idolatrous standards of the Romans should be set up
in the holy ground, which extended some furlongs outside the city walls, then
the followers of Christ were to find safety in flight. When the warning sign
                                      [ 20
should be seen, those who would escape must make no delay. Throughout the
land of Judea, as well as in Jerusalem itself, the signal for flight must be
immediately obeyed. . . . They must not hesitate a moment, lest they be
involved in-the general destruction."—"The Great Controversy," p. 26.
   10. How were those who obeyed this injunction rewarded?
   ANSWER.—"Not one Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem,
Christ had given His disciples warning, and all'who believed His words watched
for the promised sign. . . . After the Romans under Cestius had surrounded
the city, they unexpectedly abandoned the siege when everything seemed
favorable for an immediate attack. The besieged, despairing of successful
resistance, were on the point of surrender, when the Roman general withdrew
his forces without the least apparent reason. . . . Events were so overruled
that neither Jews nor Romans should hinder the flight of the Christians."
—Id., p. 30.
    NOTE.—Josephus, the Jewish historian, who was present at the siege of
Jerusalem, says that Cestius "recalled his soldiers from the place, and by
despairing of any expectation of taking it, without having received any dis-
grace, he retired from the city, without any reason in the world."—"Wars of
the Jews," book 2, chap. 19, par. 5-7.
    11. To what place did the Christians go after leaving Jerusalem?
    ANswER.—Josephus says: "After this calamity had befallen Cestius, many
of the most eminent of the Jews swam away from the city, as from a ship
when it was going to sink."—Id., chap. 20, par. 1. And the church historian
Eusebius says: "The whole body, however, of the church at Jerusalem, having
been commanded by a divine revelation, given to men of approved, piety there
before the war, removed from the city, and dwelt at a certain town beyond
the Jordan, called Pella."—"Ecclesiastical History," book 3, chap. 5.
    12. How does Jesus further describe the terrible judgments that
should fall upon the city of Jerusalem, and upon the Jewish nation?
Luke 21:23, 24.
    NOTE.—"Terrible were the calamities that fell upon Jerusalem when the
siege was resumed by Titus. . . . Thousands perished from famine and pesti-
lence. Natural affection seemed to have been destroyed. Husbands robbed
their wives, and wives their husbands. Children would be seen snatching the
food from the mouths of their aged parents. . . . The Roman leaders en-
deavored to strike terror to the Jews, and thus cause them to surrender. Those
prisoners who resisted when taken, were scourged, tortured, and crucified before
the walls of the city. Hundreds were daily put to death in this manner,
and the dreadful work continued until, along the valley of Jehoshaphat and
at Calvary, crosses were erected in so great numbers that there was scarcely
room to move among them. So terribly was visited that awful imprecation
uttered before the judgment seat of Pilate: 'His blood be on us, and on our
children.' "—"The Great Controversy," pp. 31-33.
    "Both the city and the temple were razed to their foundations, and the
ground upon which the holy house had stood was 'plowed like a field.' In the
sierre and the slaughter that followed, more than a million of the people
perished ; the survivors were carried away as captives, sold as slaves, dragged
to Rome to grace the conqueror's triumph, thrown to wild beasts in the
amphitheaters, or scattered as homeless wanderers throughout the earth."—
Id., p. 35, 36.
                                     [21]
   13. From the time that Jesus warned His disciples of the destruction
of Jerusalem, for what were they to pray? Why? Mal 24:20.
   NOTE.—" 'Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter; neither on the
Sabbath day,' Christ said. He who made the Sabbatli did not abolish it,
nailing it to His cross. The Sabbath was not rendered null and void by His
death. Forty years after His crucifixion it was still to be held sacred. For
forty years the disciples were to pray that their flight might not be on the
Sabbath day."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 630.
                              LESSON OUTLINE
    ["Invite your neighbors to your home, and read with them from the precious
Bible and from books that explain its truths. Invite them to unite with you in song
and prayer. In these little gatherings, Christ Himself will be present, as He has
promised, and hearts will be touched by His grace."—"The Ministry of Healing,"
p. 162.]
I. QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE END
      1. Christ predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and end of world. Matt.
          24:1-3.
       2. He warned against the danger of being deceived. Matt. 24:4, 5.
      3. Wars and persecution would continue for a long period before the end.
          Matt. 24:6-11.
11. A SIGN OF THE END
       1. An outstanding sign of the end is the giving of the gospel to all the
          world. Matt. 24:14.
I11. JERUSALEM'S DESTRUCTION PROPHESIED
       1. The surrounding of Jerusalem by the Roman armies would warn of
          the city's imminent destruction. Matt. 24:15.
       2. Christians were to flee Jerusalem in that hour. Luke 21:21, 22.
      3. They were to pray that it come not in winter or on the Sabbath.
          Matt. 24:20.

                       Signs in the Heavens
MEMORY VERSE: "There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
  stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, • with perplexity; the sea and the
  waves roaring." Luke 21:25.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 631-633; "The Great Controversy,"
  pp. 306-308, 333, 334.

               THE TIME WHEN THE SIGNS ARE DUE
   1. In response to a question from His disciples concerning the signs
of His coming, what did Jesus say? Luke 21:25.
   NOTE.—When in the past some crisis in the history of the world was im-
minent, God has sent a war•ing message to His people so that they might be
                                      [ 22 ]
ready for it. Witness the warning to the antediluvians, and the message of
Jonah to Nineveh ; also the message of John the Baptist proclaiming the first
advent of the Messiah. Surely when an event of such tremendous importance
as the end of the world is near, God will warn His people of the approach of
that event.
    2. What is said concerning the time when these signs should appear?
Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24.
    NoTE.—"The Saviour gives signs of His coming, and more than this, He
fixes the time when the first of these signs shall appear: 'Immediately after the
tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened.' "—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 631.
    Mark gives an additional thought. He says, "In those days, after that tribu-
lation, the sun shall be darkened." The "days" mentioned are evidently the
days of tribulation mentioned by Matthew (24:21, 22) which refer to that
long period of papal domination spoken of- by Daniel (7:25), and by John
(Rev. 12:14, 6) during which many saints suffered death for their faith.
Those days began in 538 A. D. and ended in 1798. By 1776 persecution—the
tribulation—had generally ceased. Between these two dates, then, 1776-1798,
accord'ng to the prophecy, the sun should be darkened.

                 THE SUN AND THE MOON DARKENED
    3. What did Jesus say would be the character of the sign in the sun
and the moon? Matt. 24:29. (See also Rev. 6:12.)
    Nora.—A few excerpts from various writers, some of them eyewitnesses,
of the "dark day" of May 19, 1780, will show the remarkable fulfillment of
this prophecy:
    "The 19th of May, 1780, was unprecedented in New England for its great
darkness. . . . The darkness extended over several thousand square miles.. . .
The day was appropriately called and is still known as The Dark Day."—
Joseph Dory.
    "The extent of this darkness was very remarkable. . . . It seems to have
extended all over the New England States. . . With regard to its duration, it
continued in this place at least fourteen hours."—Samuel Williams.
    "On the 19th of May, 1780, an uncommon darkness took place all over
New England, and extended to Canada. It continued about fourteen hours,
or from ten o'clock in the morning till midnight. The darkness was so great
that people were unable to read common print, or tell the time of the day by
their watches, or to dine, or transact their ordinary business without the light
of candles."—"Th'e Guide to Knowledge."
    As to the effect of the darkness produced: "Men, ordinarily cool, were filled
 with awe and alarm. . . . Some ran about saying the day of judgment was
at hand; the wicked hurried to their neighbors to confess wrongs and ask
 forgiveness; the superstitious dropped on their knees to pray in the fields, or
 rushed into meeting houses to call on God to preserve them."—"History of
 Weare, New Hampshire," Wm. Little.
    "Nor was the darkness of the night less uncommon and terrifying than
 that of the day ; notwithstanding there was almost a full moon, no object was
 discernible, but by the help of some artificial light, which when seen from
 the neighboring houses and other places at a distance, appeared through a
 kind of Egyptian darkness, which seemed almost impervious to the rays."—
 Thomas' Massachusetts Spy.
                                      [ 23 )
   Another description says: "If every luminous body in the universe had
been shrouded in impenetrable shades, or struck out of existence, the darkness
could not have been more complete. A sheet of white paper held within a few
inches of the eye was equally invisible with the blackest velvet."—From Letter
of Dr. Samuel Tenney.
   The foregoing statements are from "Source Book for Bible Students,"
pages 129-136.
                            THE FALLING STARS
    4. What sign was to succeed the darkening of the sun and the moon?
Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:25.
    5. How does John the revelator describe this meteoric shower?
Rev. 6:13.
    NOTE.—"The morning of November 13, 1833, was rendered memorable
by an exhibition of the phenomenon called shooting stars, which was probably
more extensive and magnificent than any similar one hitherto recorded."—
Denison Olmsted of Yale College (1834).
    "On the night of November 12-13, 1833, a tempest of falling stars broke
over the earth. . . . From the Gulf of Mexico to Halifax, until daylight with
some difficulty put an end to the display, the sky was scored in every direction
with shining tracks and illuminated with majestic fireballs."—"History of
Astronomy in the Nineteenth Century," Agnes M. Clerke, p. 328.
    "In many districts, the mass of the population were terror-struck, and
the more enlightened were awed at contemplating so vivid a picture of the
Apocalyptic image—that of the stars of heaven falling to the earth, even as a
fig tree casting her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."—
Thomas Milner.
    "This spectacle, which excited the greatest interest among all beholders, . . .
many of whom thought that the end of the world had come, was witnessed
generally throughout North America. . . . Hundreds of thousands of shooting
stars fell in the course of two or three hours."—The Encyclopedia Americana.
    "Probably the most remarkable of all the meteoric showers that have ever
occurred was that of the Leonids, on the rnight following] November 12, 1833.
The number at some stations was estimated as high as 200,000 an hour for
five or six hours."—"Manual of Astronomy," Charles A. Young.
    The foregoing quotations are taken from "Source Book for Bible Stu-
dents," pages 175-179.
    6. When these signs begin to appear, what should Christians do?
Luke 21:28.
    7. When all these signs have been fulfilled, what may we know?
Matt. 24:33, margin.
    8. What parable did Jesus give to assure us of the certainty and
nearness of His coming? Luke 21:29-31.
    9. What caution is given to prevent one from setting definite time
for the coming of our Lord? Matt. 24:36.
    10. What admonition is given that God's people may be ready for
the coming of Jesus? Verses 42-44.
    11. What terrible convulsions in nature will occur just before the
coming of our Lord? What effect will these have upon the ungodly?
ReV. 6:14-17.
                                       124]

   ["Those who have long known the truth need to seek the Lord most earnestly,
that their hearts may be filled with a determination to work for their neighbors."—

MEMORY VERSE: "Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time
  is. . . . Lest coming suddenly He find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I
  say unto all, Watch." Mark 13:33, 36, 37.
STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 635, 636; "The Great Controversy,"
  p. 589; "Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 14, 17, 26.

                        FEAR AMONG THE NATIONS
   1. How did Jesus describe the conditions that would prevail among
the nations just before His appearing? Luke 21:25, 26.
   NoTE.—"Everything in the world is in agitation. The Signs of the times
are ominous. Coming events cast their shadows before. The Spirit of God is
withdrawing from the earth, and calamity follows calamity by sea and by
land. There are tempests, earthquakes, fires, floods,, murders of every grade.
Who can read the future? Where is security? There is assurance in nothing
that is human or earthly. Rapidly are men ranging themselves under the
banner they have chosen. Restlessly are they waiting and watching the move-'
ments of their leaders."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 635, 636.
    2. What will be the general attitude of nations one toward another
during the history of the world? Matt. 24:7, first part.
    3. What will be the condition of the nations just before the final
judgments of God fall upon the earth? Rev. 11:18, first part.
                                       [25]
                 UNPARALLELED WAR PREPARATIONS
   4. How does the prophet Joel describe the tremendous preparation
for war that will take place in the last days? Joel 3:9-11.
   NOTE.—The recent World War which convulsed the civilized world was,
no doubt, a partial fulfillment of Joel's prophecy, and a foretokening of still
greater calamities yet to come. It is estimated that the financial cost of that
conflict reached the colossal sum of over two hundred billion dollars; that
the number of men under arms was fifty-eight million, and that the killed
and seriously wounded amounted to over twenty million. Such figures are
unparalleled in any prior war.
                     THE PEACE-AND-SAFETY CRY
   5. While war is evidently imminent, what will many people be
saying? Isa. 2:2-5.
   6. How does Paul reveal the deceptive character of the peace predic-
tions in the last days? 1 Thess. 5:3.
                           THE FINAL CONFLICT
    7. In what will this anger of nations finally culminate? Rev. 16:13-16.
    8. What will be the chief agencies in stirring up the war spirit in
all the world? Verse 14.
    NoTE.—"Satan delights in war; for it excites the worst passions of the soul,
and then sweeps into eternity its victims steeped in vice and blood. It is his
object to incite the nations to war against one another; for he can thus divert
the minds of the people from the work of preparation to stand in the day of
God."—"The Great Controversy," p. 589.
    9. Where will this great battle be fought? Verse 16.
    NoTE.—Commenting on "Armageddon," the "Century Bible" says: "The
precision of the phrase introducing the name suggests that the writer had an
actual locality in view; and it has been generally understood that he refers
to the Plain of Esdraelon, at one end of which stood Megiddo. This was the
classic battleground of Scripture. . . . It is to this that 'the kings of the
whole world' are to be gathered together for the final struggle with the armies
of God."
    The "Plain of Esdraelon," or the Valley of Jezreel, is in the northern part
of Palestine • but in the prophecy of Joel it appears That the "men of war"
are assembled in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. But there is no discrepancy here;
for if the kings of "the whole world" gather any considerable portion of their
armies, the whole of Palestine, from south of Jerusalem to Galilee, will be
covered with soldiers; thus fulfilling the terms of both prophecies.
    10. What name does the revelator give to this mighty conflict? Verse
14, last part.
    11. What indicates that the whole world will become involved in the
final conflict? Jer. 25:26-29.
    12. How does the prophet describe the terrible slaughter of the final
battle? Verses 31-33.
    13. On whom will God's people depend in the trying times that are
soon to come? Joel 3:16.

Social and Religious Conditions in the Last Days
MEMORY VERSE: "As it was in, the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days
  of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
  in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the Flood came, and
  destroyed them all." Luke 17:26, 27.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 90-98, 156-165.

                         AS IN THE DAYS OF NOAH
    1. What warning does Jesus give those who live in the last days?
Matt. 24:37-39.
   NOTE.—"The same sins exist in our day which brought the wrath of God
upon the world in the days of Noah. Men and women now carry their eating
and drinking to gluttony and drunkenness. This prevailing sin, the indulgence
of perverted appetite, inflamed the passions of men in the days of Noah, and
led to general corruption, until their violence and crimes reached to heaven,
and God washed the earth of its moral pollution by a flood."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 3, p. 163.
   2. How does Moses describe the condition of the antediluvians?
Gen. 6:5, margin.
                                       [27]
    3. What is set forth as the prime cause of this terrible apostasy?
Verses 2, 4.
   NOTE.—" 'The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were Lair.'
The children of Seth, attracted by the beauty of the daughters of Cain's de-
scendants, displeased the Lord by intermarrying with them. Many of the
worshipers of God were beguiled into sin by the allurements that were now
constantly before them, and they lost their peculiar, holy character. Mingling
with the depraved, they became like them in spirit and in deeds; the restric-
tions of the seventh commandment were disregarded, 'and they took them
wives of all which they chose.' The children of Seth went 'in the way of Cain;'
they fixed their minds upon worldly prosperity and enjoyment, and neglected
the commandments of the Lord. . . . Sin spread abroad in the earth like a
deadly leprosy."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 81, 82.
    4. How did the Lord regard the sinful condition of the world? What
did He say He would do? Verses 6, 7.
    NOTE.—"God's repentance is not like man's repentance. 'The Strength of
Israel will not lie, nor repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent.'
Man's repentance implies a change of mind. God's repentance implies a change
of circumstances and relations. Man may change his relation to God by com-
plying with the conditions upon which he may be brought into the divine favor,
or he may, by his own action, place himself outside the favoring condition;
but the Lord is the same 'yesterday, and today, and forever.'"—Id., p. 630.
   5. How long did God wait before meting out punishment upon the
sinful race? Answer: 120 years. Why did He wait so long? 2 Peter 3:9.
   6. Why do men not now generally credit the story of the Flood?
Verses 3-6.
   7. Why need we not fear that God will ever again destroy the world
with a flood of water? What sign did He give to remind us of His
promise? Gen. 9:8-16.

                      AS SODOM AND GOMORRAH
    8. To what other people did Jesus compare those who would be
living in the last days? Luke 17:28-30.
    9. How is the sin of the Sodomites described? Gen. 13:13: Ezek.
16:49. 50.
    10. What terrible judgment fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah because
of their vileness? Gen. 19:24. 25.
    11. How did the Lord show mercy upon Lot and his family? Verses
15-17.
    12. How did Lot's wife show her lack of appreciation of God's mercy?
Where were her heart's affections? How only might she have been
saved? Verse 26.
    NOTE.—"If Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the angels'
warning. but had earnestly fled toward the mountains, without one word of
pleading or remonstrance his wife also would have made her escape. The in-
fluence of his example would have saved her from the sin that sealed her doom."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p 161.
                                    [28
   13. What are we admonished to remember? Luke 17:32.
   14. Why were not more of Lot's family saved from the destruction
which came upon Sodom? Gen. 19:12-14.
    NOTE.-"When Lot entered Sodom, he fully intended to keep himself free
from iniquity, and to command his household after him. But he signally failed.
The corrupting influences about him had an effect upon his own faith, and his
children's connection with the inhabitants of Sodom bound up his interest
in a measure with theirs. The result is before us. Many are still making a
similar mistake."-Id., p. 168.
    "There was a coming out, a decided separation from the wicked, an escape
for life. So it was in the days of Noah; so with Lot; so with the disciples prior
to the destruction of Jerusalem; and so it will be in the last days. Again the
voice of God is heard in a message of warning, bidding His people separate
themselves from the prevailing iniquity."-Id., p. 166.
                             IN THE LAST DAYS
    15. What does Paul say of the religious conditions that will prevail
in the last days? 2 Tim. 3:1-5.
    16. What must Christians do that they may be kept from the corrupt-
ing influences of these last days? Luke 21:34-36; 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.
    17.. On whose keeping power may we rely in the hour of temptation?
Rev. 3:10; 1 Cor. 10:13.
                            LESSON OUTLINE
    ["There are many who have not yet heard the testing truth for this time. There
are many with whom the Spirit of God is striving."
    "Let us begin to work for those who have not had the light. . . . When we keep
before our minds the urgency and importance of our work, the salvation of God
will be revealed in a remarkable manner."-"Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 97, 107.]

         morrah. Luke 17:28-30.
      2. The conditions of Sodom are described. Ezek. 16:49, 50.
      3. God's people are admonished to "remember Lot's wife." Luke 17:32.

                           Capital and Labor
MEMORY VERSE: "Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
  Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long
  patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stab-
  lish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh." James 5:7, 8.
STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 11-18, 90, 91.

           ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH IN THE LAST DAYS
    1. In what striking terms does James describe the vast accumulation
of riches in "the last days"? James 5:3, last part.

                         OPPRESSION OF THE POOR
    2. What is said of the method by which some of the vast fortunes
of the last days were to be secured? James 5:4.
    NOTE.—"The Scriptures describe the condition of the world just before
Christ's second coming. Of the men who by robbery and extortion are amassing
great riches, it is written: 'Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.' "
—"Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 13, 14.
   3. What warning does the Lord of hosts send to the rich men who
have oppressed the poor? Verses 1-3.
    4. How does the prophet Isaiah describe the trouble that will come
upon the wicked in the last days? Isa. 2:17-21.
    5.. While many are suffering for want of the common necessities of
life, how are the rich living? James 5:5, 6.
    NorE.—"By every species of oppression and extortion, men are piling up '
colossal fortunes, while the cries of starving humanity are coming up before
God. There are multitudes struggling with poverty, compelled to labor hard
for small wages, unable to secure the barest necessities of life."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 9, p. 90.
    6. What feelings will be generated by the poor toward the rich when
such conditions prevail? In what words does the Lord guard His chil-
dren from indulging in such feelings? Verses 7-9.
    NoTE.—That enmity between the rich and the poor is becoming more in-
tense as the years go by is generally recognized. In an editorial in Current
Opinion, some time ago, under the caption of "A Battle of Titans," the writer
says: "The greatest of all wars between organized labor and capital seems to
have begun. It is described as a 'fight to the finish,' but there is no such thing
as a fight to the finish between these two contestants; and if there were, the
world would swing back a thousand years. They have been waging such fights
for generations, and each side has continued to grow more and more titanic.
Organized labor in the United States was never as powerful as it is today, and
                                          30
organized capital never as gigantic. After this pending battle is fought out,
each will continue to grow in power; for the finish of one means the finish of
the other, and each side knows that."
   Recently this statement was made:
   "It is estimated that 22,000,000 persons in the United States are victims of
poverty ; that 50,000,000 are barely able to meet living expenses ; that 35,000,000
dwell in comfort ; that 10,000,000 are wealthy ; and that 2,000,000 live in luxury
and own about 50 per cent of the nation's wealth. This situation is big with
peril."—Roy F. Cottrell, in Signs of the Times.

                  COMFORT AND HOPE FOR THE POOR
    7. How do the Scriptures show the transitory character of the riches
of this world? Prov. 23:5.
   8. What admonition does Paul give to those who are rich? 1 Tim.
6:17-19.
   9. How does John speak of those who refuse to share their temporal
goods with the needy? 1 John 3:17, 18.
  10. What faithful record is kept of business fraud and social justice?
Amos 8:4-8.
     11. In the final judgment, who will be justified, and who will be
condemned? Matt. 25:31-46.
     NOTE.—"Those whom Christ commends in the judgment, may have known
little of theology, but they have cherished His principles. Through the influence
of the divine Spirit they have been a blessing to those about them. Even
among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit of kindness; before
the words of life had fallen upon their ears, they have befriended the mis-
sionaries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own lives. Among the
heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom the light is
never brought by human instrumentality, yet they will not perish. Though
ignorant of the written law of God, they haVe heard His voice speaking to them
in nature, and have done the things that the law required. Their works are
evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are recognized
as the children of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 638.
   12. What are some of the promises left on record for those who in
the last days are oppressed, needy, and discouraged? Isa. 33:15, 16:
41:17, 18.
   NOTE.—"Is holy living urged? This is the inspiring motive thereto: 'That,
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.' Titus 2:12, 13. Is
endurance under persecution and loss of goods enjoined? This is the language
of the exhortation: 'Cast not away therefore your confidence, which bath
great recompense of reward. . . . For yet a little while, and He that shall
come will come, and will not tarry.' Heb. 10:35-37. Is patience under trial
encouraged in the Christian? The admonition is: 'Be ye also patient; stablish
your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.' James 5:8."—"Ecce.
V enit," A. J. Gordon, pp. 8, 9.

                              LESSON OUTLINE
   ["These men [the wealthy] are in need of the gospel. They need to have their
eyes turned from the vanity of material things to behold the preciousness of the
enduring riches. They need to learn the joy of giving, the blessedness of being
coworkers with God."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 213.]

      3. A record kept. Amos 8:4-8.
      4. Those who minister to others in their need will receive commendation.
         Matt. 25:31-46.
      5. God comforts the needy by His promises. Isa. 41:17, 18.

  Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the Lord will be the
  hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel." Joel 3:16.
STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pp. 304, 305, 429-634; "Prophets and

    1. Among the many signs of His coming, what terrible disturbances
in the earth does Jesus mention? Luke 21:11.
    NOTE.—"An earthquake marked the hour when Christ laid down His life,
and another earthquake witnessed the moment when He took it up in triumph.
He who had vanquished death and the grave came forth from the tomb with
the tread of a conqueror, amid the reeling of the earth, the flashing of lightning,
and the roaring of thunder. When He shall come to the earth again, He will
shake 'not the earth only, but also heaven.' The earth shall reel to and fro like
a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage.' . . . But 'the Lord will be
the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.' "—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 780.
   2. What sign was to occur before the darkening of the sun and moon
and the falling of the stars? Rev. 6:12.
                                      [ 32 ]
   NOTE.—"In fulfillment of this prophecy there occurred, in the year 1755,
the most terrible earthquake that has ever been recorded. Though commonly
known as the earthquake of Lisbon, it extended to the greater part of Europe,
Africa, and America. It was felt in Greenland, in the West Indies, in the island
of Madeira, in Norway and Sweden, Great Britain and Ireland. It pervaded
an extent of not less than four million square miles. In Africa the shock was
almost as severe as in Europe. A great part of Algiers was destroyed; and a
short distance from Morocco, a village containing eight or ten thousand in-
habitants was swallowed up. A vast wave swept over the coast of Spain and
Africa, engulfing cities, and causing great destruction."—"The Great Contro-
versy," p. 304.
   "Among the earth movements which in historic times have affected the
kingdom of Portugal, that of November 1, 1755, takes first rank; as it does
also, in some respects, among all recorded earthquakes. . . . In six minutes
sixty thousand persons perished."—"Earthquakes," William H. Hobbs, pp.
142, 143.
    Another writer says: "Half the world felt the convulsion."
    3. What terrible earth convulsions will accompany the closing scenes
of earth's history? Rev. 16:17, 18.

forsook His law? Deut. 28:22-24, margin.
    5. What calamity came upon Israel in the days of Ahab because of
a national apostasy from Jehovah? 1 Kings 17:1; James 5:17, 18.
   NOTE.—"The prophet's words went into immediate effect. . . . After a
few months the earth, unrefreshed by dew or rain, became dry, and vegetation
withered. As time passed, streams that had never been known to fail, began
to decrease, and brooks began to dry up. . . . A year passes, and yet there is
no rain. The earth is parched as if with fire. The scorching heat of the sun
destroys what little vegetation has survived. Streams dry up, and lowing herds
and bleating flocks wander hither and thither in distress. Once-flourishing fields
have become like burning desert sands,—a desolate waste."—"Prophets and
Kings," pp. 123, 124.
    6. HOw does Joel describe the conditions that shall prevail just before
the coming of Christ? Joel 1:12, 15-18.
    NOTE.—"The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living. Rulers
and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and authority, thinking
men and women of all classes, have their attention fixed upon the events taking
place about us. They are watching the relations that exist among the nations.
They observe the intensity that is taking possession of every earthly element,
and they recognize that something great and decisive is about to take place,—
that the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.
    "The Bible, and the Bible only, gives a correct view of these things. Here
are revealed the great final scenes in the history of our world, events that
already are casting their shadows before, the sound of their approach causing
the earth to tremble, and men's hearts to fail them for fear."—Id., p. 537.
    7. How will the wicked inhabitants of the earth be affected by the
fourth plague to be poured out before the coming of the Lord? Rev.
16:8, 9.
                                       [38)
    8. What protection has God provided for the righteous at that time?
Ps. 91:5-11; 121:5-8; Isa. 49:10.
    NoTE.—"The precious Saviour will send help just when we need it. The
way to heaven is consecrated by His footprints. Every thorn that wounds our
feet has wounded His. Every cross that we are called to bear, He has borne
before us. The Lord permits conflicts, to prepare the soul for peace. The time
of trouble is a fearful ordeal for God's people; but it is the time for every true
believer to look up, and by faith he may see the bow of promise encircling
him."—"The Great Controversy," p. 633.
                       FAMINES AND PESTILENCES
    9. What calamities did the Lord say would come upon a nation that
would not hearken unto His words? Jer. 27:6-8.
    10. Besides earthquakes, what other disasters were to come upon
the world before the end? Matt. 24:7.
    NOTE.—"Today the signs of the times declare that we are standing on the
threshold of great and solemn events. Everything in our world is in agitation.
Before our eyes is fulfilling the Saviour's prophecy of the events to precede
His coming. . . . 'There shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,
in divers places.' "—"Propkets and Kings," pp. 536, 537.
    11. What spiritual famine is predicted for the last days? Amos 8:11, 12.
    12. When all apparent food supplies are cut off, what may those who
trust in the Lord say? Hab. 3:17-19.
    NoTE.—"That God who cared for Elijah, will not pass by one of His self-
sacrificing children. He who numbers the hairs of their head, will care for
them; and in time of famine they shall be satisfied. While the wicked are
dying from hunger and pestilence, angels will shield the righteous, and supply
their wants. To him that `walketh righteously' is the promise, 'Bread shall be
given him; his waters shall be sure.' When the poor and needy seek water,
and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them,
I the God of Israel will not forsake them.' "—"The Great Controversy," p. 629.
                                 LESSON OUTLINE
   [It is the duty and privilege of every believer to make known the truth concerning
these world conditions—their meaning in the light of prophecy.]

      3. Those who are loyal to God put their trust in Him. Hab. 3:17-19.
                                       [34 ]
