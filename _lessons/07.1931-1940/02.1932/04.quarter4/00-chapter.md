           "Our Father Which Art in Heaven"
                        A Father and His Child
   LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:9.
   MEMORY VERSE: "As many as received Him, to them gave He power to be-
come the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name." John 1:12.
   LESSON HELP: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 151-156.

                       INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    God delights to acknowledge us as His children. Gal. 4:4-7.
   "If you call God your Father, you acknowledge yourselves His children, to
be guided by His wisdom, and to be obedient in all things, knowing that His
love is changeless. You will accept His plan for your life. As children of God,
you will hold His honor, His character, His family, His work, as the objects of
your highest interest. It will be your joy to recognize and honor your relation
to your Father, and to every member of His family. You will rejoice to do any
act, however humble, that will tend to His glory, or to the well-being of your
kindred."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 156.
                               THE LESSON
                        PRIVILEGES OF SONSHIP
    1. What high privilege was given to Paul as a son of God? Acts 9:15.
    NoTE.—One of the first things a child receives is a name. It should be a
privilege to bear that name before the world. He should honor it and seek to
hold it above reproach. But the highest privilege accorded to us is to bear the
name of our heavenly Father. Do we prize it as we should?
    2. What does God promise in this life to those who accept Him? Mark
10 : 29, 30.
    NomE.—"In the secret place of prayer, where no eye but God's can see, no
ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most hidden desires and longings to
the Father of infinite pity; and in the hush and silence of the soul, that voice
which never fails to answer the cry of human need, will speak to our hearts."—
"Mount of Blessing," p. 126.
                                      [3)
    3. What does He promise for the hereafter? John 14:1-3.
    4. What example of parental love has God given us? John 3:16.
    NOTE.—"Day by day God labors for man's sanctification, and man is to co-
operate with Him, putting forth persevering efforts in the cultivation of right
habits. He is to add grace to grace; and as he thus works on the plan of addi-
tion, God works for him on the plan of multiplication.. Our Saviour is always
ready to hear and answer the prayer of the contrite heart, and grace and peace
are multiplied to His faithful ones. Gladly He grants them the blessings they
need in their struggle against the evils that beset them."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 532.
    5. What protection do we enjoy as a result of this unfathomable love?
Ps. 91:1, 4.
    NOTE.—Our loving Father would sooner send every angel of heaven to his
rescue than to see one of His children lost. Let us meditate on this love, and
surrender to its watchcare and protection.
    6. What interest does our heavenly Father have in providing for the
spiritual needs of His children? 2 Cor. 9:8.
    7. How does the Saviour illustrate the Father's care for the temporal
wants of His children? Matt. 6:25-33.
    8. What guidance-does our Father promise to us? John 16:13; Ps.32 :8.
    9. What inheritance is promised to the children of God? Rom. 8:17.
   10. What instruction in the way of life is provided? Prov. 6:23.
                     RESPONSIBILITIES OF SONSHIP
    11. What is our responsibility if we accept the name of Christ? 2 Tim.
2:19, last part.
    NOTE.—"Ever remember that the moral nature needs to be braced with
constant watchfulness and prayer."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 522.
    12. To what life of purity are the sons and daughters of God called?
1 Peter 1:13-16.
    NOTE.—"This Saviour, who prayed for those that felt no need of prayer,
and wept for those that felt no need of tears, is now before the throne, to receive
and present to His Father the petitions of those for whom He prayed on earth.
The example of Christ is for us to follow."—Id., p. 528.
    13. When we cannot understand our Father's dealings, what are we ad-
monished to do? Isa. 26:4.
    NOTE.—"The prayer of the humble suppliant He [Christ] presents as His
own desire in that soul's behalf. Every sincere prayer is heard in heaven. It
may not be fluently expressed; but if the heart is in it, it will ascend to the
sanctuary where Jesus ministers, and He will present it to the Father without
one awkward, stammering word, beautiful and fragrant with the incense of
His own perfection."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 667.
    14. If we maintain our confidence in God's leading unto the end, what
is our reward? Heb. 3:14.
    NoTE.—"The assurance is broad and unlimited, and He is faithful who has
promised. When we do not receive the very things we ask for, at the time we
                                       [4]
ask, we are still to believe that the Lord hears, and that He will answer our
prayers. We are so erring and shortsighted that we sometimes ask for things
that would not be a blessing to us, and our heavenly Father in love answers our
prayers by giving us that which will be for our highest good,—that which we
ourselves would desire if with vision divinely enlightened we could see all things
as they really are. When our prayers seem not be answered, we are to cling to
the promise; for the time of answering will surely come, and we shall receive
the blessing we need most. But to claim that prayer will always be answered in
the very way and for the particular thing that we desire, is presumption. God
is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from them that
walk uprightly. Then do not fear to trust Him, even though you do not see the
immediate answer to your prayers. Rely Upon His sure promise, 'Ask, and it
shall be given you.'"—"Steps to Christ," pp. 100, 101.
    15. In view of all that God has done for us, what should be our response
to Him? Luke 10:27.
    16. What does our heavenly Father have a right to expect of us of whom
He says, "Your labor is not in vain"? 1 Cor. 15:58.
    17. What will our desire to obey our Father lead us to do for our neigh-
bor? James 2:8.
                     ADDITIONAL TEXTS FOR STUDY
   The following texts bearing upon the relationship of the Father and His
children will bear prayerful study in connection with this lesson:
   A separate family. 2 Cor. 6:16-18. A perfect Elder Brother. Heb. 2:10.

  SUNDAY    I   MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY I FRIDAY              I SABBATH




                   "Hallowed Be Thy Name"
                        A Worshiper and His God
     LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:9.
     MEMORY VERSE: "I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it:
that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them." John 17:26.
     LESSON HELP: "Mount of Blessing," pp. 157, 158.

                         INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    Christ hallowed His Father's name when here on earth. John 17:6, 26.
    "You cannot hallow His name, you cannot represent Him to the world, un-
less in life and character you represent the very life and character of God. This
you can do only through the acceptance of the grace and righteousness of
Christ."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 158.
                                          5
                              THE LESSON
                 THE HERITAGE OF THE WORSHIPER
    1. Whose workmanship are we? Eph. 2:10.
    2. By what name are God's children called? Eph. 3:14, 15; Isa. 43:6, 7.
    NOTE.—It is God's desire that we cherish this highest of all privileges—
adoption into His family and the bearing of His name. Let us remember this
as we pray. "Jesus said, 'Ye shall ask in My name: and I say not unto you,
that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father Himself loveth you.' I have
chosen you . . . that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He
may give it you' But to pray in the name of Jesus is something more than a
mere mention of that name at the beginning and the ending of a prayer. It is
to pray in the mind and spirit of Jesus, while we believe His promises, rely
upon His grace, and work His works."—"Steps to Christ," p. 105.
    3. Having created us, what constant, sustaining watchc'are does He man-
ifest? Psalm 23.
    NOTB.—"Oh, how evident that there is no real strength but that which God
imparts to those who trust in Him ! One petition offered up to God in faith has
more power than a wealth of human intellect."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 279.
    4. What provision has God made for the wise guidance of His crea-
tures? Ex. 20:3-17.
    NOTE.—This law will be written in the hearts of His saints. Jer. 31:33.
    5. How are we provided with the power to keep the law of God? Gal.
2:20; Phil. 4:13.
    6. What protection does the Creator extend to His redeemed creatures?
Isa. 43:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Prayer moves the arm of Omnipotence. He who marshals the
stars in order in the heavens, whose word controls the waves of the great deep,
—the same infinite Creator will work in behalf of His people if they call upon
Him in faith."—Id., vol. 5, p. 453.
    7. What means of instruction does God use? Deut. 4:36; John 14:26.
    NOTE.—"The Lord specifies no conditions except that you hunger for His
mercy, desire His counsel, and long for His love. 'Ask.' The asking makes it
manifest that you realize your necessity; and if you ask in faith, you will re-
ceive. The Lord has pledged His word, and it cannot fail. If you come with
true contrition, you need not feel that you are presumptuous in asking for what
the Lord has promised."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 187.
    8. How are Christ's followers regarded by Him? John 15:15.
    NOTE.—"Pray much; for prayer is one of the most essential duties. With-
out it you cannot maintain a Christian walk. It elevates, strengthens, and en-
nobles; it is the soul talking with God."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 313.
    9. How does the Lord manifest His interest in those who bear His
name? 2 Chron. 16:9, first part.
    NoTE.—What a delightful picture ! He creates us and gives us His name !
He sustains, instructs, and protects His creation ! He formulates the wisest of
laws and gives power in His name to keep those laws. He delights to associate
with His people and is all the time thinking of, planning for, and opening up
                                     [6 ]
ways of growth for His loved ones. Who would not accept this privilege? But
wait That is but one side of the picture. What are we to do?
   "The prayer of faith is the great strength of the Christian, and will assuredly
prevail against Satan. This is why he insinuates that we have no need of
prayer. The name of Jesus, our Advocate, he detests ; and when we earnestly
come to Him for help, Satan's host is alarmed. It serves his purpose well if we
neglect the exercise of prayer, for then his lying wonders are more readily re-
ceived."—Id., vol. 1, p. 296.
                   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE WORKER
    10. What is our first responsibility to our Creator? Jer. 18:5, 6.
Answer.—To submit to His molding.
    11. In what honor should we hold the name of Christ? Ps. 99:3; John
5:22, 23.                  •
    12. Of what else is the Creator worthy? Ps. 96:8, 9.
    13. What is promised to the obedient? Isa. 1:19.
    NOTE.—"Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial
choir, God hears the cries of the weakest human being. We pour out our
heart's desire in our closets, we breathe a prayer as we walk by the way, and
our words reach the throne of the Monarch of the universe. They may be in-
audible to any human ear, but they cannot die away into silence, nor can they
be lost through the activities of business that are going on. Nothing can drown
the soul's desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the confusion of the
multitude, to the heavenly courts. It is God to whom we are speaking, and our
prayer is heard."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 174.
    14. Whose name are we to carry to the world? Matt. 28:19.
    15. What responsibility rests upon those who bear this name? 2 Thess.
1:11, 12.
                   "The dear Lord's best interpreters
                      Are humble human souls;
                    The gospel of a life like His
                      Is more than books or scrolls.

                   "From scheme and creed the light goes out ;
                      The saintly fact survives;
                    The blessed Master none can doubt
                      Revealed in holy lives."

   17. What exhortation is given to those who have fallen into sin? Isa.
1:16-18.
   18. By what do we have access to the grace of God? In what should we
then rejoice? Rom. 5:1, 2.
   19. What is God's plan for those who love His name? Ps. 69:35, 36.

                       "Thy Kingdom Come"
                        A Subject and His King
    LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:10.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Coun-
selor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Isa. 9:6.
                         INTRODUr:TORY THOUGHT
    Christ manifested the characteristics of a loyal subject, and because of this
God has exalted Him above every name. Phil. 2:5-10. The same experience is
open to the remnant church. Rev. 3:21. Christ is the perfect subject and be-
cause of His training as a subject, He is eligible as a perfect King. Heb. 2:10.
    A subject enjoys certain definite privileges given him by his king, but just
as definitely he assumes certain responsibilities. More and more as these lessons
are studied, the conviction will deepen that the Lord's Prayer is one of com-
plete surrender.
  " 'Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison
shall we compare it?' In earthly governments there was nothing that could
serve for a similitude. No civil society could afford Him a symbol. 'It is like
a grain of mustard seed,' He said, 'which, when it is sown upon the earth,
though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth, yet when it is sown,
groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great
branches ; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.' "
—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 76.
                                THE LESSON
             GOD'S RESPONSIBILITIES—OUR PRIVILEGES
    1. How extensive is the rulership of God? Ps. 103:19; Isa. 33:22.
    NoTE.—"Not by the decisions of courts or councils or legislative assemblies,
not by the patronage of worldly great men, is the kingdom of Christ estab-
lished, but by the implanting of Christ's nature in humanity through the work
of the Holy Spirit. [John 1:12, 13.1 Here is the only power than can work
the uplifting of mankind. And the human agency for the accomplishment of
this work is the teaching and practicing of the word of God."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 509.
    "Christ sought to teach the disciples the truth that in God's kingdom there
are no territorial lines, no caste, no aristocracy ; that they must go to all na-
tions, bearing to them the message of a Saviour's love. But not until later did
they realize in all its fullness that God 'bath made of one blood all nations of
men.' [Acts 17:26, 27.]"—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 20.
    2. What protection does our King offer His subjects? Isa. 41:10.
    3. When is the kingdom of glory set up? Matt. 25:31, 32.
                                        [ 8)
    NOTE.—"His kingdom will not come until the good tidings of. His grace have
been carried to all the earth. Hence, as we give ourselves to God, and win other
souls to Him, we hasten the coming of His kingdom. Only those who devote
themselves to His service, saying, 'Here am I; send me,' to open blind eyes, to
turn men 'from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that
they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
sanctified,'—they alone pray in sincerity, 'Thy kingdom come.' "—"Mount of
Blessing," p. 160.
    4. What is promised 10. the subjects of this kingdom? Heb. 8:10.
    5. To what end is the kingdom of God directed? Isa. 26:3, 4; John 14:27.
    NOTE.—"For all who are disheartened there is but one remedy,—faith,
prayer, and work."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 438.
    6. What means of support has this great spiritual kingdom? Lev. 27:
30-33; Ezek. 20:40; Ex. 34:26.
    NOTE.—No man can consistently pray "Thy kingdom come" who is at any
time complaining because of the calls for money with which to further the
kingdom. It took from one fourth to one third of the income of the people
of God anciently to support the temple and its services. (See "Testimonies,"
vol. 4, p. 467; "Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 527.) Should our proportion in
tithes and offerings be less as an average and we still feel clear of conscience in
praying, "Thy kingdom come"?
    Christ wishes to train us to sit with Him on His throne as joint heirs and
rulers. Are we seeking to receive all the privileges of the kingdom without as-
suming our share of the responsibilities?
                    RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SUBJECT
    7. What example of loyalty did Christ set for us? Luke 4:7, 8; John
17:6-8.
    8. As King, what does God have a right to expect of His subjects? What
does He promise to those who are obedient? 1 Samuel 15:22; Isa. 1:19, 20.
    NOTE.—"The strength acquired in prayer to God, united with individual
effort in training the mind to thoughtfulness and care taking, prepares the per-
son for daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances, how-
ever trying. The temptations to which we are daily exposed make prayer a
necessity. In order that we may be kept by the power of God through faith,
the desires of the mind should be continually ascending in silent prayer for help,
for light, for strength, for knowledge. But thought and prayer cannot take the
place of earnest, faithful improvement of the time. Work and prayer are both
required in perfecting Christian character."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 459.
    9. What is promised to those who endure tribulation? Rev. 2:10.
    10. What service does God expect of His servants? Rom. 12:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Unless we exert to the utmost the powers which He has given us,
we shall ever remain weak and inefficient. Much prayer, and the most vigorous
exercise of the mind, are necessary if we would be prepared to do the work
which God would intrust to us."—Id., vol. 4, p. 611.
    "The upbuilding of the kingdom of God is retarded or urged forward ac-
cording to the unfaithfulness or fidelity of human agencies. The work is hin-
dered by the failure of the human to cooperate with the divine. Men may pray,
`Thy kingdom come ; Thy will be done in earth as it is done in heaven ;' but
                                       [9I
if they fail of acting out this prayer in their lives, their petitions will be fruit-
less."—/d., vol. 6, pp. 437, 438.
     11. What does God expect us to become in'His service? 2 Cor. 5:18-20.
     NOTE.—"As believers in Christ we need greater faith. We need to be more
fervent in prayer. Many wonder why their prayers are so lifeless, their faith
so feeble and wavering, their Christian experience so dark and uncertain. 'Have
we not fasted,' they say, 'and walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?'
In the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah Christ has shown how this condition of
things may be changed. [Read verses 6, 7,] . . . This is the recipe that Christ
has prescribed for the faint-hearted, doubting, trembling soul. Let the sorrow-
ful ones, who walk mournfully before the Lord, arise and help some one who
needs help."—Id., vol. 6, p. 266.
     12. What responsibility do we have in supporting the kingdom of God?
Mal. 3:8, 9; Prov. 3:9, 10.
     NOTE.—"Many poor men who are now content to do nothing for the good
of their fellow men, and for the advancement of the cause of God, might do
much if they would. They are as accountable to God for their capital of phys-
ical strength as is the rich man for his capital of money."—Id., vol. 3, p. 400.
     "Constant, self-denying benevolence is God's remedy for the cankering sins
of selfishness and covetousness. God has arranged systematic benevolence to
sustain His cause and relieve the necessities of the suffering and needy. He has
ordained that giving should become a habit, that it may counteract the danger-
ous and deceitful sin of covetousness. Continual giving starves covetousness to
death. Systematic benevolence is designed in the order of God to tear away
treasures from the covetous as fast as they are gained, and to consecrate them
to the Lord, to whom they belong. This system is so arranged that men may
give something from their wages every day, and lay by for their Lord a portion
of the profits of every investment. .        . God knows our danger, and has
hedged us about with means to prevent our own ruin."—Id., vol. 3, p. 548.
     13. What admonition concerning mutual burden bearing does Paul give
the subjects of the kingdom? Gal. 6:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Let none who have pledged themselves by baptism to live for the
service and glory of God, take back their pledge. There is a world to be saved:
let this thought urge us on to greater sacrifices and more earnest labor for those
who are out of the way."—Id., vol. 9, p. 133.
     14. In what freedom are the subjects of God's kingdom to stand fast?
Gal. 5:1.
                          ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS
    Are you willing to enlist as a soldier of the cross, not for a position, but for
love of King and kingdom? Are you willing to go out as His ambassador?
Do you never, even in your heart, question the continued calls for means that
the "place of His habitation" may be enlarged? If so, then you can pray in all
sincerity, "Thy kingdom come."

    In our 10,512 Sabbath schools the world over, there are 409,516 members.
Of these, during one quarter, 42,618 had a perfect record in daily study of the

  "Thy Will Be Done in Earth, as It Is in Heaven"
                      A Servant and His Master
    LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:10.
     MEMORY VERSE: "Whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
all.". Mark 10:44.
                   INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    Christ took upon Himself the form of a servant and was the best servant
this world has ever seen. His Father loved Him, yet it pleased God to bruise
Him that He might bring redemption to us. This was entirely voluntary on
the part of Christ, and because of this God has highly exalted Him. Phil. 2:7-9.
During His last meeting with His disciples before the crucifixion, He invited
them to participate in the same complete surrender that they might know the
joys of real service. Study carefully the complete abandonment of self and
full surrender to another power. Consider well both the privileges that the
servant enjoys and his responsibilities to his Master.
                                THE LESSON
            RELATION OF THE MASTER TO THE SERVANT
      1. To what has God likened His kingdom? Matt. 25:14, 15.
      NoTE.—The Scriptures are specific in stating the fact that God recognizes
 the ability of each one. God demands the training of our mental faculties and
'the putting to a stretch of all our capabilities in His service.
      2. Who takes the responsibility for the proper execution of the work of
 the kingdom? Rom. 9:28.
      NOTE.—"Work in faith, and leave results with God. Pray in faith, and the
  mystery of His providence will bring its answer. At times it may seem that
  you cannot succeed. But work and believe, putting into your efforts faith,
 hope, and courage. After doing what you can, wait for the Lord, declaring His
  faithfulness, and He will bring His word to pass. Wait, not in fretful anxiety,
  but in undaunted faith and unshaken trust."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 245.
      The Lord is the master mind behind all. He may use us or lay us aside at
  His pleasure. Let us surrender to His marvelous plan, and we will one day re-
  joice with Him when we behold the intricate design the Spirit has wrought in
  each of our lives.
      3. Of what is the servant worthy? 1 Cor. 9:14; Matt. 20:4.
     4. What did Christ consider the greatest reward to the seventy as they
 returned? Luke 10:17-20.
     5. What does God, as master, supply to His servants? Phil. 4:19.
     NOTE.—"Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray,
 when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse,
                                   111 7
where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence? Without unceas-
ing prayer and diligent watching, we are in danger of growing careless and of
deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually to obstruct the
way to the mercy seat, that we may not by earnest supplication and faith ob-
tain grace and power to resist temptation."—"Steps to Christ," p. 99.
    6. What is the Master's relation toward His servants? Ps. 107:8.
    7. How strongly does God assure us of His care for our needs? Isa. 49:15.
    8. What discipline and training are necessary in order to become an
efficient servant? 1 Peter 1:7; Isa. 48:10.
    9. Though trial is necessary, what provision does the Master make for
the protection of His servants? 1 Cor. 10:13.
    NoTE.—Even in the valley of shadow we can count on the Sustaining hand
of God. Ps. 23:4. Men may threaten and persecute, but still the sustaining
grace of the Father is His gift to His children. Heb. 13:6. No matter what
may be our portion in life, we can say with the apostle, "I know whom I have
believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have com-
mitted unto Him against that day." 2 Tim. 1:12.

              RELATION OF THE SERVANT TO THE MASTER
    10. Since God is our Master, what relationship should we gladly sus-
tain to Him? Acts 20:19.                                       •
    NoTE.—"God's messengers must tarry long with Him, if they would have
success in their work."—"Gospel Workers," p. 255.
    11. What study should the servant give to his task that he may be ef-
ficient? 2 Tim. 2:15.
    12. What illustration does Christ use to show that God expects His
servants to be profitable to the kingdom? Matt. 25:19-23.
    13. What admonition does Paul give to servants concerning obedience?
Eph. 6:5-8.
     14. What is required of servants? 1 Cor. 4:1, 2.
    15. What is another essential qualification of servants? Phil. 4:11;
Heb. 13:5.
    NoTE.—"There are many who are not satisfied to serve God cheerfully in
the place that He has marked out for them, or to do uncomplainingly the work
that He has placed in their hands. It is right to be dissatisfied with the way in
 which we perform duty, but we are not to be dissatisfied with the duty itself
because we would rather do something else. In His providence God places be-
 fore human beings service that will be as medicine to their diseased minds. .
Thus He seeks to lead them to put aside the selfish preference, which, if grati-
 fied, would disqualify them for the work He has for them. If they accept and
 perform this service, their minds will be cured. If they refuse it, they will be
left at strife with themselves and others."—/d., p. 270.
     16. What kind of service does the Lord desire of His servants? Isa.
6:8; Col. 3:23.
     17. For what does God hold His servants responsible? Matt. 25:24-30.
                                      [ 12
    NoTE.—"It is not the length of time we labor, but our willingness and fidel-
ity in the work, that makes it acceptable to God. In all our service a full sur-
render of self is demanded. The smallest duty done in sincerity and self-for-
getfulness, is more pleasing to God than the greatest work when marred with
self-seeking."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 402.
    18. While many times the servant is obliged to walk in darkness, what
is the Master's counsel? Isa. 50:10.
    NOTE.—"From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have been preserved
through the interposition of the angels, we shall never know, until in the light
of eternity we see the providences of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 240.
                     "Build a little fence of trust
                         Around to-day;
                       Fill the space with loving work
                         And therein stay ;
                       Look not through the sheltering bars
                         Upon to-morrow;
                       God will help thee bear what comes
                         Of joy and sorrow."
   19. What must a true servant never attempt? Matt. 6:24.
   NOTE.—"We cannot serve God with a divided heart. Bible religion is riot
one influence among many others; its influence is to be supreme, pervading
and controlling every other. It is not to be like a dash of color brushed here
and there upon the canvas, but it is to pervade the whole life, as if the canvas
were dipped into the color, until every thread of the fabric were dyed a deep,
unfading hue."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 312.
                          ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS
    We all dislike a servant who tries to do the directing—feels the task as-
signed to him rightly belongs to another; who shirks and pleads for another
to do what he has been asked to do. We admire the servant who places his
shoulder to the wheel and pushes steadily ahead, knowing the Master will not
suffer him to sustain loss. Such a servant was Christ !
    Are you a profitable worker for the Lord? Have the talents He has loaned
you—time, health, mental faculties, strength, influence—brought in other
talents? Are you watching your Master's interests efficiently? Or would you
like to receive the remuneration of a servant and have the Master supply your
needs in the way of houses, food, clothing, and material with which to do
your own will?
                      "Just to ask Him what to do,
                         All the day.
                       And to make you quick and true
                         To obey."
                                    •

    Millions are begging for the bread of life in the truths of the message. Will
you help send it to them in. the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering? Help liberally

           "Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread"
                   A Suppliant and His Benefactor
    LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:11.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and
he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without
money and without price." Isa. 55:1.

                        INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    A suppliant is entirely dependent on some power outside of himself. So
Christ was dependent on His Father's watchcare and provident love. Not
alone did He receive material sustenance but spiritual nourishment as well.
    "Men are called upon to cooperate with God in the care of the grain and
the preparation of the loaf, and because of this they lose sight of the divine
agency. They do not give God the glory due unto His holy name. The work-
ing of His power is ascribed to natural causes or to human instrumentality.
Man is glorified in place of God, and His gracious gifts are perverted to self-
ish uses, and made a curse instead of a blessing. God is seeking to change all
this. He desires that our dull senses shall be quickened to discern His merciful
kindness and to glorify Him for the working of His power."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 367.
                                 THE LESSON
     RELATIONSHIP OF THE BENEFACTOR TO THE SUPPLIANT
     1. How is God's sympathy and interest in His children expressed? Ps.
103:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"All that man has, God has given him, and he who improves his
abilities 10.God's glory, will be an instrument to do good; but we can no more
live a religious life without constant prayer and the performance of religious
duties, than we can have physical strength without partaking of temporal food.
We must daily sit down at God's table. We must receive strength from the
Living Vine, if we are nourished."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 560.
     2. What is the cost to the suppliant of all God's benefits? Isa. 55:1.
    NOTE.—"Satan leads many to believe that prayer to God is useless, and but
a form. He well knows how needful are meditation and prayer, to keep Christ's
followers aroused to resist his cunning and deception."—Id., vol. 1, p. 295.
     3. How willing is God to give us all these benefits? Luke 11:13.
     NOTE.—"Brethren, I entreat you to move with an eye single to the glory
of God. Let His power be your dependence, His grace your strength.. . .
God is willing to do much for you, if you will only feel your need of Him.
Jesus loves you. Ever seek to walk in the light of God's wisdom; and through
all the changing scenes of life, do not rest unless you know that your will is in
harmony with the will of your Creator."—Id., vol. 4, p. 561.
                                       14 )
    4. What evidence have we that all these benefits were given to us volun-
tarily on God's part? Rom. 5:6, 8.
    5. How do we know that God has the ability to grant all our needs?
Ps. 24:1; Eph. 3:20.
    6. How abundantly are these benefits bestowed? Phil. 4:19.
    NOTE.—"If you have renounced self, and given yourself to Christ, you are
a member of the family of God, and everything in the Father's house is for
you. All the treasures of God are opened to you, both the world that now is,
and that which is to come. The ministry of angels, the gift of His Spirit, the.
labors of His servants,—all are for you. The world, with everything in it, is
yours so far as it can do you good. . . . But you are as a child who is not yet
placed in control of his inheritance. . . . Christ holds it for you, safe beyond
the spoiler's reach. Like the child, you shall receive day by day what is required
for the day's need."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 162.
              RELATION OF SUPPLIANT TO BENEFACTOR
     7. How dependent are we upon God's mercies? 1 Tim. 6:7; Job 1:21_
    NOTE.—"In teaching us to ask every day for what we need,—both tem-
poral and spiritual blessings,—God has a purpose to accomplish for our good.
He would have us realize our dependence upon His constant care; for He is
seeking to draw us into communion with Himself."—Id., p. 165.
    8. How only does man truly live? Luke 4:4. ,
     9. What should be our attitude toward our Benefactor? 1 Thess. 5:18.
    NOTE.—That God expects this appreciation of all His gifts is well illustrated
by Christ's account of the ten lepers who were cleansed. Luke 17:15-18.
    10. In what spirit should our supplication be made? Gen. 32 : 10.
    NoTE.—The same thought is expressed by Ruth in speaking to Boaz who is
a type of Christ. When he manifested interest in her, she exclaimed, "Why have
I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing
I am a stranger?" Ruth 2:10. Nothing was said of the hard times she had
passed through or the sacrifice she had made in leaving her country and kins-
people to come among a strange people. Let us think more of the grace of •
Christ, and far less of the past, for with us as with Ruth, the future will reveal
that we have made no sacrifice at all.
    11. Because of the great benefits extended to us in the sacrifice of
Christ, what are we urged to do? Rom. 6:13; 1 Peter 5:5, 6.
    NomE.—"Jesus, while He dwelt on earth, dignified life in all its details by
keeping before men the glory of God, and by subordinating everything to the
will of His Father. . . . God's everlasting arm encircles the soul that turns to
Him for aid, however feeble that soul may be. . . . The city of God will open
its golden gates to receive him who learned while on earth to lean on God for
guidance and wisdom, for comfort and hope, amid loss and affliction."—
"Mount of Blessing," p. 148.
    12. How persistent should the suppliant be in his endeavor to attain.
complete submission to the will of God? Isa. 55:6; Luke 11:8-10.
     NoTE.—Notice Elijah's persistence in praying for rain after the test on.
Mount Carmel. "The servant watched while Elijah prayed. Six times he re-
turned from the watch saying, 'There is nothing, no cloud, no sign of rain.'
                                        15
But the prophet did not give up in discouragement. • He kept reviewing his life,
to see where he had failed to honor God, he confessed his sins, and thus con-
tinued to afflict his soul before God, while watching for a token that his prayer
was answered. As he searched his heart, he seemed to be less and less, both in
his own estimation and in the sight of God. . . . While he clung to the Sav-
iour as his only strength and righteousness, the answer came."—Mrs. E. G.
White, in Review and Herald, May 26, 1891. "Had he given up in discourage-
ment, his prayer would not have been answered, but he persevered till the an-
swer came."—Id., June 9, 1891.
    13. How must the suppliant come to God? Heb. 11:6.
    Noms.—"In the parable [Luke 11:5-8] the petitioner was again and again
repulsed, but he did not relinquish his purpose. So our prayers do not always
seem to receive an immediate answer; but Christ teaches that we should not
cease to pray. Prayer is not to work any change in God; it is to bring us into
harmony with God. When we make request of Him, He may see that it is nec-
essary for us to search our hearts and repent of sin. Therefore He takes us
through test and trial, He brings us through humiliation, that we may see what
hinders the working of His Holy Spirit through us."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. 143.
    14. Even as Christ supplicated the throne of grace that through Him
others might be blessed, whom should we include in our prayer, "Give us this
day our daily bread"? Prov. 19:17.
    NOTE.—The parable of the unjust steward (Luke 16:1-8) should be read
in this connection. There must be no selfishness in our asking.
    "When we pray, 'Give us this day our daily bread,' we ask for others as
well as ourselves. And we acknowledge that what God gives us is not for our-
selves alone. God gives to us in trust, that we may feed the hungry."—"Mount
of Blessing," pp. 163, 164.
    15. How tactfully did the Syrophcenician woman answer Christ as He
tested her faith? Matt. 15:27.
    NoTE.—This woman made no comparisons of God's treatment of her with
that which He rendered to others. No national or racial prejudice or pride
influenced her. She yielded to His influence, and humbly, courteously, pleaded
her case. Let us stop measuring ourselves by ourselves and approach the throne
of grace as humbly as she did.
                        ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS
   Do you realize your utter dependence on God, or do you just say so out-
wardly while inwardly glorying in the fact that you are independent and are
"no subject of charity"?
   Of whom else should we think when we pray, "Give us this day our daily
bread"?

   "The Spirit of Christ is the spirit of missions, and the nearer we get to
Him the more intensely missionary we must become." That "nickel or more"
each Sabbath given in Christ's name is given to Him, and it will be laid up
for the giver in the bank of heaven.

"Forgive Us OurDebts, as WeForgiveOurDebtors"
                        A Sinner and His Saviour
    LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:12.
    MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I
have loved thee with an everlasting loVe: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn
thee." Jer. 31 :3.
                         INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    We are now entering upon the second phase of the Lord's Prayer. In the
first five lessons we have seen God as Father, Creator, King, Master, and Bene-
factor. From now on we see Him under the more sacrificial roles of Saviour,
Guide, and Deliverer.
    Because Christ took our sin, He can well show us how to pray this prayer,
for no one ever manifested such a forgiving spirit as He.
    "In their work the disciples would have to meet persecution through the
jealousy and hatred of the Jews; but this had been endured by their Master,
and they were not to flee from it. The first offers of mercy must be made to
the murderers of the Saviour."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 820.
    While Christ, through His infinite love, provided the way, yet His pardon
cannot be realized unless we manifest the spirit of forgiveness toward those
who have wronged us.
                                THE LESSON
             RELATION OF THE SAVIOUR TO THE SINNER
    1. How fully do the Scriptures indicate the eternity and supremacy of
God's love for fallen man? Jer. 31:3; Rom. 8:39.
    NOTE.—"Our Saviour is always ready to hear and answer the prayer of the
contrite heart, and grace and peace are multiplied to His faithful ones. Gladly
He grants them the blessings they need in their struggle against the evils that
beset them."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 532.
    2. What evidence do we have that Christ's love and sacrifice were alto-
gether voluntary? Rom. 5:8; John 10:17, 18.
    NOTE.—"But few will follow His example in earnest, frequent prayer to
God for strength to endure the trials of this life and perform its daily duties.
Christ is the captain of our salvation, and by His own sufferings and sacrifice
He has given an example to all His followers, that watchfulness and prayer,
and persevering effort, were necessary on their part if they would rightly rep-
resent the love which dwelt in His bosom for the fallen race."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 2, p. 664.
    3. When man sold himself and his possessions to the enemy, how much
did he receive in return? Isa. 52:3.
    4. What relationship must exist between the Redeemer and the one who
had sold himself or his possessions? Lev. 25:25, 47-49.
                                       ( 17 I
    NOTE.—The unfortunate man is entirely dependent on the mercy of the
kinsman-redeemer. He has no money. He cannot redeem himself.
     5. What relation did Christ assume that according to the law He might
be a Saviour and Redeemer to those who have sold themselves and their
possessions for naught? Gal. 4:4, 5; Phil. 2:7, 8.
    NOTE.—The incarnation was accomplished according to the laW of redemp-
tion. By this means Christ became our Elder Brother and by the law had the
 right to redeem. The whole book of Ruth is built around this central theme.
The character Boaz is the (Hebrew) "Goel" or "kinsman-redeemer." The
same word translated "kinsman" in Ruth 2:1 is translated "redeemer" in Psalm
19:14. It is a dual office. In order to be a redeemer he must be "nigh of kin."
Thus Boaz typifies Christ, and Ruth typifies the alien and stranger wholly de-
pendent on His benevolence.
    "The Elder Brother of our race is by the eternal throne. He looks upon
every soul who is turning his face.toward Him as the Saviour."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 329.
    6. By the very nature of the case, who must take the initial step? Rom.
5:6-10; 1 John 4:19.
    7. Who pays the price of reconciliation? 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 1:18, 19.
    8. Who provides the way for sinners' redemption? John 14:6; Acts 4:12.
    NOTE.—"Yes; Christ has become the medium of prayer between man and
God. He has also become the medium of blessing between God and man. He
has united divinity with humanity. Men are to cooperate with Him for the
salvation of their own souls, and then make earnest, persevering efforts to save
those who are ready to die."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 178.
    9. What was an essential part of Christ's sacrifice for sin? Answer.—
Suffering. 1 Peter 3:18; Heb. 2:18.
    10. Of what may we be assured concerning One who has thus suffered?
John 13:1.
    11. What power is given to the Redeemer? John 10:28, 29; Jude 24.
    12. Because He is all powerful, what will He do for us? Heb. 7:25;
1 John 1:9.
            RELATION OF THE SINNER TO THE SAVIOUR
   13. How utterly dependent are we upon this Kinsman-Redeemer? Acts
4:12; John 15:4, 5.
     14. Realizing our helplessness without Him, what strong appeal does
God make to us? Ezek. 33 : 11.
     15. What gracious promise does He give? Rev. 3:20.
     16. Before we can confess our sins, what sense of need must be born
in us? Luke 18:13; Isa. 6:5.
     NOTE.—"By faith and prayer all may meet the requirements of the gospel.
No man can be forced to transgress. His own consent must be first gained.
. . . 'The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto
their prayers.' Cry unto the Lord, tempted soul. Cast yourself, helpless, un-
worthy, upon Jesus, and claim this very promise. The Lord will hear."—
"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 177.
     17. How does justification came? Rom. 5:1, 2.
                                     [ 18
    NOTE.—The relationship of the sinner to the Saviour is well summed up
in the acrostic:
                            F-orsaking
                            A-11
                            I
                            T-ake
                            H-im
    "Take time to pray, and as you pray, believe that God hears you. Have
faith mixed with your prayers. You may not at all times feel the immediate
answer; but then it is that faith is tried. You are proved to see whether you
will trust in God, whether you have living, abiding faith. 'Faithful is He that
calleth you, who also will do it.' Walk the narrow plank of faith. Trust all
on the promises of the Lord. Trust God in darkness. That is the time to have
 faith."---"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 167.
     18. What attitude will this experience create in our hearts toward God?
Ps. 31:23, 24.
     19. What attitude will it create toward our fellows? 1 John 3:16; Eph.
4:32.
   NOTE.—"We ourselves owe everything to God's free grace. . . . Let this
grace be revealed to others.
    "Give the erring one no occasion for discouragement. Suffer not a Pharisai-
cal hardness to come in and hurt your brother. Let no bitter sneer rise in mind
or heart. Let no tinge of scorn be manifest in the voice. If you speak a word
of your own, if you take an attitude of indifference, or show suspicion or dis-
trust, if may prove the ruin of a soul. He needs a brother with the Elder
Brother's heart of sympathy to touch his heart of humanity. Let him feel the
strong clasp of a sympathizing hand, and hear the whisper, Let us pray. God
will give a rich experience to you both."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 250.
   20. What spirit will then pervade all our lives? 2 Cor. 9:15; 1 Cor.15 :57.

              "Lead Us Not Into Temptation"
                      The Pilgrim and His Guide
    LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:13.
    MEMORY VERSE: "I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them,
and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them and not forsake them."
Isa. 42:16.
                          INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
   Christ went all of the way as a. pilgrim. He took the pilgrim journey that
He might be our Guide. In His pilgrimage He became an example to us. Each
                                     [ 19 ]
new day's experience was opened to Him by the Father. As the Holy Spirit
led Christ on to the battlefield of life, so He permits .tests and obstacles to
come into our lives, yet He always provides needed strength for every emer-
gency. Wonderful opportunities open to us under the leadership of such a
Guide, but with the opportunities comes a very definite responsibility toward
the Guide.
                                THE LESSON
              RELATION OF THE GUIDE TO THE PILGRIM
    1. What qualification is of primary importance in. the Guide? Ps. 23:
2, 3; Isa. 42:16.
    NOTE.—We expect the guide to lead. How incensed we become if one of
the party tries to go ahead of the guide ! What foolish mistakes are made if
this is permitted! The Lord's Prayer is one of complete confidence. in our
heavenly Guide.
    2. With what is this heavenly Guide acquainted? Ps. 139:3; Heb. 4:15.
    NOTE.—Having gone the way before us, Christ is thoroughly informed con-
cerning every pitfall. "If we had to bear anything which Jesus did not endure,
then upon this point Satan would represent the power of God as insufficient
for us. Therefore Jesus was 'in all points tempted like as we are' He endured
every trial to which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf no
power that is not freely offered to us. As man, He met temptation, and over-
came in the strength given Him from God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 24.
    3. With what sympathy and tenderness does our heavenly Guide lead
us? Ps. 23:4; 86:15.
    NOTE.—"Daily beset by temptation, constantly opposed by the leaders of
the people, Christ knew that He must strengthen His humanity by prayer. In
order to be a blessing to men, He must commune with God, pleading for energy,
perseverance, and steadfastness. Thus He showed His disciples where His
strength lay. Without this daily communion with God, no human being can
gain power for service."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 323.
    "Christ clothed His divinity with humanity, and lived a life of prayer and
self-denial, and of daily battle with temptation, that He might help those who
to-day are assailed by temptation."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 279.
    4. How cautious is our Guide concerning the roughness of the road?
1 Cor. 10:13.
    NOTE.—Not having gone the way before, the pilgrim may at times feel dis-
couraged by the roughness of the way. But our Guide knows what He is
doing. Is not this the very kernel of this portion of the Lord's Prayer? Christ
is not to free us from all temptation, but we are to trust His wisdom to give
us only that which will make us the best instruments for His use.
    5. To all the sympathy and caution that a wise Saviour is capable of
giving, what other characteristic is added? Ps. 32:8; Prov. 2:6.
    NoTE.—Through wise instruction based on the laboratory method of let-
ting us work things out for ourselves, we are training constantly for the work
of serving as under guides. Each day's trial is but a lesson that will give us the
experience needed to qualify us for the arduous task of guiding others.
    "The very trials that task our faith most severely, and make it seem that
God has forsaken us, are to lead us closer to Christ, that we may lay all our
                                      120 1
burdens at His feet, and experience the peace which He will give us in ex-
change."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 129.
    6. Who is the specially qualified helper given to every pilgrim? What
is His mission? John 16:13.
    NOTE.—"The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without
this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had
been strengthening for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic cap-
tivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty
agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified
energy, but in the fullness of divine power."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 671.
   7. How dependable is our Guide? Heb. 13:5; Mal. 3:6.
  8. What will the life and conduct of our Guide inspire all who follow
Him to do? John 14:12; Phil. 4:13.
    9. What special light has the Guide supplied for His followers? Ps.
119 : 105.
    NOTE.—"The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy
Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those things easy to be
understood, or prevent us from wresting truths difficult of comprehension. It
is the office of heavenly angels to prepare the heart to so comprehend God's
word that we shall be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its warnings, or
animated. and strengthened by its promises. . . . Temptations often appear
irresistible because, through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the
tempted one cannot readily remember God's promises and meet Satan with
the Scripture weapons."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 599, 600.

             RELATION OF THE PILGRIM TO .THE GUIDE
    10. What is indicated to be one of the causes of Peter's denial of Christ?
Mark 14:54.
    NOTE.—Like all pilgrims, Peter found out through sad experience that
when the Guide is followed "afar off" it is easy to have the attention turned to
other things. Our Guide will not go too fast; it is our responsibility to follow
close up. It saves many a needless explanation and many misunderstandings.
    "All your good purposes and good intentions will not enable you to with-
stand the test of temptation. You must be men of prayer. Your petitions must
be, not faint, occasional, and fitful, but earnest, persevering, and constant. It
is not necessary to be alone, or to bow upon your knees, to pray; but in the
midst of your labor, your souls may be often uplifted to God, taking hold upon
His strength ; then you will be men of high and holy purpose, of noble integrity,
who will not for any consideration be swayed from truth, right, and justice."
—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 542, 543.
    11. What will the spiritual weapons of our warfare accomplish? 2 Cor.
10:5.
    NorE.—The pilgrim is.prone to imagine all kinds of difficulties, and to fear
that the guide will not lead him in the right way. He may complain and resist
the instruction of his leader.
   "The victory is not won without much earnest prayer, without the hum-
bling of self at every step. Our will is not to be forced into cooperation with
                                      ( 21 )
divine agencies, but it must be voluntarily submitted. . . . The will must be
placed on the side of God's will."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 204.
    12. How should the pilgrim relate himself to the Guide's instruction?
Ps. 95:7, 8; John 12:35.
    NOTE. "God permits trials to assail His people, that by their constancy
and obedience they themselves may be spiritually enriched, and that their ex-
ample may be a source of strength to others."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"p.129.
    13. In following his Guide, what responsibility did Paul feel for others?
1 Cor. 4:9.
    No'rE.—Pilgrims exert a great deal of influence over their fellows. The
joyous deportment of one is like leaven among the others. As we pray for
strength to submit to our Guide's leading, we are unconsciously asking for the
power of influence over others traveling the same way.
    14. What confidence must we manifest in our Guide? Job 23:10; 13:15.
    15. What counsel to endure is given us? 2 Tim. 2:3, 12; James 1:12.
    NOTE.—One of the chief traits in Christ's life was endurance. As subor-
dinate guides this characteristic must also be in our lives. "To stand in defense
of truth and righteousness when the majority forsake us, to fight the battles
of the Lord when champions are few,—this will be our test."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 5, p. 136.
       THOUGHTS FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY— RUTH'S PRAYER
    Study the plea of Ruth to her mother-in-law, Naomi, in Ruth 1:16, 17.
Ruth made a good pilgrim, and her Guide never failed her. Christ wants to
train me as a guide. Am I the kind of pilgrim that will one day be His ideal
guide? Not unless I can pray in full surrender, "Lead us not into temptation."

                 "But Deliver Us From Evil"
                   The Captive and His Deliverer
    LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:13.
   MEMORY VERSE: "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed." John 8:36.
                    INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    Most captives long to be freed from bondage, but our trouble seems to be
that we are content with our lot and do not care to be delivered. If we pray
this prayer earnestly, we shall manifest the proper characteristics of the cap-
tive whose very anxiety is his strongest plea.
    In connection with this lesson, review carefully the deliverance of the chil-
dren of Israel from being prisoners in the "house of bondage." See how many
of the characteristics of the Deliverer were manifested by God, and, how few
                                     122 }
of the characteristics of the captive were shown by Israel. This experience is
but a mirror of our deliverance from the house of spiritual bondage to-day.

                                THE LESSON
                 RELATION OF DELIVERER TO CAPTIVE
    1. What will be experienced by the prisoners of sin who give themselves
to Christ? Isa. 49:9; John 8:36.
    2. To what will the Deliverer direct the escaped prisoners? 2 Thess. 3:5.
    3. How fully is our Deliverer acquainted with the temptations from
which He is to deliver us? Heb. 2:18; 4:15.
    NOTE.—"Satan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus. The
Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did not present
to Him His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or tell Him of the
Father's acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that sin was so offensive to
God, that their separation was to be eternal. Christ felt the anguish which the
sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer plead for the guilty race."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 753.
    "Of the bitterness that falls to the lot of humanity, there was no part which
Christ did not taste. . . . If He had responded by an impatient word or look,
if He had conceded to His brothers by even one wrong act, He would have
failed of being a perfect example."—Id., p. 88.
    4. What was Christ willing to suffer that He might become our De-
liverer? 1 Peter 2:24.
    NOTE.—"Into the world where Satan claimed dominion God permitted His
Son to come a helpless babe, subject to the weakness of humanity. He per-
mitted Him to meet life's peril in common with every human soul, to fight the
battle as every child of humanity must fight it, at the risk of failure and eternal
loss."—Id., p. 49.
    "Christ suffered keenly under abuse and insult. At the hands of the beings
whom He had created, and for whom He was making an infinite sacrifice, He
received every indignity. And He suffered in proportion to the perfection of
His holiness and His hatred of sin. His trial by men who acted as fiends was
to Him a perpetual sacrifice."—Id., p. 700.
    5. How did Christ convince Peter that He was acquainted with Satan's
plan of action? Luke 22:31.
    NOTE.—Just as fully as Christ knew the trials and temptations that were to
come into the life of Peter, He knows the trials which we must meet. He can
and, will provide the power to enable us to come forth from these trials more
than conquerors if we will have it so.
    6. What assurance is given us that our Deliverer is stronger than the
enemy? 1 Thess. 1:10; 1 John 4:4.
    7. What did our Deliverer suffer that He might save us? Heb. 2:14, 15.
    8. When were the plans laid for, this deliverance from the pit of sin?
1 Peter 1:20, 21.
    9. How great was the love in the heart of the Deliverer to cause Him to
make such a sacrifice? Ps. 18:19; Jer. 31:3.
                                          23
                 RELATION OF CAPTIVE TO DELIVERER
      10. What illustration is used by Jeremiah to show the captive's sub-
  mission to his Deliverer? Jer. 18:6.
      11. Though unable to see the way out, what are we to do? Ps. 7:1, 2;
31:1, 2.
      12. What must the captive of sin realize in order that he may be de-
 livered? Rom. 7:24.
      NOTE.—"If Satan sees that he is in danger of losing one soul, he will exert
  himself to the utmost to keep that one. And when the individual is aroused to
 his danger, and, with distress and fervor, looks to Jesus for strength, Satan
  fears that he shall lose a captive, and he calls a reenforcement of his angels
  to hedge in the poor soul, and form a wall of darkness around him, that heav-
  en's light may not reach him. But if the one in danger perseverq, and in his
  helplessness casts himself upon the merits of the blood of Christ, our Saviour
  listens to the earnest prayer of faith, and sends a reenforcement of those angels
  that excel in strength to deliver him. . . . And when angels, all-powerful,
  clothed with the armory of heaven, come to the help of the fainting, pursued
  soul, Satan and his host fall back, well knowing that their battle is lost"—
 "Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 345, 346.
      13. What must the captive do? Ps. 91:15.
      14. As prisoners of hope, what fundamental trait of character will be
  developed? Ps. 40:1, 2; Luke 21:19.
      NOTE.—"After the prayer is made, if the answer is not realized imme-
  diately, do not weary of waiting, and become unstable. Waver not. Cling to
  the promise, 'Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.' Like the im-
  portunate widow, urge your case, being firm in your purpose. Is the object
  important and of great consequence to you? It certainly is. Then waver not;
  for your faith may be tried. If the thing you desire is valuable, it is worthy
  of a strong, earnest effort. You have the promise, watch and pray. Be stead-
  fast, and the prayer will be answered; for is it not God who has promised? If
  it costs you something to obtain it, you will prize it the more when obtained.
  You are plainly told that if you waver you need not think that you shall
  receive anything of the Lord. A caution is here given not to become weary,
  but to rest firmly upon the promise. If you ask, He will give you liberally, and
  upbraid not."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 131.
      15. What spirit must be in us if we are to be saved? Answer.—The spirit
  of sacrifice which actuated the Master. Rom. 12:1; 1 John 3:16.
       16. What part does hope play in the prisoner's life? Ps. 43:5; 71:14.
       17. What spirit of thankfulness should possess us? Ps. 50:14, 15.
                     THOUGHTS FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY.
      As we look at Christ's life and see how perfectly He fitted into man's place,
  we realize how He could fittingly instruct His disciples how to pray. May we
  understand the privileges that are ours, and may we also plead with God, to
t make us willing to accept the responsibilities that go with our privileges.

  "Thine Is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the
              Glory, Forever. Amen"
                          Reasons for Surrender
    LESSON TEXT: Matthew 6:13.
    MEMORY VERSE: "They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, and talk of
Thy power; to make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and the glorious maj-
esty of His kingdom." Ps. 145:11, 12.
                         INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    There are two kinds of prayer,—the prayer of surrender and the prayer of
intercession. In the preceding eight lessons the thought is developed that the
Lord's Prayer is a prayer of surrender. No mention of intercession is in it. We
are to surrender to God as a child surrenders to its father, as a creature to his
Creator, as a subject to his ruler, as a servant to his master, as a suppliant to
his benefactor, as a sinner to his Saviour, as a pilgrim to his guide, as a prisoner
to his deliverer. Each comparison has its own meaning. It takes all to describe
the full surrender God desires us to make to Him, not for His exaltation, but
for our welfare. Now He gives us the reasons for our complete surrender. This
experience becomes the gateway to a life that "measures with the life of God,"
to a prayer of intercession on behalf of thousands who do not know Christ
and His love. Will you surrender as Christ desires you to do, and enter into
this wider service?
                                 THE LESSON
                                THE KINGDOM
    1. To whom does the kingdom belong? Ps. 22:28.
    Norx.—That Satan should try by any of his plans to wrest the kingdom
from its rightful owner, brands him as a robber. The owner of this wonderful
kingdom not only offers to share it with us, but desires so to train us that we
may be corulers in the kingdom. Why does anyone resist and rebel?
    2. For how long is this kingdom to last? Ps. 145:13.
    3. What disposition will be made of all other kingdoms? Dan. 2:44.
    4. Upon what principle is this kingdom established? Rom. 14:17; Rev.
21:27.
    NOTE.—"Not by force of arms, not by violent interpositions, was the king-
dom of God to prevail, but by the implanting of a new principle in the hearts
of men. . . . Christ had come, not as a king, but as a sower; not for the over-
throw of kingdoms, but for the scattering of seed; not to point His followers
to earthly triumphs and national greatness, but to a harvest to be gathered
after patient toil, and through losses and disappointments."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," p. 35.
    5. What is expected of the saints of God? Ps. 145:12.
    NOTE.—Even in this life the saints are to make known the nature of the
                                       [ 25 ]
kingdom that is within. This can be done best by the transformation of life
that is seen by the world. Our lives are to be an inexplicable mystery to Satan,
who cannot understand the life of love 'and service that is made possible by the
indwelling Christ. If we will fully surrender, this majesty may be seen in our
lives in all its beauty as it was in the life of the Master.
    6. Who will compose, this kingdom? Rev. 21:7; Luke 13:29.
    7. To whom will God give His kingdom? Dan. 7:18, 27.
                                         .
    NOTE.-"In the kingdoms of the world, position meant self-aggrandize-
ment. The people were supposed to exist for the benefit of the ruling classes.
Influence, wealth, education, were so many means of gaining control of the
masses for the use of the leaders. The higher classes were to think, decide,
enjoy, and rule; the lower were to obey and serve. . . .
    "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different principles. He called men,
not to authority, but to service, the strong to bear the infirmities of the weak.
Power, position, talent, education, placed their possessor under the greater ob-
ligation to serve his fellows. To even the lowliest of Christ's disciples it is said,
Vill'things are for your sakes.'"-"The Desire of Ages," p. 550.
    8. What does the psalmist say of the scepter of God's kingdom? Ps. 45:6.
    9. What special responsibility will be given to the saints? 1 Cor. 6:2, 3.
                                  THE POWER
      10. Wherein is God's power revealed? Isa. 40:26; Matt. 28:18.
      11. How else does God manifest His power? 1 Peter 1:5.
      NOTE.-"Sweetly to us, as to the first disciples, comes the assurance that
God's kingdom ruleth over all. The program of coming events is in the hands
of our Maker. The. Majesty of heaven has the destiny of nations, as well as
the concerns of the church, in His own charge. . . . Those whom God em-
ploys as His messengers are not to feel that. His work is dependent upon them.
Finite beings are not left to carry this burden of responsibility."-"Mount of
Blessing," p. 175.
      12. What deliverance will God's omnipotence bring to His people?
ZTim. 4:18.
      13. For what purpose is power granted to the saints? Acts 1:8.
      NOTE.-"That we may unite with Christ in this work, we should place our-
selves under the 'molding influence of His Spirit. Through the power thus
imparted, we may cooperate with the Lord in the bonds of unity as laborers to-
gether with Him in the salvation of souls. To every one who offers himself to
the. Lord for service, withholding nothing, is given power for the attainment
of measureless results."-"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 30.
      14. From what does God's power finally ransom us? Ps. 49:15.
      15. In what further way is this power manifested? Rev. 7:16, 17.
                                 THE GLORY
      16. How enduring is, the glory of the Lord? Ps. 104:31.
      17. Witlywhat is the earth to be filled? Ps. 72:19.
      18. Of what does nature testify? Ps. 19:1.
      19. In whom is this glory to be revealed? Rom. 8:18; John 17:22.
 ',! '20: what should-be the theme of our .conversation? Ps. 145:11.

                       Hindrances to Prayer
    MEMORY VERSE: "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear
  e." Ps. 66:18.
                 INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    "Prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse." Sa-
tan knows he is helpless if we use the key. It is there for us, so his only hope is
to keep us from using it. In studying this lesson, let us become familiar with
his various inventions that we may not be denied the resources of Omnipotence.
                               THE LESSON
    1. What effect will idolatry have upon God's answers to our prayers?
Jet. 11:10, 11.
    NOTE.—"Man is forbidden to give to any other object the first place in his
affections or his service. Whatever we cherish that tends to lessen our love
for God or to interfere with the service due Him, of that do we make a god."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 305.
    2. What does the Lord say about the prayers of those who regard in-
iquity in the heart? Ps. 66:18.
    NOTE.—"These are perilous times for the church of God, and the greatest
danger now is that of self-deception. Individuals professing to believe the
truth are blind to their own danger and wrongs. They reach the standard of
piety which has been set up by their friends and themselves, they are fellow-
shiped by their brethren, and are satisfied, while they entirely fail to reach the
gospel standard set up by our divine Lord."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 214.
    3. What is God's charge against Israel concerning His love? Mal. 1:2,
first part.
    NOTE.—"To praise God in fullness and sincerity of heart is as much a duty
as is prayer. We are to show to the world and to all the heavenly intelligences
that we appreciate the wonderful love of God for fallen humanity, and that
we are expecting larger and yet larger blessings from His infinite fullness."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 299.
    Malachi gives a list of eight ways in which Israel failed to respond to the
wonderful manifestations of God's grace and love. As they are studied, it will
be seen that real prayer of surrender cannot be uttered while such feelings
exist in the heart. (See "Prophets and Kings," pp. 703-721.)
    4. What attitude had Israel taken toward God's name? Mal. 1:6.
    NOTE.—How may we despise His name? "You cannot hallow His name,
you cannot represent Him to the world, unless in life and character you repre-
sent the very life and character of God. This you can do only through the ac-
ceptance of the grace and righteousness of Christ."—"Mount of Blessing,"p. 158.
     5. What did Israel offer to the Lord? Verse 13.
                                       [271
   NOTE.—When we make self first in any way do we not bring a lame, sick
offering to Him who, setting aside every selfish desire, took upon Him the form
of a servant that He might redeem us? Let each one look within his own
heart and inquire what kind of offering he is bringing to God.
    6. What effect did Israel's envying the workers of iniquity have on the
Lord? Mal. 2:17.
    NOTE.—How difficult it must be for God to hear His children envying the
workers of iniquity ! Let us stop all this complaining against God because we
are not so well treated as we would desire or because we see others amassing
fortunes, or enjoying worldly pleasures. Why can we not leave these things
with God and be happy to serv.e Him in any capacity He desires?
    7. From what had Israel departed? Mal. 3:7.
    NOTE.—The Christian has various ordinances to-day which depict the
sacrifice and constant love of our Master. No one who fully grasps the signifi-
cance of these ordinances can absent himself from their celebration without
serious loss.
    8. In what way had they robbed God? Verse 8.
    NomE.—"Of all our income we should make the first appropriation to God.
In the system of beneficence enjoined upon the Jews they were required either
to bring to the Lord the first fruits of all His gifts, whether in the increase of
their flocks or herds, or in the produce of their fields, orchards, or vineyards,
or they were to redeem it by substituting an equivalent. How changed the
order of things in our day ! The Lord's requirements and claims if they receive
any attention are left till the last. Yet our work needs tenfold more means
now than was needed by the Jews."—"Testimiries," vol. 4, p. 474.
    "It is not God's purpose that Christians, Whose privileges far exceed those
of the Jewish nation, shall give less freely than they gave. . . . The liberality
required of the Hebrews was largely to benefit their own nation; to-day the
work of God extends over all the earth. . . . Surely our obligations are much
greater than were those of ancient Israel."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp.
337, 338.
    9. How had Israel criticized God's dealings? Verses 13, 14.
    Norm—Name five ways that you think could be called "speaking against
God." Take your illustrations from present-thy experiences. If you were
doing for mankind all that God is doing for you, how would you feel to have
those you loved malign your every motive? Much as you long to do so, you
cannot impart to them the help you desire to give so long as they feel that way.
Let us stop finding fault with God or His creatures.
    10. Who was not justified because of cherishing unworthy motives
while praying? Luke 18:11, 12.
    11. What does Christ mention as one of the hindrances to prevailing
prayer? Matt. 6:7.
    12. What does James say is necessary in prayer? James 1:6.
    NOTE.—"There is no danger that the Lord will neglect the prayers of His
people. The danger is that in temptation and trial they will become discour-
aged, and fail to persevere in prayer."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 175.
                                       28
                         ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS
    My prayer for myself cannot be answered-
   1. If there is any bitterness in my heart because of the great trials and
griefs that God allows to come to me.         •
    2. If I question God's leadership when trials and difficult problemspress
heavily upon me.
    3. If, because of efficiency in any line, I feel independent of God and His
power.
    4. If I look with scorn on those making mistakes in their Christian life.

  SUNDAY     MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY I SABBATH




                        Intercessory Prayer
    MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost
th'at come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them."
Heb. 7:25.
                        INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    After man has learned the prayer of surrender, the Bible dearly indicates
that there are heights beyond in his association with God that he has little
dreamed of. These mountain peaks of experience lie in the field of intercessory
prayer. The Lord's prayer of surrender becomes a kind of vestibule, as it were.
The main room where God wishes His children to live, is the glorious experience
of taking part with Christ in the work of intercession and redemption. Having
fully surrendered to God's plan for us, we are now in a position to be instru-
ments of righteousness in His hand to bring the glad tidings to others.
     "Make me an intercessor, teach me how to prevail,
      To stand my ground and still pray on though powers of hell assail.
      Make me an intercessor in Spirit touch with thee
      And given the heavenly vision, pray through to, victory.
      Make me an intercessor, till pleading at Thy throne
      The sins and sorrows of other lives become to me as my own."
                                THE LESSON
                                  ABRAHAM
   1. Why did God tell Abraham of His intentions toward Sodom? Gen.
18:17-19.
   NOTE.—As a father yearns to take his son into partnership with him, so
God seems to delight to associate with Himself those of His children who
can think His thoughts after Him, who can-enter into His plans, who can be
His lieutenants in the controversy with sin. What a perpetual joy it must be
to Him to see men and women steeped in sin, deliberately turn from it and
surrender to Him for warfare against it, because that is right. It is one of the
                                      ( 29 }
 greatest evidences He has to present before the universe, that man loves Him
 not for what He does for him, but for what He is.
       2. With what words did Abraham intercede for Sodom? Verses 23-25.
       NOTE.—Abraham did not present as a reason for his request any sacrifice
 of his or any act of obedience on His part. He interceded for Sodom because
 of God's justice and mercy. After surrendering our lives to Him, we may
 plead His great justice and mercy as we intercede for others.
       3. How many times did Abraham again intercede on behalf of Sodom?
 Verses 27-33.
      NOTE.—"Abraham asked not once merely, but many times. . . . His deep
 interest for Sodom shows the anxiety that we should feel for the impenitent.
 . . . All around us are souls going down to ruin as hopeless, as terrible, as that
 which befell Sodom. Every day the probation of some is closing. Every hour
 some are passing beyond the reach of mercy. And where are the voices of
 warning and entreaty to bid the sinner flee from this fearful doom? Where
are the hands stretched out to draw him back from death? Where are those
 who with humility and persevering faith are pleading with God for him?"—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 140.
                                      MOSES
       4. When the children of Israel reached Rephidim and found no water,
what did they do? Ex. 17:2, 3.
      5. Because of their murmuring, what did God permit to come? Verse 8.
      NOTE.—"Because of their murmuring against Him, the Lord suffered
them [the Israelites] to be attacked by their enemies."—Id., p. 298.
      6. What was the effect of Moses' intercession on behalf of Israel?
Verse 11.
      7. While Moses was interceding, what were Joshua and Israel doing?
Verse 13.
      NOTE.—"Divine strength is to be combined with human effort. Moses did
not believe that God would overcome their foes while Israel remained inac-
tive. While the great leader was pleading with the Lord, Joshua and his brave
followers were putting forth their utmost efforts to repulse the enemies of
Israel and of God."—Id., p. 299.
      8. When Israel fashioned the molten calf at Sinai, what did the Lord
say to Moses? Ex. 32:9, 10.
      NOTE.—"Moses discerned ground for hope where there appeared only dis-
couragement and wrath. The words of God, 'Let Me alone,' he understood
not to forbid but to encourage intercession, implying that nothing but the
prayers of Moses could save Israel, but that if thus entreated, God would spare
His people."—Id., p. 318.
      9. What was Moses' reply? Verses 11-13.
    10. When on the morrow Moses met God, how earnestly did he intercede
f or Israel? Verses 31, 32.
      NOTE.—"The prosperity of God's chosen people was dearer to him [Moses]
than personal honor, dearer than the privilege of becoming the father of a
mighty nation. God was pleased with his faithfulness, his simplicity of heart,
and his integrity, and He committed to him, as a faithful shepherd, the great
charge of leading Israel to the Promised Land."—Id., p. 319.
                                       [ 30]
                                    ELIJAH
      11. When, after three and a half years' drought, Elijah met Ahab,
 what did he say to the king? 1 Kings 18:18, 19.
      12. After the prophets of Baal had failed to bring down fire by their in-
  tercessions, with what words did Elijah intercede for Israel? Verses 36,37.
      13. When Elijah faced discouragement, how did God encourage him?
  1 Kings 19:18.
      NOTE.—"The apostasy prevailing to-day is similar to that which in the
  prophet's day overspread Israel. . . . Yet this apostasy, widespread as it has
  come to be, is not universal. Not all in the world are lawless and sinful; not
  all have taken sides with the enemy. God has many thousands who have not
  bowed the knee to Baal, many who long to understand more fully in regard
. to Christ and the law, many who are hoping against hope that Jesus will come
  soon to end the reign of sin and death. And there are many who have been
  worshiping Baal ignorantly, but with whom the Spirit of God is still striving.
  These need the personal help of those who have learned to know God and the
  power of His word."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 170, 171.
                        INTERCESSORS OF TO-DAY
     14. What evidence do we have that the faithfulness and, fidelity of
 Elijah will be seen before Christ comes? Mal. 4:5.
     15. How does Ezekiel describe the experience of the intercessors just
 before Christ comes? Ezek. 9:3, 4.
     NOTE.—"The crisis is fast approaching. The rapidly swelling figures (of
 those accepting the gospel] show that the time for God's visitation has about
 come. Although loath to punish, nevertheless He will punish, and that speedily.
 Those who walk in the light will see signs of the approaching peril; but they
 are not to sit in quiet, unconcerned expectancy of the ruin, comforting them-
 selves with the belief that God will shelter His people in the day of visitation.
 Far from it. They should realize that it is their duty to labor diligently to
 save others, looking with strong faith to God for help."—"Testimonies," vol.
5, p. 209.
     16. What does Joel say about the same experience? Joel 2:15-17.
     NoTE.—"Could the curtain be rolled back, could you discern the purposes
 of God and the judgments that are about to fall upon a doomed world, could
 you see your own attitude, you would fear and tremble for your own souls and
 for the souls of•your fellow men. Earnest prayers of heart-rending anguish
 would go up to heaven. You would weep between the porch and the altar,
 confessing your spiritual blindness and backsliding."—Id., vol. 6, p. 408.
                          ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS
     Meditations for those who would enter the larger room of intercession:
     1. Do the hard places in which I am placed make me pity myself?
     2. Do "triumph and disaster" have the same effect,—lead me closer to Christ?
     3. When forgotten, neglected, or purposely set aside, do I smilingly con-
 tinue life's duties?
     4. While trying to pray, have I found my cherished bitterness toward an-
 other making real prayer impossible?
     5. Do I justify myself when sinning occasionally by saying that others
 sin also?
     6. Do I feel at times that my friend's sin is no responsibility of mine?

             Intercessory Prayer (Concluded)
    MEMORY VERSE: "Now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
and I come to Thee. Holy Father, keep through Thine own name those whom Thou
bast given Me, that they may be one, as we are." John 17:11.

                        INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    "The Redeemer of the world did not consult His own pleasure, but went
about doing good. He bound Himself closely to the Father, that He might
bring their united strength to bear upon the souls of men to save them from
eternal ruin. In like manner should His servants cultivate spirituality if they
expect to succeed in their work. Jesus pitied poor sinners so much that He
left the courts of heaven, and laid aside the robes of royalty, humiliating Him-
self to humanity, that He might become acquainted with the needs of man
and help' him to rise above the degradation of the fall. When He has given to
man such unquestionable evidence of His love and tenderest sympathy, how
important that His representatives should imitate His example in coming
close to their fellow men, and helping them to form a true Christian charac-
ter."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 268.
                               THE LESSON
                                      JOB
    1. With what words before the assembled representatives of the uni-
verse had Satan taunted God concerning Job? Job 1:10, 11.
    NOTE.—"It was generally believed by the Jews that sin is punished in this
life. Every affliction was regarded as the penalty of some wrong-doing, either
of the sufferer himself or of his parents. It is true that all suffering results
from the transgression of God's law, but this truth had become perverted.
Satan, the author of sin and all its results, had led men to look upon disease
and death as proceeding from God,—as punishment arbitrarily inflicted on ac-
count of sin. Hence one upon whom some great affliction or calamity had fal-
len, had the additional burden of being regarded as a great sinner. Thus the
way was prepared for the Jews to reject Jesus. He who `hath borne our griefs
and carried our sorrows,' was looked upon by the Jews as 'stricken, smitten of
God, and afflicted;' and they hid their faces from Him. aod had given a lesson
designed to prevent this. The history of Job had shown that suffering is in-
flicted by Satan, and is overruled by God for purposes of mercy. But Israel
did not understand the lesson. The same error for which God had reproved
the friends of Job was repeated by the Jews in their rejection of Christ."—
"The Desire of Ages," pp. 470, 471.
    From the foregoing, the history of Job is to be interpreted in the experience
of Christ. As Christ's experience is to be ours, the Book of Job should con-
tain present-day help in preparation for the great crisis when God permits
Satan to tempt the remnant.
    2. What is shown concerning Job's reaction to serious personal loss and
cruel tauntings? Job 13:15; 23:10.
                                     [32 )
                    "What matter if the clouds hang low?
                     What matter if the bleak winds blow?
                     What matter if I may not know
                     The reason why these things are so?
                          God reigns! I will be true."
   3. Because of his faith and trust in God in the hour of trial, what bless-
ing came to Job as he entered the experience of intercessory prayer for
those who had wrongly accused him? Job 42:10.
                                      DANIEL
    4. What did Daniel give as his reason for approaching God concerning
Israel? Dan. 9:2, 3.
    NoTE.—"Daniel searched the portion of the Old Testament which he had at
his command, and made the word of God his highest instructor. At the same
time he improved the opportunities that were given him to become intelligent
in all lines of learning. . . . Students that exalt the sciences above the God of
science, will be ignorant when they think themselves very wise. If you cannot
afford time to pray, cannot give time for communion with God, for self-exam-
ination, and do not appreciate that wisdom which comes alone from God, all
y9ur learning will be deficient, and your schools and colleges will be found
wanting."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education," p. 358.
    5. As an intercessor, how did he identify himself with the people?
Verses 5, 6.
    NOTE.—"With faith founded on the sure word of prophecy, Daniel pleaded
with the Lord for the speedy fulfillment of these promises. He pleaded for the
honor of God to be preserved. In his petition he identified himself fully with
those who had fallen short of the divine purpose, confessing their sins as his
own."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 554, 555.
    6. In asking for forgiveness, what did Daniel acknowledge? Verse 14.
                                  CHRIST
    7. How did Christ show that in interceding for Peter He had already
anticipated his needs? Luke 22:31, 32.
    8. By what reply did Peter show that he failed to sense his need?
Verse 33.
    NOTE.—"The great reason why so many professed disciples of Christ fall
into grievous temptation and make work for repentance, is that they are de-
ficient in a knowledge of themselves. Here is where Peter was so thoroughly
sifted by the enemy. Here is where thousands will make shipwreck of faith.
You do not take your wrongs and errors to heart, and afflict your souls over
them. I entreat you to purify your souls by obeying the truth. Connect your-
selves with heaven. And may the Lord save you from self-deception."--"Tes-
timonies," vol. 4, p. 246.
    9. For whose sake did Christ, the great Intercessor, sanctify Himself?
John 17:19.
    NOTE.—"He it was who made supplication with strong crying and tears.
He prayed not for Himself, but for those whom He came to save. As He be-
came a suppliant, seeking at the hand of His Father fresh supplies of strength,
and coming forth refreshed and invigorated as man's substitute, He identified
                                     ( 33 )
Himself with suffering humanity, and gave them an example of the necessity
of prayer."—Id., vol. 4, p. 528.
     10. In exchange for our sin, what does our great Intercessor give us?
Verse 22; 2 Cor. 5:21.
    11. How efficient is this work of intercession on Christ's part? Heb. 7:25.
    NOTE.—"God's appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit.
The throne of grace is itself the highest attraction, because occupied by One
who permits us to call Him Father. But God did not deem the principle of
salvation complete while invested only with His own love. By His appoint-
ment He has placed at His altar an Advocate clothed with our nature. As our
intercessor, His office work is to introduce us to God as His sons and daugh-
ters. Christ intercedes in behalf of those who have received Him. To them
He gives power, by virtue of His own merits, to become members of the royal
family, children of the heavenly King."—Id., vol. 6, pp. 363, 364.
    12. As our intercessor, what rebuke is administered to the adversary?
Zech. 3:2-4.
    NOTE.—"In a vision given in 1880 I asked, 'Where is the security for the
people of God in these days of peril?' The answer was, 'Jesus maketh inter-
cession for His people, though Satan standeth at His right hand to resist Him.'
`And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, 0 Satan; even the Lord
that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the
fire?' As man's Intercessor and Advocate, Jesus will lead all who are willing to
be led, saying, 'Follow Me upward, step by step, where the clear light of the
Sun of Righteousness shines.'"—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 465.
                                HOLY SPIRIT
      13. What part does the Holy Spirit act in intercession for the church?
Rom. 8:26.
      14. In harmony with whose will does the Spirit make intercession?
Verse 27.
     NOTE.—"Let us rejoice in this, that we are called into the fellowship of the
Son of God in prayer. Three partners form this partnership. There is Christ,
the living Intercessor on the throne, pleading for the church and world, His
sacrifice on Calvary, with all its power to save to the uttermost, and lead to
victory. In our hearts the Holy Spirit makes effectually operative His death.
. . . The believer, indwelt by the Spirit, and in touch with the throne, proves
the completeness of what has been won for him, as he goes forth to witness for
Christ and win men to Him. Oh let us pray !"—"Effectual Fervent Prayer,"
Gordon Watt, pp. 40, 41.
     15. What did Paul say of the intense desire he had for his former
Israelitish brethren? Rom. 9 :3.
                 MEDITATIONS FOR THE INTERCESSOR
   1. Can the stamp of the Master's approval be placed on my conversation?
   2. When I see others exalted who I think do not have capabilities equal to
mine, am I envious?
   3. Do I prove by my life that it is too great sacrifice to yield all to Christ?
   4. Do I always speak well of those who speak evil of me?
   5.. Do I talk to the sinner about his sin--or to my neighbor?
                                     [34 )

            Hindrances to Intercessory Prayer
   MEMORY VERSE: "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
consume it upon your lusts." James 4:3.
                        INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
    Prayer is necessary for our own life, and Satan does all in his power to make
it of no avail. But doubly necessary is prayer for the intercessory life. In les-
son ten we studied some of the hindrances Satan places before us to' make
prayer ineffectual in our own lives. Now let us see what hindrances he brings
to intercessory prayer, first in our own personal experience and then in the ex-
perience of those for whom we would work.
    "Prayer is neither a sentiment nor a theory: it is a working instrument
which is to do certain things in behalf of righteous causes and in opposition to
evil."—"Effectual Fervent Prayer," Gordon Watt, p. 54.
                               THE LESSON
    1. Because Israel displayed before the nations their idolatrous dis- .
loyalty to God, what did He say concerning their prayers? Ezek. 8:15-18.
    NOTE.—Idolatry is permitting any other person or thing to take the place .
of God in our affections. There may be idolatry within the life and also out-
side. The idolatry within is well described by the Sermon on the Mount. (Matt.
5-7.) But there is an idolatry lived out before the world in a multitude of
ways that most effectually blocks any prayer of intercession. If those for whom
we are working and praying see any manifestation of idolatry in our lives, a
formidable and impassable barrier is immediately erected. How can God
answer our petitions under these circumstances?
    2. What reason does James give why prayer is not heard? James 4:3-5.
    NOTE.—Nowhere do we find Jesus praying in order that He might con-
sume the blessings on Himself. "Through continual communion He received
life from God, that He might impart life to the world. His experience is to be
ours."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 363. Let us pray not for easier lives but to be
stronger men. Quietly analyze your prayers of yesterday and see if this thought
finds expression anywhere.
    3. What definite characteristic should be in the prayer life of every
intercessor? Eph. 6:18.
    NoTE.—"By the grace of Christ the apostles were made what they were.
It was sincere devotion and humble, earnest prayer that brought them into ,
close communion with Him. They sat together with Him in heavenly places.
They realized the greatness of their debt to Him. By earnest, persevering
prayer they obtained the endowment of the Holy Spirit, and then they went
forth, weighted with the burden of saving souls, filled with zeal to extend the
triumphs of the cross."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 32.
    One of the great reasons for lack of spirituality in the church is that the
restlessness of the age has kept us from sincere, persevering effort for others.
                                      (35 1
   It is but one of the many hindrances Satan places before us. It can be overcome
   by patient continuance in prayer.
        4. What does Peter say may hinder the effectiveness of prayer in the
   life? 1 Peter 3:7.
        NOTE.—"To a large degree the happiness of men and women and the suc-
   cess of the church depend upon home influence. Eternal interests are involved
   in the proper discharge of the everyday .duties of life. The world is not so
  much in need of great minds, as of good men, who are a blessing in their homes."
   —"Gospel Workers," p. 204.
        5. What reason did Jesus give for the disciples' prayers not being
   heard? Matt. 17:18-21.
        NOTE.—"The selection of the three disciples to accompany Jesus to the
   mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. Instead of strengthening their
   faith by prayer and meditation on the words of Christ, they had been dwelling
  on their discouragements and personal grievances. In this state of darkness
  they had undertaken the conflict with Satan. In order to succeed in such a
  conflict they must come to the work in a different spirit. Their faith must be
  strengthened by fervent prayer and fasting, and humiliation of heart. They
  must be emptied of self, and be filled with the Spirit and power of God. Ear-
  nest, persevering supplication to God in faith,—faith that leads to entire de-
  pendence upon God, and unreserved consecration to His work,—can alone
  avail to bring men the Holy Spirit's aid in the battle against principalities and
  powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and wicked spirits in high
  places."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 430.
        6. How will the spirit of self-exaltation affect one's prayers? Luke
  18:11-14.
       NOTE.—"He who feels whole, who thinks that he is reasonably good, and
  is contented with his condition, does not seek to become a partaker of the grace
  and righteousness of Christ. Pride feels no need, and so it closes the heart
  against Christ and the infinite blessings He came to give. There is no room for
  Jesus in the heart of such a person. Those who are rich and honorable in their
  own eyes do not ask in faith, and receive the blessing of God. They feel that
  they are full, therefore they go away empty."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 19.
        7. What spirit possessed the brother when the prodigal returned home?
  Luke 15:29, 30.
       8. That our prayers be not hindered, what should ever characterize our
  dealings with °tilers, both within and without the church? Rom. 12:17;
  1 Peter 2:12.
       NorE.—"Belief in the near coming of the Son of man in the clouds of
  heaven will not cause the true Christian to become neglectful and careless of
  the ordinary business of life. . . . I have been shown that here is where many
  will fail to bear the test. They develop their true character in the management
  of temporal concerns. They manifest unfaithfulness, scheming, dishonesty, in
' dealing with their fellow men. They do not consider that their hold upon the
  future, immortal life depends upon how they conduct themselves in the con-
  cerns of this life, and that the strictest integrity is indispensable to the forma-
  tion of a righteous character. Dishonesty is practiced all through our ranks,
  and this is the cause of lukewarmness on the part of many who profess to be-
  lieve the truth. They are not connected with Christ, and are deceiving their
  own souls."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, pp. 309, 310.
                                         36
    9. What obstacle lay in the way of Jeremiah's interceding for Israel?
Jer. 14:10-12.
     NOTE.—"Many who profess the faith know not what true conversion is.
They have no experience in communion with the Father through Jesus Christ,
and have never felt the power of divine grace to sanctify the heart. Praying
and sinning, sinning and praying, their lives are full of malice, deceit, envy,
jealousy, and self-love. The prayers of this class are an abomination to God."
—Id., p. 534.
     10. What caused•Daniel to wait three weeks for the answer to his prayer
for Israel? Dan. 10:12, 13.
     11. If backsliding Israel had returned to the Lord and then interces-
sion had been made for the nations round, what would have taken place?
Jer. 3:12, 13, 17.
    NoTE.—Nothing so hinders intercession as a backslidden condition on the
part of the church. "The Lord does not now work to bring many souls into the
truth, because of the church members who have never been converted, and
those who were ,once converted but who have backslidden. What influence
would these unconsecrated membeis have on new converts? Would they not
make of no effect the God-given message which His people are to bear?"—
Id., vol. 6, p. 371.
     12. What is Satan's master stroke in hindeting devotion and interces-
sion in.this last generation? Rev. 3:15, 16.
     NOTE.—"The figure of spewing out of His mouth means that He cannot
offer up your prayers or your expressions of love to God. He cannot indorse
your teaching of His word or your spiritual work in any wise. He cannot
present your religious exercises with the request that grace be given you."—
 Id. p. 408.
     13. What is Christ's counsel to the Laodiceans as a church of inter-
 cessors? Rev. 3:18.
     NOTE.—"Have you so deep an appreciation of the sacrifice made on Cal-
 vary that you are willing to make every other interest subordinate to the work
 of saving souls? The same intensity of desire to save sinners that marked the
 life of the Saviour marks the life of His true follower. The Christian has no
 desire to live for self. He delights to consecrate all that he has and is to the
 Master's service. He is moved by an inexpressible desire to win souls to Christ."
 —Id., vol. 7, p. 10.
                          ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS
    My prayers for others may be hindered-
    1. If my heart is not torn and bruised at the transgression of men because
of their refusal to follow Christ.
    2. If in dealing with others I show "respect of persons."
    3. If my life shows others that I am content with the approval of man who
 gooketh on the outward adornment."

                        Constraints to Prayer
    MEMORY VERSE: "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for an-
other, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
much." James 5:16.
                         INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT
   "The idea that prayer is not essential is one of Satan's most successful de-
vices to ruin souls. Prayer is communion with God, the fountain of wisdom,
the source of strength, and peace, and happiness. Jesus prayed to the Father
`with strong crying and tears.' Paul exhorts believers to 'pray without ceas-
ing,' in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, making
known their requests to God. 'Pray one for another,' James says. 'The effec-
tual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.' Heb. 5:7 ; 1 Thess. 5:17;
James .5:16."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 42.

                                   THE LESSON
    1. What gracious invitation does God extend to His children? Matt.
11:28-30.
    NOTE.—"If we keep the Lord ever before us, allowing our hearts to go out
in thanksgiving and praise to Him, we shall have a continual freshness in our
religious life. Our prayers will take the form of a conversation with God, as
we would talk with a friend. He will speak His mysteries to us personally.
Often there will come to us a sweet, joyful sense of the presence of Jesus.
Often our hearts will burn within us as He draws nigh to commune with us as
He did with Enoch. When this is in truth the experience of the Christian, there
is seen in his life a simplicity, a humility, meekness, and lowliness of heart, that
show to all with whom he associates that he has been with Jesus and learned
of Him."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 129, 130.
    2. What supreme gift is freely promised to all who make request?
Luke 11:13.
    NOTE.—"We must not only pray in Christ's name, but by the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said that the Spirit
`maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.' Such
prayer God delights to answer. When with earnestness and intensity we breathe
a prayer in the name of Christ, there is in that very intensity a pledge from
God that He is about to answer our prayer 'exceeding abundantly above all that
we ask or think.' "—Id., p. 147.
    3. What did David combine with prayer? Ps. 143:5-8.
    NOTE.—"While we are to labor earnestly for the salvation of the lost, we
must also take time for meditation, for prayer, and for the study of the word
of God. Only the work accomplished with much prayer, and sanctified by the
merit of Christ, will in the end prove to have been efficient for good."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 362.
                                        [ 38 ]
     4. For what did David cry to the Lord? Ps. 86:11; 119:169.
     NOTE.—"Every promise in the word of God furnishes us with subject
matter for prayer, presenting the pledged word of Jehovah as our assurance.
Whatever spiritual blessing we need, it is our privilege to claim through Jesus.
We may tell the Lord, with the simplicity of a child, exactly what we need."—
"Mount of Blessing," p. 190.
     5. In what words did David express his faith in God? Ps. 86:5-10.
     NOTE.—"The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual
Christian, are not those that are gained by talent or education, by wealth, or
the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience
chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty
arm of power."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 203.
     6. In what manifestations of power will God answer the prayers of His
saints? Ps. 65:4, 5.
     NOTE.—"While engaged in our daily work, we should lift the soul to heaven
in prayer. These silent petitions rise like incense before the throne of grace;
and the enemy is baffled. The Christian whose heart is thus stayed upon God
cannot be overcome. No evil arts can destroy his peace. All the promises of
God's word, all the power of divine grace, all the resources of Jehovah, are
pledged to secure his deliverance. It was thus that Enoch walked with God.
And God was with him, a present help in every time of need."—"Gospel Work-
ers," p. 254.
     7. When assailed by discouragement, in whom should we hope? Ps. 42:
4, 5.
     NOTE.—"Oh, how evident that there is no real strength but that which God
imparts to those who trust in Him l One petition offered up to God in faith has
more power than a wealth of human intellect."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 279.
     8. What comes to the petitioner as a result of prayer? Phil. 4:6, 7.
     9. What is said of the prayer of those who abide in Christ? John 15:4-10.
    10. What evidence is there that prayer brings results? Ps. 107:6, 7;
34:4; 50:15; Joel 2:32:
     11. What did Paul say about prayer and boldness of spirit? Eph. 6:
18, 19.
     12. To what does the revelator liken prayer? Rev. 5:8.
     13. What marvelous transformation may be wrought through prayer?
 Ps. 40:1-5.
     NOTE.—"Those who teach and preach the most effectively are those who
 wait humbly upon God, and watch hungrily for His guidance and His grace.
 Watch, pray, work—this is the Christian's watchword. The life of a true
 Christian is a life of constant prayer. He knows that the light and strength of
 one day is not sufficient for the trials and conflicts of the next. Satan is con-
 tinually changing his temptations. Every day we shall be placed in different
 circumstances; and in the untried scenes that await us we shall be surrounded
 by fresh dangers, and constantly assailed by new and unexpected temptations.
 It is only through the strength and grace gained from heaven that we can hope
 to meet the temptations and perform the duties before us."---"Gospel Work-

Thoughts from the                                                     `A

Mount of Blessing
                              By Ellen G. White




      While studying these fourth quarter lessons on "The Lord's Prayer" a
      great blessing may be experienced through the reading of this masterful
      and inspired commentary on Christ's- Sermon on the Mount,—the
      sermon in which He first uttered to the multitude that beautiful prayer.

    Following is a quotation from the Preface of the book: "The Sermon on
the Mount is Heaven's benediction to the world,—a voice from the throne of
God. It was given to mankind to be to them the law of duty and the light
of heaven, their hope and consolation in despondency, their joy and comfort
in all the vicissitudes and walks of life. Here the Prince of preachers, the
Master Teacher, utters the words that the Father gave Him to speak."
    In the Lord's Prayer, then, we have the words of God Himself spoken
through His Son, Jesus Christ. What a blessed thought, and how reveren-
tially each word should be pondered during these weeks of study, that the
fullest and richest blessing may be ours!

section given to a commentary on the Lord's Prayer. It is therefore an excel-
lent lesson help. There are three editions of the book, as follows:
