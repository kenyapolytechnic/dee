 "On to the Walls, and Over"
     The emergency call for "A Nickel or More Than Heretofore"
 through our Sabbath school offerings in 1932, was made early in
 the year. Every conference in North America responded favor-
 ably. The local churches, large and small, are enthusiastic.
              What, Then, Is Needed to Attain Success?
  A vision of world mission needs.    "Lift up your heads."
  Consecrated lives.                  "A living sacrifice."
  Leadership by example.              "She gave more than they all."
  Continuous promotion.               "I press toward the mark."
  Prayerful planning.                 "Praying always." "I do nothing of
                                         Myself."
     Has the year's halfway point found you letting the cords
 slacken in your hands l Awaken ! the conflict is but begun! "On
 to the walls !" "Over the top." Let us, under God, make the last
 half year count doubly for victory, and thus maintain the work in
 foreign lands without retrenchment.

               THE STEWARDSHIP OF LIFE
                              General Note
    The purpose of this series of lessons is to study the relationship
existing between God and man, between man and man, and the deeper
meaning of the familiar statement, "God is love." 1 John 4:16.
    "When Adam came from the Creator's hand, he bore, in his physical,
mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker. 'God created man
in His own image,' and it was His purpose that the longer man lived,
the more fully he should reveal this image,—the more fully reflect the
glory of the Creator. All his faculties were capable of development;
their capacity and vigor were continually to increase. Vast was the
scope offered for their exercise; glorious the field opened .to their re-
search.. The mysteries of the visible universe—the 'wondrous works of
Him who is perfect in knowledge'—invited man's study. Face-to-face,
heart-to-heart communion with his Maker was his high privilege. Had
he remained loyal to God, all this would have been his forever. Through-
out eternal ages he would have continued to gain new treasures of knowl-
edge, to discover fresh springs of happiness, and to obtain clearer and
yet clearer conceptions of the wisdom, the power, and the love of God.
More and more fully would he have fulfilled the object of His creation,
more and more fully have reflected the Creator's glory."—"Education,"
p. 15.

                   . Creation: Sons of God
    MEMORY VERSE: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy
neighbor as thyself." Luke 10:27.
    KEYNOTE: Love.
                             THE LESSON
    1. What fundamental principle underlies recognition of man's re-
lationship to God? What is God to those who diligently seek Him?
Heb. 11:6.
     2. Where is God's dwelling place? Ps. 103:19.
     NOTE.—"Our God has heaven and earth at His command, and Ho
knows just what we need. We can see only a little way before us; 'but
all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have
to do.' Above the distractions of the earth He sits enthroned; all things
are open to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He
                                      [3]
orders that which His providence sees best."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp.
272, 273.
    3. What attribute distinguishes the true God from false gods? Jer.
10 : 10-12.
    4. How is the eternal existence of God described? Ps. 90:1, 2.
     5. When the Jews were in captivity in Babylon and the outlook
seemed dark, in what fact did Habakkuk find firm foundation for faith
in God? Hab. 1:12.
    NOTE.—"Confident that even in this terrible judgment [the Baby-
lonian captivity] the purpose of God for His people would in some way
be fulfilled, Habakkuk bowed in submission to the revealed will of Je-
hovah. 'Art thou not from everlasting, 0 Lord my God, mine Holy One?'
he exclaimed. And then, his faith reaching out beyond the forbidding
prospect of the immediate future, and laying fast hold on the precious
promises that reveal God's love for His trusting children, the prophet
added, 'We shall not die.' With this declaration of faith, he rested his
case, and that of every believing Israelite, in the hands of a compas-
sionate God."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 386.
     6. In what simple language is the work of creation described? Ps.
33:6,9.
     NOTE.—"The work of creation can never be explained by science.
What science can explain the mystery of life? The theory that God did
not create matter when He brought the world into existence, is without
foundation. In the formation of our world, God was not indebted to
preexisting matter. On the contrary, all things, material or spiritual,
stood up before the Lord Jehovah at His voice, and were created for
His own purpose."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 258, 259.
    7. Who were associated with God the Father in the work of crea-
tion? Gen. 1:1-3; Eph. 3:9, last clause; John 1:1-3, 14.
    NOTE.—"From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one
with the Father. . . . In the beginning, God was revealed in all the
works of creation. It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the
foundations of the earth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in
space, and fashioned the flowers of the field. 'His strength setteth fast
the mountains.' 'The sea is His, and He made it.' It was He that filled
the earth with beauty, and the air with song. And upon all things in
earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the message of the Father's love."—
"The Desire of Ages," pp. 19, 20.
    "Only by the aid of that Spirit who in the beginning 'was brooding
upon the face of the waters' [R. V., margin] ; of that Word by whom
`all things were made;' . . . can the testimony of science be rightly
interpreted."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 530. -
    8. How intimate was the relationship between the Father and Son?
Prov. 8:22-31; Col. 1:16-19.
    NOTE.—"The Sovereign of the universe was not alone in His work
of beneficence. He had an associate,—a coworker who could appreciate
His purposes, and could share His joy in giving happiness to created
                                  E41
beings. . . . Christ, the Word, the only-begotten of God, was one with
the eternal Father,—one in nature, in character, in purpose,—the only
being that could enter into all the counsels and purposes of God. . .
And the Son of God declares concerning Himself: 'The Lord possessed
Me in the beginning of His way, before His works of old. I was set up
from everlasting. . . . When He appointed the foundations of the
earth, then I was by Him, as one brought up with Him; and I was
daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 34.
    9. In whom is "the fountain of life"? Ps. 36:9; John 5:26.
    10. What relation does the Lord still sustain to His creative works?
Neh. 9:6; Acts 17:28.
    NOTE.—"As regards this world, God's work of creation is completed.
For 'the works were finished from the foundation of the world.' But His
energy is still exerted in upholding the objects of His creation. It is
not because the mechanism that has once been set in motion continues
to act by its own inherent energy, that the pulse beats, and breath fol-
lows breath ; but every breath, every pulsation of the heart, is an evi-
dence of the all-pervading care of Him in whom 'we live, and move, and
have our being.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 115.
    11. What was the attitude of unf alien angels and the intelligences
of other worlds to the creative work of God? Job 38:7.
    NomE.—"Before the creation of man, angels were in existence; for
when the foundations of the earth were laid, 'the morning stars sang
together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.' "—"The Great Con-
troversy," p. 511.
    12. In whose form and moral likeness did God create man? Gen.
1:26, 27.
    NomE.—"God designed that man, the crowning work of His crea-
tion, should express His thought and reveal His glory."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 8, p. 264.
    "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and
in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father; but
man was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harinony
with the will of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine
things. His affections were pure; his appetites and passions were under
the control of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of
God, and in perfect obedience to His will."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 45.
    13. What did God rightfully require of man? Gen. 2:16, 17.
    NOTE.—"To man, the crowning work of creation, God has given
power to understand His requirements, to comprehend the justice and
 beneficence of His law, and its sacred claims upon him; and of man un-
swerving obedience is required."—Id., p. 52.
    14. When Adam disobeyed God, what change took place iii his re-
lationship to God? Gen. 3:22-24. Answer.—He lost his direct contact
with God, and became "fallen" man, of himself hopelessly lost without
a redeemer.
                                 [5]
     NoTE.—"Adam, in his innocence, had enjoyed open communion with
his Maker; but sin brought separation between God and man, and the
atonement of Christ alone could span the abyss, and make possible the
communication of blessing or salvation from heaven to earth. Man was
still cut off from direct approach to his Creator."—Id., p. 67.
    "By repentance toward God and faith in Christ, the fallen children
of Adam might once more become 'sons of God.'"—Id., p. 64.
     15. What divine assurance is given to fallen man concerning adop-
tion into the family of God? 2 Cor. 6:17, 18; 1 John 3:1, 2.
     NOTE.—"What love, what matchless love, that, sinners and aliens as
we are, we may be brought back to God, and adopted into His family!
We may address Him by the endearing name, 'Our Father,' which is a
sign of our affection for Him, and a pledge of His tender regard and
relationship to us. And the m of God, beholding the heirs of grace,
'is not ashamed to call them brethren.' They have even a more sacred
relationship to God than have the angels who have never fallen."—
"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 739, 740.
    16. What divine principle actuates the life of the true child of God?
Matt. 22 : 37.
    17. What should be the attitude of God's children toward all man-
kind? Lev. 19:18; Matt. 22 : 39.
    NOTE.—"He who is a child of God should henceforth look upon him-
self as a link in the chain let down to have the world, one with Christ
in His plan of mercy, going forth with Him to seek and save the lost."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 417.
                         Thoughts for Meditation
    1.   Is my heart a dwelling place for God's presence?
    2.   Am I willing for God's word to manifest its power in my life?
    3.   Does my life reveal that I am a child of God?
    4.   Do I love my neighbor as I love myself?

                 The Slavery of Self-Seeking
     MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to
the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the
word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience
received'a just recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great
salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
unto us by them that heard Him." Heb. 2:1-3.
     KEYNOTE: Humble obedience.
                                       [6   ]
                              THE LESSON
    1. What is revealed concerning the ways and works of God? Deut.
32:4.
    2. What conditions therefore must have prevailed throughout the
entire universe of God before sin was known? Answer.—Perfection,
harmony, happiness.
    NOTE.—"Before the entrance of evil, there was peace and jby
throughout the universe. All was in perfect harmony with the Creator's
will. Love for God was supreme, love for one another impartial."—
"The Great Controversy," p. 493.
    3. In what manner did the heavenly beings give expression to their
joy when the creation of the earth was complete? Job 38:7.
    NoTE.—"In the beginning the Father and the Son had rested upon
the Sabbath after their work of creation. When 'the heavens and the
earth were finished, and all the host of them,' the Creator and all heav-
enly beings rejoiced in contemplation of the glorious scene. 'The morn-
ing stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.' "—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 769.
    4. Who among these heavenly beings was soon to break the harmony
of heaven's rejoicing? Isa. 14:12, margin.
    NomE.—"Lucifer, 'son of the morning,' was first of the covering
cherubs, holy and undefiled. He stood in the presence of the great Crea-
tor, and the ceaseless beams of glory enshrouding the eternal God,
rested upon him." —"Patriarchs and Prophets," P. 35.
    5. What personal description of Lucifer recorded by Inspiration is
 given under the symbol of the king of Tyrus? Eze. 28:11-15, 17.
    NOTE.—It is manifest from these texts that under the figure of the
 king of Tyrus, Inspiration is dealing with the self-exaltation of Lucifer.
    "Satan was once an honored angel in heaven, next to Christ. His
 countenance, like those of the other angels, was mild and expressive of
 happiness. His forehead was high and broad, showing great intelli-
 gence. His form was perfect; his bearing noble and majestic."—"Early
 Writings," p. 145.
    6. How did Lucifer pervert the "law of love" which is the "foun-
 dation of the government of God?" Isa. 14:12-14.
     NOTE.—"The law of love being the foundation of the government of
 God, the happiness of all created beings depended upon their perfect
 accord with its great principles of righteousness. . . . But there was
 one that chose to pervert this freedom. . . . Little by little, Lucifer
 came to indulge a desire for self-exaltation. . . . Coveting the honor
 which the infinite Father had bestowed upon His Son, this prince of
 angels aspired to power which it was the prerogative of Christ alone to
 wield. . . . Pride in his own glory nourished the desire for supremacy."
 —"The Great Controversy," pp. 493-495.
     7. What was the result of the course taken by Lucifer? Rev. 12:7-9.
     8. Being cast out of heaven because of his rebellion, what did Luci-
 fer endeavor to do? 1 Peter 5:8.
                                    171
     NOTE.—"To the very close of the controversy in heaven, the great
usurper continued to justify himself. When it was announced that
with all his sympathizers he must be expelled from the abodes of bliss,
then the rebel leader boldly avowed his contempt for the Creator's law.
. . . The same spirit that prompted rebellion in heaven, still inspires
rebellion on earth. Satan has continued with men the same policy which
he pursued with the angels."—Id., pp. 499, 500.
    9. What vitally important object lesson is perpetually presented to
the universe through the rebellion of Lucifer and his angels? 1 John
3:4, 8; Rom. 6:23.
    NOTE.—"Satan's rebellion was to be a lesson to the universe through
all coming ages,—a perpetual testimony to the nature of sin and its
terrible results. The working out of Satan's rule, its effects upon both
men and angels, would show what must be the fruit of setting aside the
divine authority. It would testify that with the existence of God's gov-
ernment is bound up the well-being of all the creatures Hp has made."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 42.
    10. Which precept of the Decalogue was directly violated by the
instigator of rebellion? Ex. 20:17.
    NOTE.—"The tenth commandment strikes at the very root of all
sins, prohibiting the selfish desire, from which springs the sinful act.
He who in obedience to God's law refrains from indulging even a sinful
desire for that which belongs to another, will not be guilty of an act of
wrong toward his fellow creatures."—Id., p. 309.
   11. What is another name for covetousness or self-seeking? Eph.
5:5.
    NOTE.—"By idolatry he [Paul] meant not only the worship of idols,
but self-serving, love of ease, the gratification of appetite and passion.
A mere profession of faith in Christ, a boastful knowledge of the truth,
does not make a man a Christian. A religion that seeks only to gratify
the eye, the ear, and the taste, or that sanctions self-indulgence, is not
the religion of Christ."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 317.
   12. What contrast to self-seeking is revealed in the course pursued
by Christ? Phil 2:5-8.
    13. What is the incentive of acceptable service? 2 Cor. 5:14, first
clause.
    NoTE.—"In heaven, service is not rendered in the spirit of legality.
When Satan rebelled against the law of Jehovah, the thought that there
was a law came to the angels almost as an awakening to something un-
thought of. In their ministry the angels are not as servants, but as sons.
There is perfect unity between them and their Creator. Obedience is to
them no drudgery. Love for God makes their service a joy. So in every
soul wherein Christ, the hope of glory, dwells, His words are reechoed,
   delight to do Thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.' "
—"Mount of Blessing," p. 161.
   14. What admonition is set before us? Heb. 2:1-3.
                                    8
    NoTE.—"Satan uses the listless, sleepy indolence of professed Chris-
tians to strengthen his forces and win souls to his side. Many who
think that though they are doing no actual work for Christ, they are yet
on His side, are enabling the enemy to preoccupy ground and gain ad-
vantages. By their failure to be diligent workers for the Master, by
leaving duties undone and words unspoken, they have allowed Satan to
gain control of souls who might have been won for Christ."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 280.
                       Thoughts for Meditation
    1. Am I enslaved by any evil habit?
    2. Am I unquestionably on God's side?
    3. Do I render loyal and constant allegiance to my Lord?
    4. Do I find my greatest joy in doing God's will?

                      The Supremacy of Love
    MEMORY VERSE: "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love
one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another." John 13:34.
    KEYNOTE: Service.
                               THE LESSON
   1. What is the source of that impulse • of the human heart called
"love"? 1 John 4:7.
    NOTE.—"Love is of God. The unconverted heart cannot originate
nor produce this plant of heavenly growth, which lives and flourishes
only where Christ reigns.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p.-135.
    2. In what brief statement does the scripture personify love?
Verse 8.
    NOTE.—" 'God is love.' His nature, His law, is love. It ever has
been; it ever will be. . . . Every manifestation of creative power is an
expression of infinite love."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 33.
    3. How is divine love manifested to the human race? John 3:16.
    NOTE.—"Only as we contemplate the great plan of redemption can
we have a just appreciation of the character of God. The work of crea-
tion was a manifestation of His love; but the gift of God to save the
guilty and ruined race, alone reveals the infinite depths of divine ten-
                                       [9 ]
derness and compassion. 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-
begotten Son.' . . . All the paternal love which has come down from
generation to generation through the channel of human hearts, all the
springs of tenderness which have opened in the souls of men, are but as
a tiny rill to the boundless ocean, when compared with the infinite, ex-
haustless love of God."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 739, 740.
    4. What characteristic of divine love is of greatest assurance and
comfort to the sinner? 1 John 4:10; Rom. 5:8.
    NOTE.—"Herein His love commends itself in the most marvelous
manner to the rebellious race. What a sight for angels to behold! What
a hope for man, 'that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us'!"—
"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 246.
    5. What should be our response to the unmerited gift of divine love?
1 John 4:19, 11, 20.
    NoTE.—"His love received, will make us, in like manner, kind and
tender, not merely toward those who please us, but to the most faulty
and erring and sinful. . . . To be kind to the unthankful and to the
evil, to do good hoping for nothing again, is the insignia of the royalty
of heaven, the sure token by which the children of the Highest reveal
their high estate."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 115.
    6. What distinguishing characteristic indicates whether a person is
a child of God or a child of the devil? 1 John 3:10.
    NOTE.—God's "very life is the outflow of unselfish love."—Id., p. 117.
    "The perception, of God's love works the renunciation of selfishness."
—Id., p. 155.
    The negative of love is hate, arising from rebellion against the "law
of love," which is the "foundation of the government of God." Just as
"God is love," so Satan is the personification of hate, which manifests
selfishness in myriad forms. Satan perverted the power of love into the
love of power, and every human life is the battlefield for the contest be-
tween the principles of love (obedience) and hate (rebellion).
    "The only safeguard against evil is the indwelling of Christ in the
heart through faith in His righteousness. It is because selfishness exists
in our hearts that temptation has power over us."—Id., p. 172.
    7. How did Jesus emphasize the supremacy of love in the lives of
His followers? John 13 : 34, 35.
    8. In what is the Christian's life rooted and grounded? Eph. 3:17.
    9. What example of love is set before us? What admonition con-
cerning the practical side of love is given us? 1 John 3:16-18.
    NoTE.—"Love has a twin sister, which is Duty. Love and Duty
stand side by side."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 195.
    "Remember that Duty has a twin sister, Love; these united can ac-
complish almost everything, but separated, neither is capable of good."
—Id., vol. 4, p. 62.
    10. How extensive is the field of service presented to the twin graces,
love and duty? Matt. 5:44-46; 25:31-46.
                                   [ 10 ]
    11. In what way did Jesus suggest that Peter demonstrate the
genuineness of his love? John 21:15-17.
    NOTE.—"The question that Christ had put to Peter was significant.
He mentioned only one condition of discipleship and service. 'Lovest
thou Me?' He said. This is the essential qualification. Though Peter
might possess every other, yet without the love of Christ he could not
be a faithful shepherd over the Lord's flock. Knowledge, benevolence,
eloquence, gratitude, and zeal are all aids in the good work; but with-
out the love of Jesus in the heart, the work of the Christian minister is
a failure."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 815.
    12. Through which of Christ's parables did He seek to illustrate
the conduct of the life which is "rooted and grounded in love?" Luke
10:25-37.
    NOTE.—"In the story of the good Samaritan, Christ illustrates the
nature of true religion. He shows that it consists not in systems, creeds,
or rites, but in the performance of loving deeds, in bringing the great-
est good to others, in genuine goodness."—Id., p. 497.
    "Unless there is practical self-sacrifice for the good of others, in the
family circle, in the neighborhood, in the church, and wherever we may
be, then whatever our profession, we are not Christians."—Id., p. 504.
    13. What relation does love sustain to the law of God? Rom. 13:
8-10.
    NoTE.—"The law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable.
It is a revelation of the will and the character of its Author. God is
love, and His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and
man. 'Love is the fulfilling of the law.' . . . Such 'a law, being an ex-
pression of the mind and will of God, must be as enduring as its
Author."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 466, 467.
                       Thoughts for Meditation
   1. Is my service for others an accurate measure of my love for the
Lord?
   2. Do I really love those that mistreat me and gossip about mel

                         A New Creation
    MEMORY VERSE : "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
are passed away; behold, all things are become new." 2 Cor. 5:17.
    KEYNOTE: Restoration.
                                    [ 11
                             THE LESSON
    1. What was God's purpose in the creation of the earth? Isa. 45:18.
     NomE.—"As it came from the Creator's hand, not only the Garden
of Eden but the whole earth was exceedingly beautiful. No taint of
sin, or shadow of death, marred the fair creation. . . . Thus was the
earth a fit emblem of Him who is 'abundant in goodness and truth ;' a
fit study for those who were made in His image. The Garden of Eden
was a representation of what God desired the whole earth to become,
and it was His purpose that, as the human family increased in num-
bers, they should establish other homes and schools like the one He had
given. Thus in course of time the whole earth might be occupied with
homes and schools where the words and works of God should be studied,
and where the students should thus be fitted more and more fully to
reflect, throughout endless ages, the light of the knowledge of His
glory."—"Education," p. 22.
    2. What was God's purpose concerning the inhabitants of the earth?
Gen. 1:26-28.
    NOTE.—"God created the earth to be the abode of holy,. happy be-
ings."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 67.
    "In the creation it was His [God's] purpose that the earth should
be inhabited by beings whose existence would be a blessing to them-
selves and to one another, and an honor to their Creator. All who will
may identify themselves with this purpose."—"Prophets and Kings,"
p. 500.
    3. What was the Creator's design for the home, the occupation, and
the intellectual development of the inhabitants of the earth? Gen. 2:
8, 15.
    NorE.—"The home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other
libmes as their children should go forth to occupy the earth. That home,
beautified by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace. Men,
in their pride, delight in magnificent and costly edifices, and glory in
the works of their own hands; but God placed Adam in a garden. This
was his dwelling. . . . To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care
of the garden, 'to dress it and to keep it.' Their occupation was not
wearisome, but pleasant and invigorating. God appointed labor as a
blessing to man, to occupy his mind, to strengthen his body, and to de-
velop his faculties. . . .
    "The holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care of
God, but students receiving instruction from the all-wise Creator. They
were visited by angels, and were granted communion with their Maker,
with no obscuring veil between. . . . The laws and operations of na-
ture, which have engaged man's study for six thousand years, were
opened to their minds by the infinite Framer and Upholder of all. They
held converse with leaf and flower and tree, gathering from each the se-
crets of its life. With every living creature, from the mighty leviathan
that playeth among the waters, to the insect mote that floats in the sun-
beam, Adam was familiar. He had given to each its name, and he was
acquainted with the nature and habits of all. God's glory in the,heavens,
                                   I 12 3
the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, 'the balancings of
the clouds,' the mysteries of light and sound, of day and night,—all
were open to the study of our first parents."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," pp. 49-51.
    4. What great change took place as the result of man's disobedience?
Gen. 3:16-19, 22-24.
    NOTE.—"The fall of man filled all heaven with sorrow. The world
that God had made was blighted with the curse of sin, and inhabited
by beings doomed to misery and death. There appeared no escape for
those who had transgressed the law. Angels ceased their songs of praise.
Throughout the heavenly courts there was mourning for the ruin that
sin had wrought."—Id., p. 63.
    5. 'What occurred in heaven when the Creator's provision for man
had been perverted through transgression of divine law? Zech. 6:13.
Answer.—"The counsel of peace."
    NOTE.—"The Son of God, heaven's glorious Commander, was touched
with pity for the fallen race. His heart was moved with infinite com-
passion as the woes of the lost world rose up before Him. But divine
love had conceived a plan whereby man might be redeemed. . . . Be-
fore the Father He pleaded in the sinner's behalf, while the host of
heaven awaited the result with an intensity of interest that words can-
not express. Long continued was that mysterious communion,—'the
counsel of peace' for the fallen sons of men. The plan of salvation had
been laid before the creation of the earth; for Christ is 'the Lamb
slain from the foundation of the world' [Rev. 13:8] ; yet it was a strug-
gle, even with the King of the universe, to yield up His son to die for
the guilty race."—Ibid.
   6. As the result of this "counsel of peace," what did the Creator
become? Isa. 54:5; 63:16. Answer.—The Ree   emer.
   NOTE.—"Christ assured the angels that by His death He would
ransom many, and would destroy him who had the power of death. He
would recover the kingdom which man had lost by transgression, and
the redeemed were to inherit it with Him, and dwell therein forever."
—Id., p. 65.
    7. In the Creator's plan for redemption, restoration, and reconcilia-
tion, what additional work of creation was involved?
    Answer.—( a) A new creation of man. 2 Cor. 5:17-19.
               (b) The creation of new heavens and a new earth. Isa.
                      65:17-25.
    8. How complete will be the restoration to Edenic conditions? 1 Cor.
15:22, 23; Micah 4:8.
    NOTE.—"Restored to the tree of life in the long-lost Eden, the re-
deemed will 'grow up' to the full stature of the race in its primeval glory.
The last lingering traces of the curse of sin will be removed, and Christ's
faithful ones will appear 'in the beauty of the Lord our God,' in mind
and soul and body reflecting the perfect image of,their Lord."—"The
Great Controversy," p. 645.
                                   [13]
      9. How is man made into a "new creature"? 1 Peter 1:23.
      NOTE.—As in the original creation, "the Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters," so is the Spirit the divine agency in the new
creation. Said the Saviour, "Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of
the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." John
3:5, 6.
      With this scripture agrees this statement from "The Desire of
Ages": "The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and with-
out this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power
of evil had been strengthening for centuries, and the submission of men
to this satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and over-
come only through the mighty agency of the third person of the God-
head, who would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of
divine power."—Page 671.
     10. Whose image is reproduced in the life of the "new man"? Col.
3:10.
      NOTE.—"Christ is sitting for His portrait in every disciple. Every
one God has predestinated to be 'conformed to the image of His Son.'
. . . The Saviour longs to manifest His grace and stamp His character
on the whole world. It is His purchased possession, and He desires to
make men free, and pure, and holy. Though Satan works to hinder this
purpose, yet through the blood shed for the world there are triumphs to
be achieved that will bring glory to God and the Lamb. Christ will not
be satisfied till the victory is complete."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 827.
    11. How does the apostle Paul contrast the new life in Christ with
the old life of bondage to sin? Eph. 4:17-24.
    NomE.—"Through the power of Christ men and women have broken
the chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The pro-
fane have become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate pure. Souls
that have borne the likeness of Satan have become transformed into the
image of God. This change is in itself the miracle of miracles."—"Acts
of the Apostles," p. 476.
    12. Mat is the life program for every one who has become a "new
creation" in Christ Jesus? 2 Cor. 5:20.
    NOTE.—"All who receive the gospel message into the heart will long
to proclaim it. The heaven-born love of Christ must find expression."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 125.
    13. What stimulus to hope and steadfastness should ever be kept in
view? 2 Peter 3:13, 14.

                     Thoughts for Meditation
   1. How positive am I as to the reality of my Christian experience?
   2. Do I regard God's requirements as a privilege or a burden?
   3. How much have I surrendered to God, and how much do I still
hold in reserve?

                     Living the New Life
    MEMORY VERSE: "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do
of His good pleasure." Phil. 2:13.
    KEYNOTE: Growth.
                             THE LESSON
    1. What will be the experience of every one who has buried the old
life in the baptismal grave? Rom. 6:1-4.
    NoTE.—"In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with
God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change
has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from
sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and
loyalty. The old life of alienation from God has ended; the new life of
reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 468.
    2. How is the new life of reconciliation sustained? Gal. 2:20.
    NOTE.—"The life of Christ, that gives life to the world, is in His
word. . . . As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual
life is sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life
from God's word for himself. As we must eat for ourselves in order to
receive nourishment, so we must receive the word for ourselves."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 390.
    3. What development of the life is to take place? 1 Peter 2:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"The work of transformation from unholiness to holiness is
a continuous one. Day by day God labors for man's sanctification, and
man is to cooperate with Him, putting forth persevering efforts in the
cultivation of right habits. He is to add grace to grace; and as he thus
works on the plan of addition, God works for him on the plan of multi-
plication. Our Saviour is always ready to hear and answer the prayer
of the contrite heart, and grace and peace are multiplied to His faithful
ones. Gladly He grants them the blessings they need in their struggle
against the evils that beset them."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 532.
   4. What standard has Christ set before us? Matt. 5 : 48.
   NomE.—"God's ideal for His children is higher than the highest
human thought can reach. 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
which is in heaven is perfect.' This command is a promise. The plan of
redemption contemplates our complete recovery from the power of
Satan. Christ always separates the contrite soul from sin. He came to
                                    15
destroy the works of the devil, and He has made provision that the Holy
Spirit shall be imparted to every repentant soul, to keep him from
sinning."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 311.
    5. What avenue to the throne of God is open to every Christian?
Phil. 4:6.
    NOTE.—"In order to have spiritual life and energy, we must have
actual intercourse with our heavenly Father. Our minds may be drawn
out toward Him; we may meditate upon His works, His mercies, His
blessings; but this is not, in the fullest sense, communing with Him. In
order to commune with God, we must have something to say to Him
concerning our actual life. Prayer is the opening of the heart to God
as to a friend."—"Steps to Christ," p. 97.
    6. What spiritual attitude is the Christian to maintain? Eph. 6:18.
    NOTE.—"Although there may be a tainted, corrupted atmosphere
around us, we need not breathe its miasma, but may live in the pure air
of heaven. We may close every door to impure imaginings and unholy
thoughts by lifting the soul into the presence of God through sincere
prayer. Those whose hearts are open to receive the support and bless-
ing of God will walk in a holier atmosphere than that of earth, and will
have constant communion with Heaven."—Id., p. 104.
    7. What was the supreme purpose of Christ's earthly life? John
9:4; 4:34.
    NOTE.—"The Saviour's life on earth was not a life of ease and devo-
tion to Himself, but He toiled with persistent, earnest, untiring effort
for the salvation of lost mankind. From the manger to Calvary He fol-
lowed the path of self-denial, and sought not to be released from arduous
tasks, painful travels, and exhausting care and labor."—Id., p. 82.
    8. What endowment accompanies the new birth? Mark 13:34.
    NOTE.—"To His servants Christ commits 'His goods,'—something to
be put to use for Him. He gives `to every man his work.' Each has his
place in the eternal plan of heaven. Each is to work in cooperation with
Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place prepared
for us in the heavenly mansions than is the special place designated
on earth where we are to work for God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp.
326, 327.
    9. How did Jesus illustrate the serious responsibility involved in
this divine endowment of His goods to His servants? Matt. 25:14-30.
    NOTE.—"Our heavenly Father requires no more nor less than He has
given us ability to do. He lays upon His servants no burdens that they
are not able to bear. 'He knoweth our frame ; He remembereth that we
are dust.' All that He claims from us we through divine grace can ren-
der. . . . We shall individually be held responsible for doing one jot
less than we have ability to do. The Lord measures with exactness every
possibility for service. The unused capabilities are as much brought into
account as are those that are improved. For all that we might become
through the right use of our talents God holds us responsible. We shall
                                 [ 16 ]
be judged according to what we ought to have done, but did not accom-
plish because we did not use our powers to glorify God."—Id., pp. 362,
363.
   10. What parable shows that no one is excused from service? Matt.
20:1-7.
    NorE.—"Every one who has heard the invitation is to echo the mes-
sage from hill and valley, saying, 'Come,' . . . Hundreds, yea, thou-
sands, who have heard the message of salvation, are still idlers in the
market place, when they might be engaged in some line of active service.
To these Christ is saying, 'Why stand ye here all the day idle?' and He
adds, 'Go ye also into the vineyard.' Why is it that many more do not
respond to the call? Is it because they think themselves excused in that
they do not stand in the pulpit? Let them understand that there is a
large work to be done outside the pulpit, by thousands of consecrated
lay members."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 110, 111.
   11. What is one of the primary essentials in Christian service? Isa.
43:10; Acts 1:8.
   12. What is the measure of our "reasonable" service? Rom. 12:1.
                        Thoughts for Meditation
    1. Am I as faithful in supplying the necessary food for my spiritual
life as I am for my physical life?
    2. Do I believe in the atmosphere of prayer?
    3. Have I found my place in service?
    4. Am I a witness for God, or am I merely a contender for doctrine?

                    Works of Righteousness
    MEMORY VERSE: "Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? who shall
dwell in Thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
speaketh the truth in his heart." Ps. 15:1, 2.
    KEYNOTE: Fruit bearing.
                               THE LESSON
   1. To what did Christ refer as proof of His Sonship with God?
John 5:36.
   Nova.—"Jesus of Nazareth was the promised one. The evidence of
His divinity was seen in His ministry to the needs of suffering humanity.
His glory was shown in His condescension to our low estate. The works
                                 [ 17 l
of Christ not only declared Him to be the Messiah, but showed in what
manner His kingdom was to be established."—"Ministry of Healing,"
pp. 35, 36.
    2. What was the purpose which actuated Christ in all He did? John
8:28, 29.                                                       •
    NoTE.—" do nothing of Myself,' said Christ. . . . In these words
is set forth the great principle which is the law of life for the universe.
All things Christ received from God, but He took to give. So in the
heavenly courts, in His ministry for all created beings: through the be-
loved Son, the Father's life flows out to all; through the Son it returns,
in praise and joyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source of all.
And thus through Christ the circuit of beneficence is complete, repre-
senting the character of the great Giver, the law of life."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 21.
    3. What conduct attests the fact of a new creation in Christ Jesus?
Matt. 7 : 16-21.
    4. What is the relationship between genuine faith and good works?
James 2:14-17, 21-24.
    NoTE.—"It is God's will that faith in Christ shall be made perfect
by works; He connects the salvation and eternal life of those who be-
lieve, with these works, and through them provides for the light of
truth to go to all countries and peoples. This is the fruit of the working
of God's Spirit."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 644.
    "Man is to be saved by faith, not by works; yet his faith must be
shown by his works."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 279.
    5. How are faith and works to be especially manifest in the church
which will exist when Christ returns for His.people? Rev. 14:12.
    NOTE.—"The third angel of Revelation fourteen is represented as
flying swiftly through the midst of heaven crying, 'Here are they that
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' Here is shown
the nature of the work of the people of God. They have a message of
so great importance that they are represented as flying in the presenta-
tion of it to the world. They are holding in their hands the bread of
life for a famishing world. The love of Christ constraineth them. This
is the last message. There are no more to follow; no more invitations
of mercy to be given after this message shall have done its work. What
a trust !"—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 206, 207.
    6. What are some of the "works of righteousness" mentioned in the
Scriptures?
    Hospitality. Rom. 12:13.
    Generosity. Ps. 41:1.
    Visitation and ministry. James 1:27; Job 29:16.
    Warn, comfort, support, be patient. 1 These. 5:14.
    Teach the, word of God. Dan. 12:3, margin.
    "Every good word and work." 2 These. 2:17.
    Liberality. Prov. 3:9; 2 Cor. 9:7.
                                   18
    7. To what class of Christians is given the special admonition to be
a "pattern" and an "example" in works of righteousness? Titus 2:6, 7;
1 Tim. 4!12.
    NOTE.—"We must manifest confidence in our young men. They
should be pioneers in every enterprise involving toil and sacrifice, while
the overtaxed servants of Christ should be cherished as counselors, to
encourage and bless those who strike the heaviest blows for God. . . .

                   A Building of Living Stones
   MEMORY VERSE: "We are laborers together with God: ye are God's hus-
bandry, ye are God's building." 1 Cor. 3:9.
   KEYNOTE: Spirituality.
                               THE LESSON
   1. Under what symbol does Moses refer to the God of Israel? Deut.
32:3, 4.
   2. Who is specifically called the "Rock"? 1 Cor. 10:1-4.
   NOTE.—"Christ, the true Rock, was with them [Israel] in all their
wanderings."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 411.
   "Centuries before the advent of Christ, Moses pointed to Him as the
Rock of Israel's salvation."—Id., p. 413.
   3. What similar term is used by Inspiration as a symbol of Christ?
What specifications are made concerning this "Stone"? Isa. 28:16.
                                     [ 19 ]
     NoTE.—"In infinite wisdom, God chose the foundation stone, and
 laid it Himself. He called it 'a sure foundation.' The entire world may
 lay upon it their burdens and griefs; it can endure them all. With per-
 fect safety they may build upon it. Christ is a 'tried stone.' Those who
 trust in Him, He never disappoints. He has borne every test. He has
endured the pressure of Adam's guilt, and the guilt of his posterity,
and has come off more than conquerer of the powers of evil. He has
borne the burdens cast upon Him by every repenting sinner. In Christ
 the guilty heart has found relief. He is the sure foundation. All who
 make Him their dependence, rest in perfect security."—"The Desire of
 Ages," pp. 598, 599.
     4. How did Christ allude to the prophecy concerning Him as the
"chief corner stone"? What incident familiar to His hearers did He
cite as an object lesson? Matt. 21:42; Ps. 118:22.
     NOTE.—"In quoting the prophecy of the rejected stone, Christ re-
 ferred to an actual occurrence in the history of Israel. The incident was
 connected with the building of the first temple. While it had a special
application at the time of Christ's first advent, and should have appealed
with special force to the Jews, it has also a lesson for us. When the
temple of Solomon was erected, the immense stones for the walls and
the foundation were entirely prepared at the quarry; after they were
brought to the place of building, not an instrument was to be used upon
them; the workmen had only to place them in position. For use in the
foundation, one stone of unusual size and peculiar shape had been
brought; ut the workmen could find no place for it, and would not
accept it. It was an annoyance to them as it lay unused in their way.
Long it remained a rejected stone. But when the builders came to the
laying of the corner, they searched for a long time to find a stone of
sufficient size and strength, and of the proper shape, to take that par-
ticular place, and bear the great weight which would rest upon it.
Should they make an unwise choice for this important place, the safety
of the entire building would be endangered. They must find a stone
capable of resisting the influence of the sun, of frost, and of tempest.
Several stones had at different times been chosen, but under the pressure
of immense weights they had crumbled to pieces. Others could not bear
the test of the sudden atmospheric changes. But at last attention was
called to the stone so long rejected. It had been exposed to the air, to
sun and storm, without revealing the slightest crack. The builders ex-
amined this stone. It had borne every test but one. If it could bear the
test of severe pressure, they decided to accept it for the corner stone.
The trial was made. The stone was accepted, brought to its assigned
position, and found to be an exact fit. In prophetic vision, Isaiah was
shown that this stone was a symbol of Christ."—Id., pp. 597, 598.
    5. To what class does this "tried stone" become a stumblingblock?
1 Peter 2:7, 8.
    6. Where is the true foundation`stone laid? Isa. 28:16, first part;
Matt. 16:18. Answer.—In Zion, the church.
    NOTE.—"In the presence of God, and all the heavenly intelligences,
in the presence of the unseen army of hell, Christ founded His church
                                     201
upon the living Rock. That Rock is Himself,—His own body, for us
broken and bruised. Against the church built upon this foundation, the
gates of hell shall not prevail. . . . For six thousand years, faith has
builded upon Christ. For six thousand years the floods and tempests of
satanic wrath have beaten upon the Rock of our salvation ; but it stands
unmoved."—Id., p. 413. '
    7. Has any other foundation ever been laid? 1 Cor. 3:11.
    8. What is the nature of the construction developed upon the "sure
foundation"? Eph. 2:20-22.
    9. What kind of stones enter into the construction of this spiritual
temple? 1 Peter 2:5.
    NOTE.—The Revised Version gives the reading, "living stones."
    "Christ, the true foundation, is a living stone ; His life is imparted to
all that are built upon Him. . . . The stones become one with the foun-
dation; for a common life dwells in all."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 216.
    10. How nearly complete is the spiritual temple? Rom. 13:11, 12.
    NOTE.—"Through the ages that have passed since the days of the
apostles, the building of God's temple has never ceased. . . . But the
structure is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have a work
to do, a part to act."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 598, 599.
    11. What is an essential experience of every one who, as a living
stone, shall become a part of God's spiritual house? Luke 20:17, 18.
    NOTE.—"To those who believe, Christ is the sure foundation. These
are they who fall upon the Rock and are broken. Submission to Christ
and faith in Him are here represented. To fall upon the Rock and be
broken is to give up our self-righteousness, and to go to Christ with the
humility of a child, repenting of our transgressions, and believing in
His forgiving love. . . . Many persons are by their own endeavors
heviin, polished, and beautified; but they cannot become 'living stones,'
because they are not connected with Christ. Without this connection,
no man can be saved."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 599.
   12. Against what perilous conditions must builders of God's spirit-
ual temple be ever on guard? What gracious privilege is theirs? Rev.
3:14-21.
   NOTE.—"Our Redeemer sends His messengers to bear a testimony to
His people. He says, 'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any
man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will
sup with him, and he with Me.' But many refuse to receive Him. The
Holy Spirit waits to soften and subdue hearts, but they are not willing
to open the door and let the Saviour in, for fear that He will require
something of them. And so Jesus of Nazareth passes by."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 6, p. 262.
    Salvation cannot be had by a mere union with the visible church of
God on earth. Except the living Christ by His Spirit be in us, we shall
be lukewarm, inactive, and a danger to ourselves and to the church of
God. But Christ within will produce living, active, vital Christians
whose lives are held ready for His calls to service.

                  The Church—Christ's Body
    MEMORY VERSE: "As we have many members in one body, and all mem-
bers have not the same office: so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every
one members one of another." Rom. 12:4, 5.
    KEYNOTE: Union with Christ.
                          THE LESSON
   1. How close and vital is the connection between Christ and the
church? Col. 1:18.
   NomE.—"Very close and sacred is the relation between Christ and
His church,—He the bridegroom, and the church the bride; He the head,
and the church the body. Connection with Christ, then, involves con-
nection with His church."—"Education," p. 268.
   2. How is this spiritual union described by the apostle Paul? Eph.
5:30, 32.
   3. Through what gospel ordinance does the believer signify his
union with the body of Christ? Gal. 3:27.
    NorrE.—"Christ has made baptism the sign of entrance to His spirit-
ual kingdom. He has made this a positive condition with which all must
comply who wish to be acknowledged as under, the authority of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 91.
   4. What parallel exists between the members of the physical body
and the members of the spiritual body? Rom. 12:4, 5.
   5. How does the apostle illustrate the harmonious working of all
members of the body of Christ? 1 Cor. 12:14-20, 27.
   NOTE.— "The Lord has wrought with you, enabling you to act your
part as His workman; but there are other workmen also who are to act
their part as His instrumentalities. These help to compose the whole
body. All are to be united as parts of the one great organism. . . . God
has given you your work. But He has other instrumentalities, and to
them He has given their work, that all may become, through sanctifica-
tion of the truth, members of Christ's body, of His flesh and of His
bones."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 174.
   6. What conditions will be found in the church of Christ when it is
rightly related to the head? 1 Cor. 14:33, 40.
   NomE.—"God's people are not to be in confusion, lacking order and
harmony, consistency and beauty. The Lord is greatly dishonored when
disunion exists among His people."—Ibid.
                               [ 22]
    "He requires that order and system be observed in the conduct of
church affairs to-day, no less than in the days of old. He desires His
work to be carried forward with thoroughness and exactness, so that He
may place upon it the seal of His approval. Christian is to be united
with Christian, church with church, the human instrumentality cooperat-
ing with the divine, every agency subordinate to the Holy Spirit, and all
combined in giving to the world the good tidings of the grace of God."
—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 96.
    7. What specific example of God's ideal organization of His people
is furnished in the history of ancient Israel? Ex. 18:13-23.
    NoTE.—"Even before they left Egypt, a temporary organization
had been effected, and the people were arranged in companies, under
appointed leaders."—"Education," p. 37.
    "The government of Israel was characterized by the most thorough
organization, wonderful alike for its completeness and its simplicity."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 374.
    8. What experience of Israel impresses upon us the solemnity of
coming into God's presence? Heb. 12:18-29.
    NOTE.—"From the sacredness which was attached to the earthly
sanctuary, Christians may learn how they should regard the place where
the Lord meets with His people. . . . The reverence which the people
had anciently for the sanctuary where they met with God in sacred
service, has largely passed away. Nevertheless, God Himself gave the
order of His service, exalting it high above everything of a temporal
nature. . . . The church is the sanctuary for the congregation. There
should be rules in regard to the time, the place, and the manner of wor-
shiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains to the worship
of God, should be treated with carelessness or indifference."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 5, p. 491.
    "God gave rules of order, perfect and exact, to His ancient people.
Has His character changed'? Is He not the great and mighty God who
rules in the heaven of heavens'? Would it not be well for us often to
read the directions given by God Himself to the Hebrews, that we who
have the light of the glorious truth shining upon us, may imitate their
reverence for the house of GodI"—Id., p. 496.
     9. How are the principles of order and organization demonstrated
in Christ's ministry? Luke 9:12-17; 10:1; Mark 3:13, 14.
     NOTE.—"It was at the ordination of the twelve that the first step
was taken in the organization of the church that after Christ's depar-
 ture was to carry on His work on the earth."—"Gospel Workers," p. 445.
     "The organization of the church at Jerusalem was to serve as a
 model for the organization of churches in every other place where mes-
 sengers of truth should win converts to the gospel. . . . Later in the
 history of the early church, when in various parts of the world many
 groups of believers had been formed into churches, the organization of
 the church was further perfected, so that order and harmonious action
 might be maintained."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 91, 92.
                                   [ 23 ]
   10. What are some of the duties devolving upon each member of
the church?
    Answer.—Attendance at divine service. Heb. 10:25.
            Reverence for the sanctuary. 1 Tim.3 :15 ; 1 Cor.14 :26,40.
            Financial support. 2 Cor. 9:6, 7.
            Cooperatiie endeavor. 1 Cor. 3:9; 1 Peter 3:8-11.
      11. How is the divine ideal for the church set forth? Eph. 4:15, 16.
      NOTE.—"His [God's] church on earth is to assume divine propor-
lions before the world, as a temple built of living stones, each one
 reflecting light. It is to be the light of the world, as a city set on a hill,
,which cannot be hid. It is built of stones laid close together, stone
 fitting to stone, making a firm, solid building. Not all the stones are of
 the same form or shape. Some are large, some are small, but each has
 its own place to fill. And the value of each stone is determined by the
               reflects."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 173.
     12. What process of purification is to take place in the church just
13efore Christ's appearing? Mal. 3:2, 3.
     NoTE.—"The days of purification of the church are hastening on
apace. God will have a people pure and true. In the mighty sifting soon
to take place, wo Shall be better able to measure the strength of Israel.
: . . Many a star that we have admired for its brilliancy, will then go
out in darkness. Chaff like a cloud will be borne away on the wind, even
fforn‘plaxes 'where we see only floors of rich wheat."—Id., vol. 5, pp.
80, fit'
    43:       is.the final triumph of the church described? Rev. 7:9, 10.
   ,,Novz.,-.7`Xlad in the armor of Christ's righteousness, the church is
    enter,upon her final conflict. 'Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and
 terrible as an, army with banners,' she is to go forth into all the world,
 conquering and to conquer. The darkest hour of the church's struggle
 with, the powers of evil, is that which immediately precedes the day of
 her final deliverance. But none who trust in God need fear ; for 'when
 the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall,' God will be
 10. His church 'a refuge from the storm!"—"Prophets and Kings,"

 body as a whole/

             Christ's Parting Gift to the Church
   MEMORY VERSE: "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not
away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto
you." John 16:7.
   KEYNOTE: The indwelling Christ.
                          THE LESSON
   1. What assurance did Jesus give to His sorrowing disciples just
before He left them? John 14:18.
    2. What did Jesus say would be given to His disciples that would
abide in His church until the end of earth's history? Verses 16,.17.
    NomE.—"With the consecrated worker for God, in whatever place he
may be, the Holy Spirit abides. The words spoken to the disciples, are
spoken also to us. The Comforter is ours as well as theirs."—"Acts of
the Apostles," p. 51.
    "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the per-
sonality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with human-
ity, Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for
their interest that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to
be His successor on earth. No one could then have any advantage be-
cause of his location or his personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit
the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer
to them than if He had not ascended on high."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 669.
    3. What is said concerning the personality and work of the Holy
Spirit? 1 John 5:7; Matt. 28:19.
    NOTE.—"It is not essential for us to be able to define just what the
Holy Spirit is. Christ tells us that the Spirit is the Comforter, 'the Spirit
of truth, which proceedeth from the Father.' . . . The nature of the
Holy Spirit is a mystery. Men cannot explain it, because the Lord has
not revealed it to them. Men having fanciful views may bring together
 passages of Scripture and put a human construction on them; but the
acceptance of these views will not strengthen the church. Regarding Such
 mysteries, which are too deep for human understanding, silence is
 golden."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 51, 52.
       4. Of what inestimable value is the gift which Christ chose to bestow
    upon the church? John 14:26.
       NomE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He Gould
    solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit
                                      25
was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice
of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been
strengthening for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic
captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through
the mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead, who would come
with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the
Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world's
Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through
the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ
has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and
cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon
His church."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 671.
    5. How was the promise of the Spirit renewed just before the ascen-
sion of Jesus? Upon what occasion was the promise fulfilled? Acts
1:8; 2:1-4.
    NOTE.—"Pentecost brought them the presence of the Comforter, of
whom Christ had said, He 'shall be in you.' . . . Henceforth through the
Spirit, Christ was to abide continually in the hearts of His children."
—"Steps to Christ," p. 80.
    6. Of what was the visible presence of the Comforter an assurance
concerning the departed Saviour? John 14:18, 20. •
    NOTE.—"When Christ passed within the heavenly gates, He was en-
throned amidst the adoration of the angels. As soon as this ceremony
was completed, the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples in rich
currents, and Christ was indeed glorified, even with the glory which He
had with the Father from all eternity. The Pentecostal outpouring was
Heaven's communication that the Redeemer's inauguration was accom-
plished. According to His promise He had' sent the Holy Spirit from
heaven to His followers, as a token that He had, as priest and king, re-
ceived all authority in heaven and on earth, and was the Anointed One
over His people."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 38, 39.
     7. In view of the fact that the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
are so often referred to in Old Testament history, what special signifi-
cance attended the gift of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost? Acts 2:
33; 10:45.
     NorE.—"During the patriarchal age, the influence of the Holy Spirit
had often been revealed in a marked manner, but never in its fullness.
Now, in obedience to the word of the Saviour, the disciples offered their
supplications for this gift, and in heaven Christ added His intercession.
He claimed the gift of the Spirit, that He might pour it upon His peo-
ple."—Id., p. 37.
     "The more abundant impartation of the Spirit did not take place
till after Christ's ascension. Not until this was received could the dis-
ciples fulfill the commission to preach the gospel to the world. But the
Spirit was now given for a special purpose. Before the disciples could
fulfill their official duties in connection with the church, Christ breathed
His Spirit upon them."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 805.
                                     [ 26 ]
    8. What may we with confidence believe concerning the presence of
the Holy Spirit in the church for all time? Acts 2:38, 39.
    NOTE.—"Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His
church, and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples.
But like every other promise, it is given on conditions. . . . It is given
according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply
every soul according to the capacity to receive."—Id., p. 672.
   9. Why, then, do we not receive and enjoy to a greater degree the
riches of this gift? John 15:7. Answer.—Because we do not fulfill the
conditions.
    NomE.—"There are many who believe and profess to claim the Lord's
promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive
no benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled
by the divine agencies. We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to
use us. Through the Spirit God works in His people 'to will and to do
of His good pleasure.' But many will not submit to this. They want
to manage themselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly
gift."—Ibid.
   10. What is the specific work of the Holy Spirit in the world to-day?
   Answer.—To reprove (margin, "convince") of sin, righteousness,
                 judgment. John 16:8.
             To guide into all truth. Verse 13.
             To comfort hearts. John 14:18.
             To teach and to bring to remembrance. Verse 26.
             To bestow power. Acts 1:8.
    NomE.—"This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other
blessings in its train."—Ibid.
    "In the great and measureless gift of the Holy Spirit are contained
all of heaven's resources."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 419.
   11. What spiritual gifts to the church are bestowed by the Holy
Spirit? Eph. 4:8; 1 Cor. 12:7-11, 28.
   NOTE.—The gift of the Spirit must be distinguished from the gifts
the Holy Spirit bestows.
   12. For what purpose are the gifts of the Holy Spirit bestowed?
 Eph. 4:11, 12.
    NOTE.—Varied renderings of the text are as follows:
         "With a view to the fitting of the saints for the work of min-
            istering."—Rotherham.
         "For the perfecting of God's people in their appointed serv-
             ice."—Conybeare and Howson.
         "In order fully to equip His people for the work of serving."
            —Weymouth.
         "In order to perfect the saints in serviceableness."—Pierson.
    13. How extensive was the influence of the apostolic church in its
 operations after the experience of Pentecost? Rom. 1:7, 8; 10:18.
                                  [27 7
   NOTE.—"The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to tile
utmost bounds of the inhabited world. The hearts of the disciples were
surcharged with a benevolence so full, so deep, so far-reaching, that it
impelled them to go to the ends of the earth. . . . As they proclaimed
the truth as it is in Jesus, hearts yielded to the power of the message."
—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 19.
    14. What assurance is given concerning God's purpose for the fin-
ishing of His work? Rom. 9:28.
    15. What agencies has He provided that this work may close in
power? Rev. 18:1; Joel 2:23.
    NOTE.—"The great work of the gospel is not to close with less mani-
festation of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophe-
cies which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the
opening of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its
close. . . . Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with
holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim the mes-
sage from heaven. By thousands of voices all over the earth, the warn-
ing will be given. . . .
    "The message will be carried not so much by argument as by the
deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have been pre-
sented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up and bear
fruit."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 611, 612.
    16. What admonition is given to the church of the last days? 2 Peter
3:11, 12, 14.
    NOTE.—"For the daily baptism of the Spirit, every worker should
offer his petition to God. Companies of Christian workers should gather
to ask for special help, for heavenly wisdom, that they may know how
to plan and execute wisely. Especially should they pray that God will
baptize His chosen ambassadors in mission fields with a rich measure
of His Spirit. The presence of the Spirit with God's workers will give
the proclamation of truth a power that not all the honor or glory of the
world could give."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 50, 51.
                       Thoughts for Meditation
    1. Have I accepted for my life the great Gift which my beloved Mas-
ter bequeathed to me at the close of His earthly ministry I
    2. Do I know the meaning of the conscious presence of the ascended
Lord?
    3. Am I a faithful steward of the gift or gifts bestowed upon me
by the Holy Spirit, thereby hastening the world-wide proclamation of
the gospel?

    "Those who use their wealth in doing good will see no necessity for
large accumulations in this world; for the treasure which is used to ad-
vance the cause of God, and which is given to the needy in Christ's name,
is given to Christ, and He lays it up for us in the bank of heaven, in
bags which wax not old. He who does this is rich toward God."—"Tes-
timonies," vol. 3, p. 546.

                        - One Talent or Many
    MEMORY VERSE: "The kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto
one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to, every man according
to his'several ability; and straightway took his journey." Matt. 25:14, 15.
    KEYNOTE: Individual accountability.

                            THE LESSON
    1. What shows that the call of God to service is not based on special
 gifts or worldly position? 1 Cor. 1:26.29; James 2:5.
    NoTE.—"In choosing men and women for His service, God does not
ask whether they possess worldly wealth, learning, or eloquence. He
asks, 'Do they walk in such humility that I can teach them My wayl
Can I put My words into their lips? Will they represent Me?' "—"Min-
istry of Healing," p. 37.
    2. What is God's estimate of worldly wisdom? 1 Cor. 1:19, 20; 3:19.
    NOTE.—"Man's inventions often counterwork God's plans. .Those
who build the temple of the Lord, are to build according to the pattern
shown in the mount,—the divine similitude. God is dishonored and the
gospel is betrayed when His servants depend on the counsel of men who
are not under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Worldly wisdom is fool-
ishness with God. Those who rely upon it, will surely err."—"The De-
sire of Ages," p. 354.
    3. What thought should be in the heart of every Christian? Gal. 6:14.
    NOTE.—"The mystery of the cross explains all other mysteries. In
the light that streams from Calvary, the attributes of God which had
filled us with fear and awe appear beautiful and attractive."—"The
Great Controversy," p. 652.
    4. From what source is wisdom and every essential qualification for
efficient service obtained? 1 Cor. 1:30.
    NOTE.—"All that man needs to know or can know of God has been
revealed in the life and character of His Son. . . . It is through the
gift of Christ that we receive every blessing. Through that gift there
comes to us day by day the unfailing flow of Jehovah's goodness."—
"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 286, 287.
   5., How is individual responsibility and accountability in God's
service emphasized in the Scriptures? Matt. 25:14-30.
                                        [ 29 ]
   NOTE.—Another parable in Luke 19:12-26 teaches the same lesson.
To the meek and shrinking man, it is a real joy to know that the one
pound (Luke 19:16) gained ten pounds. It is of interest to note that
the highest denomination of money in two nations is chosen to repre-
sent the gift of the Spirit,—the Roman pound and the Hebrew talent.
   "God desires that His workers in every line shall look to Him as the
Giver of all they possess. All right inventions and improvements have
their source in Him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in work-
ing. The skillful touch of the physician's hand, his power over nerve and.
muscle, his knowledge of the delicate organism of the body, is the wis-
dom of divine power, to be used in behalf of the suffering. The skill
with which the carpenter uses the hammer, the strength with which the
blacksmith makes the anvil ring, comes from God. He has intrusted men
with talents, and He expects them to look to Him for counsel."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 349.
    6. What is the primary purpose in bestowing varied gifts upon the
church? 1 Peter 4:10, 11.
    NOTE.—"To His servants Christ commits 'His goods,'—something
to be put to use for Him. He gives 'to every man his work.' Each has
his place in the eternal plan of heaven. Each is to work in cooperation
with Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place pre-
pared for us in the heavenly mansions than is the special place desig-
nated on earth where we are to work for God."—Id., pp. 326, 327.
    "It was the one with the smallest gift who left his talent unimproved.
In this is given a warning to all who feel that the smallness of their
endowments excuses them from service for Christ. If they could do
some great thing, how gladly would they undertake it; but because they
can serve only in little things, they think themselves justified in doing
nothing. In this they err."—Id., p. 355.
   7. According to what measure are talents apportioned? Matt. 25:15.
    8. What special importance is attached to the talent of time? Eph.
5:16.
    NOTE.—"Our time belongs to God. Every moment is His, and we
are under the most solemn obligation to improve it to His glory. Of no
talent He has given will He require a more strict account than of our
time."—Id., p. 342.
    9. What responsibility is involved in the talent of health and
strength? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; Luke 10:27.
    NOTE.—"Health is a blessing of which few appreciate the value ;
yet upon it the efficiency of our mental and physical powers largely de-
pends. Our impulses and passions have their seat in the body, and it
must be kept in the best condition physically, and under the most
spiritual influences, in order that our talents may be put to the highes't
use."—Id., p. 346.
   10. What does God require in regard to the talent of the mind?
Prov. 2:1-5.
                              303
    NoTE.—"God requires the training of the mental faculties. He de-
signs that His servants shall possess more intelligence and clearer dis-
cernment than the worldling, and He is displeased with those who are
too careless or too indolent to become efficient, well-informed workers.
The Lord bids us love Him with all the heart, and with all the soul, and
with all the strength, and with all the mind. This lays upon us the ob-
ligation of developing the intellect to its fullest capacity, that with all
the mind we may know and love our Creator."—Id., p. 333.
   11. What is the standard governing the talent of speech? Col. 4:6.
   NOTE.—"The power of speech is a talent that should be diligently
cultivated. Of all the gifts we have received from God, none is capable
of being a greater blessing than this. . . . Every Christian is called to
make known to others the unsearchable riches of Christ; therefore he
should seek for perfection in speech. He should present the word of
God in a way that will commend it to the hearers."—Id., pp. 335, 336.
   12. What returns does the Lord expect from the talent which en-
ables its owner to acquire wealth? Deut. 8:18; 1 Tim. 6:17, 18.
     NoTE.—"God also intrusts men with means, He gives them power
to get wealth. . . . And he asks for a return of His own. . . . All we
possess is the Lord's, and we are accountable to Him for the use we make
of it. In the use of every penny it will be seen whether we love God
supremely and our neighbor as ourselves.
     "Money has great value, because it can do great good. In the hands
of God's children it is food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, and
clothing for the naked. It is a defense for the oppressed, and a means
of help to the sick. But money is of no more value than sand, only as
it is put to use in providing for the necessities of life, in blessing others,
and advancing the cause of Christ."—Id., p. 351.
    13. How is the faithful stewardship of talents rewarded? What is
the experience of the one who fails to use his talent? Matt. 25:21, 25-28.
   NoTE.—"The Lord measures with exactness every possibility for
service. The unused capabilities are as much brought into account as
are those that are improved. For all that we might become through the
right use of our talents God holds us responsible."—Id., p. 363.

                         Thoughts for Meditation
    1. Would I pass the test of fitness for God's service?
    2. Am I a diligent student of the science of the cross? Am I making
practical application of this science in personal experience?
    3. Have I ever stopped to count my talents,—"name them one by
one"?
    4. How will my record stand when the Master "scrutinizes every
talent" and "measures with exactness every possibility for service"?

              All the Word to All the World
    MEMORY VERSE: "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the
Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen
upon thee." Isa. 60:1, 2.
    KEYNOTE: Light bearing.
                                THE LESSON
    1. What promise to Abraham sets forth a prophecy of the proclama-
tion of the gospel in all the world? Gen. 12:3.
    NOTE.—"It was a high honor to which Abraham was called, that of
being the father of the people who for centuries were the guardians and
preservers of the truth of God for the world,—of that people through
whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed in the advent of the
promised Messiah."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 140, 141.
    2. How was the same prophecy presented to Moses? Num. 14:21.
    NoTE.—God "imparted to Moses, in the form of a prophecy, a knowl-
edge of His purpose concerning the final triumph of Israel. 'As truly
as I live,' He declared, 'all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the
Lord.' God's glory, His character, His merciful kindness and tender
love,—that which Moses had pleaded in behalf of Israel,—was to be
revealed to all mankind. And this promise of Jehovah was made doubly
sure; it was confirmed by an oath. As surely as God lives and reigns,
His glory should be declared 'among the heathen, His wonders among
all people.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 313.
    3. How was the promise confirmed, centuries later, in the time of
Isaiah? Isa. 27:6.
    NoTE.—"It was concerning the future fulfillment of this prophecy
that Isaiah had heard the shining seraphim singing before the throne,
'The whole earth is full of His glory.' [Isa. 6:3.] The prophet, confident
of the certainty of these words, himself afterward boldly declared of
those who were bowing down to images of wood and stone, 'They shall
see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.' [Isa. 35:2.]"
—Ibid.
   4. In whom centered all the prophecies, promises, and sacrificial
symbolism given to Israel? Deut. 18:15, 18; 1 Cor. 10:1-4.
   NOTE.—"In patriarchal times the sacrificial offerings connected with
divine worship constituted a perpetual reminder of the coming of a
                               1 32
Saviour; and thus it was the entire ritual of the sanctuary services
throughout Israel's history."—Id., p. 684.
    5. What charge did the Lord give to His church at the beginning of
the gospel dispensation? Matt. 28:18-20.
    NOTE.—"The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the
believers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time. It is a
fatal mistake to suppose that the work of saving souls depends alone on
the ordained minister. All to whom the heavenly inspiration has come,
are put in trust with the gospel. All who receive the life of Christ are
ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men. For this work
the church was established, and all who take upon themselves its sacred
vows are thereby pledged to be coworkers with Christ."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 822.
    "It is in doing Christ's work that the church has the promise of His
presence. . . . The very life of the church depends upon her faithful-
ness in fulfilling the Lord's commission. To neglect this work is surely
to invite spiritual feebleness and decay. Where there is no active labor
for others, love wanes, and faith grows dim."—Id., p. 825.
    6. Upon whom did the Lord lay responsibility of leadership in the
fulfillment of the gospel commission? Matt. 10:1, 5-8; 2 Cor. 11:28;
Titus 1:6. Answer.—Upon ministers and church officers.
    NoTE.—"The disciples were to go forth as Christ's witnesses, to
declare to the world what they had seen and heard of Him. Their office
was the most important to which human beings had ever been called,
second only to that of Christ Himself. They were to be workers to-
gether with God for the saving of men. As in the Old Testament the
twelve patriarchs stood as representatives of Israel, so the twelve apos-
tles stand as representatives of the gospel church."—"Acts of the Apos-
tles," p. 19.
    "Solemn are the responsibilities resting upon those who are called
to act as leaders in the church of God on earth."—Id., p. 92.
    7. What relation does every believer sustain to the great commis-
sion? Mark 13:34; Rev. 22:17.
    NOTE.—"In the trust given to the first disciples, believers in every
age have shared. Every one who has received the gospel has been given
sacred truth to impart to the world. God's faithful people have always
been aggressive missionaries, consecrating their resources to the honor
of His name, and wisely using their talents in His service. . . . Not
upon the ordained minister only rests the responsibility of going forth
to fulfill this commission. Every one who has received Christ is called
to work for ,the salvation of his fellow men. 'The Spirit and the bride
say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.' The charge to give this
invitation: includes the entire church. Every one who has heard the in-
vitation is to echo the message from hill and valley, saying, 'Come.' "—
Id., pp. 109, 110.
    8. What is the divinely appointed work of every follower of Christ?
Matt. 4:19; Luke 5:9, 10.
                                  [ 331
    NoTE.—The fisherman concentrates his energies upon the one busi-
ness of catching fish. He sets his nets, or casts his line, and brings in
the fish. At times there are many fish caught (Luke 5:4, 6, 7), and
again there are but few (verse 5).
    "The work of Christ was largely made up of personal interviews.
He had a faithful regard for the one-soul audience. From that one soul
the intelligence received was carried to thousands."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 6, p. 115.
   9. How did the Saviour emphasize the need of tact on the part of
His workmen? Matt. 10:16, last part.
   14. What advice did the apostle Paul give? Eph. 5:15.
   11. What fundamental principles in soul winning are revealed in
the ministry of Christ and of the apostle Paul? John 2:24, 25; 1 Cor.
10:32, 33. Answer.—Jesus knew all men. Paul studied to please men,
and not to give offense.
    12. What confession of sin and consecration to service, as uttered
by David, may well become the prayer of every believer to-day? Ps.
51: 9-13.
   13. What will the church be to the world in the last dark hour of
the reign of sin? Matt. 5:14-16.
    14. What arousing call is sent to every member of this chosen body
of light bearers? Isa. 60:1, 2.
    NorE.—"Christ does not bid His followers strive to shine. He says,
Let your light shine. If you have received the grace of God, the light is
in you. Remove the obstructions, and the Lord's glory will be revealed."
—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 420.
    "While all the world is plunged in darkness, there will be light in
every dwelling of the saints."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 720.

                       Thoughts for Meditation
   1. God's promise to patriarch and prophet in all succeeding ages is
meeting fulfillment in my day. What a privilege is mine!
    2. Am I faithful to the commission given by the Saviour to every
believer
    3. Are my life and my dwelling centers of light in the midst of
earth's darkness I

                        Finishing God's Work
    MEMORY VERSE: "Then saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is
plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that
He will send forth laborers into His harvest." Matt. 9:37, 38.
    KEYNOTE: Finishing God's work.

                                 THE LESSON
   1. What admonition given by Christ to His disciples is particularly
applicable to the disciples of the present day,? John 4:35.
    2. When does the world's harvest take place? Matt. 13:39.
    3. What is the cause of delay in finishing the harvest? Matt. 9:
37, 38.
    NOTE.—"The work of God in this earth can never be finished until
the men and women comprising our church membership rally to the
work, and unite their efforts with those of ministers and church offi-
cers."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 117.
    "If every soldier of Christ had done his duty, if every watchman on
the walls of Zion had given the trumpet a certain sound, the world might
ere this have heard the message of warning. But the work is years be-
hind. While men have slept, Satan has stolen a march upon us."—Id.,
p. 29.
    4. What experience in the ministry of the apostle Paul is being
repeated to-day by the many opening providences in all the world?
Acts 16:9.
    NoTE.—"Never was there greater need of earnest, self-sacrificing
labor in the cause of Christ than now, when the hours of probation are
fast closing, and the last message of mercy is to be given to the world.
My soul is stirred within me as the Macedonian cry comes from every
direction, from the cities and villages of our own land, from across the
Atlantic and the broad Pacific, and from the islands of the sea, 'Come
over and help us"'—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 732.
    5. In what attitude, and with what confidence, should the worker go
forth into the harvest field? Ps. 126:5, 6.
    NOTE.—"Our churches are to cooperate in the work of spiritual till-
ing, with the hope of reaping by and by. There is much perversity to
be met, much thwarting of holy plans and consecrated effort, because of
the evil heart of unbelief. But the work must be done. The soil is stub-
                                        ( 35
born, but the fallow ground must be broken up, the seeds of righteous-
ness must be sown. Pause not, teachers beloved of God, as though
doubtful whether to prosecute a labor which will grow as performed.
Fail not, neither be discouraged. They that sow in tears shall reap in
joy."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 420.
    6. How closely associated are the sowers and the reapers in the great
harvest field? John 4:37, 38; Amos 9:13.
    NOTE.—"God has need of wise men and women who will labor ear-
nestly to accomplish the work committed to them. He will use them as
His instruments in the conversion of souls. Some will sow, and some
will reap the harvest of the seed sown. Let every one do his best to
improve his talents, that God may use him either as a sower or as a
reaper."—"Gospel Workers," p. 410.
   7. What counsel does God give to the sower and reaper concerning
the cultivation of the soil of the heart? Hosea 10:12.
   NOTE.—"The garden of the heart must be cultivated. The soil must
be broken up by deep repentance for sin. Poisonous, ,satanic plants
must be uprooted. The soil once overgrown by thorns can be reclaimed
only by diligent labor. So the evil tendencies of the natural heart can
be overcome only by earnest effort in the name and strength of Jesus."
—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 56.
    8. What provision has the Lord of the harvest made for the quick
ripening of the grain? Hosea 6:3; Isa. 44:3, 4.
    NOTE.—"As the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of the
Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of
the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given at its close, for the
ripening of the harvest."—"The Great Controversy," p. 611.
    9. How should the reapers relate themselves to this provision?
Zech. 10:1.
    NOTE.—"Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of
spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the
Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of
the latter rain; and it is for this added power that Christians are to
send their petitions to the Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter
rain.' "—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 55.
   10. How abundant and complete will be the fulfillment of the prom-
ise? Joel 2:23, 24.
   NOTE.—"The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles
was the 'former rain,' and glorious was the result. But the latter rain
will be more abundant."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 21.
   11. How completely is the world field to be covered with the gospel
seed? Mark 16:15; Rev. 14:6.
   NOTE.—With His consecrated people and the mighty powers of
heaven at His command, God will finish His work—cut it short, thank
God, "in righteousness." God's people will not be looking through
worldly spectacles for guidance in His work. When the world is in the
                                  [361
greatest trouble is the very time when God's people should be doing
their greatest work for soul saving. When the world is most perplexed
and cast down, our path ought to be open, our convictions clearest, our
courage best, our hopes brightest. Jesus is coming, and that means
victory forevermore for all who are His.
   12. What immediately follows the completion of this work? Matt.
24:14; Rev. 14:14-16.
    13. What sad lament will be heard in connection with the ending of
the harvest? Jer. 8:20.
    NOTE.—"Let church members bear in mind that the fact that their
names are registered on the church books will not save them. They
must show themselves approved of God, workmen that need not be
ashamed. Day by clay they are to build their characters in accordance
with Christ's directions. They. are to abide in Him, constantly exer-
cising faith in Him. Thus they will grow up to the full stature of men
and women in Christ,—wholesome, cheerful, grateful Christians, led
by God into clearer and still clearer light. If this is not their' experience,
they will be among those whose voices will one clay be raised in the bitter
lamentation, ;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is
not saved! Why did I not flee to the Stronghold for refuge? Why have
I trifled with my soul's salvation, and done despite to the Spirit of
grace?' "—"Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 47, 48.
   14. What reward awaits those who respond to the Master's call for
reapers? Matt. 13:43; Dan. 12:3.
   NOTE.—"Good works can never purchase salvation, but they are an
evidence of the faith that acts by love and purifies the soul. And though
the eternal reward is not bestowed because of our merit, yet it will be
in proportion to the work that has been done through the grace of
Christ."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 314.

                        Thoughts for Meditation
    1. Do I look with joy to the close of earth's harvest and to Christ's

 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING OVERFLOWS
                       SOUTH AMERICA, No. 1
    During the past two decades the Thirteenth Sabbath overflows have
been sent forward to the mission fields of the world, bringing help and
blessing to the work and workers. These have been additions to the
regular bydget allotments to these fields. That our people may know
what has been accomplished by the overflows, we shall occasionally re-
port by fields on these special offerings. A partial report on the overflow
gifts to South America is given here.
    In 1923 (December), an overflow of $4,153.74 went to this division.
The entire amount was assigned to the normal school at Juliaea, Peru,
in the Lake Titicaca field. This school is the training center for teach-
ers for the Indian day schools, and for workers among the Indians of
Bolivia and Peru.
    In 1926 (March), an overflow of $17,731.78 was given to East and
South Brazil. The following disposition was made of this amount:
      Brazilian Training School                                 $3,000.00
      Goyaz Indian 'Mission (Central Brazil)                     1,731.78
      E. Brazil Mission headquarters                             6,500.00
         (This gift has been greatly appreciated, as it has pro-
      vided healthful living quarters that experienced work-
      ers may remain in the field.)
      Assistance in completing nine church buildings and con-
      ference office (South Brazil Union)                        6,500.00
   You are helping to build up a strong work in mission lands through
your Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings. Every overflow means greater de-
velopment abroad. Plan for a large offering.

    LESSON STUDY                         HET 4PS
                   A    GLANCE over this quarter's lessons reveals
that lesson help notes are in practically every instance quotations
from some of the writings of Mrs. E. G. White. Valuable as these
quotations in the lesson pamphlet are, they are made doubly helpful
if you have access to the books themselves, thus being able to read
the connecting paragraphs for a fuller understanding and further
study of the subject under consideration.
   In the accompanying list of Mrs. White's writings the books to
which references are made this quarter are indicated by a star(*).
Note that nearly every book in the list is thus indicated. This lends
weight to the suggestion that every home and every Bible student
should have personal access to all of Mrs. White's books.
