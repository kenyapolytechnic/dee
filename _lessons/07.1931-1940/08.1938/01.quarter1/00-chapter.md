        Man's Nature—His Condition in Death
MEMORY VERSE: "When this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
  mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that
  is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave,
  where is thy victory." 1 Cor. 15:54, 55.
STUDY HELP: "The Other Side of Death," pp. 11-18.

                             MAN'S CREATION
    1. From what was man made? How did he receive life? Gen. 2:7.
    2. What is the breath of life called in Job? Job 27:3.
    NOTE.—"When God had made man in His image, the human form was
perfect in all its arrangements, but it was without life. Then a personal, self-
existing God breathed into that form the breath of life, and man became a
living, breathing, intelligent being. All parts of the human organism were
put in action. The heart, the arteries, the veins, the tongue, the hands, the
feet, the senses, the perceptions of the mind,—all began their work, and all
were placed under law. Man became a living soul. Through Jesus Christ, a
personal God created man, and endowed him with intelligence and power."
—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 264.
    3. What was man's position after his creation? Ps. 8:4, 5.
                        THE RESULT OF THE FALL
   4. As the result of sin, to what did man become subject? Gen. 2:17;
3:19; Rom. 6:23, first clause.
   5. How does Job define the nature of fallen man? Job 4:17.
   NorE.—Webster defines "mortal" as "subject to death."
   6. On how many of God's creation did the death sentence pass?
Eccl. 3:19; Gen. 7:21, 22.
   NoTE.—"That is, here men, as well as beasts, die. This present life, with
them, as with the rest of the animal creation, is dependent upon their breath.
When this is gone; they, the same as beasts, die. In this respect they have no
pre-eminence over beasts. But men have a future unending life held out

before them, and may, if they will, die in hope of eternal life, which is a very
great pre-eminence over the rest of the animal creation."—"Bible Readings,"
p. 507.
                        THE NATURE OF DEATH
   7. At death to whom does-the breath of life return? Eccl. 12:7.
   NoTE.—"That is, the spirit of life by which man lives, and which is only
lent him of God, at death goes back to the great Author of life. Having come
from Him, it belongs to God, and man can have it eternally only as a gift
from God, through Jesus Christ. Rom. 6:23. When the spirit goes back to
God, the dust, from which man was made a 'living soul' in the beginning, goes
back as it was, to the earth, and the individual no longer exists as a living,
conscious, thinking being, except as he exists in the mind, plan, and purpose
of God through Christ and the resurrection. In this sense 'all live unto Him'
(Luke 20:38), for all are to be raised from the dead. See John 5:28, 29;
Acts 24:15; Rom. 4:17."—"Bible Readings," p. 507.
   8. How is death spoken of by the apostle? 1 Thess. 4:13.
   9. Under what circumstances did Christ use similar words? John
11:11-14.
   10. Where do the dead sleep? Dan. 12:2; Job 17:13.
    11. What relation do the dead sustain to the present world? Ps. 146:
4; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Job 14:12, 21.
    NoTE.—"If one continued in consciousness after death, he would know of
the promotion or dishonor of his sons. But Job says he does not know this.
Not only so, but in death one loses all the attributes of mind,—love, hatred,
envy, etc. Thus it is plain that his thoughts have perished, and that he can
have nothing more to do with the things of this world. But if, as taught and
held by some, man's powers of thought continue after death, he lives; and if
he lives, he must be somewhere. Where is he? Is he in heaven, or in hell?
If he goes to either place at death, what then is the need of a future judgment,
or of a resurrection, or of the second coming of Christ? If the judgment does
not take place at death, but men go to their reward at death, then their
rewards precede their awards, and there would arise the possibility that some
have at death gone to the wrong place, and must needs be sent to the other,
after having been in bliss or torment for ages, perhaps."—"Bible Readings,"
p. 512.
    12. In whom alone is there hope for the righteous dead? John 11:25,
26; Col. 3:3, 4.
    13. To whom only is the hope of a resurrection and eternal life pos-
sible? Rom. 2:7.
     14. How and when will the righteous realize the fulfillment of this
hope? 1 Thess. 4:14-17; 1 Cor. 15:51-55.
     NoTE.—Beyond the fondest hopes of the human heart, more glorious than
the human mind can conceive, grander than faith has ever been able to
picture or human language to express, is God's plan and His provision for the
 faithful. Sin brought death in its train, but Christ brought life and immor-
tality to light; He, the resurrection and the life, has for His loyal ones, a
 future, immortal existence which will banish forever the memory of sin,
                                      f3)
sorrow, and death. It is well worth patient seeking for. Our hearts should
leap with joyful anticipation for its fulfillment.

              Spiritism, Ancient and Modern
MEMORY VERSE: "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principali-
  ties, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
  spiritual wickedness in high places." Eph. 6:12. (See margin.)
STUDY HELP: "The Other Side of Death," pp. 75-91.

                           ANCIENT SPIRITISM
    1. Against what do Christians wrestle? Eph. 6:12, margin.

ancient times warned? Deut. 18:10, 11.
    NoTE.-Divination, witchery, wizards, familiar spirits, and necromancers
were some of the forms under which spiritism manifested itself in ancient times.
Each of these different forms had a variety of ways of manifesting itself to
the people.
    5. On one occasion, how did the king of Babylon practice divination?
Ezek. 21:21: Hosea 4:12.
    6. When sorely pressed by the enemy, for what purpose did Saul
consult a woman with a familiar spirit? 1 Sam. 28:7, 8.
   NOTE.-"It was not God's holy prophet that came forth at the spell of a
                                      [4)
sorcerer's incantation. Samuel was not present in that haunt of evil spirits.
That supernatural appearance was produced solely by the power of Satan.
He could as easily assume the form of Samuel as he could assume that of an
angel of light, when he tempted Christ in the wilderness."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 679.

Oppressed by the horror of despair, it would be impossible for him to inspire his
army with courage. Separated from the Source of strength, he could not lead
the minds of Israel to look to God as their helper. Thus the prediction of evil
would work its own accomplishment."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 681.
   10. What similar punishment came to Ahaziah and Manasseh? 2

Immortality, and the Destruction of the Wicked
MEMORY VERSE: "God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,
  that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
  John 3:16.
LESSON HELPS: "Here and Hereafter," pp. 263-275, 286, 287; "Our Day in the
  Light of Prophecy," pp. 287-293.
                          FOR LIFE OR DEATH
   1. For what purpose did God send Jesus into the world? Matt. 1:21;
9:12, 13.
   2. How many have sinned? Rom. 3:23.
   3. What came upon men as a result of sin? Gen. 2:17; Rom. 5:12.
   4. In what state are all sinners? Eph. 2:1; Col. 2:13.
   5. What transformation takes place in the one who is converted and
accepts Christ? John 5:24; 1 John 3:14.
   6. In what condition do those remain who do not believe on Christ?
1 John 5:12.
   7. In whom is the life of the Christian? 1 John 5:11; Col. 3:3, 4.
   8. When will the Christian actually receive immortality? 1 Cm.. 15:
51-54.
   NOTE.—Faith in Christ translates the believer out of the kingdom of dark-
ness (Col. 1:13), out of the land of the valley of the shadow of death into
the kingdom of His dear Son, out of death unto life; but man does not
actually receive immortality until the resurrection.
               THE DEATH PENALTY—ITS EFFECTIVENESS
   9. How is the final death penalty executed upon the wicked? Rev.
21:8; 20:13-15.
   10. With what kind of fire is the eternal death executed? Matt. 25:41:
3:12.
   11. What will this fire do to the wicked? Mal. 4:1-3; Ps. 37:20.
   NOTE.—"With unquenchable fire." Unquenchable fire is fire that cannot
be put out till it consumes utterly that which it is burning. In many texts of
Scripture the entire destruction of sin and sinners is illustrated by the withered
branches to be burned (John 15:6), by bad fish cast away to corruption
(Matt. 13:47, 48), by the destruction of Sodom by fire (Luke 17:29; 2 Peter
2:5, 6). In the reference in Matthew 3:12 the unquenchable fire is to burn up
the chaff, to completely wipe it out. So it will be with the wicked when the
Lord purges the earth and cleanses it from sin. Malachi speaks of the wicked
reduced to ashes, the revelator says they shall be devoured, while the psalmist
                                      (6)
 speaks of them as consumed away into smoke. Each of these Bible writers
Jives one impression to the mind—that of the complete destruction or anni-
 hilation of the wicked.
     12. In contrast to the reward of the righteous, what do the wicked
 receive? Matt. 25:46.
     NoTE.—"Everlasting punishment" may, and in this case does, mean a
 punishment that is complete, and will never have to be repeated. Sin and
 sinners will be wiped out, destroyed to arise no more. Hence punishment will
 never again be necessary.
     13. What is the end of the wicked? 2 Thess. 1:9; Rev. 21:8.
     14. How complete will be their destruction? Ps. 37:10; Mal. 4:1;
 Nahum 1:9.
    15. In what manner will Satan be destroyed? Ezek. 28:18.
    NOTE.—"Said the angel, 'Satan is the root, his children are the branches.
 They are now consumed root and branch. They have died an everlasting death.
 They are never to have a resurrection, and God will have a clean universe.' "
 —"Early Writings," p. 295.
    16. In view of the human tendency to turn to worldliness and evil,
 what counsel does the prophet Hosea give? Hosea 12:6.
     17. What will be the result of such repentance and continued loy-
 alty? Rom. 2:7.
                             LESSON OUTLINE
 I. FOR LIFE OR DEATH
      1. God sent Christ into the world to save men. Matt. 1:21.
      2. All have sinned—death is the penalty. Rom. 5:12.
      3. The man converted by the gospel is transformed. John 5:24; 1 John
         3:14.
      4. Eternal life, immortality, comes to us only in Christ. 1 John 5:11;
         1 Cor. 15:51-54.
 11. THE DEATH PENALTY—ITS EFFECTIVENESS
      1. Death's final penalty executed. Rev. 21:8; 20:13-15.
       2. Death and destruction of evildoers will be complete and final. Mal.
          4:1-3 ; Ps. 37:20; Matt. 25:46.
       3. Satan will be included in the final destruction of evil. Ezek. 28:18.
       4. God desires man's return to Him and his continual loyalty. Hosea 12:6 ;
          Rom. 2:7.

                      The Ministry of Angels
MEMORY VERSE: "To which of the angels said He at any time, Sit on My right
  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits,
  sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" Heb. 1:13, 14.
STUDY HELP: "Our Day in the Light of Prophecy," pp. 295-301.

                            MESSENGERS OF GOD
   1. Who are the angels? Heb. 1:7, 14.
   NoTE.—The word "angel" is from a Greek word which means "messenger."
Angels are God's messengers to men, but they are more than messengers; they
minister to man's needs, are the agents of God for man's protection, and
record keepers of the lives of human beings.
   2. By what are angels known in the Scriptures?
   ANS WER.—Seraphims (Isa. 6:2) ; cherub (Ezek. 28:14) ; ministering spirits
(Heb. 1:14) ; and angel of the Lord (Matt. 28:2).
   3. What is the position of man as related to angels? Heb. 2:7.
   4. By whom were the angels created? Col. 1:16, 17; John 1:1-3.
   NOTE.—The Saviour is here said to be the creator of all things in heaven
and earth, visible and invisible. Christ Himself, in John 3:16, is stated to be
the "only-begotten Son." The angels are therefore apart of the creation of
God, and of Christ, the agent of creation. Of Christ's work in creation we
read in "The Desire of Ages," page 20:
   "In the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of creation. It was
Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth. .
Upon all things in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the message of the
Father's love."
   5. On what occasion were angels first mentioned? Gen. 3:24.
    6. Name other early occasions in earth's history when angels ap-
peared to men. Gen. 16:7-9; 19:1-3; 22:11, 12.
    7. In Jacob's dream, what illustration of angel ministry is given?
How did this vision meet its fulfillment in Christ? Gen. 28:12; John 1:51.
    NoTE.—In a dream, Jacob beheld earth and heaven connected by a ladder
on which angels of God went about their work of ministering to men. Christ
told Nathaniel that He would be the communicating link between heaven and
earth. Through all time Christ has been the connecting link between fallen
humanity and God. "The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"
alone could, through His sacrifice, His provision for man's salvation, keep
open the one way, in the gift of Himself. He is the ladder that reaches from
earth to heaven.

                      ANGEL MINISTRY TO CHRIST
    8. How did angels co-operate with Christ in His ministry? Rev. 1:1;
22:16.
    9. What did angels do for Jesus while on earth? Matt. 4:11: Luke
22:43.
    NOTE.—"From His earliest years Jesus was guarded by heavenly angels,
yet His life was one long struggle against the powers of darkness."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 71.
    "These angels had been with Christ as guardian angels throughout His
life on earth. They had witnessed His trial and crucifixion."—/d., p. 793.
    "God could not trust His beloved Son with men, even while carrying for-
ward His work for their salvation. He commissioned angels to attend Jesus
and protect Him till He should accomplish His mission on earth, and die by
the hands of those whom He came to save."—Id., p. 67.
                        ANGEL MINISTRY TO MEN
    10. What have angels done for servants of God in ages past?
    ANswER.—Ministered to Elijah (1 Kings 19:4-8) ; shut lions' mouths for
Daniel (Dan. 6:22) ; protected Elisha and his servant (2 Kings 6:14-17).
    NozE.—"Between the servant of God and the hosts of armed foemen was
an encircling band of heavenly angels. They had come down in mighty power,
not to destroy, not to exact homage, but to encamp round about and minister
to the Lord's weak and helpless ones."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 257.
    Other instances might be noted, for the Old Testament records many ex-
periences of angel ministry to God's servants.
    11. What have angels done to those who trangress God's law? Isa.
37:36; Acts 12:23.
    NoTE.—In many cases of flagrant transgression and rebellion against Him,
God has sent His angels as the messengers of wrath. Yet He does not love to
cause suffering to the evildoer, but pleads with him to repent. Even in that
day when His wrath is poured out in final punishment of those who do
wickedly, it will be because of continued unrepentant rebellion. Of the work
of angels in behalf of the evildoer we read:
    "Under God the angels are all powerful. On one occasion, in obedience to
the command of Christ, they slew of the Assyrian army in one night one
hundred and eighty-five thousand men."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 700.
    "God does not send messengers to flatter the sinner. . . . He lays heavy
burdens upon the conscience of the wrongdoer, and pierces the soul with arrows
of conviction. The ministering angels present to him the fearful judgments
of God to deepen the sense of need, and prompt the cry, 'What must I do to
be saved?' "—Id., p. 104.
    "The angels of glory find their joy in giving,—giving love and tireless
watchcare to souls that are fallen and unholy. Heavenly beings woo the hearts
of men; they bring to this dark world light from the courts above; by gentle
and patient ministry they move upon the human spirit, to bring the lost
into a fellowship with Christ which is even closer than they themselves can
know."—Id., p. 21.
     12. Who is the commander of the heavenly messengers? Ps. 68:17.
    'NOTE.—"The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a
                                     (9)
state of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten thousand
times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy beings, all waiting to
do His will. Through these messengers He is in active communication with
every part of His dominion. By His Spirit He is everywhere present. Through
the agency of His Spirit and His angels, He ministers to the children of men."
—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 417.
    "They [God's people] are to contend with supernatural forces, but they
are assured of supernatural help. All the intelligences of heaven are in this
army. And more than angels are in the ranks. The Holy Spirit, the repre-
sentative of the Captain of the Lord's host, comes down to direct the battle."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 352.
    "One part of the ministry of heavenly angels is to visit our world and
oversee the work of the Lord in the hands of His stewards."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 6, p. 456.
    13. Give instances in the New Testament which illustrate the ministry
of angels to human souls. Acts 8:26, 29-39; 12:6-11.
    NOTE.—"This Ethiopian was a man of good standing and of wide influence.
God saw that when converted, he would give others the light he had received,
and would exert a strong influence in favor of the gospel. Angels of God were
attending this seeker for light, and he was being drawn to the Saviour. By
the ministration of the Holy Spirit, the Lord brought him into touch with
one who could lead him to the light."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 107.
    "When the angel had gone, the centurion 'called two of his household serv-
ants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when
he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.' The angel,
after his interview with Cornelius, went to Peter, in joppa."—/d., pp. 134, 135.
    14. How do angels serve to care for and protect God's children? Ps.
34:7; 91:11.
    NOTE.—"It is impossible to give any idea of the experience of the people
of God who shall be alive upon the earth when celestial glory and a repetition
of the persecutions of the past are blended. They will walk in the light
proceeding from the throne of God. By means of the angels there will be
constant communication between heaven and earth."—"Testimonies," vol. 9,
p. 16.
    "My attention was then turned to the company I had seen, who were
mightily shaken. I was shown those whom I had before seen weeping and
praying in agony of spirit. The company of guardian angels around them
had been doubled, and they were clothed with an armor from their head to
their feet."—"Early Writings," p. 271.

    5. Who is the chief foundation stone of the church? 1 Cor. 3:11; 1 Pe-
ter 2:5-9.
    NoTE.—Christ is the chief foundation stone of the church of God. On

the saints. No other foundation than Christ is possible to the true church, the
Israel of God.
    6. Upon what rock was the church in the wilderness founded? 1 Cor.
10:4; Deut. 32:4.
                  THE SIGN OF GOD'S TRUE CHURCH

mans 3:31 and James 2:10-12.)
    NoTE.—The Decalogue, the Ten Commandments, is the fundamental law
of the church of God. It presents the chief ruler—God, the Creator of heaven
                                       [11
and earth. It states our duty to Him, and it lays down the fundamental
principles of the relationship between members of His family.

    11. What covenant does the Lord make with His people? Heb. 8:10.
   NOTE.—"The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone is
written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going about
to establish our own righteousness, we accept the righteousness of Christ.
His blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted for us. Then the
heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth 'the fruits of the Spirit.'
Through the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience to the law of God
written upon our hearts. Having the Spirit of Christ, we shall walk even as
He walked. Through the prophet He declared of Himself, 'I delight to do Thy
will, 0 My God; yea, Thy law is within My heart.' And when among men
He said, 'The Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always those things that
please Him.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 372. ,

   13. What promise is made concerning the remnant? Rom. 9:27, 28.
   14. What are the characteristics of the "remnant" of the church? Rev.
14:12; 12:17.
   NoTE.—A remnant is a part of and exactly like the whole. The remnant
church will measure up to the law of God, which is the law of God's church,
just as the saints have ever been obedient to His will. They will keep the
commandments of God, and hold to the faith of Jesus. In true loyalty to the
principles of the kingdom they will abide to the end.
     15. Eventually what will be the home of the church? John 14:1-3;
Rev. 21:1-3.

                             Spiritual Gifts
MEMORY VERSE: "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
  prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
  governments, diversities of tongues." 1 Cor. 12:28.
STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 327, 328; (new ed., pp. 329, 330).

                        THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT

on His work? John 14:26; 16:13.
    2. What work had been given to the church? Matt. 28:18-20.
    3. What gifts were given to the church for the prosecution of the task
committed to them? 1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:7-13.
    4. What are these gifts called? Why are they so called? 1 Cor. 12:
1, 11.
    NOTE.—These gifts are called "spiritual" gifts because they are distributed
through and ministered by the Holy Spirit.
    5. How are the gifts of the Spirit distributed? 1 Cor. 12:4-6, 11.
    NorE.—To the members of the church He has given what Paul, the mis-
sionary apostle, calls "the gifts of the Spirit." The work of the Holy Spirit
upon the individual heart is one of its functions. The work of the Spirit
through individuals by the gifts of the Spirit is another. The gifts of the Spirit
are bestowed upon the membership of the church of Christ to make possible
successful winning of the unconverted souls.
                   GIVEN TO DEVELOP THE CHURCH
    6. What should be the attitude of the members of the church to these
gifts? 1 Cor. 12:31.
    7. What is expected of one who receives a gift? 1 Peter 4:10; Rom.
12:6-8.
                                      113 7
    8. How long were Christ's servants to whom He had given gifts to
continue their labors? Luke 19:12, 13.
    NOTE.—"The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially
the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit. 'To one is given by the
Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same
Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by
the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy;
to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another
the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame
Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.' All men do not receive the
same gifts, but to every servant of the Master some gift of the Spirit is
promised. . . .
    "The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents represented in the
parable. It includes all gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired,
natural or spiritual. All are to be employed in Christ's service. In becoming
His disciples, we surrender ourselves to Him with all that we are and have.
These gifts He returns to us purified and ennobled, to be used for His glory in
blessing our fellow men."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 327, 328.
    9. What is the purpose of these gifts? Eph. 4:11-13.
               ATTRIBUTES OF THE REMNANT CHURCH
    10. How many of the gifts of the Spirit will be found in the church
which awaits our Lord's return? 1 Cor. 1:7.
    11. Which gift is especially mentioned as belonging to the remnant
church? Rev. 12:17. (Compare with Revelation 19:10.)
    12. Upon what condition is the Holy Ghost given? How long will He
continue in and bless the church? John 14:15, 16.
    NoTE.—As long as the people of God love Him and remain faithful to
His law, the Ten Commandments, the Holy Spirit will co-operate with thein
and work through them. But when an individual, or the body of the church
as a whole, turns away from and deliberately rejects the law of God, the Holy
Spirit can no longer use them. They, themselves, from that time forth stand
in need of ministry, and are not in a position to minister spiritually to others.
One may go so far, while still professedly a Christian, that even his prayers
become an abomination to God. Prov. 28:9. If the church as a whole thus
departs from God, we are told that her prophets find no vision. God no longer
speaks through them. Lam. 2:9. But God's true remnant church will be a
commandment-keeping church, and will have the testimony of Jesus in their
midst. Rev. 12:17; see also Rev. 14:12.
                               LESSON OUTLINE
I. THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT

                 Spiritual Gifts (Concluded)
MEMORY VERSE: "Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
  upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto Me." Acts 1:8.
STUDY HELP: "Acts of the Apostles," pp. 35-56.

                PENTECOST AND THE GIFT OF TONGUES
    1. After giving the disciples their work, what did Jesus say as to
where and when they should begin their labors? Luke 24:47-49.
   NoTE.—The disciples were not to enter upon the fuller ministry to which
they had been called until they had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
The coming of the Holy Ghost in the form of cloven tongues of fire on the day
of Pentecost was the signal from heaven for them to go forth in obedience to
Christ's command to "go, . . . teach all nations." Obedient to that summons
they went forth, humble fishermen made bold, courageous, efficient, by the
Spirit's presence in their lives.
    2. What was the condition of their hearts that ultimately made the
fulfillment of this promise possible? Acts 1:14; 2:1.
   NoTE.—"The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to meet
men, and in their daily intercourse to speak words that would lead sinners to
Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for the supremacy, they came
close together in Christian fellowship. They drew nearer and nearer to God,
and as they did this, they realized what a privilege had been theirs in being
permitted to associate so closely with Christ."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 37.
    3. At what time and under what conditions was the promised out-
pouring given? Acts 2:1-4.
    4. Who spoke on the day of Pentecost? What spiritual gift was mani-
fested? Acts 2:4-7, 14.
    5. What made necessary the exercise of the gift of tongues on this
occasion? Verses 8-1L
    NOTE.—" 'There were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.' During the dispersion, the Jews had been scat-
tered to almost every part of the inhabited world, and in their exile they had
learned to speak various languages. Many of these Jews were on this occa-
sion in Jerusalem, attending the religious festivals then in progress. Every
known tongue was represented by those assembled. This diversity of Ian-
                                     [15
guages would have been a great hindrance to the proclamation of the gospel;
God therefore in a miraculous manner supplied the deficiency of the apostles.
The Holy Spirit did for them that which they could not have accomplished
for themselves in a lifetime. They could now proclaim the truths of the gospel
abroad, speaking with accuracy the languages of those for whom they were
laboring. This miraculous gift was a strong evidence to the world that their
commission bore the signet of Heaven. From this time forth the language of
the disciples was pure, simple, and accurate, whether they spoke in their native
tongue or in a foreign language."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 39, 40.
    6. What is the rule given by the apostle Paul for the use of tongues
in the church? 1 Cor. 14:26-28.
    NOTE.—On the day of Pentecost the gift of tongues was exercised because
it was necessary, and would not have been exercised if no one could have
understood them. In the exercise of the true gift of tongues, every man heard
in the tongue in which he was born.
    7. For whose sake was the gift of tongues given? 1 Cor. 14:22.
                  OTHER GIFTS IN THE EARLY CHURCH
    8. What gift of the Spirit was manifested in the apostolic church?
Acts 15:32; 11:27, 28; 21:8-10.
    9. What instruction concerning the gift of healing has been given the
church? James 5:13-16. (Compare with the earlier exercise of this gift
in Mark 6:13.)
    10. What gift was exercised by Peter and John? Acts 3:1-11.
    11. What further examples have we of the use of this gift? Acts 5:
15, 16; 19:12.
    12. What prophecy of Jesus was fulfilled by the apostles in the exer-
cise of this gift of healing? John 14:12.
    13. What gifts belonging to the chur.ch have been counterfeited by
Satan? 2 Cor. 11:13-15; Rev. 13:14.
    NOTE.—Satan has counterfeited the gifts of the Spirit in the past, and will
continue increasingly to do so in the future. By this means he seeks to con-
fuse minds, and lead men to reject the true gifts of God. Among the instances
of counterfeit workings by Satan are those recorded in the following: Matt.
7:15;1 John 4:1; Rev. 16:14.
    14. How may the genuine gifts be distinguished from the counter-
feit? Matt. 7:20; 1 John 4:1, 2; Isa. 8:20.
    NoTE.—No Christian need be deceived by false prophets or spurious mir-
acle workers. God has given infallible rules by which to judge professed serv-
ants of His. The fruitage of their lives; their loyalty to the commands of
God as given in His word; the measure of their love for, and manifestation of,
the Spirit of Jesus, are the factors which will either justify or condemn them.
                              LESSON OUTLINE
I. PENTECOST AND THE GIFT OF TONGUES
    1. The disciples were to await the outpouring of the Spirit. Luke 24:47-49.
     2. Conversion and unity of heart were first essentials. Acts 1:14; 2:1.
                                     [16)
     3. When they were thus prepared, the Spirit appeared as cloven tongues.
        Acts 2:1-4.
     4. To meet the special need the gift of tongues accompanied Pentecost.

                             BAPTISM OF CHRIST
    1. What is the meaning of the word "baptism"?
    ANSWER.-"Baptism" is a word taken from the Greek, and means to "im-
merse, to dip, to plunge in10."
    2. What ordinance did Jesus receive before beginning His earthly
ministry? Matt. 3:13.
    3. What mode of baptism was used by John in baptizing Jesus?
Where was He baptized? Matt. 3:16: Mark 1:5, 9.
    NorE.-Jesus was baptized of John in Jordan. He "went up straightway
out of the water." The baptism of Christ was by immersion. No other method
of water baptism is taught in the Bible.
    4. What public announcement was made by God at Jesus' baptism?
Matt. 3:17.
    NOTE.-"These words of confirmation were given to inspire faith in those
who witnessed the scene, and to strengthen the Saviour for His mission."-
"The Desire of Ages," p. 112.
    5. Where else did John baptize? Why? John 3:23.
    6. How did he interpret the baptismal experience of Christ? John
1 :31 -34.
                                       I 17 )
   NorE.—Baptism was instituted by, God. John the Baptist was the first to
baptize. He was sent before Jesus to prepare the way of the Lord. It was most
appropriate that he should administer the ordinance which initiated Jesus into
His great work of preaching the gospel. Jesus was anointed to preach. He was
anointed by the Holy Ghost at His baptism.
    7. By what prophetic utterance did Isaiah indicate the work of
Christ? Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:17, 18.
    8. How many baptisms are there? Eph. 4:5.
    NOTE.—The Bible recognizes but one form of baptism, that of immersion.
Christ was baptized "in the Jordan ;" the eunuch went down "into the water"
and "came up out of the water." Baptism is to be accompanied by the giving
of God's Spirit, as says Peter, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you, . . .
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Acts 2:38. As Christ comes
into the life, His Spirit takes possession of the soul, and it is no longer we who
live, "but Christ liveth" in us. (See Gal. 2:20.) There is, however, but one
baptism, and the gift of the Holy Spirit is a part, a complement, of that bap-
tism.

    9. What did Jesus commission His disciples to do? Matt. 28:18, 19;
Mark 16:15, 16.
    10. How did Peter relate himself to this command on the day of
Pentecost? What would accompany their baptism? Acts 2:38, 39.
    NorE.—Peter definitely indicates that one who is baptized into Christ will
receive the Holy Spirit to guide into truth, to lead in service. The Holy Spirit
is given not for us to use, but to use us. In other words, He empowers, pre-
pares, and fits the Christian to live for and serve his Lord. God has given to
every man hisawork, and when the heart and life are surrendered, the first
and greatest desire is to make Christ known to others. For this purpose the
gifts of the Spirit are bestowed.
    11. When God made choice of Paul to be the apostle to the Gen-
tiles, what was the first thing he was commanded to do? Acts 22:12-16.
    12. Why is baptism necessary? John 3:3-5.
   13. What relationship to Christ and to the church is established by
baptism? Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 12:13.
   14. What two distinct acts of Jesus are memorialized by baptism? In
what way? Rom. 6:3, 4; Col. 2:12.
    NorE.—Paul here recognizes in his reference to the death and burial of
Christ and to His resurrection from the dead, the true significance of baptism.
Those who are baptized are buried with Christ, and rise to walk in newness
of life in Him.
    15. What are the prerequisites for baptism?
   ANswER.—Prerequisites for baptism are: (1) Men must be taught the
gospel, Matt. 28:19; (2) they must believe with all the heart, Acts 8:36-38;
(3) they must repent of sins committed, Acts 2:38; (4) they must die to, or
cease from, sin, Rom. 6:2-6.
                                      [18]
    16. How do we know that baptism is a required ordinance? John
3:3, 5; Acts 2:37, 38; Mark 16:15, 16.
   NoTE.-Jesus said to Nicodemus, "Except a man be born of water and of
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." He spoke impera-
tively to His disciples, "Go," "teach," "baptize." If it is imperative for the
minister to baptize, it is equally imperative for the candidate for the church
of Christ to receive baptism for the remission of sins.

                 MEMORIALS ESTABLISHED OF GOD
   1. What is God's desire with regard to His wonderful works? Ps.
111:4.
   2. What is God's memorial of creation? Ex. 20:8-11.
   3. What memorial of Israel's Exodus from Egypt did God establish?
Ex. 13:3-10; Deut. 16:1-8.
   4. What is God's memorial of the resurrection of Jesus? Rom. 6:4, 5;
Col. 2:12.
                                     [ 19 1
    NOTE.—Of all the events in the Biblical program, the resurrection is of
most interest, if not actually of most importance, to the people of God. God
has memorialized this great event by the ceremony of baptism. The popular
Christian church has largely ignored God's memorial, and put in its stead
a man-made memorial. The reason assigned for the observance of the first
day of the week instead of the seventh day as a Sabbath is that it is observed
as a memorial of the resurrection. The Bible has never commanded and
approved such a memorial.
                            THE LORD'S SUPPER
     5. What memorial service was instituted by Jesus the night of His
betrayal? 1 Cor. 11:23-25; Matt. 26:26-29.
     6. To what covenant did this ordinance belong? Matt. 26:28; 1 Cor.
11:25.
     7. When did the ordinances of this covenant become effective and
of binding obligation on Christians? Heb. 10:9, 10.
    NorE.—The ordinances connected with the first covenant came to an end
when the services of the earthly sanctuary ceased, and Christ •gave His life
as the Lamb of God. Before His death He provided for the memorials of
the new testament. These were ever after to be celebrated by His followers
"till He come." These new covenant ordinances are to be a constant reminder
of what Christ has done for His brethren, of our need of Him in daily life,
and of our life with Him, if we are faithful, in that better land where we
shall dwell with Him forever.
     8. What ordinance was Jesus celebrating with His disciples on the
night He was betrayed? On the same night, what ordinance did Jesus
institute to take its place? Luke 22:15-20; Matt. 26:26.
    NOTE.—"Christ was standing at the point of transition between two econ-
omies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb of God, was
about to present Himself as a sin offering, and He would thus bring to an
end the system of types and ceremonies that for four thousand years had
pointed to His death. As He ate the Passover with His disciples, He insti-
tuted in its place the service that was to be the memorial. of His great sacri-
fice. The national festival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The service
which Christ established was to be observed by His followers in all lands
and through all ages."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 652.
     9. With what kind of bread and wine was the Passover observed?
Matt. 26:17; Lev. 23:4-6; Ex. 12:8.
    NOTE.—"Christ is still at the table on which the paschal supper has been
spread. The unleavened cakes used at the Passover season are before Him.
The Passover wine, untouched by fermentation, is on the table. These em-
blems Christ employs to represent His own unblemished sacrifice. Nothing
corrupted by fermentation, the symbol of sin and death, could represent the
`Lamb without blemish and without spot.'"—"The Desire of Ages," p. 653.
     10. To what great event does the Lord's Supper look forward? Matt.
26:29; 1 Cor. 11:26.
                      THE ORDINANCE OF HUMILITY
     11. What other service was instituted on the same night Christ insti-
tuted the new covenant ordinances? John 13:1-12.
                                     120]
   12. What did Jesus tell the disciples they ought to do? Verse 14.
     NOTE.—"To those who receive the spirit of this service, it can never
become a mere ceremonial. Its constant lesson will be, 'By love serve one
another.' In washing the feet of His disciples, Christ gave evidence that
He would do any service, however humble, that would make them heirs
with Him of the eternal wealth of heaven's treasure. His disciples, in per-
forming the same rite, pledged themselves in like manner to serve their
brethren. Whenever this ordinance is rightly celebrated, the children of God
are brought into a holy relationship, to help and bless each other. They
covenant that the life shall be given to unselfish ministry. And this, not
only for one another. Their field of labor is as wide as their Master's was.
The world is full of those who need our ministry. The poor, the helpless,
the ignorant, are on every hand. Those who have communed with Christ
in the upper chamber, will go forth to minister as He did."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 651.
     13. By this service what did Jesus say He had given them? Verse 15.
                                LESSON OUTLINE
I. MEMORIALS ESTABLISHED OF GOD
     1. God desires His works to be remembered. Ps. 111:4.
     2. He has established memorials of creation (Ex. 20:8-11) ; of Israel's
        Exodus (Ex. 13:3-10) ; of Christ's resurrection (Rom. 6:4, 5).
11. THE LORD'S SUPPER
     1. Christ instituted the Lord's Supper the night of His betrayal. 1 Cor.
        11:23-25.
     2. It is an ordinance of the new testament, or covenant. Matt. 26:28;
        1 Cor. 11:25.
     3. It takes the place of the Passover of the old covenant. Luke 22:15-20.
     4. Unleavened bread and unfermented wine were used as symbols. Matt.

STUDY HELP: "The Ministry of Healing," pp. 287-310.
        DISEASE A RESULT OF MAN'S TRANSGRESSION
  1. What principle should govern and control the life of the Christian?
Why? 1 Cor. 6:20; 10:31.
  2. What is God's will for His people? Ps. 67:2; Jer. 30:17.
                                 ( 21 )
    3. When and where did disease originate? What was the cause of
its wide dissemination? Gen. 3:3, 6; Deut. 28:15, 22, 58-62.
    Nora—The first transgression of the law of God took place in Eden.
God had said to Adam and Eve, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou
shalt surely die," or, as the marginal reading gives it, "dying thou shalt die."
That one transgression brought sentence of death upon our first parents.
Sickness, disease, and death have followed as a natural consequence. As man
continued his course of sin, and wickedness became almost universal, disease
increased.
    4. What is essential to good health? 3 John 2; Prov. 4:20-22.
    NOTE.—"The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the
body. The spiritual healing was followed by physical restoration. This les-
son should not be overlooked. There are today thousands suffering from
physical disease, who, like the paralytic, are longing for the message, 'Thy
sins are forgiven.' The burden of sin, with its unrest and unsatisfied desires,
is the foundation of their maladies. They can find no relief until they come
to the Healer of the soul. The peace which He alone can give, would impart
vigor to the mind and health to the body."—"Tlie Desire of Ages," p. 270.
    5. What caused the spiritual fall and punishment of the following:
Adam and Eve (Genesis 3; Rom. 5:12); Esau (Gen. 25:29-34; Heb. 12:16);
ancient Israel (Num. 11:4); the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah
(Luke 17:27-29; Ezek. 16:49)?
            MAN'S DIET—BEFORE AND AFTER SIN ENTERED
    6. What food was originally given to man? Gen. 1:29, 30; 2:16.
    7. What is the earliest record of flesh eating? What prohibition was
given with the permission to eat animal food? Gen. 9:2-4.
    NorE.—God's permission to the people after the Flood to use flesh food
was premised upon the condition of the world at that time. Originally He
had given them "every herb bearing seed, . . . every tree, in the which is the
fruit of a tree yielding seed." Owing to the hardness of men's hearts, God
had later permitted many things that were not according to His original pur-
pose for mankind. In these last days we have this instruction:
    "A solemn responsibility rests upon those who know the truth, that all
their works shall correspond with their faith, and that their lives shall be
refined and sanctified, and they be prepared for the work that must rapidly
be done in these closing days of the message. They have no time or strength
to spend in the indulgence of appetite."
    "Flesh foods are injurious to the physical well-being, and we should learn
to do without them. Those who are in a position where it is possible to
secure a vegetarian diet, but who choose to follow their own preferences in
this matter, eating and drinking as they please, will gradually grow careless
of the instruction the Lord has given regarding other phases of the present
truth, and will lose their perception of what is truth; they will surely reap
as they have sown."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 154, 156.
                  TEMPERANCE A CHRISTIAN GRACE
   8. Which Christian grace comes before patience? Of what is it a
fruit? 2 Peter 1:6; Gal. 5:22, 23.
                                   [22]
   9. What lesson of temperance is given by the apostle Paul? 1 Cor.
9:25.
    NoTE.—Moderation in all things good, is the rule for the Christian. This
comprehends eating, drinking, working, sleeping, recreation, etc.
    "The principles of temperance must be carried further than the mere use
of spirituous liquors. The use of stimulating and indigestible food is often
equally injurious to health, and in many cases sows the seeds of drunken-
ness. True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with everything hurt-
ful, and to use judiciously that which is healthful."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 562.
    10. How far reaching are the results of intemperance? Ex. 20:5.
    NOTE.—"Fathers as well as mothers are involved in this responsibility.
Both parents transmit their own characteristics, mental and physical, their
dispositions and appetites, to their children. As the result of parental in-
temperance, children often lack physical strength and mental and moral
power. Liquor drinkers and tobacco users may, and do, transmit their insa-
tiable craving, their inflamed blood and irritable nerves, to their children.
The licentious often bequeath their unholy desires, and even loathsome dis-
eases, as a legacy to their offspring. And as the children have less power to
resist temptation than had the parents, the tendency is for each generation
to fall lower and lower. To a great degree, parents are responsible, not only
for the violent passions and perverted appetites of their children, but for
the infirmities of the thousands born deaf, blind, diseased, or idiotic."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 561.
    11. What are some of the things prohibited to the child of God?
Prov. 23:31; Lev. 11:7,8, 26, 41-44.
    NoTE.—"The angel's prohibition included 'every unclean thing.' The dis-
tinction between articles of food as clean and unclean was not a merely cere-
monial and arbitrary regulation, but was based upon sanitary principles."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 562.

                    KEEPING THE TEMPLE HOLY
   12. What will be the fate of those who defile the temple of God?
1 Cor. 3:16, 17.
   13. How is this temple more fully defined by the apostle? 1 Cor.
6:19, 20.
    14. How may man be defiled? 2 Cor. 7:1.
   'NOTE.—These two component parts of man are so closely related to each
other that what defiles the one reacts against the other. As Peter says, "Ab-
stain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." 1 Peter 2:11.
    "That which corrupts the body tends to corrupt the soul. It unfits the
user for communion with God, unfits him for high and holy service."—"The
Ministry of Healing," p. 280.
    15. What outstanding Bible characters illustrate proper principles in
eating and drinking? How were they rewarded? Dan. 1:8-19.
    16. What admonition regarding eating and drinking is given? 1 Cor.
10:31.
                                    ( 23
     17. What was the first point on which Satan tempted Jesus in the
wilderness? What lesson should be learned from it? Matt. 4:3, 4.
     NOTE.-"Of all the lessons to be learned from our Lord's first great temp-
tation, none is more important than that bearing upon the control of the
appetites and passions. In all ages, temptations appealing to the physical
nature have been most effectual in corrupting and degrading mankind.
Through intemperance, Satan works to destroy the mental and moral powers
that God gave to man as a priceless endowment. Thus it becomes impossible
for men to appreciate things of eternal worth. Through sensual indulgence,
Satan seeks to blot from the soul every trace of likeness to God."-"The
Desire of Ages," p. 122.

     1. God provided a nonflesh diet to Adam and Eve. Gen. 1:29, 30; 2:16.
     2. Flesh first permitted after the Flood. Gen. 9:2-4.
I11. TEMPERANCE A CHRISTIAN GRACE

     3. Daniel an example of true temperance. Dan. 1:8-19.
     4. In all things we are to honor God. 1 Cor. 10:31.
     5. As he did with Christ, the enemy seeks to overthrow Christians on the
        point of appetite. Matt. 4:3, 4.

            •             LOVE NOT THE WORLD

   1. What counsel is given the church with reference to the world?
1 John 2:15-17; Col. 3:2.
                                      f   24 1
    NoTE.—The text has reference to a love of worldly pleasure, to the tem-
poral, transitory things of the world. A love for sinners in a spiritual sense
is not included, for through the example and teachings of the Master we are
taught to seek and to save the lost; but our heart's affections are to be on
our heavenly Father and our heavenly home.
    2. How does God regard one who seeks to be a friend to the world?
James 4:4.
    3. In the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, on what point did
Satan climax his temptation? Matt. 4:8.
    NOTE.—"By the one who had revolted in heaven, the kingdoms of this
world were offered Christ, to buy His homage to the principles of evil; but
He would not be bought. . . . With the same temptation Satan approaches
men, and here he has better success than with Christ. To men he offers the
kingdom of this world on condition that they will acknowledge his suprem-
acy."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 130.
    4. What desire was the beginning of Israel's downfall as a kingdom?
How was their desire regarded by God? 1 Sam. 8:5, last clause, 19,
20, 7.
    NorE.—In desiring to be like all the nations around them and to separate
themselves from God's own plan of leadership, Israel sinned. God had Him-
self, through His prophets, guided the destinies of His people. In seeking
human leadership, they were rejecting God. The desire to be like the world
led eventually to their downfall.
    5. How does love of the world often manifest itself? Ezek. 16:49; Isa.
3:16.
    NorE.—A love of the world manifests itself in pride, haughtiness, love of
display, idleness, and feasting. Perhaps in no other way is it more marked
in mankind than in their love of display upon the person, in the home, and in
public. Many are the ways, however, in which it may make itself seen and
felt.
       MAN'S ATTIRE CHANGED BECAUSE OF DISOBEDIENCE
    6. Who made the first artificial garments for man? Why were they
made? Gen. 3:7, 8. 10. 21.
    NOTE.—"The sinless pair [Adam and Eve] wore no artificial garments;
they were clothed with a covering of light and glory, such as the angels wear.
So long as they lived in obedience to God, this robe of light continued to
enshroud them."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 45.
    "The robe of light which had enshrouded them, now disappeared, and
to supply its place they endeavored to fashion for themselves a covering;
for they could not, while unclothed, meet the eye of God and holy angels."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 57.
   7. What purposes were served by the garments of the priests? Ex.
28:2.
            GOSPEL COUNSEL REGARDING ADORNMENT
   8. What counsel concerning dress does the apostle Paul give?
1 Tim. 2:9.
                                    [26]
    9. Wherein does Peter say the greatest personal adornment lies?
1 Peter 3:4.
    NorE.—"Self-denial in dress is a part of our Christian duty. To dress
plainly, and abstain from display of jewelry and ornaments of every kind
is in keeping with our faith."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 366.
    "I have been shown that the main cause of your backsliding is your love
of dress.... Fashion is deteriorating the intellect and eating out the spiritual-
ity of our people. Obedience to fashion is pervading our Seventh-day Advent-
ist churches, and is doing more than any other power to separate our people
from God."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 647.
    "Lead the youth to see that in dress, as in diet, plain living is indispensable
to high thinking."—"Education," p. 248.
      10. What counsel has been given us concerning the clothing of the
body?
     ANSWER.—"The Bible teaches modesty in dress. 'In like manner also,
that women adorn themselves in modest apparel.' This forbids display in
dress, gaudy colors, profuse ornamentation. Any device designed to attract
attention to the wearer or to excite admiration, is excluded from the modest
apparel which God's word enjoins. . . .
     "In the professed Christian world enough is expended for jewels and
needlessly expensive dress to feed all the hungry and to clothe the naked.
Fashion and display absorb the means that might comfort the poor and the
suffering. They rob the world of the gospel of the Saviour's love. Missions
languish. Multitudes perish for want of Christian teaching. Beside our own
doors and in foreign lands the heathen are untaught and unsaved. . . .
     "In the day of God, when brought face to face with Him who gave His
life for these needy ones, what excuse will those offer who are spending their
time and money upon .indulgences that God has forbidden? . . .
     "But our clothing, while modest and simple, should be of good quality,
of becoming colors, and suited for service. It should be chosen for dura-
bility rather than display. It should provide warmth and proper protection.
. . . Our dress should be cleanly. Uncleanliness in dress is unhealthful, and
thus defiling. to the body and to the soul. ... In all respects the dress should
be healthful. 'Above all things,' God desires us to 'be in health,'—health of
body and of soul. And we are to be workers together with Him for the health
of both soul and body. Both are promoted by healthful dress.
     "It should have the grace, the beauty, the appropriateness, of natural sim-
plicity. Christ has warned us against the pride of life, but not against its
grace and natural beauty.... The most beautiful dress He bids us wear upon
the soul. No outward adorning can compare in value or loveliness with that
`meek and quiet spirit' which in His sight is 'of great price.'"—"The Ministry
of Healing," pp. 287-289.
   11. What articles and classes of apparel are prohibited by the Bible?
1 Peter 3:3; 1 Tim. 2:9.
   12. What may those expect who separate themselves from the world?
John 15:18, 19.
   NOTE.—"We must not expect to please ourselves, live and act like the
                                      [26)
world, have its pleasures, and enjoy the company of those who are of the
world, and reign with Christ in glory."—"Early Writings," p. 47.
    13. What two classes of servants will Jesus find when He comes?
What will each class be doing? Matt. 24:45-51.
    NOTE.—"That evil servant who said in his heart, 'My Lord delayeth his
coming;' professed to be waiting for Christ. He was a 'servant' outwardly
devoted to the service of God, while at heart he had yielded to Satan. He
does not, like the scoffer, openly deny the truth, but reveals in his life the
sentiment of the heart,—that the Lord's coming is delayed. Presumption
renders him careless of eternal interests. He accepts the world's maxims, and
conforms to its customs and practices. Selfishness; worldly pride, and ambi-
tions predominate. Fearing that his brethreh may stand higher than himself,
he begins to disparage their efforts and impugn their motives. Thus he smites
his fellow servants. As he alienates himself from the people of God, he unites
more and more with the ungodly. He is found 'eating and drinking with the
drunken,'—joining with worldings, and partaking of their spirit. Thus he
is lulled into a carnal security, and overcome by forgetfulness, indifference,,
and sloth."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 101.
    "Those who link in sympathy with the world are eating and drinking
with the drunken, and will surely be destroyed with the workers of iniquity."
—Id., p. 212.

             Reverence for the House of God
MEMORY VERSE: "Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary:
  I am the Lord." Lev. 19:30.
STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 491-500.
                     A DWELLING PLACE FOR GOD
    1. For what purpose was the sanctuary erected? Ex. 25:8.
    2. What did God's presence do for the sanctuary? Ex. 29:43, 44.
    3. What, then, should have been the attitude of the congregation to
the sanctuary? Lev. 19:30.
    4. What does it mean to reverence anything? Heb. 12:9.
    NoTE.—The word "reverence" means to respect, to honor, to fear, to bow
in holy esteem to, etc. For example, see 2 Sam. 9:6; 1 Kings 1:31; Eph. 5:33.
    5. Realizing God's presence in His holy temple, what should be the
attitude of the congregation? Hab. 2:20.
    6. How was this principle illustrated when God appeared to Moses?
Ex. 3:2-6. (See also 1 Kings 19:12, 13; Isa. 6:1-5.)
    7. When God came down upon Mount Sinai, how were Israel in-
structed to conduct themselves? Ex. 19:10-13, 22-24.
    8. How did God's presence affect Israel? Deut. 5:23-28.
   NOTE.—Israel    feared to come directly into the presence of God. Their
one experience at Sinai led them to ask that Moses be their representative,
meeting with God, and bringing back to them His commands. In the con-
tacts that men have had with God either directly, or in vision, or through
His messengers, they have learned to come into His presence with awe and
reverence. For example, Job in Job 42:5, 6; Peter in Luke 5:8, 9; Manoah
and his wife in Judges 13:18-20; Daniel in Dan. 10:6-8; Paul in Acts 9:3-8;
Cornelius in Acts 10:2-4; John in Rev. 19:10.
    9. What instruction concerning the service of the sanctuary was
given to the priests?
    ANswER.—Instruction regarding sacrifices and offerings in the sanctuary.
(See Leviticus, chapters 1 to 4; Heb. 8:4.)
    10. What priests violated these laws concerning the services? How
was their act punished? Lev. 10:1-6.
    11. Where in the sanctuary was the special place in which God's
presence was manifested? Ps. 99:1; Ex. 25:21, 22.
    Nora.—"God designed to teach the people that they must approach Him
with reverence and awe, and in His own appointed manner. He cannot ac-
cept partial obedience. It was not enough that in this solemn season of wor-
ship nearly everything was done as He had directed."—"Patriarch's and Proph-
ets," p. 360.
                                    [ 28)
    12. What instruction was given to the priests concerning entrance
into and service in the most holy place? Lev. 16:2;4.
    NoTE.—God specified the dress, care of the body, and the character and
details of every part of the service rendered by the priests in the service of
the sanctuary. A departure from these specifications met His rebuke, and in
cases of flagrant transgression, punishment by death resulted. (See Num. 16:
35; 2 Sam. 6:6, 7.)
                  THE CHURCH ALSO GOD'S SANCTUARY
   - 13. What in the Christian dispensation compares to the sanctuary
of the former dispensation? 1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:20-22.
     14. How should Christians conduct themselves in the church? 1 Cor.
14:33, 40; Ps. 100:4; Eccl. 5:1.
     NOTE.—"There should be rules in regard to the time, the place, and the
manner of worshiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains to the
worship of God, should be treated with carelessness or indifference. . . .
     "When the worshipers enter the place of meeting, they should do so with
decorum, passing quietly to their seats. . .. Common talking, whispering, and
laughing should not be permitted in the house of worship, either before or
after the service. Ardent, active piety should characterize the worshipers.
. . . The whispering and laughing and talking which might be without sin in
a common business place, should find no sanction in the house where God is
worshiped....
     "When the minister enters, it should be with dignified, solemn mien. He
should bow down in silent prayer as soon as he steps into the pulpit, and
earnestly ask help of God. What an impression this will make i There will
be solemnity and awe upon the people. Their minister is communing with
God. . . . Solemnity rests upon all, and angels of God are brought very near.
. . . When the meeting is opened by prayer, every knee should bow in the
presence of the Holy One, and every heart should ascend to God in silent
devotion. . . . All the service should be conducted with solemnity and awe,
as if in the visible presence of the Master of assemblies. . . .
     "When the benediction is pronounced, all should still be quiet, as if fear-
ful of losing the peace of Christ. . . . God and angels have been dishonored
by the careless, noisy laughing and shuffling of feet heard in some places."
—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 491-494.

                                  Prayer
MEMORY VERSE: "Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and
  supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."
  Phil. 4:6.
STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," pp. 97-109.

                          PRAYER AN ESSENTIAL
    1. How essential is prayer to the Christian? Phil. 4:6.
    NOTE.—"In everything by prayer and supplication . . . let your requests
be made known unto God," says the apostle. Prayer, according to the dic-
tionary, is an "appeal, a request, an intercession." In the spirit of prophecy
we read, "Prayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of spiritual power."
—"Gospel Workers," p. 254. "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as
to a friend."—"Steps to Christ," p. 97.
    2. Who prompts and assists in prayer? Rom. 8:26.
   NOTE.—"By     the Spirit every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer
is acceptable to God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 189.

6:6-9; Phil. 4:6.
    4. Through whom do we have access to the Father when we pray?
John 14:6; 1 Tim. 2:5.
    5. What does it mean to pray in Christ's name? John 14:14-16; Eph.
4:32, last clause.
    NOTE.—"To pray in Christ's name means much. It means that we are to
accept His character, manifest His spirit, and work His works. The Saviour's
promise is given on condition. 'If ye love Me,' He says, 'keep My command-
ments.' He saves men, not in sin, but from sin; and those who love Him will
show their love by obedience."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 668.
    "In Christ's name our petitions ascend to the Father. He intercedes in
our behalf, and the Father lays open all the treasures of His grace for our
appropriation, for us to enjoy and impart to others. 'Ask in My name,'
Christ says. 'I do not say that I will pray the Father for you; for the Father
Himself loveth you. Make use of My name. This will give your prayers
efficiency, and the Father will give you the riches of His grace.' "—"Testi-
monies," vol. 8, p. 178.
    6. For what things should one pray? Matt. 6:9-13; James 1:5; 5:13-15.
    NoTE.—"Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your
fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary Him."—
"Steps to Christ," p. 104.
    "For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for
wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has promised, we may
                                     [30 )
ask; then we are to believe that we receive, and return thanks to God that
we have received."—"Education," p. 258.
    7. What is the highest form of worship? Ps. 50:23.
    NorE.—"The soul may ascend nearer heaven on wings of praise. God
is worshiped with song and music in the courts above, and as we express our
gratitude, we are approximating to the worship of the heavenly hosts. Whoso
offereth praise glorifieth' God. Let us with reverent joy come before our
Creator, with 'thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.' "—"Steps to Christ,"
p. 109.
    8. What on man's part makes prayer effective? James 1:6; Heb. 11:6;
James 5:16, last clause.
    9. What on man's part makes prayer ineffective? Ps. 66:18; Lam. 3:
42, 44; James 1:6, 7.
    Nora—While it is true that God hears not sinners, yet if the sinner comes
in penitence, God will hear and forgive. This is one prayer to which God
never turns a deaf ear.
                          EXAMPLES OF PRAYER
    10. What may be learned about prayer from the example of Christ?
    (1) Time to pray: (a) Every hour of need (Luke 23:34, 46; John 17:
1, 5, 11) ; (b) early morning (Mark 1:35)..
    (2) Place: (a) Solitary place (Mark 1:35) ; (b) the mountains (Luke
6:12).
    NOTE.—"Jesus Himself, while He dwelt among men, Was often in prayer.
Our Saviour identified Himself with our needs and weakness, in that He be-
came a suppliant, a petitioner, seeking from His Father fresh supplies of
strength, that He might come forth braced for duty and trial. He is our
example in all things. He is a brother in our infirmities."—"Steps to Christ,"
pp• 97, 98.
    11. Name some occasions on which Jesus prayed.
    ANSWER.—At His baptism (Luke 3:21, 22).; at His transfiguration (Luke
9:28, 29) ; at Lazarus' resurrection (John 11:41-43).
    12. Give some Bible examples of prayer.
    ANswEn.—Abraham (Gen. 18:23-33, note especially the last verse) ; Moses
 (Ex. 32:10-14, 31-34) ; Elijah (1 Kings 18:36-38, compare verses 41-43 with
James 5:17, 18) ; Daniel (Dan. 9:1-19; 6:10).

     14. When are we told by the Saviour men ought to pray? Luke 18:1;
1 Thess. 5:17.
    NOTE.—"We may commune with God in our hearts; we may walk in
companionship with Christ. When engaged in our daily labor, we may breathe
out our heart's desire, inaudible to any human ear; but that word cannot
die away into silence, nor can it be lost. Nothing can drown the soul's desire.
It rises above the din of the street, above the noise of machinery. It is God
to whom we are speaking, and our prayer is heard."—"Gospel Workers," p.
258.
                                      1811
      15. What is the preferred posture in prayer? Ps. 95:6.
     NOTE.—"Both in public and in private worship, it is our privilege to bow
on our knees before, God when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our ex-
ample, 'kneeled down, and prayed.' Of His disciples it is recorded that they,
too, 'kneeled down, and prayed.' Paul declared, 'I bow my knees unto the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.' In confessing before God the sins of Israel,
Ezra knelt. Daniel 'kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and
gave thanks before his God.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 48.
      16. What may the faithful seeker expect in answer to his prayers?
Matt. 7:7, 8: 1 John 3:22.
