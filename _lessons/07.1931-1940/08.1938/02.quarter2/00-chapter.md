                     The Gospel of Salvation
MEMORY VERSE: "The angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
  good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this
  day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord." Luke 2:10, 11.
STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 63-70.

                                INTRODUCTION
    The word "gospel" means "good news." "Glad tidings, especially the good
news concerning Christ, the kingdom of God, and salvation."—Webster.
Christ's command, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature," is given to every believer in the gospel. The gospel is as 'necessary
to a man in darkest heathenism as it is to the one living by us. "If every
church member were a living missionary, the gospel would speedily be pro-
claimed in all countries, to all peoples, nations, and tongues."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 9, p. 32.
          ETERNAL LIFE THE FRUIT OF PERFECT OBEDIENCE
    1. What was man's condition when created? Gen. 1:26, first part.
    NOTE.—"Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and
in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father; but man was
formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of
God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections
were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He
was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect obedience to
His will."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 45.
    2. How only could man remain in this perfect condition?
    ANSWER.—By obeying his Creator's commands. Gen. 2:16, 17.
    NOTE.—"God placed man under law, as an indispensable condition of his
very existence. He was a subject of the divine government, and there can be
no government without law. God might have created man without the power
to transgress His law; He might have withheld the hand of Adam from touch-
ing the forbidden fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a free
 moral agent, but a mere automaton. Without freedom of choice, his obedience

Mountain View, California. Entered as second-class matter Oct. 13, 1904, at the
post office in Mountain View, California, under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1879.
Acceptance for mailing at special rate of postage provided for in section 1103, Act
                   of Oct. 3, 1917, and authorized Sept. 18, 1918.

would not have been voluntary, but forced. There could have been no de-
velopment of character. Such a course would have been contrary to God's
plan in dealing with the inhabitants of other worlds. It would have been
unworthy of man as an intelligent being, and would have sustained Satan's
charge of God's arbitrary rule."-"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 49.
   3. What is sin? 1 John 5:17; 3:4.
   4. How many have sinned? Rom. 3:23; 5:12.
   5. What is the wages of sin? Rom. 6:23, first part.
                        THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION
    6. What provision has God made to save man from the consequences
of sin? John 3:16; Rom. 8:38, 39.
    NOTE.-"The broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all
the universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its claims.
Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could
make atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem fallen
man from the curse of the law, and bring him again into harmony with
heaven."-"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 63.
    7. To how many was the message of peace to go which was pro-
claimed at our Saviour's advent? Luke 2:10-14.
    8. How was Christ empowered for His work? Acts 10:38.
    9. In what words did Jesus describe His work? What else was He
to do besides preaching? Luke 4:18, 19.
    NOTE.-"From Him flowed a stream of healing power, and in body and
mind and soul men were made whole. . . . Where He had passed, the objects
of His compassion were rejoicing in health, and making trial of their new-
found powers."-"Ministry of Healing," pp. 17-19.
             IN CHRIST OUR CHARACTER IS PERFECTED
   10. What is God's standard of character for man? Matt. 5:48.
   NoTE.-"Christ reaches us where we are. He took our nature and over-
came, that we through taking His nature might overcome. Made 'in the like-
ness of sinful flesh,' He lived a sinless life. Now by His divinity He lays hold
upon the throne of heaven, while by His humanity He reaches us. He bids
us by faith in Him attain to the glory of the character of God. Therefore are
we to be perfect, even as our 'Father which is in heaven is perfect' "-"The
Desire of Ages," p. 312.
   11. Through whom is this perfection to be obtained? .1 Cor. 1:30;
Col. 2:10.
   12. What part has faith in the work of the gospel? Rom. 1:17.

supplied, every defilement cleansed, every. fault corrected, every excellence
developed."-"Education," p. 257.
                   CITIZENSHIP IN GOD'S KINGDOM
   14. How may men become citizens of the 'kingdom of God? John
1:12; 2 Cor. 5:19.
   15. What did Christ leave with His followers as one of the funda-
mental principles of His kingdom? John 14:27.

  16. As Christ was leaving His disciples to return to His Father, what
command did He give them? Mark 16:15.

 The Right of the Heathen to Receive the Gospel
MEMORY VERSE: "But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are
  made nigh by the blood of Christ." Eph. 2:13.
STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 367-378; "Acts of the Apostles,"
  pp. 177-187; 270-274.
                                INTRODUCTION
   "Millions upon millions have never so much as heard of God or of His love
revealed in Christ. It is their right to receive this knowledge. They have an
equal claim with us in the Saviour's mercy. And it rests with us who have
received the knowledge, with our children to whom we may impart it, to answer
their cry."-"Education,", p. 263.
                     SIN WORKS DEGRADATION
   1. How many of earth's inhabitants have sinned and so need the
gospel of salvation? Rom. 5:12.
                                [4 1
    2. What is the natural tendency of those who, while knowing God,
do not love and worship Him?
    ANSWER.—Their ways lead to idolatry. Rom. 1:21-23.
    3. What is the spiritual condition of the Gentiles? Eph. 2:11, 12.
    NoTE.—In the Scriptures the words "Jews and Gentiles" are made to em-
brace all men. The word "Gentile" commonly signifies all who are apart from
God.
    4. What are false gods unable to do? In whom alone is salvation?
Isa. 45:20, 21.
    5. What shall become of these false gods? Jer. 10:11.
                 THE GOSPEL OPENS A DOOR OF HOPE
    6. What did the Son of God do that He might destroy the author of
death? From what bondage was man thus delivered? Heb. 2:14, 15.
    NoTE.—The torture from the fear of death in most heathen lands is un-
believably great. "Every non-Christian land is a land of pain." Where men
have not been freed by the gospel from sin and the fear of death, illness and
other misfortunes are generally believed to be caused by demons. Hence there
arises the horrible and vile worship of devils to appease and conciliate them.
The gospel alone is the power for deliverance from these pitiful fears and awful
superstitions. God has given all mankind the right to be set free from frightful
fear and gross superstition. It is the work of His gospel to do this.
    "When Christ hung in agony upon the cross, while evil spirits rejoiced, and
evil men reviled, then indeed His heel was bruised by Satan. But that very act
was crushing the serpent's head. Through death He destroyed 'him that had
the power of death, that is, the devil.' This act decided the destiny of the rebel
chief, and made forever sure the plan of salvation. In death, He gained the
victory over its power; in rising again, He opened the gates of the grave to
all His followers."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 701, 702.
    7. What is God's call to the world? Isa. 45:22.
    8. For whom is God searching? Where does He search? For what
purpose? Ezek. 34:11-13.
    NoTE.—"Among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, He sees men and women
who are praying for light and knowledge. Their souls are unsatisfied; long
have they fed on ashes. The enemy of all righteousness has turned them aside,
and they grope as blind men. But they are honest in heart, and desire to learn
a better way. . . . Heaven's plan of salvation is broad enough to embrace the
whole world. God longs to breathe into prostrate humanity the breath of life.
And He will not permit any soul to be disappointed who is sincere in his long-
ing for something higher and nobler than anything the world can offer."—
"Prophets and Kings," pp. 376-378.
    9. To how many does Jesus give the light of life? John 1:9.
    NoTE.—"The Holy Spirit has implanted the grace of Christ in the heart of
the savage, quickening his sympathies contrary to his nature, contrary to his
education. The 'Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,'
is shining in his soul; and this light, if heeded, will guide his feet to the kingdom
of God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 385.
    Our heavenly Father is depending upon us to endeavor to fan this ember
into a continually burning flame. John 17:18, 20; Isa. 43:10; Acts 26:16-18.
                                        [6)
        GOD WORKS THROUGH HIS CHURCH TO SAVE MEN
    10. For what are the honest, truth-loving heathen asking? Acts 16:9.
    11. What is God's attitude toward those asking for help? Isa. 49:25.
    NOTE-"Constantly He is sending His angels to those who, while surrounded
by circumstances the most discouraging, pray in faith for some power higher
than themselves to take possession of them, and bring deliverance and peace."
-"Prophets and Kings," p. 378.
    "The angel sent to Philip could himself have done the work for the
Ethiopian, but this is not God's way of working. It is His plan that men are
to work for their fellow men."-"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 109.. "We are
laborers together with God" in this search after the seeker for God.
    12. In view of the spiritual darkness covering the earth, what is the
church enjoined to do? With what result? Isa. 60:1-4.
    NoTE.-"These prophecies of a great spiritual awakening in a time of gross
darkness, are today meeting fulfillment in the advancing lines of mission sta-
tions that are reaching out into the benighted regions of earth. The groups of
missionaries in heathen lands have been likened by the prophet to ensigns
set up for the guidance of those who are looking •for the light of truth."-
"Prophets and Kings," pp. 375, 376.
    13. Who will be saved? Rom. 10:13.
    14. What should be done that those who know not God may call on
Him? Verses 14, 15.
    NoTE.-Believing is dependent upon hearing, hearing upon preaching, and,
in turn, preaching upon someone being sent to preach. In this work of sending
preachers-missionaries to the great heathen world-every member of the
church should assist by prayers and gifts. This is one way in which we may
be "laborers together with God," and the Gentiles be brought "to thy light,
and kings to the brightness of thy rising."

                    The Power of the Gospel
MEMORY VERSE: "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power
  of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to
  the Greek." Rom. 1:16.
STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 252-259.

                                INTRODUCTION
    "The life of the true believer reveals an indwelling Saviour. The follower
of Jesus is Christlike in spirit and in temper. Like Christ, he is meek and
humble. His faith works by love and purifies the soul. His whole life is a
testimony to the power of the grace of Christ. The pure doctrines of the gospel
never degrade the receiver, never make him coarse, or rough, or uncourteous.
The gospel refines, ennobles, and elevates, sanctifying the judgment and in-
fluencing the whole life."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 67.
                 GOD'S POWER INHERENT IN HIS WORD
    1. What is the nature of the word of God? Heb. 4:12; John 6:63.
    NoTE.—"The creative energy that called the worlds into existence is in the
word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life. Every command is a
promise; accepted by the will, received into the soul, it brings with it the life
of the Infinite One. It transforms the nature, and re-creates the soul in the
image of God. The life thus imparted is in like manner sustained. 'By every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God' shall man live. The mind, the
soul, is built up by that upon which it feeds; and it rests with us to determine
upon what it shall be fed. It is within the power of everyone to choose the
topics that shall occupy the thoughts and shape the character."—"Education,"
pp. 126, 127.
    2. How did God create all things? Ps. 33:6, 9.
    NoTE.—"The work of creation cannot be explained by science. What science
can explain the mystery of life? 'Through faith we understand that the worlds
were framed by the word of God, so that thingS which are seen were not made
of things which do appear.' . . . In the creation of the earth, God was not
indebted to pre-existing matter. 'He spake, and it was; . . . He commanded,
and it stood fast.' All things, material or spiritual, stood up before the Lord
 Jehovah at His voice, and were created for His own purpose. The heavens
 and all the host of them, the earth and all things therein, came into existence
 by the breath of His mouth."—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 414, 415.
    3. Through whom did God create all things? How are they now up-
 held and kept in ordered existence? Heb. 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-17.
    NoTE.—"It is not by inherent power that year by year the earth yields its
 bounties, and continues its march around the sun. . . . It is by His power that
 vegetation is caused to flourish, and every leaf appears, every flower blooms,
 every fruit develops. The mechanism of the human body cannot be fully
 understood; it presents mysteries that baffle the most intelligent. It is not
                                       [7 ]
as the result of a mechanism, which, once set in motion, continues its work,
that the pulse beats, and breath follows breath. In God we live and move and
have our being."—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 416, 417.
    "The mighty pOwer that works through all nature and sustains all things
is not, as some men of science represent, merely an all-prevading principle, an
actuating energy. God is a Spirit; yet He is a personal Being; for so He has
revealed Himself. . . . God's handiwork in nature is not God Himself in
nature. The things of nature are an expression of God's character and power;
but we are not to regard nature as God."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 413.
    4. How have the heathen come to regard nature? Rom. 1:25.
                       SINFUL MAN A NEW CREATION
    5. What does the creative, sustaining power of God's word mean to
sinful man? Eph. 2:10; Ps. 51:10.
    NOTE.—"Let Christ be daily made manifest in you, and He will reveal
through you the creative energy of His word,—a gentle, persuasive, yet mighty
influence to re-create other souls in the beauty of the Lord our God."—
"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," p. 185.
     6. To what extent can sinful man change his own heart? Job 14:4;
Jer. 10:23; 13:23.
     7. By what power may man be redeemed? 1 Peter 1:23.
     8. How does God manifest His creative, converting power? Ezek.
36:26, 27; Heb. 10:15-17.
     NOTE.—"If the law is written in the heart, will it not shape the life?
Obedience—the service and allegiance of love—is the true sign of discipleship.
Thus the Scripture says, 'This is the love of God, that we keep His command-
ments.'        that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is
a liar, and the truth is not in him.' Instead of releasing a man from obedience,
it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which
enables us to render obedience. We do not earn salvation by our obedience;
for salvation is the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is
the fruit of faith."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 65, 66.
             KINGDOM OF LIGHT FOUNDED ON THE WORD
    9. Who creates spiritual as well as physical light? 2 Cor. 4:6.
    NorE.—"He causes 'the light to shine out of darkness' When 'the earth
was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep,' the
Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be
light; and there was light' So in the night of spiritual darkness, God's word
goes forth, 'Let there be light.' To His people He says, 'Arise, shine; for thy
light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.' . . . It is the
darkness of misapprehension of God that is enshrouding the world. Men are
losing their knowledge of His character. It has been misunderstood and mis-
interpreted. At this time a message from God is to be proclaimed, a message
illuminating in its influence and saving in its power. His character is to be
made known. Into the darkness of the world is to be shed the light of His
glory, the light of His goodness, mercy, and truth."—"Christ's Object L,essons,"
p. 415.
    10. Why were those who heard Christ astonished? Lake 4:32.
    11. What is God's promise regarding the power of sin? Rom. 6:14.
                                      (8 1
   12. How may the church be cleansed from sin?
   ANSWER.-By the word of God. Eph. 5:25-27; Ps. 119:9, 11.
     TRIUMPH OF THE GOSPEL ASSURED THROUGH THE WORD
     13. How did Christ speak of His words? John 6:63.
     14. How does Peter speak of God's promises? What will they en•
able us to do? 2 Peter 1:4.
     NOTE.-"Every promise in God's word is ours. 'By every word that pro-
ceedeth out of the mouth of God' are we to live. When assailed by temptation,
look not to circumstances or to the weakness of self, but to the power of the
word. All its strength is yours."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 123.
     15. How may all men be made spiritually clean? John 15:3.
     NOTE.-" 'Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
you.' . . . Here is Bible sanctification. It is not merely a show or outside
work. It is sanctification received through the channel of truth. It is truth
received in the heart, and practically carried out in the life."-"Testimonies,"
vol. 1, p. 339.
     16. What is the gospel, which we are commanded by Christ to preach
to the world, declared to be? Rom. 1:16.
     NOTE.-The gospel is the light that is to dispel the world's spiritual dark-
ness. It is a revelation of God's unmerited favor to man through His only-
begotten Son. It is not man-made; it is God-made. It is not a lifeless theory;
it is a pardoning, life-giving power. Oh, the greatness of the riches of the love
of God in Christ Jesus as disclosed in His gospel of grace to a race of rebels.

              The Gospel Does Change Lives
MEMORY VERSE: "You hath He quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
  sins." Eph. 2:1.
STUDY HELPS: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 73-94; "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp.
  259, 260.
                               INTRODUCTION
   "The Lord Jesus is making experiinents on human hearts through the
exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is effecting transformations
so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, with all his con-
federacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government, stands
viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delusions. They
are to him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels of God, seraphim and
cherubim, the powers commissioned to co-operate with human agencies, look
on with astonishment and joy, that fallen men, once children of wrath, are
through the training of Christ developing characters after the divine similitude,
to be sons and daughters of God, to act an important part in the occupations
and pleasures of heaven."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 18.
                      TRANSFORMED BY THE GOSPEL
    1. How does Paul describe the lives of the Ephesian believers before
the gospel came to them? Eph. 2:1-3; 4:17-19.
    NOTE.—"Ephesus was not only the most, magnificent, but the most corrupt,
of the cities of Asia. Superstition and sensual pleasure held sway over her
teeming population. Under the shadow of her temples, criminals of every grade
found shelter, and the most degrading vices flourished."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 286.
    2. What did God's gospel do for these idolatrous Ephesians? Eph.
2:4-6.
    3. What did the Ephesians do to receive this blessed experience?
Eph. 1:13.
    4. Who "shall not inherit the kingdom of God"? 1 Cor. 6:9, 10.
    5. What is said of some of the Corinthian brethren? 1 Cor. 6:11, first
sentence.
    6. What had God's gospel of grace done for them? Verse 11, last
part.
    NoTE.—"When the apostle Paul began his ministry in Corinth, that popu-
lous, wealthy, and wicked city, polluted by the nameless vices of heathenism,
he said, 'I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ,
and Him crucified.' Writing afterward to some of those who had been cor-
 rupted by the foulest sins, he could say, 'But ye are washed, but ye are sancti-
fied, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
 God.' I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is
                                      {10 7
given, you by Jesus Christ.' Now, as in Christ's day, the work of God's
kingdom lies . . . with those who are declaring to the people in His name
those spiritual truths that will work in the receivers the experience of Paul: 'I
am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in
me.'"—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 509, 510.
                      THE GOSPEL'S SAVING POWER                   •
    7. What had been the experience of some of the Colossian brethren?
Col. 3:5-7.
    8. How could these believers meet the standards of the gospel?
Verses 9, 10.
   9. What did Paul call these transformed Colossians? Col. 1:2.
    NOTE.—When men lose sight and knowledge of God, they naturally become
corrupt. But just as naturally, when they receive the gospel of Christ into
their hearts, they thereby are washed, justified, and sanctified in His name.
The gospel has power within itself to completely change in body, mind, and
spirit those who joyfully receive and wholeheartedly believe it.
    10. Tell the story of Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman
at Jacob's well. John 4:1-26.
    11. What did this heathen woman do that showed genuine conver-
sion? Verses 28, 29.
    NOTE.—"The woman had been filled with joy as she listened to Christ's
words. The wonderful revelation was almost overpowering. Leaving her
waterpot, she returned to the city, to carry the message to others. Jesus knew
why she had gone. Leaving her waterpot spoke unmistakably as to the effect of
His words. It was the earnest desire of her soul to obtain the living water ; and
she forgot her errand to the well, she forgot the Saviour's thirst, which she
had purposed to supply. With heart overflowing with gladness, she hastened.
on her way, to impart to others the precious light she had received."—"The
 Desire of Ages," p. 191.
    12. Recite the story of the conversion of Nctaman. 2 Kings 5:1-19.
    NoTE.—"Today in every land there are those who are honest in heart, and
upon these the light of heaven is shining. If they continue faithful in following
that which they understand to be duty, they will be given increased light,
until, like Naaman of old, they will be constrained to acknowledge that 'there
is no God in all the earth,' save the living God, the Creator."—"Prophets and
 Kings," p. 253.
             ALL INCLUDED IN THE GOSPEL INVITATION
   13. What is God's purpose for all men? 1 Tim. 2:4.
   14. What two converted heathen women were brought into the line
of Christ's ancestry? Matt. 1:5.
   NOTE.—"By faith `Rahab perished not with them that believed not' And
her conversion was not an isolated case of God's mercy toward idolaters who
acknowledged His divine authority. In the midst of the land, a numerous peo-
ple—the Gibeonites—renounced their heathenism, and united with Israel,
sharing in the blessings of the covenant."--"Prophets and Kings," p. 369.
    15. How complete is the work of the gospel? Rev. 14:6; Eph. 5:27;
Jude 24.
                                      n
   Nom—The power of the gospel to change men's lives is seen in all lands,
but in none more than in countries where heathenism abounds. Miracles of
spiritual grace and physical healing are abundant, showing the heavenly
Father's love in bringing "nigh by the blood of Christ" those "who sometimes
were far off." The degraded are uplifted, the harshly brutal are made gentle,
and those possessed by evil spirits are filled by the Holy Spirit. Experiences
similar to that of the demoniac as recorded in Luke 8:26-40 are being con-
stantly repeated. The gospel with its saving power must go to every kindred,
nation, people, and tongue in this generation. "How beautiful upon the
mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace;
that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto
Zion, Thy God reigneth !"
                             LESSON OUTLINE
I. MANKIND CORRUPTED BY SIN, THOUGH GROSS IDOLATERS, ARE TRANSFORMED
            BY GOSPEL
    1. People of Ephesus notorious for idolatry. Eph. 2:1-3; 5:17-19.
    2. The gospel wrought a wonderful change. Eph. 2:4-6.
    3. The Ephesian believers• "beard" and "trusted" the gospel. Eph. 1:13.
    4. Some Corinthian believers delivered from terrible degradation. 1 Cor.
       6:11.
    5. Hope of salvation open to vilest sinners. 1 Cor. 6:9, 10.
11. ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE GOSPEL'S SAVING POWER
    1. Colossians were addicted to sinful practices. Col. 3:5-7.
    2. Putting away their old ways, they became new men and women in
       Christ. Col. 3:9, 10.
    3. They had been transformed from sinners to saints. Col. 1:2.
    4. The Samaritan woman found Messiah. John 4:1-26.

    3. The church triumphant will include many from darkest heathen lands.
       Rev. 14:6; Eph. 5:27; Jude 24.

  SUNDAY I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY! THURSDAY I FRIDAY I SABBATH




                    "Go Preach My Gospel"
MEMORY VERSE: "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." Matt. 24:14.
STUDY HELPS: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 219-237; "The Desire of Ages,"
  pp. 328-332, 627-636.
                            INTRODUCTION
  "The vineyard includes the whole world, and every part of it is to be
worked. There are places which are now a moral wilderness, and these are to
                                  [ 121
become as the garden of the Lord. The waste places of the earth are to be
cultivated, that they may bud and blossom as the rose. New territories are to
be worked by men inspired by the Holy Spirit. New churches must be estab-
lished, new congregations organized. At this time there should be representa-
tives of present truth in every city, and in the remote parts of the earth. The
whole earth is to be illuminated with the glory of God's truth. The light is to
shine to all lands and all peoples. And it is from those who have received the
light that it is to shine forth. The daystar has risen upon us, and we are to
flash its light upon the pathway of those in darkness."="Testimonies," vol.
6, p. 24.
         CHRIST FORETOLD SIGNS OF HIS SECOND COMING
    1. In speaking of the signs of His second advent to the world, what
prophecy did Christ make concerning the spread of His gospel? Matt.
24:14.
    Nora.—"When the members of the church of God do their appointed work
in the needy fields at home and abroad, in fulfillment of the gospel commission,
the whole world will soon be warned, and the Lord Jesus will return to this
earth with power and great glory."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 111.
    2. What questions led Christ to make this prophecy? Matt. 24:3.
    3. Contrast the nature of this prophecy with the other events prophe-
sied of in connection with it. Matt. 24:4-41.
    NOTE.—It is a very dark picture which our Saviour draws of events, that
portend His second advent to the world. Earthquakes, tidal waves, wars, and
rumors of war naturally cause men's hearts to fail them for fear—a fear that
their love of pleasures cannot dispel. Set right in the midst of this dark picture
as a very bright star in a very dark night is the declaration of Jesus that the
advance of His gospel to every kindred and tongue is also a token of His soon
coming to establish His eternal kingdom of love.
      CHRIST HIMSELF PREACHED THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL
    4. By whom and how did the preaching of Christ's gospel begin?
Matt. 4:23.
    NOTE.—While "the gospel of the kingdom" had been preached to man since
sin first entered the world, yet upon the personal advent of man's Saviour to
earth its eternal truths were put in a new and most appealing way. "He healed
the sick and preached the gospel. In His service, healing and teaching were
linked closely together. Today they are not to be separated. . . . All around
us are doors open for service. We should become acquainted with our neigh-
bors, and seek to draw them to Christ. As we do this, He will approve and co-
operate with us."—"Counsels on Health," p. 396.
    5. By what great movement is the gospel to be finished? Rev. 14:6-16.
    NOTE.—"The third angel's message, embracing the messages of the first
and second angels, is the message for this time."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 197.
    "Here is shown the nature of the work of the people of God. They have a
message of so great importance that they are represented as flying in the
presentation of it to the world. They are holding in their hands the bread of
life for a famishing world. The love of Christ constraineth them. This is the
last message. There are no more to follow; no more invitations of mercy to be
                                      ( 13 )
given after this message shall have done its work. What a trust!"—"Testi-
monies," vol. 5, pp. 206, 207.
    6. How extensive is to be its proclamation? Verse 6.
    NorE.—"If the followers of Christ were awake to duty, there would be
thousands where there is one today, proclaiming the gospel in heathen lands.
And all who could not personally engage in the work, would yet sustain it
with their means, their sympathy, and their prayers. And there would be far
more earnest labor for souls in Christian countries."—"Steps to Christ," p. 86.
    7. Describe the activity of "the time of the end." Dan. 12:4.
    NorE.—"That part of his prophecy which related to the last days, Daniel
was bidden to close up and seal 'to the time of the end.' . . . But at the time
of the end, says the prophet, 'many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased' . . . Since 1798 the book of Daniel has been unsealed, knowledge
of the prophecies has increased, and many have proclaimed the solemn mes-
sage of the judgment near."—"The Great Controversy," p. 356.
    With the very opening hours of "the time of the end," Bible and missionary
societies sprang up. The founders were not acquainted with God's prophecies
relating to "the time of the end." He inspired them to fulfill His word. The
Baptist Missionary Society was organized in 1792, the London Missionary
Society was organized in 1795, the London Religious Tract Society in 1799.
These were followed by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804; then
came the American Board of Missions in 1810, the Wesleyan Missionary So-
ciety in 1813, and the first American Bible Society in 1816. Other Bible and
missionary societies of Europe and America followed in quick succession, result-
ing in a great religious and missionary awakening. Keeping pace with these
movements were inventions for travel, communication, and food preservation
by which the whole earth has been discovered, explored, and made livable for
the missionary.
    8. With what voice does the third angel proclaim his message?
Rev. 14:9.
    NOTE.—"At that time, while the work of salvation is closing, trouble will
be coming on the earth, and the nations will be angry, yet held in check so as
not to prevent the work of the third angel. At that time the 'latter rain,' or
refreshing from the presence of the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud
voice of the third angel, and prepare the saints to stand in the period when
the seven last plagues shall be poured out."—"Early Writings," pp. 85, 86.
          THE CHURCH TO HERALD GOD'S LAST MESSAGE
                             TO THE WORLD
    9. What command does God give to His church in the day of His
coming? Joel 2:1.
    10. How is this time described? Verses 2, 3; Luke 21:25-28.
    11. What promise is given to God's people at that time? Isa. 60:5.
    12. That God may be able thus to bless His people, what are they
exhorted to do? Joel 2:12-17.
    NOTE.—"In view of that great day the word of God, in the most solemn
and impressive language, calls upon His people to arouse from their spiritual
lethargy, and to seek His face with repentance and humiliation: 'Blow ye the
trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain: let all the in-
                                     [14]
habitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord 'cometh, for it is nigh
at hand.' . . . To prepare a people to stand in the day of God, a great work
of reform was to be accomplished. . . . This message is declared to be a part
of the 'everlasting gospel.' The work of preaching the gospel has not been
committed to angels, but has been intrusted to men. . . . Faithful men, who
were obedient to the promptings of God's Spirit and the teachings of His word,
were to proclaim this warning to the world."—"The Great Controversy," pp.
311, 312.
     13. What glorious promises are made God's people in the finishing
of His gospel in all the world? Joel 2:23-26.
     NoTE.—"Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual
grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son of man.
This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter rain; and
it is for this added power that Christians are to send their petitions to the Lord
of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain.' In response, the Lord shall make
bright clouds, and give them showers of rain.' . . . But unless the members
of God's church today have a living connection with the source of all spiritual
growth, they will not be ready for the time of reaping. . . . Every worker
who follows the example of Christ will be prepared to receive and use the
power that God has 'promised to His church for the ripening of earth's
harvest."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 55, 56.

                Who Are to Give the Gospel?
MEMORY VERSE: "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that

STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 818-828; "Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 47.

                                INTRODUCTION
    " `Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature,' is
 Christ's command to His followers. Not that all are called to be ministers or
missionaries in the ordinary sense of the term; but all may be workers with
Him in giving the 'glad tidings' to their fellow men. To all, great or small,
learned or ignorant, old or young, the command is given."—"Education,"
p. 264.
       ' THE CHURCH PREPARED BY THE GIFT OF THE SPIRIT
                             FOR SOUL-WINNING
    1. What classes of workers has God set in the church? What are to
be the final results of their work? Eph. 4:11-15.
    NOTE.—Verse 12 is made clearer by Weymouth's version: "In order fully
to equip.His people for the work of serving."
    "In sending forth His ministers, our Saviour gave gifts unto men, for
through them He communicates to the world the words of eternal life. This
is the means which God has ordained for the perfecting of the saints in knowl-
edge and true holiness. . . . All who have been benefited by the labors of
God's servant, should, according to their ability, unite with him in working
for the salvation of souls. This is the work of all true believers, ministers, and
 people."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 237, 238.
    2. What is to be the spirit of those thus set apart? Acts 6:4; 2 Tim. 4:5.
    3. What did the early disciples do in preparation for their work?
With what result? Acts 1:14; 2:1.
    NoTE.—"As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they
humbled their hearts in true repentance, and confessed their unbelief. . . .
As they meditated upon His pure, holy life, they felt that no toil would be too
hard, no sacrifice too great, if only they could bear witness in their lives to
the loveliness of Christ's character. . . . Putting away all differences, all
desire for the supremacy, they came close together in Christian fellowship.. . .
These days of preparation were days of deep heart searching. The disciples
felt their spiritual need, and cried to the Lord for the holy unction that was
to fit them for the work of soul saving."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 36, 37.
    4. About how many believers were there at this time under the
leadership of the apostles? Acts 1:15.

       Sabbath Schools Are "Life-Saving Stations" for the
                   Children of All Nations.
                                      f ib)
   5. As a result of the work of believers, old and new, how was the
church of God prospered? Acts 2:47; 5:14; Col. 1:6.
    NoTE.—"Then the glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the
uttermost bounds of the inhabited world. The church beheld converts flocking
to her from all directions. Believers were reconverted. Sinners united with
Christians in seeking the pearl of great price. The prophecy was fulfilled, The
weak shall be 'as David,' and the house of David 'as the angel of the Lord.' ...
The only ambition of the believers was to reveal the likeness of Christ's
character, and to labor for the enlargement of His kingdom. 'The multitude
of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. . . . With great
power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and
great grace was upon them all.' And the Lord added to the church daily such
as should be saved' The Spirit of Christ animated the whole congregation;
for they had found the pearl of great price. These scenes are to be repeated,
and with greater power. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of
Pentecost was the former rain, but the latter rain will be more abundant. The
Spirit awaits our demand and reception."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 120,
121.
                     BELIEVERS CALLED TO WITNESS
    6. What occurred that gave members of the church opportunity to
proclaim the gospel? Acts 8:1, 4.
    NOTE.-"It was the providence of God which in the beginning of the
Christian church scattered the saints abroad, sending them out of Jerusalem
into many parts of the world. The disciples of Christ did not stay in Jerusalem
or in the cities near by, but they went beyond the limits of their own country
into the great thoroughfares of travel, seeking for the lost that they might
bring them to God. Today the Lord desires to see His work carried forward
in many places. We must not confine our labors to a few localities."—
"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 330.
    7. What were some of the results of their work? Acts 11:21.
    8. What are God's people commanded to do? Zech. 8:16; Eph. 4:25.
    9. What is truth? John 17:17.
                  TO WITNESS THROUGH THE SPIRIT
    10. What is the source of power for witnessing for Christ? Where
was the early church to begin to witness? Acts 1:8.
    NoTE.—" 'Ye shall be witnesses unto Me.' These words of Jesus have lost
none of their force. Our Saviour calls for faithful witnesses in these days of
religious formalism. . . . Many can tell what the great and good men of
generations past have done, and dared, and suffered, and enjoyed. . . . But
while so earnest in bringing forward other Christians as witnesses for Jesus,
they seem to have no fresh, timely experience of their own to relate. . . .
What have you seen, what have you known, of the power of Christ? This is
the kind of witness for which the Lord calls, and for which the churches are
suffering."—"Gospel Workers," p. 273.
    11. What are God's children to do for Him? Isa. 43:10.
       Twenty-Five Cents a Member Is the Average,—Not the
                         Individual Goal.
                               [ 17 1
   12. What did the witnessing of a little Jewish slave girl accomplish?
2 Kings 5:1-17.
   NorE.-"The conduct of the captive maid, the way that she bore herself in
that heathen home, is a strong witness to the power of early home training.
There is no higher trust than that committed to fathers and mothers in the
care and training of their children. Parents have to do with the very founda-
tions of habit and character. By their example and teaching, the future of
their children is largely decided. . . . We know not in what line our children
may be called to serve. They may spend their lives within the circle of the
home; they may engage in life's common vocations, or go as teachers of the
gospel to heathen lands; but all are alike called to be missionaries for God,
ministers of mercy to the world. They are to obtain an education that will
help them to stand by the side of Christ in unselfish service."-"Prophets and
Kings," p. 245.
                  LOST MUST BE SOUGHT AND FOUND
   13. How did Paul conduct his evangelistic work? Acts 20:20.
   14. How are Christ's disciples sent to others? John 17:18.
   15. By what words in His prayer did. Christ involve every believer
today? Verse 20.
   16. What is essential that members of Christ's church may today give
the closing message of His gospel? Verses 21-23.

                 The Support of Missionaries
MEMORY VERSE: "Freely ye have received, freely give." Matt. 10:8, last part.
STUDY HELPS: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 137-149; "Early Writings," pp.
  266-269.
                                INTRODUCTION
    "As the disciples proclaimed the truths of the gospel in Jerusalem, God
bore witness to their word, and a multitude believed. . . . The record declares,
`Neither was there any among them that lacked,' and it tells how the need
was filled. Those among the believers who had money and possessions, cheer-
fully sacrificed them to meet the emergency. . . . One common interest con-
trolled them,—the success of the mission entrusted to them; and covetousness
had no place in their lives. . . . Thus it was in the early church; and when in
the church of today it is seen that by the power of the Spirit the members have
taken their affections from the things of the world, and that they are willing
to make sacrifices in order that their fellow men may hear the gospel, the
truths proclaimed will have a powerful influence upon the hearers."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pp. 70, 71.
          FAITHFUL STEWARDSHIP ACKNOWLEDGES GOD'S
                                 OWNERSHIP
    1. What portion of man's income has God reserved for Himself?
Lev. 27:30.
    NoTE.—"The tithing system did not originate with the Hebrews. From
the earliest times the Lord claimed a tithe as His; and this claim was recognized
and honored. . . . The system of tithes and offerings was intended to impress
the minds of men with a great truth,—that God is the source of every blessing
to His creatures, and that to Him man's gratitude is due for the good gifts of
His providence." "God has made men His stewards. The property which He
has placed in their hands is the means that He has provided for the spread
of the gospel. To those who prove themselves faithful stewards He will com-
mit greater trusts."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 525, 529.
    2. What did God do with the tithe in ancient Israel? Num. 18:21.
    3. What did Christ say with reference to the payment of the tithe?
Matt. 23:23.
    4. What is God's plan for the support of gospel workers? 1 Cor.
9:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"It is not God's purpose that Christians, whose privileges far exceed
those of the Jewish nation, shall give less freely than they gave. 'Unto whom-
soever much is given,' the Saviour declared, 'of him shall be much required.'
The liberality required of the Hebrews was largely to benefit their own
nation; today the work of God extends over all the earth. . • . If professing
Christians would faithfully bring to God their tithes and offerings, His treasury
would be full."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 337, 338.
                                      ( 19 ]
   "The contributions required of the Hebrews for religious and charitable
purposes amounted to fully one fourth of their income. So heavy a tax upon
the resources of the people might be expected to reduce them"to poverty; but,
on the contrary, the faithful observance of these regulations was one of the
conditions of their prosperity."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 527.
             CONSECRATION INCLUDES OUR POSSESSIONS
    5. What are we to bring into the courts of the Lord? Ps. 96:8.
    NozE.—It is to the glory of the Lord that we should bring an offering when
we appear to worship Him. All, old and young, rich and poor, should come
before Him with a thank offering. It is right that one of our thank offerings
should be made regularly in the Sabbath school. Here we study God's word
and learn the way of salvation. How appropriate that we should give cheer-
fully, liberally, and regularly through the Sabbath school to carry the word
of salvation to the heathen.
    "God requires an appropriation of means for benevolent objects every
week, that in the frequent exercise of this good quality the heart may be kept
open like a flowing stream, and not allowed to close up."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 3, p. 548.
    6. By withholding tithes and offerings what do we do? Mal. 3:8.
    7. To have the gift delight God, what must be the spirit of the one
who gives? 2 Cor. 9:7.
    NOTE.—"That there may be funds in the treasury for the support of the
ministry, and to meet the calls for assistance in missionary enterprises, it is
necessary that the people of God give cheerfully and liberally. . . . When
this is neglected, and the churches fail to give for the necessities of others, not
only does the work of the Lord suffer, but the blessing that should come to
believers is withheld. Even the very poor should bring their offerings to God."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 341.
    8. With what two kinds of sacrifice is God pleased? Heb. 13:15, 16.
    9. What is the rule for giving? Deut. 16:17.
    NoTE.—"Whenever God's people, in any period of the world, have cheer-
fully and willingly carried out His plan in systematic benevolence and in gifts
and offerings, they have realized the standing promise that prosperity should
attend all their labors just in proportion as they obeyed His requirements.. . .
But when they robbed God in tithes and in offerings, they were made to realize
that they were not only robbing Him but themselves; for He limited His
blessings to them, just in proportion as they limited their offerings to Him."
—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 395.
        LOVE FOR THE LOST INSPIRES WILLING SACRIFICE
   10. What makes our gifts acceptable to God? 2 Cor. 8:12.
   11. Upon what are we exhorted to look? John 4:35.
   NOTE.—"God's people have a mighty work before them, a work that must
continually rise to greater prominence. Our efforts in missionary lines must
become far more extensive. A more decided work than has been done must
be done prior to the second appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. God's people
are not to cease their labors until they shall encircle the world."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 6, pp. 23, 24.
                                    ( 20 )
    12. For what are we earnestly to pray? Why? Matt. 9:38, 37.
   13. What suitable prayer may, be offered for missionaries? 2 Thess.
3:1, 2.
   NOTE.-Definite, importunate prayer must go together with our gifts for
the sending and sustaining of reapers in the Lord's ripe harvest field. Prayer
and money are both necessary for the support of missionaries.
   14. What is the relation of the missionary to those who support him?
1 Cor. 3:9.
   NoTE.-Paul here states a great principle of gospel service. "We are
laborers together." He that contributes to the sending and support of the
missionary shares with him in the soul reaping. The story is told of two
earnest Christian brothers, each of whom wanted to be a foreign missionary.
Their mission board would gladly have placed them under appointment, but
had no funds to send even one. Finally one brother proposed to remain at
home, work the farm, care for the parents, and support his brother in a needy
foreign mission land. The brother thus supported brought many souls to his
Saviour. Now in the final accounting of the lifework of these two brothers,
will not the one who by his farm toil supported his brother in the mission field
share equally in the Lord's reward for the harvesting of souls? We so believe.
   15. How does God account all gifts made to His work of soul-saving?
Matt. 25:40.
                             LESSON OUTLINE
I. FAITHFUL STEWARDSHIP ACKNOWLEDGES GOD'S -OWNERSHIP
    1. God claims a tenth as His own. Lev. 27:30.
    2. The tithe is dedicated to the support of the ministry. Num. 18:21.
    3. Tithe-paying is a doctrine of Christ. Matt. 23:23.
    4. Tithes and offerings to sustain God's work and workers. 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.
11. CONSECRATION INCLUDES OUR POSSESSIONS
      1. We cannot love without giving. Ps. 96:8.
      2. Withholding tithes or offerings defrauds God. Mal. 3:8.
      3. We are to give cheerfully. 2 Cor. 9:7.
      4. Thankfulness and the spirit of sacrifice are pleasing to God. Heb.
         13:15, 16.
      5. Christ's redeemed will bring an offering into His presence. Deut. 16:17.
I11. LOVE FOR THE LOST INSPIRES WILLING SACRIFICE
      1. The measure of sacrifice indicates the worth of the gift. 2 Cor. '8:12.
      2. The world's need should enlist our interest. John 4:35.
      3. Our prayers should accompany our gifts. Matt. 9:38, 37.
      4. God blesses when we pray for workers. 2 Thess. 3:1, 2.
      5. Missionaries and supporters are blessed together. 1 Cor. 3:9.
      6. Christ reckons our gifts as to Him. Matt. 25:40.

                       The Spirit of Sacrifice
MEMORY VERSE: "Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
  He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty
  might be rich." 2 Cor. 8:9.
STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 49-60; "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp.
  525-529.
                               INTRODUCTION
   "The foundation of the plan of salvation was laid in sacrifice. Jesus left
the royal courts, and became poor, that we through His poverty might be
made rich. All who share this salvation, purchased for them at such an infinite
sacrifice by the Son of God, will follow the example of the True Pattern. Christ
was the chief cornerstone, and we must build upon this foundation. Each
must have a spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice. The life of Christ upon earth
was unselfish ; it was marked with humiliation and sacrifice. And shall men,
partakers of the great salvation which Jesus came from heaven to bring them,
refuse to follow their Lord, and to share in His self-denial and sacrifice? . . .
Self-denial is an essential condition of discipleship."—"Testimonies," vol. 3,
pp. 387, 388.
                 SACRIFICE IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF LOVE
    1. How did God manifest the spirit of sacrifice? What caused Him
to do this? John 3:16.
   2. How did Christ likewise sacrifice? Titus 2:14.
    3. How is this spirit to be manifested by man? 1 John 3:16.
   Nor.—"Here is the work of self-denial upon which we must enter with
cheerfulness, in imitation of the example of our Redeemer. The Christian's life
must be one of conflict and of sacrifice. The path of duty should be followed,
not the path of inclination and choice."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 538.
      SACRIFICIAL GIVING CHARACTERISTIC OF GOD'S PEOPLE
    4. What example did Christ give to us all? 2 Cor. 8:9.
    5. Relate the experience of the rich young man who asked Jesus
what he might do to inherit eternal life. Matt. 19:16-22.
   NOTE.—"Christ made the only terms which could place the ruler where he
would perfect a Christian character." "So God now entrusts men with means,
with talents and opportunities, that they may be His agents in helping the
poor and the suffering. He who uses his entrusted gifts as God designs, becomes
a coworker with the Saviour."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 520, 523.
   6. How did Abraham manifest the spirit of sacrifice? Heb. 11:17-19.
   NoTE.—"Looking beyond that which was seen, Abraham grasped the divine
word, 'accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead.'
Yet none but God could understand how great was the father's sacrifice in
yielding up his son to death ; Abraham desired that none but God should,
witness the parting scene."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 152.
                                       22
    7. What sacrificial spirit did Moses manifest? Ex. 32:31, 32; Heb. 11:
24-27.     •
         APOSTOLIC CHURCH REVEALED SACRIFICIAL SPIRIT
    8. What was the experience of the Christi‘an church after nte-
cost? Acts 4:32-35.
    NOTE.—"This liberality on the part of the believers was the result of the
outpouring of the Spirit. The converts to the gospel were 'of one heart and
of one soul' One common interest controlled them,—the success of the mis-
sion entrusted to them; and covetousness had no place in their lives. Their
love for their brethren and the cause they had espoused, was greater than their
love of money and possessions. Their works testified that they accounted the
souls of men' of, higher value than earthly wealth. Thus it will ever be when
the Spirit of God takes possession of the life. Those 'whose hearts are filled
with the love of Christ, will follow the example of Him who for our sake
became poor, that through His poverty we might be made rich."—"The Acts
of the Apostles," pp. 70, 71.
    9. Discuss Paul's sacrifices. Phil. 3:4-8; 2 Cor. 11:21-30.
    10. How did the churches of Macedonia co-operate with Paul in his
service and sacrifice? 2 Cor. 8:1-5.
    NorE.—Moffatt translates 2 Cor. 8:1-5 as follows:, "Now, brothers, I have
to tell you about the grace God has given to the churches of Macedonia. Amid
a severe ordeal of trouble, their overflowing joy and their deep poverty to-
gether have poured out a flood of rich generosity; I can testify that up to their
means, aye and beyond their means, they have given—begging me of their
own accord, most urgently, for the favor of contributing to the support of
the saints. They have done more than I expected; they gave themselves to the
Lord, to begin with, and then (for so God willed it) they put themselves at
my disposal."
    "Nearly all the Macedonian believers were poor in this world's' goods,
but their hearts were overflowing with love for God and His truth, and they
gladly gave for the support of the gospel. . . . The willingness to sacrifice
on the part of the Macedonian believers came as a result of wholehearted con-
secration."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 343.
                A LOVE-FILLED HEART DELIGHTS TO GIVE
    11. When and how does sacrifice become a Pleasure? 2 Cor. 5:14,
first part; 12:10.
     NoTE.—"When once the gaze is fixed upon Him [Christ], the life finds
its center. The enthusiasm, the generous devotion, the passionate ardor of the
youth find here their true object. Duty becomes a delight, and sacrifice a
pleasure. To honor Christ, to become like Him, to work for Him, is the life's
highest ambition and its greatest joy."—"Education;" p. 297.
     12. What example did four of the disciples set us? Matt. 4:18-22;
Luke 5:11.
     13. How did the publican Matthew sacrifice in obedience to the
 call of Jesus? Luke 5:27, 28.
     NorE.—"To Matthew in his wealth, and to Andrew and Peter in their
poverty, the same test was brought; the same consecration was made by each.
 At the moment of success, when the nets were filled with fish, and the impulses
 of the old life were strongest, Jesus asked the disciples at the sea to leave all for
                                        [281
the work of the gospel. So every soul is tested as to whether the desire for
temporal good or for fellowship with Christ is strongest."-"The• Desire of
Ages," p. 273.
     14. How does Jesus reward those who truly sacrifice for Him? Mark
10:28-30; Phil. 4:19.
     NOTE.-"There are men and women who have left all for Christ's sake.
Their own temporal interests, their own enjoyment of society and of family
and friends, are made of less importance than the interests of the kingdom of
God. They have not made houses and lands, and relatives and friends however
dear, first in their affections, and God's cause second. And those who do this,
who devote their lives to the advancement of the truth, to bringing many sons
and daughters to God, have the promise that they shall have a hundredfold
in this life, and in the world to come life everlasting."-"Testimonies," vol. 5,
p. 428.

                    The Spirit of the Worker
MEMORY VERSE: "The love of Christ constraineth us." 2 Cor. 5:14, first part.
STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies to Ministers," pp. 184-187; "Acts of the Apostles,"
  pp. 539-545.
                              INTRODUCTION
   "Christ gave no stinted service. He did not measure His work by hours.
His time, His heart, His soul and strength, were given to labor for the benefit
                                     ( 24 )
of humanity. . . To His workers He says, 'I have given you an example,
that ye should do as I have done.' The love of Christ,' said Paul, `constraineth
us.' This was the actuating principle of his conduct; it was his motive power.
If ever his ardor in the path of duty flagged for a moment, one glance at the
cross caused him to gird up anew the loins of his mind, and press forward
in the way of self-denial. In his labors for his brethren he relied much upon
the manifestation of infinite love in the sacrifice of Christ, with its subduing,
constraining power."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 500.

    BELIEVERS TO MANIFEST DEVOTION AND ZEAL OF CHRIST
    1. What should be the controlling motive in the life and work of
every believer? 2 Cor. 5:14, first part.
    Nom—This scripture does not say that a love for but the love of Christ
constrained the apostle and his fellow workers. The very love with which
Christ loves us is to be in us impelling us to do the very work He would do
were He in our place. As He was sent, so He sends us to do His work. If we
let His mind dwell in us, as we are admonished in Philippians 2:5 to do, then
truly we shall be constrained by His love to do His work.
    2. What must we do to fulfill the royal law? James 2:8.
    NOTE.—"We must come up to a higher standard, or we are unworthy of
the Christian name. We should cultivate the spirit with which Christ labored
to save the erring. They are as dear to Him as we are. . . . Did we view
this matter in the right light, how would our zeal be quickened, and our
earnest, self-sacrificing efforts be multiplied, that we might come close to those
who need our help, our prayers, our sympathy, and our love I Let those who
have been remiss in this work, consider their duty in the light of the great
commandment, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' This obligation is
resting upon all. All are required to labor to diminish the ills and multiply
the blessings of their fellow creatures."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 605, 606.
    3. Who is our neighbor? Luke 10:25-37.
    Nora.—"The story ended, Jesus fixed His eyes upon the lawyer, in a glance
that seemed to read his soul, and said, 'Which of these three, thinkest thou,
proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?' The lawyer would
not, even now, take the name Samaritan upon his lips, and he made answer,
`He that showed mercy on him.' Jesus said, 'Go, and do thou likewise.' Thus
the question, 'Who is my neighbor?' is forever answered. Christ has shown
that our neighbor does not mean merely one of the church or faith to which
we belong. It has no reference to race, color, or class distinction. Our neighbor
is every person who needs our help. Our neighbor is every soul who is wounded
and bruised by the adversary. Our neighbor is everyone who is the property
of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 503.
             RESPONSIBILITY OF CHURCH MEMBERSHIP
    4. To what does God compare His church?
    ANswER.—The human body. 1 Cor. 12:12.
    5. How closely do all members of the human body co-operate?
Verses 14-26.
 , 6. Who is the head of the body, the church? Col. 1:13, 18.
                                      (25J
   7. What is the work of the head?
   ANSWER.—TO control every member of the body in such a way that it shall
co-operate with every other member.
   8. How is this control of each individual member of the body made
possible? Phil. 2:5; Rom. 12:2.
   NorE.—"We are to be courteous toward all men, tenderhearted and sym-
pathetic; for this was the character Christ manifested when on earth. The
more closely we are united with Jesus Christ, the more tender and affectionate
will be our conduct toward one another."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 377.
  CHURCH MEMBERS SHARE FELLOWSHIP OF FATHER AND SON
    9. How deep, sincere, and far-reaching is to be the spirit of com-
passion and love? John 13:34.
    NOTE.—" 'A new commandment I give unto you,' Christ said, 'That ye
love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.' What
a wonderful statement; but 0, how poorly practiced! In the church of God
today, brotherly love is sadly lacking. Many who profess to love the Saviour
do not love one another. . . . Christians are all members of one family, all
children of the same heavenly Father, with the same blessed hope of im-
mortality. Very close and tender should be the tie that binds them together."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 550.
    10. What knowledge concerning Christ will be given an unbeliev-
ing world by this spirit of brotherly unity? John 14:23; 17:21-23.
    11. How was this spirit of love and co-operation shown in the setting
up of David's kirtgdom? 1 Chron. 12:32, 33, 38.
- 12. How was it again revealed in the work of the early church?
Acts 4:32, 33.
    NOTE.—"On the day of Pentecost the Spirit'was given. Christ's witnesses
proclaimed the power of the risen Saviour. . . . Every Christian saw in his
brother the divine similitude of benevolence and love. One interest prevailed.
One object swallowed up all others. All hearts beat in harmony."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 120.
    13. In the final work of the church, how is this same spirit again to
be shown? Isa. 60:5; Joel 2:1, 18, 19, 23.
    NOTE.—"The day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can
abide it?" asks the prophet Joel. The answer is evident. It is those and those
only who in response to His trumpet call have turned unto Him with all their
hearts. It is by workers with such a spirit that God's gospel shall be carried
"into all the world" and His work finished. Each of us may be of that great
and strong people. God grant it.
    14. How does Christ speak of the work of His church in the strength
of its purity? Song of Solomon 6:4, 10.
    NOTE.—In these verses the church, in the strength of its purity, is repre-
sented as an army terrible because of its holiness and unity. She is "as the
morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun." This is a beautiful illustration
of the conquering church of God that shall at last stand upon the sea of glass,
"without fault before God." By this church God will then have finished His
gospel work in all the earth.

   "Christ's commission, `Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature,' is spoken to every one of His followers. All who are ordained
unto the life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of, their fellow
men. Their hearts will throb in unison with the heart of Christ. The same
longing for souls that He has felt will be manifest in them. Not all can fill
the same place in the work, but there is a place and a work for all."-"Christ's

   2. To, what are the members compared in the building of Christ's
church? Peter, 2:4, 5.
   NoTE.-"Dpon the foundation that Christ Himself had laid, the apostles
built the church of God. In the Scriptures the figure of the erection of a temple
                                       27
is frequently used to illustrate the building of the church."—"The Acts of the

    4. What part are believers in Christ from all over the world to have
in the building of this spiritual house of the Lord? Verse 15; Isa. 60:10.
    NOTE.—"Zechariah refers to Christ as the Branch that should build the

'They that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord;' and
Isaiah declares, 'The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls.' "—"The Acts
of the Apostles," p. 595.
                 THE UNFINISHED WORK DEMANDS HASTE
    5. What scriptural evidence have we that the work of building this
spiritual temple is not yet completed? Acts 15:16, 17; Isa. 60:11.
    NOTE.—"Paul and the other apostles, and all the righteous who have lived
since then, have acted their part in the building of the temple. But the struc-
ture is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have a work to do, a
part to act."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 599.

tion material that will endure, and in the kingdom of God he will be honored
as a wise builder."—"The Acts of the ApoStles," p. 599.
    7. By what means are believers of whatever tongue and people to
be fitted for a place in God's building? 1 Cor. 3:13; 1 Peter 1:7.
    NoTE.—"The company of believers may be few in number, but in God's
sight they are very precious. By the cleaver of truth they have been taken as
rough stones from the quarry of the world, and have been brought into the
workshop of God, to be hewed and shaped. But even in the rough they are
precious in the sight of God. The ax, the hammer, and the chisel of trial are
in the hands of One who is skillful; they are used, not to destroy, but to work
out the perfection of every soul. As precious stones, polished after the similitude
of a palace, God designs us to find a place in the heavenly temple."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 6, p. 363.
   8. How great is the number of tiose who enter into this building of
the temple of the Lord? Whence do they come? Rev. 7:9.
   NoTE.—"Mysteries into which angels desire to look, which prophets and
kings and righteous men desired to understand, the remnant church will carry
in messages from God to the world. The prophets prophesied of these things,
and they longed to understand that which they foretold; , but to them this
privilege was not given. They longed to see what we see, and to hear what we
hear; but they could not. They will know all when Christ shall come the second
time; when, surrounded by a multitude which no man can number, He ex-
plains the deliverance,wrought out by the great sacrifice He made."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 6, pp. 19, 20.

   9. In order that the remnant church may carry God's messages for
the building of His temple to the world, what is necessary on the part

          WISE LEADERSHIP AND EXPERIENCED WORKMEN
    10. In the organization of Israel, what was the character of the men
chosen? Ex. 18:25, 26.
    NoTE.—"I was pointed back to the children of Israel. Very soon after
leaving Egypt they were organized and most thoroughly disciplined." "Has
God changed from a God of order? No; He is the same in the present dis-
pensation as in the former. Paul says, 'God is not the author of confusion, but
of peace.' He is as particular now as then. And He designs that we should
learn lessons of order and organization from the perfect order instituted in the
days of Moses, for the benefit of the children of Israel."—"Testimonies," vol.
1, pp. 650, 653.
    11. What example did Moses as a leader give to all who are called
to lead and teach in God's work? Num. 12:3.
    NOTE.—"The Lord had greatly honored Moses, and had wrought wonders
by his hand; but the fact that he had been chosen to instruct others did not
lead him to conclude that he himself needed no instruction."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 301.
    12. In order that God's world work may prosper, what spirit must
exist among all the believers? 1 Peter 5:5.
    NoTE.—"We are to be subject one to another. No man, in himself, is a
complete whole. Through submission of the mind and will to the Holy Spirit,
we are ever to be learners of the Great Teacher. . . . We are to demonstrate
to the world that men of every nationality are one in Christ Jesus. Then let
us remove every barrier, and come into unity in the service of the Master."—
"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 196.
    13. How did Paul receive the gospel? Gal. 1:12.
    14. How did he co-operate with his brethren? Gal. 2:1, 2; Acts 9:27,
28; 15:2.
    NOTE.—"Notwithstanding the fact that Paul was personally taught by
God,' he had no strained ideas of individual responsibility. While looking to
God for direct guidance, he was ever ready to recognize the authority vested
in the body of believers united in church fellowship. He felt the need of
counsel; and when matters of importance arose, he was glad to lay these
before the church; and to unite with his brethren in seeking God for wisdom
to make right decisions. Even 'the spirits of the prophets,' he declared, 'are
subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace,
as in all churches of the saints.' With Peter, he taught that all united in church
capacity should be 'subject one to another.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 200.
    15. As Jesus sent out His disciples to preach the gospel, what in-
struction did-He give them? Matt. 10:7, 8; 28:19, 20.
    NorE.—"The church of Christ was organized for missionary purposes.
Christian missionary work furnishes the church with a sure foundation, a
foundation having this seal, 'The Lord knoweth them that are His.' By it the
                                       ( 29 )
members are inspired with zeal to deny self, to put forth self-sacrificing efforts
to send the truth to the regions beyond. . . . To show a liberal, self-denying
spirit for the success of foreign missions is a sure way to advance home mis-
sionary work; for the prosperity of the home work depends largely, under
God, upon the reflex influence of the evangelical work done in countries afar
off. . . . That which is given to start the work in one field will result in
strengthening the work in other places. . . . As these churches grow stronger,
they will be able not only to carry on the work in their own borders, but to
send help to other fields."-"Gospel Workers," pp. 464-466.

               Zeal of the Church for Missions
MEMORY VERSE: "The zeal of Thine house hath eaten Me up." John 2:17,
  last part.
STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 9-16; "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp.
  23-30; 445-453.
                           INTRODUCTION
  "The church is God's agency for the proclamation of truth, empowered by
Him to do a special work; and if she is loyal to Him, obedient to all His
commandments, there will dwell within her the excellency of divine grace. If
                                      [30 7
she will be true to her allegiance, if she will honor the Lord God of Israel,
there is no power that can stand against her.
    "Zeal for God and His cause moved the disciples to bear witness to the
gospel with mighty power. Should not a like zeal fire our hearts with a deter-
mination to tell the story of redeeming love, of Christ and Him crucified? It
is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten the
coming of the Saviour."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 600.
              VASTNESS OF THE TASK CALLS FOR ZEAL
   1. How did Paul regard himself and his fellow workers? 2 Cor. 5:20.
   NOTE.—"The work of the ambassadors for Christ is far,greater and more
responsible than many dream of. They should not be at all satisfied with their
success until they can, by their earnest labors and the blessing of God, present
to Him serviceable Christians, who have a true sense of their responsibility,
and will do their appointed work. . . . All may not occupy a position of
prominence; yet all may fill positions of usefulness and trust, and may, by
their persevering fidelity, do far more good than they have any idea that they
can do."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, pp. 398, 399.
   2. How zealously and faithfully did Paul labor? 2 Cor. 6:4-10.
   3. What did Paul exhort Christians to do?' 1 Cor. 11:1; Phil. 4:9.
   NOTE.—"What the church needs in these days of peril, is an army of workers
who, like Paul, have educated themselves for usefulness, who have a deep
experience in the things of God, and who are filled with earnestness and zeal.
Sanctified, self-sacrificing men are needed; men who are brave and true; men
in whose hearts Christ is formed, 'the hope of glory,' and who with lips touched
with holy fire will 'preach the word.' "—"Gospel Workers," p. 61.
              EXAMPLES OF FAITH AND ZEAL FOR GOD
    4. What was Gideon's reply to the salutation of the angel? Judges
6:13.
    NorE.—"As Gideon labored in secrecy and silence, he sadly pondered upon
the condition of Israel, and considered how the oppressor's yoke might be
broken from off his people."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 546.
    It was Gideon's great burden for the sad plight of his people that made
it possible for God to use him as a leader in the deliverance of Israel from
the Midianites.
    5. Tell the story of the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines by
the hand of Jonathan. 1 Sam. 14:1-16.
    NoTE.—"Jonathan, the king's son, a man who feared the Lord, was chosen
as the instrument to deliver Israel. . . . Angels of heaven shielded. Jonathan
and his attendant, angels fought by their side, and the Philistines fell before
them. The earth trembled as though a great multitude with horsemen and
chariots were approaching. Jonathan recognized the tokens of divine aid,
and even the Philistines knew that God was working for the deliverance of
Israel."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 623.

    These things "are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
world are come." 1 Cor. 10:11. While our warfare is not physical but spiritual,
yet an even greater degree of zeal and courage for the honor of the cause of
God, is required of all the members of the church than was required of His
people anciently.
    6. What did Jeremiah resolve not to do? Why could he not carry out
his resolution? Jer. 20:9.
    NOTE.—"Imprisoned, and placed in the stocks, the prophet nevertheless
continued to speak the messages of Heaven to those who stood by. His voice
could not be silenced by persecution. The word of truth, be declared, 'was
in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with
forbearing, and I could not stay.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 432.
    7. How did Daniel, a man against whom is recorded no wrong,
identify himself with God's erring people? Dan. 9:5-10.
    NOTE.—"With faith founded on the sure word of prophecy, Daniel pleaded
with the Lord for the speedy fulfillment of these promises. He pleaded for the
honor of God to be preserved. In his petition he identified himself fully with
those who had fallen short of the divine purpose, confessing their sins as his
own."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 554, 555.
    8. How did the course of Israel, with the consequent destruction of
Jerusalem, make Nehemiah feel? Neh. 1:4; 2:1, 2.
    9. How did Nehemiah identify himself with God's erring people?
Neh. 1:7.
    NOTE.—"Overwhelmed with sorrow, Nehemiah could neither eat nor drink ;
he 'wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted.' In his grief he turned to the
divine Helper. 'I . . . prayed,' he said, 'before the God of heaven' Faith-
fully he made confession of his sins and the sins of his people. He pleaded
that God would maintain the cause of Israel, restore their courage and strength,
and help them to build up the waste places of Judah."—"Prophets and
Kings," p. 629.
                 GOD GIVES STRENGTH AND WISDOM
    10. How could Jesus drive an evil company out of the temple? John
2:17.
    Nom.—"Looking upon Christ, they behold divinity flash through the garb
of humanity. . . . He speaks, and His clear, ringing voice—the same that
upon Mount Sinai proclaimed the law that priests and rulers are transgressing
—is heard echoing through the arches of the temple: 'Take these things hence;
make not My Father's house an house of merchandise.' Slowly descending the
steps, and raising the scourge of cords gathered up on entering the inclosure,
He bids the bargaining company depart from the precincts of the temple. . . .
Officers of the temple, speculating priests, brokers and cattle traders, with
their sheep and oxen, rush from the place, with the one thought of escaping
from the condemnation of His presence. . . . Even the disciples tremble.
They are awestruck by the words and manner of Jesus, so unlike His usual de-
meanor. They remember that it is written of Him, 'The zeal of Thine house
hath eaten Me up.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 158.
                                                                             4-
      eA Widow's Mite Is Not the Measure of Men of Might.
                              1 32 )
    Zeal for God's truth and worship gives unusual power. Peter and John
before the Sanhedrin, Paul before the Roman rulers, Luther before the Diet
of Worms, were each consumed by their zeal for the cause of Christ. Their
love and fervor for Christ and His gospel gave the Holy Spirit the oppor-
tunity to reveal Himself in convincing and convicting power. But it is not
on great occasions alone that a zeal for God's house should consume every
other impulse and desire. God's Spirit enlarges the powers of the devoted,
zealous worker today as in the past.
    11. Discuss Paul's example of zeal. Phil. 3:7-14.
    NoTE.—"The trials and anxieties that Paul had endured had preyed upon
his physical powers. The infirmities of age were upon him. He felt that he
was now doing his last work; and as the time of his labor grew shorter, his
efforts became more intense. There seemed to be no limit to his zeal. Resolute
in purpose, prompt in action, strong in faith, he journeyed from church to
church, in many lands, and sought by every means within his power to
strengthen the hands of the believers, that they might do faithful work in
winning souls to Jesus, and that in the trying times upon which they were even
then entering, they might remain steadfast to the gospel, bearing faithful wit-
ness for Christ."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 488.
    12. After receiving Christ's commission, where did the disciples go?
What did they do? With what results? Mark 16:20.
    NOTE.—"As Christ sent forth His disciples, so today He sends forth the
members of His church. The same power that the apostles had is for them.
If they will make God their strength, He will work with them, and they shall
 not labor in vain."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 599.

The Work of the Holy Spirit in Giving the Gospel
MEMORY VERSE: "When He, the Spirit of truth, is come," "He will reprove the
  world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment." John 16:13, 8.
STUDY HELPS: "Acts of the Apostles," pp. 35-56; "Testimonies," vol. 8, pp.
  19-23; "Testimonies to Ministers," pp. 506-512.

                                INTRODUCTION
   "The preaching of the word is of no avail without the presence and aid of
the Holy Spirit; for this Spirit is the only effectual teacher of divine truth.
Only when the truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit, will it quicken
the conscience or transform the life. . . . Without the co-operation of the
Spirit of God, no amount of education, no advantages, however great, can
make one a channel of light. Before one book of the New Testament had been
written, before one gospel sermon had been preached after Christ's ascension,
the Holy Spirit came upon the praying disciples. Then the testimony of their
enemies was, 'Ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.' Christ promised
the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the promise belongs as much to
us as to the first disciples."—"Gospel Workers," p. 284.
   THE CHURCH DEPENDENT ON THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
    1. What is the particular work of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter?
John 16:8.
    NOTE.—"It is the Holy Spirit that convicts of sin. If the sinner responds
to the quickening influence of the Spirit, he will be brought to repentance,
and aroused to the importance of obeying the divine requirements."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 52.
    2. Into what will the Spirit of truth guide those who look to Him and
listen to His voice? John 16:13, first part.
    NoTE.—"It is not essential for us to be able to define just what the Holy
Spirit is. Christ tells us that the Spirit is the Comforter, 'the Spirit of truth,
which proceedeth from the Father' It is plainly declared regarding the Holy
Spirit, that in His work of guiding men into all truth, 'He shall speak of
Himself.' The nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery. Men cannot explain it,
because the Lord has not revealed it to them. Men having fanciful views may
bring together passages of Scripture and put a human construction on them;
but the acceptance of these views will not strengthen the church. Regarding
such mysteries, which are too deep for human understanding, silence is golden."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 51, 52.
    3. Of whom does the Spirit of truth speak? John 16:13, last part; 15:26.
   4. How does John in his epistle connect the work of the Spirit with
that of Christ? 1 John 5:5, 6.
                                       84
           THE HOLY SPIRIT IMPARTS UNDERSTANDING OF
                              SPIRITUAL TRUTH
     5. Describe the work of the Comforter as a teacher. John 14:26.
     NOTE.—"Jesus had opened before His disciples a vast tract of truth. But
it was most difficult for them to keep His lessons distinct from the traditions
and maxims of the scribes and Pharisees. . . . Many of His lessons seemed
almost lost upon them. Jesus saw that they did not lay hold of the real
meaning of His words. He compassionately promised that the Holy Spirit
should recall these sayings to their minds. And He had left unsaid many things
that could not be comprehended by the disciples. These also would be opened
to them by the Spirit."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 670.
     6. What does the Holy Spirit do for Christ? How does the Spirit
glorify Him? John 16:14.
     NoTE.—"Of the Spirit Jesus said, 'He shall glorify Me.' The Saviour came
to glorify the Father by the demonstration of His love; so the Spirit was to
glorify Christ by revealing His grace to the world. The very image of God
is to be reproduced in humanity. The honor of God, the honor of Christ, is
involved in the perfection of the character of His people. . . . The preaching
of the word will be of no avail without the continual presence and aid of the
Holy Spirit. This is the only effectual teacher of divine truth. Only when
the truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit, will it quicken the con-
science or transform the life."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 671.
     7. How did Jesus speak of the work of the Holy Spirit in conversion?
John 3:5.
     NoTE.—"The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the
old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a
new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual
working of the Holy Spirit. . . . By an agency as unseen as the wind, Christ
is constantly working upon the heart."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 172.
     8. What is the place of the Spirit in the work of redemption? What
should we not do? Eph. 1:13, 14; 4:30.
     NOTE.—"Every ray of light rejected, every warning despised or unheeded,
 every passion indulged, every transgression of the law of God, is a seed sown,
 which yields its unfailing harvest. The Spirit of God, persistently resisted, is
 at last withdrawn from the sinner, and then there is left no power to control
 the evil passions of the soul, and no protection from the malice and enmity of
 Satan."—"The Great Controversy," p. 36.
      THE HOLY SPIRIT IS THE POWER, GLORY, AND VICTORY
                               OF BELIEVERS
   9. How did the Spirit of God work with Gideon? Judges 6:14, 34.
   Nora.—The American Revised marginal reading of this text is: "But the
Spirit of Jehovah clothed Itself with Gideon." This rendering is in accordance
with Jesus' word when in speaking of the Spirit of truth He said, "for He
dwelleth with you, and shall be in you."
   10. How did the Holy Spirit use the evangelist Philip for the salva-
tion of the Ethiopian eunuch? Acts 8:29, 39.
   NOTE.—"In the experience of Philip and the Ethiopian is presented the
work to which the Lord calls His people. The Ethiopian represents a large
                                      (35 1
class who need missionaries like Philip, missionaries who will hear the voice
of God, and go where He sends them. There are those in the world who are
reading the ScriptUres, but who cannot understand their import. The men and
women who have a knowledge of God are needed to explain the word to these
souls."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp.-58, 59.
    11. How did the Spirit direct Peter in preaching to the Gentiles?
Acts 10:19, 20.
    NOTE.—II is to be observed that the angels and the Holy Spirit co-operate
in directing and inspiring men in working for those who are seeking for truth.
The angel of the Lord directed Philip where to go to meet the Ethiopian seeker
after Christ. Acts 8:26. An angel of God also directed Cornelius to send for a
spiritual helper. Acts 10:3, 7.
    "Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for us of which we
know nothing. Those who accept the one principle of making the service of
God supreme, will find perplexities vanish, and a plain path before their feet."
—"The Ministry of Healing,"-p. 481.
    12. How only may God's work be accomplished? Zech. 4:6.
    NOTE.—"We cannot depend upon form or external machinery. What we
need is the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit of God. 'Not by might,
nor by power, but by My $pirit, saith the Lord of hosts.' Pray without ceas-
ing, and watch by working in accordance with your prayers. As you pray,
believe, trust in God. It is the time of the latter rain, when the Lord will give
largely of His Spirit. Be fervent in prayer, and watch in the Spirit."—"Testi-
monies to Ministers," p. 512.
    13. What is the source of our power? Phil. 2:13.
    NOTE.—"We cannot use the Holy Spirit; the Spirit is to use us. Through
the Spirit, God works in His people 'to will and to do of His good pleasure.'
But many will not submit to be led. They want to manage themselves. This
is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those who wait humbly
upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. This
promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It
is given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply
every soul according to the capacity to receive."—"Gospel Workers," p. 285.
    14. For how long is the Spirit of truth to abide with the church?
John 14:16.
    NOTE.—"With the consecrated worker for God, in whatever place he may
be, the Holy Spirit abides. The words spoken to the disciples are spoken also
to us. The Comforter is ours as well as theirs. The Spirit furnishes the strength
that sustains striving, wrestling souls in every emergency, amidst the hatred of
the world, and the realization of their own failures and mistakes. In sorrow
and affliction, when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we
feel helpless and alone,—these are the times when, in answer to the prayer of
faith, the Holy Spirit brings comfort to the heart."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 51.

                  Reward of Christ's Servants
MEMORY VERSE: "They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firma-
  ment; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever."
  Dan. 12:3.
STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 305-312; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
  pp. 390-404; "Prophets and Kings," pp. 722-733; "Testimonies," vol. 9, pp. 285-288.

                              INTRODUCTION
   "Oh that they would now exert their powers of mind in seeking ways to
approach perishing sinners, that they might make known to them the path of
holiness, and by prayer and entreaty win even one soul to Christ! What a
noble enterprise! One soul to praise God through eternity! One soul to enjoy
happiness and everlasting life ! One gem in their crown to shine as a star for-
ever and ever! But even more than one can be brought to turn from error to
truth, from sin to holiness. Says the Lord by the prophet, 'And they that
turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.' Then
those who engage with Christ and angels in the work of saving perishing souls,
are richly rewarded in the kingdom of heaven."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 512.
                A BLESSED RECOMPENSE FOR ALL
   1. What did Paul do whenever he thought of his Philippian brethren?
Phil. 1:3.
    2. How did the apostles consider those they had won for Christ?
Phil. 4:1; 1 Thess. 2:19, 20; 3 John 4.
    NorE.—"Paul wrote to these brethren as 'saints in Christ Jesus;' but he
was not writing to those who were perfect in character. He wrote to them as
men and women who were striving against temptation, and who were in danger
of falling."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 167.
                                       [ 37 1
    Paul had great reward for his labor of love for his brethren in their endeav-
ors to walk the way to heaven. He thanked God for them—this fruit of his
labor—whenever they came to his remembrance. They were his "joy and
crown," "beloved and longed for." What greater reward could this faithful
servant of the Lord have had than to see his children in the Lord stand fast,
unmovable in their faith and hope in Christ?
    3. What will God do for those who serve with Christ? John 12:26;
17:22-24.
    NoTE.—The rewards of those who serve their Lord are not all in the future.
The joy of being with Jesus in His work is a reward passing all human value.
If we serve with Christ, we know that His Father honors us. Men honor the
heroes of their nation, but far more to be appreciated is the honor which God
gives to those who serve with His Son in the work of His gospel.
    4. How did Jesus teach that faithfulness in His service has a sure
reward? Matt. 25:21, 23.
    NOTE.—"It is the faithfulness, the loyalty to God, the loving service, that
wins the divine approval. Every impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to
goodness and to God, is noted in the books of heaven, and in the day of God
the workers through whom He has wrought will be commended. They will
enter into the joy of the Lord as they see in His kingdom those who have been
 redeemed through their instrumentality. And they are privileged to participate
in His work there, because they have gained a fitness for it by participation in
His work here."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 361.
    GOD GIVES TEMPORAL AS WELL AS SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS
    5. How does God reward in this present world those who give of
their means for the advancement of His cause? Mal. 3:10-12.
    NoTE.—"These earthly treasures are blessings when rightly used. Those
who have them should realize that they are lent them of God, and should cheer-
fully spend their means to advance His cause. They will not lose their reward
here. They will be kindly regarded by the angels of God, and will also lay up
a treasure in heaven."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 141, 142.
    6. How did Paul compare the rewards of this world with those of
the eternal world? 1 Cor. 9:24, 25.
    NOTE.—"The competitors in the ancient games, after they had submitted
to self-denial and rigid discipline, were not even then sure of the victory. . . .
Such is not the case in the Christian warfare. Not one who complies with the
conditions will be disappointed at the end of the race."—"The Acts of the
 Apostles," p. 313.
    7. How did Paul endeavor to win the prize? Why? 1 Cor. 9:26, 27.
    NOTE.—"The apostle compared himself to a man running in a race, strain-
ing every nerve to win the prize. . . . Paul feared lest, having preached to
others, he himself should be a castaway. He realized that if he did not carry
out in his life the principles he believed and preached, his labors in behalf of
others would avail him nothing."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 314.
    8. What question did Peter ask that revealed something of his motive
in working for Christ? Matt. 19:27, 28.
    NOTE.—"The Saviour's answer thrilled the hearts of those Galilean fisher-
                                       { 88 1
men. It pictured honors that fulfilled their highest dreams. . . . But Peter's
question, 'What shall we have therefore?' had revealed a spirit, that, uncor-
rected, would unfit the disciples to be messengers for Christ; for it was the
spirit of a hireling."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 395, 396.
    The love of Christ, not the reward, is to be the constraining power in our
service for Christ.
    9. What does Christ promise that He will do for those who believe in
Him? John 14:1-3.
    NOTE.-"All who have borne with Jesus the cross of sacrifice, will be
shakers with Him of His glory. It was the joy of Christ in His humiliation
and pain, that His disciples should be glorified with Him. They are the fruit
of His self-sacrifice. The outworking in them of His own character and
spirit, is His reward, and will be His joy throughout eternity. This joy they
share with Him, as the fruit of their labor and sacrifice is seen in other hearts
and lives."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 624.
     10. Speak of the joys of the country Christ will give to those who
have toiled with Him here. Isa. 65:17-25.
     11. Describe the glories of the New Jerusalem and the new earth.
Rev. 21:1-27; Isa. 66:23.
     Non.—"We all marched in and felt that we had a perfect-right in the city.
Here we saw the tree of life and the throne of God. . . Then we began to
look at the glorious things outside of the city. There I saw most glorious houses,
that had the appearance of silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls
 most glorious to behold. These were to be inhabited by the saints. . . . I
saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I plucked them, I cried out,
 `They will never fade.' . . . Then we entered a field full of all kinds of
 beasts,—the lion, the lamb, the leopard, and the wolf, all together in perfect
 union. We passed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably
 after. Then we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have here; no, no;
 but light, and all over glorious; the branches of the trees waved to and fro,
 and we all cried out, `We will dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the
 woods.' "—"Early Writings," pp. 17, 18. •
     12. What is the reward of those who "turn many to righteousness"?
 Dan. 12:3.
     NOTE.—"And what of the age of these glorious bodies. A few years pass
 away, and all things earthly gather the mold of age, and the odor of decay.
 How much in this world has perished entirely! But the stars shine on as fresh
 as in the beginning. . . . Of all things visible, these stand next to the Ancient
 of Days; and their undiminished glory is a prophecy of eternity. And thus
 shall they who turn many to righteousness shine in a glory that shall bring joy
 even to the heart of the Redeemer; and thus shall their years roll on forever
 and ever."—"Daniel and the Revelation," pp. 330, 331.
