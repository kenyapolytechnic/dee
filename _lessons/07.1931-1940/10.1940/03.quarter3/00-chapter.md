ABIDING GIFT OF PROPHECY, THE                            By A. G. Daniells
   In a most comprehensive way the author surveys the entire subject of
the prophetic gift. He follows the evidence of God's guiding hand in
prophecy from the fall of man to the final establishment of the remnant
church, with special emphasis on the providences that have accompanied
the gift of prophecy in the advent movement. This book will bring to the
reader in a new way the beauty and significance of God's gift to His
chosen people. 378 pages. Also published in German.

PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS                                  By Ellen G. White
   The great conflict between good and evil, as illustrated in the lives of
holy men of old. Beginning with the rebellion in heaven, the author
shows why sin was permitted, why Satan was not destroyed, and why
man was tested; gives a thrilling description of man's temptation and fall,
and rehearses the plan of redemption devised for his salvation. The life
of each of the patriarchs from Adam to King David is carefully scanned,
and from each a lesson is drawn. 800 pages. Also published in French,
German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Swedish.

learned from Israel's triumphs, defeats, backslidings, captivity, and refor-
mation; to make these lessons practical helps to souls in times of testing;
and to show the fullness of God's love and mercy in all His dealings with
a gainsaying and obdurate people. The book abounds in great character
studies. Beyond them all rises in glory the coming King, the Lamb of
God, the only-begotten Son, in whom all types of sacrifice, righteousness,
and peace find their fulfillment. 750 pages, illustrated. Algo published in

        THE SURE WORD OF PROPHECY

                       Lesson 1, for July 6, 1940
 Communication With Heaven—Lost Through
      Sin; Restored Through Christ
    MEMORY VERSE: "If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make
Myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream." Num. 12:6.
    STUDY HELP: "The Abiding Gift of Prophecy," A. G. Daniells, pp. 15-21.
    SEED THOUGHT: In Eden Adam and Eve held direct communion with their
Creator, and with the angels. Sin was an act of rebellion, which automatically sepa-
rated them from the kingdom of God, and made them subjects of Satan. As a part of
the plan of redemption, whereby man might, by his own choice and through faith in
the promised Saviour, find his way back to God, it was necessary that some way be
devised for God to direct him, and to maintain communication with him. This He has
done through the ministry of angels, by means of visions and dreams, for a time by
the Urim and Thummim, with a select few individuals by direct communion, but usually
through prophets whom He chooses to convey His messages to His people.

                Man's Communion With His Creator
    1. 'What are the first recorded words of God to man? Gen. 1:27-30.
    NOTE.—Man was created with perfect mental and physical powers. He
was capable of understanding the words of God, and of responding.
    "Our first parents, though created innocent and holy, were not placed
beyond the possibility of wrongdoing. God made them free moral agents,
capable of appreciating the wisdom and benevolence of His character and
the justice of His requirements, and with full liberty to yield or to withhold
obedience. They were to enjoy communion with God and with holy angels."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 48.
    2. When Edenic conditions are restored, what degree of fellowship will
exist between God and the redeemed? Rev. 21:3; Isa. 66:23.
    NoTa.—"Restored to His presence, man will again, as at the beginning, be
taught of God: 'My people shall know My name; ... they shall know in that
day that I am He that doth speak; behold, it is I.' Isa. 52:6."—"Education,"
p. 302.
    3. For what purpose did Jesus come to this world to die? Luke 19 : 10.
    4. What words of Jesus show His desire and purpose regarding His as-
sociation with those whom He has redeemed? John 14:3; 17:24.
    NoTE.—"It is the reward of Christ's workers to enter into His joy. That

joy, to which Christ Himself looks forward with eager desire, is presented in
His request to His Father, 'I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be
with Me where I am.' John 17:24."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 309.

         Sin's Effect Upon Man's Communion With God
    5. What effect did sin have upon the association of man with his Crea-
tor? Gen. 3 :24; Isa. 59:2.
    NOTE.—"Adam, in his innocence, had enjoyed open communion with his
Maker; but sin brought separation between God and man, and the atonement
of Christ alone could span the abyss, and make possible the communication of
blessing or salvation from heaven to earth. Man was still cut off from direct
approach to his Creator, but God would communicate with him through Christ
and angels."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 67.
    6. In what words does the apostle Paul describe our communion with
God during the reign of sin, as contrasted with the time when Edenic con-
ditions will be restored? 1 Cor. 13:12.

               Means of Communion Since Man's Fall
    7. Cite instances where God sometimes sent messages to individuals.
Gen. 19:1, 12, 13; Num. 22:31-33; Judges 6:11-22; 13:15-21.
    NOTE.—"It is impossible to give any idea of the experience of the people of
God who shall be alive upon the earth when celestial glory and a repetition of
the persecutions of the past are blended. They will walk in the light proceeding
from the throne of God. By means of the angels there will be constant com-
munication between heaven and earth."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 16.
    8. In connection with the sanctuary service, what provision was made by
which inquirers might learn God's will? Ex. 28:30; Num. 27:21.
    NOTE.—"At the right and left of the breastplate were two large stones of
great brilliancy. These were known as the Urim and Thummim. By them the
will of God was made known through the high priest. When questions were
brought for decision before the Lord, a halo of light encircling the precious stone
at the right was a token of the divine consent or approval, while a cloud shad-
owing the stone at the left was an evidence of denial or disapprobation."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 351.
    9. What instance is given which illustrates the use of this method of in-
quiry? 1 Sam. 23:6, 9-12.
    NoTE.—In the temple as restored after the Jewish captivity, the Shekinah
of God's glory was no longer manifested. So too there was no longer the evi-
dence of His presence in the Urim and Thummim. Its absence, with perhaps
a hope of its restoration, is suggested in Ezra 2:63.
    10. How did God send a message of assurance and comfort to Jacob
after he had left his home in sorrow? Gen. 28:10-16.
    NoTE.—The student will readily recall many other instances of dreams given
by God to individuals for their guidance and instruction. Sometimes dreams
were given to those who did not know God, as Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar.
Solomon talked with God in a dream, and made his choice of wisdom to be
granted above riches and honor. Joseph was instructed in a dream to take the
child Jesus to Egypt, and he was also instructed when the time had come to
                                       [4)
return. In some of these instances, plain instruction was given. In other cases,
the message was suggested by symbols which were later interpreted. At such
times, the Spirit of the Lord was as necessary for the true interpretation as fot
the dream itself.
    11. With whom did the Lord speak directly, face to face? Gen. 18:1,
2, 22-33; Ex. 33:9-11; Deut. 34:10.
   NoTE.—Speaking of Moses, we read: "He became united to, submerged in,
the Holy One of Israel. He believed in the great God. He held communion
with the Father through humble prayer. He looked to the Highest for an edu-
cation in spiritual things, and for a knowledge of his duty as a faithful shep-
herd. His life became so closely linked with heaven that God talked with him
face to face, 'as a man speaketh unto his friend.' Ex. 33:11."—"Counsels to
Teachers," p. 408.
    12. How did the Lord make it clear that His manner of communication
with Moses was exceptional? What was His usual method of revelation?
Num. 12:1-8.
   NOTE.—"Their claim to the prophetic gift was not denied; God might have
spoken to them in visions and dreams. But to Moses, whom the Lord Himself
declared 'faithful in all Mine house,' a nearer communion had been granted.
With him God spake mouth to mouth. 'Wherefore then were ye not afraid to
speak against My servant Moses?' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 385.



                       Lesson 2, for July 13, 1940
          God's Messages in Antediluvian Days
    MEMORY VERSE: "This is as the waters of Noah unto Me: for as I have sworn
that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would
not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee." Isa. 54:9.
    STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 58-62, 84-89, 92-98; "The Abid-
ing Gift of Prophecy," pp. 36-45.
    SEED THOUGHT: God's messages were progressively given. As new conditions
and new needs arose. His plans and purposes were unfolded. To Adam and Eve after
the fall, hope of recovery was given through the "Seed of the woman." As wickedness
increased, warnings of the Flood, and of the final judgment upon sinners at the coming
of Christ, were voiced through Enoch; to Noah was given the time message of the
impending judgment, the call to repentance, the specifications of the ark, and after the
Flood the reassuring covenant that the catastrophe would not be repeated. Only a few
of the prophets of this period are listed.

                God's Earliest Messages to Fallen Man
    1. As soon as our first parents had sinned, what features of the plan of
salvation were made known to them? Gen. 3:15.
    2. How early in history was the prophetic gift manifested? Luke 1:70.
   NoTE.—"It was the Son of God that gave to our first parents the promise of
redemption. It was He who revealed Himself to the patriarchs. Adam, Noah,
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses understood the gospel. . . . These holy men
of old held communion with the Saviour who was to come to our world in hu-
man flesh."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 366.
                                          [5 ]
      "It is the voice of Christ that speaks through patriarchs and prophets, from
  the days of Adam even to the closing scenes of time."—"The Desire of Ages,"
  P. 799.
      3. What evidence have we that the death of the Son of God as a substi-
  tute was understood from the beginning? Gen. 4:3, 4.
      NOTE.—"Abel 'grasped the great principles of redemption. He saw himself
  a sinner, and he saw sin, and its penalty death, standing between his soul and
  communion with God. He brought the slain victim, the sacrificed life, thus
  acknowledging the claims of the law that had been transgressed. Through the
  shed blood he looked to the future sacrifice, Christ dying on the cross of Cal-
  vary; and trusting in the atonement that was there to be made, he had the
  witness that he was righteous, and his offering accepted."—"Patriarchs and
` Prophets," p. 72.
      4. Of what future event did Enoch prophesy? Jude 14, 15.
      NOTE.—"Enoch was a man of strong and highly cultivated mind, and ex-
  tensive knowledge; he was honored with special revelations from God; yet
  being in constant communion with heaven, with a sense of the divine greatness
  and perfection ever before him, he was one of the humblest of men.... Through
  holy angels, God revealed to Enoch His purpose to destroy the world by a
  flood, and He also opened more fully to him the plan of redemption. By the
  spirit of prophecy He carried him down through the generations that should
  live after the Flood, and showed him the great events connected with the second
  coming of Christ and the end of the world."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 85.
                          Noah a Prophet of God
     5. What message was given to Noah for the impenitent world? Gen.
  6:13.
     6. Explain how Noah's message conflicted with the scientific knowledge
 of that day? Gen. 2:5, 6; Heb. 11:7, first part.
     NOTE.—"The world before the Flood reasoned that for centuries the laws
 of nature had been fixed. The recurring seasons had come in their order. Here-
 tofore rain had never fallen; the earth had been watered by a mist or dew.
 The rivers had never yet passed their boundaries, but had borne their waters
 safely to the sea. Fixed decrees had kept the waters from overflowing their
 banks. But these reasoners did not recognize the hand of Him who had stayed
 the waters, saying, 'Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further."'—"Patriarchs
 and Prophets," pp. 96, 97.
     7. In this communication to Noah, what provision was made for the
 safety of those who should heed the call to, repentance? Gen. 6:14-16.
     NOTE.—In 1609, Peter Jansen of Holland built a ship with the same propor-
 tions as Noah's ark, only smaller. When launched, it proved to be able to carry
 one-third more freight than other vessels of the same length but differently
 proportioned, and was also swifter in sailing. The Dutch built several ships
 like it, calling them Noah's arks. Because they were not fitted to carry cannon
 for protection against privateers, they were discontinued when war broke out
 in 1621. (See Geikie's "Hours With the Bible," vol. 1, p. 208.) The ark, ap-
 proximately 680 feet long, by modern measure of capacity would have a
 tonnage of about 32,800. Only in recent years have vessels of this size been
 built. How, save by divine directions, could Noah have constructed such a
 ship, with proper proportions for safety, freightage, and mobility?
                                       [6)
    8. Where is found the first recorded prophetic period of time? Gen. 6:3.
   NorE.—"Noah preached to the people of his time that God would give
them one hundred and twenty years in which to repent of their sins, and find
refuge in the ark; but they refused the gracious invitation."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 4, p. 308.
    9. What message of hope did God give to Noah? What sign was given
as a token of its surety? Gen. 9:8-17.
   NOTE.—"It was God's purpose that as the children of after generations
should ask the meaning of the glorious arch which spans the heavens, their
parents should repeat the story of the Flood, and tell them that the Most High
had beaded the bow, and placed it in the clouds as an assurance that the waters
should never again overflow the earth. Thus from generation to generation it
would testify of divine love to man, and would strengthen his confidence in
God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 106, 107.
               Assurance to the Remnant Church
   10. In a prophecy for the remnant church, how is the fulfillment of this
covenant with Noah made the basis of assurance of God's mercy in trou-
blous times? Isa. 54:7-10.
    NorE.—"With the assurance given to Noah concerning the Flood, God Him-
self has linked one of the most precious promises of His grace."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 107.
    11. To what future event was the mind of all the prophets directed?
Acts 3:20, 21.
    NorE.—"Notwithstanding the prevailing iniquity, there was a line of holy
men who, elevated and ennobled by communion with God, lived as in the com-
panionship of heaven. They were men of massive intellect, of wonderful at-
tainments. They had a great and holy mission,—to develop a character of
righteousness, to teach a lesson of godliness, not only to the men of their time,
but for future generations. Only a few of the most prominent are mentioned
in the Scriptures; but all through the ages, God had faithful witnesses, true-
hearted worshipers."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 84.



                       Lesson 3, for July 20, 1940
     Abraham, and the Gospel of Righteousness
                   • by Faith        .
     MEMORY VERSE: "So, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
Heb. 6:15.
     STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 125-131, 145-155.
     SEED THOUGHT: Only a few generations after the Flood mankind again turned
to idolatry. God chose Abraham, of the line of Shem, from an idolatrous home. "Idola-
try invited him on every side, but in vain. Faithful among the faithless, uncorrupted by
the prevailing apostasy, he steadfastly adhered to the worship of the one true God.
. . . He communicated His will to Abraham, and gave him a distinct knowledge of
the requirements of His law, and of the salvation that would be accomplished through
Christ."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 125. Patiently God led him on, making prom-
                                           [73
ises that seemed impossible of fulfillment, until faith was perfected. The outstanding
contribution of the prophetic utterances given through Abraham, and of his experience,
is the doctrine of righteousness by faith. The promised Seed makes possible the fulfill-
ment of the promise that spiritual Israel shall be the heir of the world.

                        Called Out of Heathenism
   1. What was the environment of Abraham when God first spoke to him?
Joshua 24: 2 ; Isa. 51:1, 2.
    2. What threefold renunciation was asked of him? Upon condition of
his obedience, what promises were made to Abraham? Gen. 12:1-3.
    NOTE.—"Before God can use him, Abraham must be separated from his
former associations, that he may not be controlled by human influence;or rely
upon human aid. Now that he has become connected with God, this man must
henceforth dwell among strangers.... Just such faith and confidence as Abra-
ham had, the messengers of God need today. But many whom the Lord could
use will not move onward, hearing and obeying the one Voice above all others.
The connection with kindred and friends, the former habits and associations,
too often have so great an influence upon God's servants that He can give them
but little instruction, can communicate to them but little knowledge of His
purposes; and often after a time He sets them aside, and calls others in their
place, whom He proves and tests in the same manner."—"Testimonies," vol. 4,
pp. 523, 524.
    3. How did Abraham manifest his faith in the promises of God? Heb.
11:8.
    4. How soon did Abraham forsake his father's house? In what place
did he tarry, and until what event? Gen. 11:31, 32; 12:4.
    NoTE.—"Thus far his father's family accompanied him ; for with their idol-
atry they united the worship of the true God. Here [in Haran] Abraham
remained till the death of Terah. But from his father's grave the divine voice
bade him go forward. His brother Nahor with his household clung to their
home and their idols. Besides, Sarah, the wife of Abraham, only Lot, the son of
Haran long since dead, chose to share the patriarch's pilgrim life."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 127.
                    A Test of Faith and Obedience
    5. To what place did God now guide them?• What message from God
assured Abraham that he had arrived at his destination? Gen. 12:5-8.
    NOTE.—"Abraham had reached the goal of his hopes to find a country oc-
cupied by an alien race, and overspread with idolatry. In the groves Were set
up the altars of false gods, and human sacrifices were offered upon the neigh-
boring heights. While he clung to the divine premise, it was not without dis-
tressful forebodings that he pitched his tent."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 128.
   6. What further trying circumstances led Abraham to go to the land of
Egypt? While there, how did he manifest a lack of faith? How was he
rebuked? Verses 9-20.
                          Renewing the Promise
    7. Under what circumstances did the Lord renew to Abraham the prom-
ise of innumerable seed, and the inheritance of the land? Gen. 13:14-18.
                                        [a l
    NoTE.—Standing on an eminence, Abraham had permitted Lot to choose
the best of the land for himself. While his nephew was making his way "toward
Sodom," God told Abraham to look in every direction,—all he saw was to be
his heritage.
    8. In his next recorded vision, what cheering words were spoken to Abra-
ham? Gen. 15:1.
    NorE.—Having recovered, with about three hundred men, from the mighty
king Amraphel and his three allies, the captives and the spoils of Sodom, well
might Abraham have been fearful of reprisal. He had declined the great wealth




offered him by the grateful king of Sodom. How fitting the words, "After
these things," "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
reward !"
             Tangible Evidence Given God's Servant
   9. With what words did God again assure the prophet of the certainty
of His promises? What was Abraham's attitude? Verses 2-7.
   10. What tangible evidence did God give to Abraham concerning the
surety of His promise? Verse 18.
   11. In addition to Abraham, for whose sake was this covenant made?
Heb. 6:17-19; 1 Peter 1 :12.
                                  f9 ]
                 Lessons From the Final Test of Faith
   12. What supreme test of faith was brought to Abraham when Isaac
was a young man? Gen. 22:1, 2.
   13. In acting in obedience to this trying command, to what heights did
Abraham's faith reach? Heb. 11:17-19.
   14. What outstanding contribution to gospel truth is set forth in the
experience of Abraham? Rom. 4:3, 20-25.



                       Lesson 4, for July 27, 1940
           With Moses From Egypt to Canaan
    MEMORY VERSE: "By a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by
a prophet was he preserved." Hosea 12:13.
    STUDY HELPS: "Education," pp. 68, 69; "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 245-
247, 462-468; "The Abiding Gift of Prophecy," pp. 49-55.
    SEED THOUGHT: Two centuries after Abraham, new conditions arose which
called for greatly advanced steps in the progressive revelation of God to His people.
They needed a greater revelation of His faithfulness and power, and further lessons of
faith in His care. They had in their servitude forgotten God's law, and needed a clear
representation of their duty to Him and to one another. They needed a better under-
standing of the plan of salvation. All these important lessons were revealed to them
through Moses, with statutes and judgments specifically applying the principles of the
Ten Commandments. Moses also prophesied of Christ.

                             The Call of Moses
     1. What revelation of the nature of God was given to Moses when God
called him to act as His prophet? Ex. 3:13-15.
     NorE.—"I AM, assumed as a name, implies (1) an existence different from
all other existence-1 am, and there is none beside Me' (Isa. 45:6) ; (2). an
existence out of time, with which time has nothing to do (John 8:58) ; (3) an
existence that is real, all other being shadowy; (4) an independent and uncon-
ditional existence, from which all other is derived, and on which it is depend-
ent."—"An Old Testament Commentary for English Readers," Ellicott, vol.
1, p. 200.
     2. Of what did God say that He was mindful? To what work did He
call Moses? Verses 7-10.
     3. In his reluctance to undertake this great work, what three excuses
did Moses make for himself? How did God meet each one? Ex. 3:11, 12;
4 : 1-12.
    NorE.—"The divine command given to Moses found him self-distrustful,
slow of speech, and timid. He was overwhelmed with a sense of his incapacity
to be a mouthpiece for God to Israel. But having once accepted the work, he
entered upon it with his whole heart, putting all his trust in the Lord. The
greatness of his mission called into exercise the best powers of his mind. God
blessed his ready obedience, and he became eloquent, hopeful, self-possessed,
and well fitted for the greatest work ever given to man. . .. Had Moses relied
upon his own strength and wisdom, and eagerly accepted the great charge, he
                                       [ 10 ]
would have evinced his entire unfitness for such a work. The fact that a man
feels his weakness, is at least some evidence that he realizes the magnitude of
the work appointed him, and that he will make God his counselor and his
strength."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 255.
    4. How is the relation of God to the prophet illustrated by the relation-
ship between Moses and Aaron? Ex. 7:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"The prophet, in the true meaning of the word, is the mouth of
God among men, whether in respect to the present or the future. Prediction
is only one form of the divine communications He announces. To proclaim the
present purposes and will of God is his main commission."—"Hours With the
Bible," Geikie, vol. 2, p. 118.
    "The central idea of the word [prophet] is, one to whom God reveals Him-
self and through whom He speaks. The revelation may or may not relate to
the future. The prophet is a forth-teller, not necessarily a foreteller. The es-
sence of the prophetic character is:immediate intercourse with God."—"Word
Studies in the New Testament," Robertson, vol. 1, pp. 325, 326.

                         The Prophecy Fulfilled
    5. What was the design of God in the messages sent to Pharaoh and in
His dealings with the Egyptians and with His own people? Ex. 6:7; 7:5,
17.
    NoTE.—"This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God,
and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent." John 17:3. Repeatedly the purpose
of the revelation of God through His messenger is said to be that they might
know Him. In the book of Ezekiel alone, this is stated more than sixty times.
If possible, He makes His people to know Him through His mercy and His
gracious favors. If this is not possible, He may through judgments speak His
message of sovereign power, as He spoke to the Egyptians when His commands
were unheeded and flouted.
     6. With what precision was the time prophecy given to Abraham ful-
filled? Ex. 12:40, 41.
    NOTE.—"Like the stars in the vast circuit of their appointed path, God's
purposes know no haste and no delay. Through the symbols of the great dark-
ness and the smoking furnace, God had revealed to Abraham the bondage of
Israel in Egypt, and had declared that the time of their sojourning should be
four hundred years. 'Afterward,' He said, 'shall they come out with great
substance.' Against that word, all the power of Pharaoh's proud empire battled
in vain. On 'the selfsame day' appointed in the divine promise, 'it came to
pass that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.' "—"The
Desire of Ages," pp. 31, 32.
             The Prophet Must Believe the Message
    7. In what experience did Moses exemplify the confidence that a true
prophet will have in the messages given to him? Ex. 14:13, 14, 21, 22.
    NOTE.—"There was no possibility of deliverance unless God Himself should
interpose for their release; but having been brought into this position in obedi-
ence to the divine direction, Moses felt no fear of the consequences. His calm
and assuring reply to the people was, 'Fear ye not, stand still, and see the sal-
vation of the Lord.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 284.
                                      [ 11 j
   8. In what words did God emphasize the historic importance of the giv-
ing of the law? Deut. 4:9-13, 32, 33.
   NorE.—"During the bondage in Egypt, many of the Israelites had, to a
great extent, lost the knowledge of God's law, and had mingled its precepts
with heathen customs and traditions. God brought them to Sinai, and there
with His own voice declared His law."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 334.
        Instruction Regarding the Sabbath and the Law
    9. What special instruction was given through Moses regarding the
observance of the fourth commandment? Ex. 31:12-17.
    NOTE.—"To us as to Israel the Sabbath is given 'for a perpetual covenant.'
To those who reverence His holy day the Sabbath is a sign that God recognizes
them as His chosen people. It is a pledge that He will fulfill to them His cove-
nant. Every soul who accepts the sign of God's government places himself
under the divine, everlasting covenant. He fastens himself to the golden chain
of obedience, every link of which is a promise."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 350.
    10. Through what system was the gospel of forgiveness and of salva-
tion from sin revealed to Moses? Ex. 25:8, 9; Lev. 4:31, 35; 5:10, 16, 18.
    NOTE.—"While Moses was in the mount, God presented to him, not only
the tables of the law, but also the plan of salvation. He saw that the sacrifice
of Christ was prefigured by all the types and symbols of the Jewish age; and
it was the heavenly light streaming from Calvary, no less than the glory of the
law of God, that shed such a radiance upon the face of Moses. That divine
illumination symbolized the glory of the dispensation of which Moses was the
visible mediator, a representative of the one true Intercessor."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 330.
    11. Besides the Ten Commandments and the sanctuary service, what
other laws were given to Moses for the people? Deut. 4:13, 14.
    Norn.—The comprehensive code of laws given by the Lord through Moses
includes civil law; instruction for courts of justice; sanitary regulations, in-
cluding diet, quarantine, cleanliness; relation of the rich and poor; rules of
warfare; relation of masters and servants; support of the Levites by the tithes
(Lev. 27:30-33).
    "Moses was commanded to write, as God should bid him, judgments and
laws giving minute instruction as to what was required. These directions re-
lating to the duty of the people to God, to one another, and to the stranger,
were only the principles of the Ten Commandments amplified and given in a
specific manner, that none need err. They were designed to guard the sacred-
ness of the ten precepts engraved on the tables of stone."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 364.
            Prophecy of the Redeemer—Final Counsel
    12. What contribution was made by Moses to direct Messianic proph-
ecy? Deut. 18:15, 18, 19; John 5:45-47.
    13. What was the burden of his parting instruction to his people? Deut.

                      Lesson 5, for August 3, 1940

     Elijah in Defense of Jehovah Against Baal
    MEMORY VERSE: "Hear me, 0 Lord, hear me, that this people may know that
Thou art the Lord God, and that Thou hast turned their heart back again." 1 Kings
18:37.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 143-154, 177-189.
    SEED THOUGHT: Elijah appeared at a time of spiritual crisis in Israel. The
worship of Jehovah was well-nigh supplanted by that of Baal. Although "a man subject
to like passions as we are," Elijah was endowed by the Spirit with outstanding courage
and fortitude in withstanding the forces of evil in high places. Messages were sent
through him exalting the God of Israel, and pointing out the folly of trusting in false
gods. With convincing evidence, the people were forced to admit that Jehovah is God,
but their penitence was short-lived. Elijah is a type of those who are called today to
represent Jehovah in a time of widespread apostasy.


                           Elijah—God's Prophet
    1. What was the deplorable spiritual condition of Israel at the time
when Elijah appeared? 1 Kings 16:30-33.
   NorE.—"Through faithful messengers, the Lord sent repeated warnings to
the apostate king and the people; but in vain were these words of reproof. In
vain did the inspired messengers assert Jehovah's right to be the only God in
Israel; in vain did they exalt the laws that He had entrusted to them.... Noth-
ing short of the miracle-working power of God could preserve the nation from
utter destruction. Israel had voluntarily separated herself from Jehovah; yet
the Lord in compassion still earned after those who had been led into sin,
and He was about to sen them one of the mightiest of His prophets, through
whom many were to be led back to allegiance to the God of their fathers."—
"Prophets and Kings," p. 116.
                                                                    /7
    2. For what did Elijah pray earnestly? In what strik' g way did he
show his faith that God would answer his prayer? James 5 ; 1 Kings 17:1.
    NorE.—"Viewing this apostasy from his mountain retreat, Elijah was over-
whelmed with sorrow. In anguish of soul he besought God to arrest the once-
favored people in their wicked course, to visit them with judgments, if need be,
that they might be led to see in its true light their departure from Heaven. He
longed to see them brought to repentance before they should go to such lengths
in evil-doing as to provoke the Lord to destroy them utterly. Elijah's prayer
was answered."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 120.
   3. How was Elijah directed in his movements? 1 Kings 17:2-4, 8, 9;
18:1.
                        Testing the Prophet's Faith
    4. What request was the prophet led to make of the poor woman of
Zarephath? What message did he give her from the Lord, on condition of
her obedience? 1 Kings 17:10-14.
    NOTE.—"In this poverty-stricken home the famine pressed sore; and the
pitifully meager fare seemed about to fail. The coming of Elijah on the very
day when the widow feared that she must give up the struggle to sustain life,
                                    f 13
tested to the utmost her faith in the power of the living God to provide for her
necessities. ...
    "No greater test of faith than this could have been required. The widow
had hitherto treated all strangers with kindness and liberality. Now, regard-
less of the suffering that might result to herself and child, and trusting in the
God of Israel to supply her every need, she met this supreme test of hospi-
tality by doing 'according to the saying of Elijah.' "—"Prophets and Kings,"
pp. 130, 131.
    5. What incident gives further evidence that Elijah was a man of great
faith, and mighty in prayer? Of what was the widowed mother convinced
regarding Elijah? Verses 17-24.
    6. How long did Elijah wait before God again summoned him to bear
active witness in public? James 5:17, last part; 1 Kings 18:1.
   NorE.—"Through the long years of drought and famine, Elijah prayed ear-
nestly that the hearts of Israel might be turned from idolatry to allegiance to
God. Patiently the prophet waited, while the hand of the Lord rested heavily
on the stricken land. As he saw, evidences of suffering and want multiplying
on every side, his heart was wrung with sorrow, and he longed for power to
bring about a reformation quickly. But God Himself was working out His
plan, and all that His servant could do was to pray on in faith, and await the
time for decided action."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 133.
      7. What evidence have we that the.king of Israel was hardened rather
than repentant during the famine years? 1 Kings 18:4, 10-13.
     NOTE.—"All this evidence of God's justice and judgment does not awaken
Israel to repentance. . . . Notwithstanding all their sufferings, they stood firm
in their idolatry, and looked upon the prophet of God as the cause of their
calamity. And if they could have had Elijah in their power, they would have
delivered him to Jezebel, that she might satisfy her revenge by taking his life.
. . . They could not see God's hand in the judgments under which they were
suffering because of their sins, but charged them to the man Elijah."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 3, pp. 276, 277.
    8. In what fearless words did the prophet declare to Ahab the reason for
God's judgments? 1 Kings 18:17, 18.
    NOTE.—"Many reformers, in entering upon their work, determined to exer-
cise great prudence in attacking the sins of the church and the nation. They
hoped, by the example of a pure Christian life, to lead the people back to the
doctrines of the Bible. But the Spirit of God came upon them as it came upon
Elijah, moving him to rebuke the sins of a wicked king and an apostate people;
they could not refrain from preaching the plain utterances of the Bible,—
doctrines which they had been reluctant to present. They were impelled to
zealously declare the truth, and the danger which threatened souls. The words
which the Lord gave them they uttered, fearless of consequences, and the peo-
ple were compelled to hear the warning. Thus the message of the third angel
will be proclaimed."—"The Great Controversy," p. 606.
   9. At the test at Mount Carmel, in what words did Elijah manifest in
prayer to God the desire of his heart? How was this prayer answered?
Verses 36-39, 41.

      Human Weakness Manifested—The Elijah Message
   10. After Elijah's flight into the desert, what message came to him?
1 Kings 19:13-17.
   NorE.—"He who had maintained his trust in Jehovah during the years of
drought and famine; he who had stood undaunted before Ahab; he who
throughout that trying day on Carmel had stood before the whole nation of

                                              \\Wit/

Israel the sole witness to the true God, in a moment of weariness allowed the
fear of death to overcome his faith in God."—"Prophets and Kings;" p. 174.
    11. What later words of Ahab show that he steadfastly refused to hear
the prophets of God? 1 Kings 22:5-8.
    12. How complete was the fulfillment of the doom pronounced upon the
house of the impenitent king through the prophet Elijah? 2 Kings 10:8-10.
(Compare 1 Sam. 3:19.)
    13. Why is the story of the prophet Elijah important to the remnant
church? Mal. 4:4-6.
    NOTE.—"Here the prophet describes the character of the work. Those who
are to prepare the way for the second coming of Christ, are represented by
faithful Elijah, as John came in the spirit of Elijah to prepare the way for
Christ's first advent."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 62.

                      Lesson 6, for August 10, 1940

     Prophetic Guidance of the Theocracy and
                Kingdom of Israel
    MEMORY VERSE: "Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none
of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that
Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord." 1 Sam. 3:19, 20.
    STUDY HELP: "The Abiding Gift of Prophecy," pp. 67-89.
    SEED THOUGHT: Following the checkered course of Israel during the days of
the judges, God called the child Samuel to the prophetic office, and directed by the Lord
he judged Israel, till the people demanded a king, to be like the other nations. God
gave them their desire, and endeavored to stem the drift of apostasy by raising up proph-
ets to act as counselors to the kings. We have studied about Elijah, perhaps one of the
greatest of these, but there are other characters brought to view, in whose record we
may learn much regarding the responsibilities of the prophet, and his varied lines of
work.
                               Holy Men of Old
    1. Why was the word of God in the days of Samuel declared to be pre-
cious? 1 Sam. 3:1.
    NOTE.—"There was no open vision." Other renderings of this clause better
indicate its meaning: "Prophecy was not extended" (Isaac Leeser) ; "a word
from the Eternal was rare" (Moffatt) ; "no vision broke forth" (Young). The
margin of the Revised Version gives as a rendering for the Hebrew word for
"open," the words "frequent," or "widespread." "All Israel from Dan even to
Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord."
That the words "no open vision" do not indicate a complete cessation of pro-
phetic utterance at that time is evident from the fact that they are immediately
preceded by a solemn message delivered to Eli from the "Lord God of Israel,"
through a "man of God." 1 Sam. 2:27-36. There is here intimated a distinc-
tion between a national prophet and one who might occasionally receive and
deliver messages of a local nature.
   2. Besides the prophets who wrote a portion of the Scriptures, what
others are among those mentioned? 2 Chron. 9:29; 12:15.
   NoTE.—So important was the matter of accuracy in the keeping of the
chronicles and of the genealogies that they were committed to such men as Iddo,
who had visions. This fact should give us confidence in and a reason for the
veracity of the history of the Bible, the accuracy of which is confirmed by con-
temporary records and recent archaeological discoveries.
    3. What important feature of worship was fostered by at least two
prophets? 2 Chron. 29:30.
    NOTE.—The introduction to a number of the psalms shows that they were
written by Asaph. (Psalms 50; 73-83.) He was one of the leaders of instru-
mental music appointed by the Levites (1 Chron. 15:16, 17), and his musical
talent and leadership were transmitted to his children (Ezra 2:41; 3:10).
    4. By what other name were the prophets frequently called in olden
times? 1 Sam. 9:9.
    5. With what solemn words were the prophets enjoined to be faithful
in delivering their messages from God? Jer. 26:2; Ezek. 2:5-7.
                                  f 16 j
   NOTE.—"These words were spoken to me, 'Your work is appointed you of
God. Many will not hear you, for they refused to hear the Great Teacher;
many will not be corrected, for their ways are right in their own eyes. Yet
bear to them the reproofs and warnings I shall give you, whether they will
hear, or forbear.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 74.
    6. When men rejected the prophetic message, whom did they really
reject? 1 Sam. 8:7.
   NOTE.—"When I send you a testimony of warning and reproof, many of
you declare it to be merely the opinion of Sister White. You have thereby in-
sulted the Spirit of God. You know how the Lord has manifested Himself
through the the spirit of prophecy. Past, present, and future have passed be-
fore me. I have been shown faces that I had never seen, and years afterward
I knew them when I saw them. I have been aroused from my sleep with a
vivid sense of subjects previously presented to my mind; and I have written'at
midnight, letters that have gone across the continent, and, arriving at a crisis,
have saved great disaster to the cause of God. This has been my work for
many years. [Written in 1882.] A power has impelled me to reprove and re-
buke wrongs that I had not thought of. Is this work of the last thirty-six years
from above, or from beneath?"—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 64, 65.
                   The Source of Prophetic Power
    7. What was the impelling power that moved the prophets to deliver
their messages? 2 Peter 1:21 ; Num. 11 :25; 2 Chron. 24:20.
    8. When, because of opposition and persecution, a prophet thought to
refrain from speaking further in the name of the Lord, how strong was the
urge of the Spirit? Jer. 20:9.
    NOTE.—"The prophet's words, instead of leading to confession and repent-
ance, aroused the anger of those high in authority, and as a consequence Jere-
miah was deprived of his liberty. Imprisoned, and placed in the stocks, the
prophet nevertheless continued to speak the messages of Heaven to those who
stood by. His voice could not be silenced by persecution. The word of truth,
he declared, 'was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I
was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.' "—"Prophets and Kings,"
p. 432.
    9. Explain God's messages to Saul through Samuel as shown by these
scriptures. 1 Sam. 9:18-20; 15:16; 28:6.
    NoTE.—"The Lord never turned away a soul that came to Him in sincerity
and humility. Why did He turn Saul away unanswered?—The king had by his
own act forfeited the benefits of all the methods of inquiring of God. He had
rejected the counsel of Samuel the prophet; he had exiled David, the chosen of
God; he had slain the priests of the Lord. Could he expect to be answered by
God, when he had cut off the channels of communication that Heaven had or-
dained?"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 676.
    10. When unconsecrated men came to inquire of the prophet, how did
God at one time answer them? Ezek. 14:1-4.
    Nom—In the counsel given to church members who go to camp meeting to
meet with the Lord, these words of Ezekiel are applicable. We are instructed:
    "If we love the things of the world and have pleasure in unrighteousness,
or fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, we have put the stumbling
                                      ( 17 1
block of our iniquity before our face, and have set up idols in our heart. . . .
Here is a work for families to engage in before corning up to our holy convoca-
tions. Let the preparation for eating and dressing be a secondary matter, but
let deep heart searching commence at home. Pray three times a day, and like
Jacob, be importunate. At home is the place to find Jesus; then take Him with
you to the meeting, and how precious will be the hours you spend there. . . . I
have been shown that for want of this preparation these yearly meetings have
accomplished but little."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 164, 165.
    11. What incident illustrates the power of God to keep His prophets
from being deceived by crafty men? 1 Kings 14:1-6.
    12. When a prophet, acting upon his own judgment, once.assented to a
plan that seemed to be good, how were his human judgment and his counsel
reversed? 1 Chron. 17:1-4; 22:7, 8.
    NOTE.—The fact that the prophet Nathan spoke words of approval to the
plan of the king, a plan that seemed to be prompted by unselfish love for God,
and that would glorify Him, should not lessen confidence in the counsel of a
prophet. Rather, the fact that his imperfect judgment was so soon corrected,
and that he faithfully delivered the message of God as soon as it came to him,
should deepen our confidence in the prophetic words.
                  The Prophets' Relation to Rulers
    13. What responsibility often rested upon the prophet in his relation to
the leaders of God's people? 2 Sam. 24:11-14; 1 Chron. 21:18; 2 Chron.
33:18.
    14. What notable instance is recorded, illustrating the prophet's faith-
ful discharge of his duty to bring messages of reproof to the king? When
the reproof was accepted, what cheering message did the Lord send? 2 Sam.
12:1-7, 13.
    15. What was the result when King Uzziah followed the counsels given
through the prophet? 2 Chron. 26:5.


                     Lesson 7, for August 17, 1940

            Later Messages to Israel and Judah
    MEMORY VERSE: "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
land: but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of
the Lord hath spoken it." Isa. 1:19, 20.
    STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 322-339, 407-421; "The Abiding
Gift of Prophecy," pp. 126-143.
    SEED THOUGHT: The long-suffering and never-failing love of God is seen in the
nature of the appeals made through the prophets to the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
Repeatedly He gave them evidence of His power to save them from their enemies, and
the threats of judgment were mingled with earnest appeals for repentance with promises
of pardon and blessing if these were heeded.

            Prophets as Counselors in Times of War
   1. What helpful messages did Elisha send to the king of Israel during
a war with Syria? What did the Syrian king naturally believe regarding
                                        [ 18
the loyalty of some of his servants? What was the true explanation?
2 Kings 6:8-12.
    NOTE.—"I saw that Satan bade his angels lay their snares especially for those
who were looking for Christ's second appearing, and keeping all the command-
ments of God. Satan told his angels: . . . 'Present the world before them in
the most attractive light, that they may love and idolize it. . . . Cause dis-
turbance and confusion if possible. . . . Make covetousness and love of earthly
treasures the ruling traits of their character. . . . When any shall attempt to
give, put within them a grudging disposition, that it may be sparingly. "—
"Early Writings," pp. 266, 267. Among hundreds of pages devoted to exposing
the wiles whereby Satan hopes to entrap those looking for the coming of Christ,
there is an outstanding message of this nature to be found in "The Great Con-
troversy," pages 518-530 (new edition, pp. 589-601).
    2. How did counsel given through the prophet Elisha prove more effec-
tive than fighting in bringing the war to a close? 2 Kings 6:21-23.
    3. What recognition of helplessness is found in the prayer of King
Jehoshaphat offered at a time when the kingdom of Judah was invaded by
a great army? Through whom did the Lord send a message of reassurance?
2 Chron. 20:12-15.
     4. What directions were given through the prophet for the conduct of
the battle? Verses 16,17.
     5. As they were marching against the enemy, what wise counsel did
Jehoshaphat give the people? Verse 20.
     6. How was their faith in the prophetic message rewarded? Verses 21-
24.
     7. In a war with the Moabites, what instruction came from the Lord
 through Elisha? How did the Lord co-operate with their efforts? In the
 morning, what did the Moabites see, and with what result? 2 Kings 3:16,
20-24.
     8. What message of hope and encouragement was delivered by the
 prophet Isaiah to the fearful king of Judah, when he was threatened by the
 combined forces of Israel and Syria? Isa. 7:1-7.
    NoTE.—Notwithstanding this assurance, King Ahaz was unbelieving. He
 chose rather to look to human alliances. Despoiling the temple and his own
 palace of its treasures and silver and gold, he sent them to Tiglath-Pileser,
 king of Assyria, with a frantic appeal, to come to his rescue. This defection
 was one of a series of actions in disobedience to the prophetic messages, that
 finally resulted in the captivity of Judah.
                  Voices of Entreaty and Warning
   9. What appeal was made to God's people through the prophet Isaiah?
What contrast was set before them as the result of their obedience or. dis-
obedience? Isa. 1:16-20.
   NOTE.—"In every age, for the sake of those who have remained true, as
well as because of His infinite love for the erring, God has borne long with the
rebellious, and has urged them to forsake their course of evil, and return to
Him. 'Precept upon precept; line upon line, . . . here a little, and there a little,'
through men of His appointment, He has taught transgressors the way of
righteousness. And thus it was during the reign of Ahaz. Invitation upon
                                      [ 197
 invitation was sent to erring Israel to return to their allegiance to Jehovah.
 Tender were the pleadings of the prophets; and as they stood before the people,
 earnestly exhorting to repentance and reformation, their words bore fruit to
 the glory of God."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 324, 325.
     10. After being healed by the Lord in answer to prayer, what mistake
 did Hezekiah make? Because of this, what prediction was made by the
 prophet? Isa. 39:1-8; 2 Chron. 32:24, 25, 31.
    NorE.—"Had Hezekiah improved the opportunity given him to bear wit-
 ness to the power, the goodness, the compassion, of the God of Israel, the re-
 port of the ambassadors would have been as light piercing darkness. But he
magnified himself above the Lord of hosts. . . . How disastrous the results
which were to follow! To Isaiah it was revealed that the returning ambassa-
dors were carrying with them a report of the riches they had seen, and that the
 king of Babylon and his counselors would plan to enrich their own country
with the treasures of Jerusalem. Hezekiah had grievously sinned; 'therefore
there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.'"—"Prophets and
Kings," p. 346.
    11. How complete were the desolations of Judah to be, if God's people
did not humble themselves? Jer. 13:15-19.
    12. What message was delivered by Jeremiah showing the consequences
of their attitude toward Sabbathkeeping? Jer. 17:21-27.
    13. What lesson was taught by the Lord through Jeremiah as to how
the judgments decreed might even yet be turned aside if the people would
repent? Jer. 18:1-8.
    14. How was this appeal received by the people? Verse 18.
    NorE.—The writings of the prophets of that period abound in messages of
entreaty, promises of pardon and mercy and favor conditional upon repent-
ance, and predictions of impending judgment. Today an impenitent world
is facing the day of judgment. As then, so today we should expect that similar
warnings and appeals should be given by the Spirit of God to His people. And
this He has done.
    "In ancient times God spoke to men by the mouth of prophets and apos-
tles. In these days He speaks to them by the Testimonies of His Spirit. There
was never a time when God instructed His people more earnestly than He in-
structs them now concerning His will, and the course that He would have them
pursue."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 148.



                     Lesson 8, for August 24, 1940
   Glorious Messages During the Years of Exile
   MEMORY VERSE: "The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,
that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets." Dan.
2:47.
   LESSON HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 425-451; "The Abiding Gift of
Prophecy," pp. 135-149.
   SEED THOUGHT: God never left Israel without prophetic witness. "By a
prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved."
                                       t 20)
Hosea 12:13. There was a long line of these faithful messengers, even through the
centuries of steadily growing apostasy. "The Lord God of their fathers sent to them
by His messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because He had compassion on His
people, and on His dwelling place." 2 Chron. 36:15. Rejected light led to greater dark-
ness, until there was no remedy but captivity. Even in the land of their exile God sent
Ezekiel and Daniel with messages of hope, and the prophecies of Jeremiah and Isaiah
held before them His purpose concerning a "remnant," to whom He would show favor
and blessing. In the darkest hour there was foreshadowed a glorious kingdom and a
king who would be King of kings.

                       God's Prophets Rejected
    1. In a rehearsal by the Levites of the history of Israel, what attitude
toward the prophets and their messages is stated to be the reason for their
captivity? Neh. 9:26, 29, 30, 33, 34.
    Non.—Mark the use of the word "testimonies," which is here defined as
God's words to Israel which He "testified against them" by His Spirit in the
prophets. The testimonies of God's true prophets are always urging the people
to obey God's law. (2 Kings 17:13, last part.)
    2. In what graphic words was Isaiah bidden to record this attitude as
a memorial? Isa. 30:8-10.
                      The Rise and Fall of Empires
    3. What counsel was sent by Jeremiah to those who were carried away
captive during the reign of Jehoiachin? How long was their exile to be?
Jer. 29:1-7, 10, 11; 25 : 12.
    NOTE.—It was about 606 B.C. that the first Judean captives, among whom
was Daniel, were carried away from Jerusalem. False prophets were predict-
ing victory for Judah, and a speedy return to the land of these exiles. (Jer.
28:10, 11.)
    4. What message to a group of nations, given through a prophet, showed
that God overruled them in their conquests? Jer. 27:1-8.
    NoTE.—Jeremiah's messages to the ambassadors who came to Jerusalem
show that God was seeking to save not only His own people, but all nations.
    Diviners and sorcerers and enchanters and dreamers were giving assurance
of deliverance from Babylon to the heathen nations, as were the false prophets
among the people of God. It took courage and confidence for God's prophets
to sound the message of doom under such circumstances. So today, while men
are looking forward to a glorious future for this world, God's messengers are
called to give warning of the final overthrow of earthly kingdoms at the coming
of Christ.
    5. What was made known to Nebuchadnezzar regarding the permanence
of his empire? How many empires were to succeed his? What would happen
to the "fourth kingdom"? What kingdom would succeed the ten divisions?
Dan. 2:39-44.
    NoTE.—At this time in a very special way, God's prophets were dealing with
nations and kingdoms. Jeremiah was ordained as "a prophet unto the nations."
Jer. 1:5. Ezekiel was given messages for Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, Sidon,
Philistia, and Ethiopia (Ezekiel 25-32), forecasting their future. Other nations
were commanded to submit to Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar was said to be
God's "servant." Jer. 27:6. All this would tend to inspire Nebuchadnezzar with
pride and a confidence in his prowess that was unseemly. It was therefore
                                         [ 21 I
fitting that he should receive through the dream and its interpretation a warn-
ing of the weakness of his kingdom, and of the city which he was seeking to
make impregnable in the confidence that it would stand forever.
     6. Through another dream given to the king of Babylon, what truth
regarding the sovereignty of Jehovah was impressed upon his mind? Dan.
4:17, 25.
     7. What message was sent to Belshazzar, when he had daringly defied
and insulted the God of heaven? Dan. 5:5, 25-28.
                Revelation of God and His Purposes
    8. What experience came to Ezekiel five years after he had been carried
away captive from Jerusalem? Ezek. 1:1, 4, 5, 15, 16, 26-28.
    No .—"This vision was given to Ezekiel at a time when his mind was filled
with gloomy forebodings.... That which he saw and heard of human tyranny
and wrong distressed his soul, and he mourned bitterly day and night. But the
wonderful symbols presented before him beside the river Chebar, revealed an
overruling power mightier than that of earthly rulers. Above the proud and
cruel monarchs of Assyria and Babylon, the God of mercy and truth was
enthroned.
    "The wheel-like complications that appeared to the prophet to be involved
in such confusion, were under the guidance of an infinite hand. The Spirit of
God, revealed to him as moving and directing these wheels, brought harmony
out of confusion; so the whole world was under His control. Myriads of glori-
fied beings were ready at His word to overrule the power and policy of evil
men, and bring good to His faithful ones." —"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 752.
     9. What instances are recorded of the prophet's seeming participation
in scenes at a distance as though he were personally present? Ezek. 8:3;
11:1, 2.
    NOTE.—In connection with the experience of Ellen G. White, many similar
instances might be cited. Regarding one she wrote:
    "November 3, 1890, while laboring at Salamanca, New York, as I was in
communion with God in the night season, I was taken out of and away from
myself to assemblies in different states, where I bore a decided testimony of
reproof and warning."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 460.
    10. What instance may be found where symbols were presented to the
prophet with a special application to the last days? Ezek. 9:1-7.
    NorE.—"The true people of God, who have the spirit of the work of the
Lord, and the salvation of souls at heart, will ever view sin in its real, sinful
character. . . . Especially in the closing work for the church, in the sealing
time of the one hundred and forty-four thousand who are to stand without
fault before the throne of God, will they feel most deeply the wrongs of God's
professed people. This is forcibly set forth by the prophet's illustration of the
last work under the figure of the men each having a slaughter weapon in his
hand."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 266. Of some it is said, "They will fall in the
general destruction of the wicked, represented by the work of the five men
bearing slaughter weapons."—Id., p. 267.
    11. What promise, involving spiritual and temporal restoration, was
made to Israel through the prophets? How and when was this to be ful-
filled? Ezek. 36:24-28; 37:12-14.
                                      [u]
    NoTE.—A recognition of this clear statement that the restoration of spirit-
ual Israel to their land is to be effected by their resurrection from the dead,
would save much of the unwarranted expectations of many prophetic exposi-
tors today. It should also be evident that the Israel to whom the promises
were made include only those who are Christ's, and not Israel after the flesh.
Rom. 2:28, 29 ; Gal. 3:28, 29.
    12. What important prophecy was given regarding the definite time for
the appearance of the Messiah? By the rule of what contemporary prophet
are the days to be reckoned? Dan. 9:24-27; Ezek. 4:6, last part.
    NOTE.—With increasing clearness, and with more definite details, the proph-
ecies concerning the Seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15) and of Abraham (Gen.
13:15; Gal. 3:16), and the "prophet" foretold by Moses (Deut. 18:15) had
been developed from time to time. In poetry and in song David set forth the
Son to whom the heathen were to be given as an inheritance, who, after the
agony of separation from His Father, was to pass through the' valley of the
shadow of death, and before whom the everlasting doors were to be lifted up,
at .His ascension (Ps. 2:7, 8; chapters 22-24). Isaiah in lofty strain had de-
clared His suffering for "our transgressions," and declared that after He had
"made His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death," He should
"prolong His days." Isaiah 53. Micah had designated the city of His birth.
Micah 5:2. And now to Daniel in the land of captivity the year of His appear-
ance is linked with the assurance of the decree "to restore and to build
Jerusalem."


                     Lesson 9, for August 31, 1940
Divine Guidance in the Early Christian Church
    MEMORY VERSE: "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in
time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by
His Son." Heb. 1:1, 2.
    STUDY HELP: "The Abiding Gift of Prophecy," pp. 163-172.
    SEED THOUGHT: From Malachi to the appearance of John the Baptist, a four-
hundred-year period, there is no record of any prophet. There was more need for study
of the past revelations than for new ones. Christ, through whom there was full and-
complete communication from the Father, was a prophet in the truest sense of the
word. Following His ascension, through the ministration of the Spirit, spiritual gifts
were bestowed upon the Christian church, prominent among which was the gift of
prophecy.
                       John the Baptist and Christ
    1. What did Christ say of the prophetic office of John the Baptist?
What was the burden of his message? Matt. 11:7-10, 14; 3:1-3, 11, 12.
    NoTE.—At the end of the seventy years' captivity, when the way had been
prepared for the return of Israel to their land, only a few responded. The
prophets Haggai and Zechariah directed them in rebuilding the temple. Mal-
achi warned them against formality in their worship of God, spoke to them
of the blessings that would follow faithfulness in bringing to the Lord His own
in tithes and offerings,, and looked forward to the day that should burn as an
oven when the wicked should be destroyed. With a final appeal to remember
the "law of Moses," and an announcement of the coming of Elijah before the
"great and dreadful day of the Lord," should come, Malachi closes the canon
                                        [23 1
of the Old Testament. For four hundred years there is no record of another
prophet, until John, who, in fulfilling Malachi's prediction, links the New
Testament with the Old.
    2. Explain how Christ fulfilled Deuteronomy 18:15-18. Luke 7:16;
24:19; Matt. 13:57.
    NorE.—"He was the one divine, infallible prophet. He exercised every pos-
sible manifestation of the prophetic gift. He revealed the past, back into
eternity, with perfect ease. He showed infinite wisdom regarding every de-
tail of teaching and of events during the time when He was upon earth. The

future was clearly an open book to Him. Indeed, He was, and is still, the
source of the prophetic gift by which He has communicated with the human
family from the day Adam was sent from his Eden home."—"The Abiding
Gift of Prophecy," p. 165.
                       The Promise of the Spirit
    3. In the Saviour's promise of the Holy Spirit to His church, what was
said to be one of His offices? John 16:12, 13.
   NOTE.—Here is clearly a promise of a fuller revelation of truth, and the
agency by which that truth was to be revealed is the Holy Spirit. And we
should expect that, as in former times, the prophetic gift would be one of God's
methods of communication.
                                       24
    4. Of what prophecy was the advent of the Holy Spirit, as promised by
Christ, said by Peter to be the fulfillment? Acts 2:16-18; Joel 2:28-32.
    NoTE.—That the Holy Spirit thus bestowed was not intended to be limited
to the day of Pentecost is evident from the words "in the last days," of Acts
2:17, and also by reference to the remnant. That it was not to be limited to
the Jewish race is evident from the fact that the Spirit is to be poured out
"upon all flesh ;" and also in Joel 2:23 reference is made to both the "early" and
the "latter rain."
    5. What provision was made for the extension of the gospel when Christ
left the earth, and returned to heaven? What would these gifts accomplish?
How long were they to operate in the church? Eph. 4:8, 11-13.

              Spiritual Guidance in the Early Church
    6. Among what other gifts is the gift of prophecy listed? Who makes
the decision as to the distribution of the gifts among the members? 1 Cor.
12:4-11, 28.
    7. What is the distinctive purpose of prophecy as contrasted with the
gift of tongues? 1 Cor. 14:22.
    8. How completely are the gifts of the Spirit to be found in the church?
1 Cor. 1:4-7.
    9. In the church at Antioch, how was the will of God concerning the
advancement of His work made known? Acts 13:1-4.
    NOTE.—"God foresaw the difficulties that His servants would be called to
meet; and in order that their work should be above challenge, He instructed
the church by revelation to set them apart publicly to the work of the ministry.
Their ordination was a public recognition of their divine appointment to bear
to the Gentiles the glad tidings of the gospel."—"Gospel Workers," pp. 441,
442.
    The incidental reference to prophets in the inspired record of the early
church, and the guidance of the church by the Spirit, indicate that such a
method of communication through the Spirit was common and widespread.
    10. What scriptures show that women as well as men had the gift of
prophecy? Joel 2:28; Acts 21:8, 9.
    NOTE.—In the Old Testament mention is made of Miriam, Deborah, and
Huldah, as being prophetesses. (Ex. 15:20; Judges 4:4; 2 Kings 22:14.) And
Anna, the aged prophetess, seeing the infant Jesus in the temple, "spake of Him
to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem." Luke 2:38,
R. V.
    11. In what manner was the gospel made known to the apostle Paul?
Gal. 1:11, 12; 2 Cor. 12:1-4, 7.
    12. How was he directed in his labors? Acts 16:6-10.

                          Messages From Christ
   13. What clear statement is made by John regarding the manner in
which he received his revelation? Rev. 1:1, 10-13.
   14. Though prophecy is a gift of the Spirit, who is the author of the
messages thus given? Rev. 19:10; 22:16; 1 Peter 1:10, 11.
                                      [25]
    NOTE.—"It was Christ that spoke to His people through the prophets. The
apostle Peter, writing to the Christian church, says that the prophets 'proph-
esied of the grace that should come unto you, searching what, or what manner
of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified be-
forehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.' It is the
voice of Christ that speaks to us through the Old Testament. The testimony
of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 366, 367.
    15. What then should be our attitude toward the writings of the
prophets? 2 Peter 1:19-21; 1 Thess. 5:19-21.



                   Lesson 10, for September 7, 1940
             The Prophetic Gift Counterfeited
   MEMORY VERSE: "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits."
Matt. 7:15, 16.
   STUDY HELP: "The Abiding Gift of Prophecy," pp. 277-292.
   SEED THOUGHT: Satan has the power to communicate through various ways
and to deceive his followers. His mediums of communication are called in the Scrip-
tures, "false prophets." The word of God has not only warned us against being de-
ceived by these false revelations, but has given examples of their manner of working,
and rules by which they may be distinguished from the true prophets of God. We are
solemnly enjoined to try the spirits whether they be of God, and the tests by which
they are to be recognized are clear and decisive.

                   Warnings Against False Prophets
      1. Against what has Jesus warned His followers? How is their de-
ceptive power described? Matt. 7:15.
      2. Explain why such a warning is needed now. Matt. 24:24, 25; 2 Thess.
2:9-11.
      NOTE.—"There are many false prophets in these days, to whom sin does not
appear specially repulsive. They complain that the peace of the people is un-
necessarily disturbed by the reproofs and warnings of God's messengers. As
 for them, they lull the souls of sinners into a fata ease by their smooth and
deceitful teachings. Ancient Israel was thus charmed by the flattering mes-
sages of the corrupt priests. Their prediction of prosperity was more pleasing
than the message of the true prophet, who counseled repentance and submis-
sion."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 185.
      3. How does Satan seek to deceive God's people? 2 Peter 2:1, 2.
     NOTE.—"Modern spiritualism . . . is but a revival, in a new form, of the
 witchcraft and demon worship that God condemned and prohibited of old. It
is foretold in the Scriptures, which declare that 'in the latter times some shall
depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.'
. . . And Peter, describing the dangers to which the church was to be exposed
in the last days, says that as there were false prophets who led Israel into sin,
so there will be false teachers, 'who privily shall bring in damnable heresies,
even denying the Lord that brought them. . . . And many shall follow their
pernicious ways.' Here the apostle has pointed out one of the marked char-
                                      t 26 )
acteristics of spiritualist teachers. They refuse to acknowledge Christ as the
Son of God. . . . Spiritualism, by denying Christ, denies both the Father and
the Son, and the Bible pronounces it the manifestation of antichrist."—"Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," p. 686.
    4. What two classes of false prophets are mentioned in the Scriptures?
(a) Ezek. 13:2, 3, 17, (b) 4, 6, 7, 16; Jer. 23:32.
    NOTE.—The term "seer," one who sees, was given to the ancient prophets,
because of the manner in which divine knowledge was imparted to them. "The
word that Isaiah . . . saw" (Isa. 2:1) ; "the word of the Lord that came to
Micah . . . which he saw" (Micah 1:1) ; "the burden which Habakkuk the
prophet did see" (Hab. 1:1) ; "the word that the Lord hath showed me" (Jer.
38:21) ;. "thy prophets have seen" (Lam. 2:14). Like the testimony admissible
in a court of law, the prophet bears witness of what he has seen and heard.
Therefore one who comes in the name of the Lord, having seen nothing, is
speaking only out of his heart. However, the fact that a vision forms the basis
of a communication is not sufficient to warrant its acceptance.
                            "Try the Spirits"
    5. How are prophetic messages to be tested? 1 John 4:1; 1 Thess. 5:19-
21; Isa. 8:20.
    6. What is one fundamental test by which to discern the teaching of the
false from the true prophet? 1 John 4:2, 3.
    NOTE.—"Loyalty to the person of Christ, to His pre-existence, His divine
incarnation, His deity, His divine Sonship, His virgin birth, His miracle-work-
ing power, the divine authority of His teaching, His substitutionary and ex-
piatory death, His literal resurrection, His ascension, His mediatory and inter-
cessory priesthood, and the promise of His bodily, visible; personal, and
imminent return—this is the fundamental test as to whether a prophet is false
or true."—"The Gift of Prophecy," C. B. Haynes, pp. 104, 105.
    7. How will the teachings of a true prophet be related to the teachings
of scriptural and other prophetic writings? Deut. 13:1-5; Zech. 7:7, 12.
    NoTE.—"However much one may advance in spiritual life, he will never
come to a point where he will not need diligently to search the Scriptures; for
therein are found the evidences of our faith. All points of doctrine, even though
they have been accepted as truth, should be brought to the law and to the testi-
mony ; if they cannot stand this test, 'there is no light in them!"—"Testimo-
nies," vol. 5, p. 575.
    8. In applying this test, how did the prophet Jeremiah question the
truthfulness of Hananiah, who predicted the early return from the captiv-
ity? What would be the final evidence of his claims to prophecy? Jer.
28:5-9.
              Condoning Sin, and Prophesying Peace
    9. What principle did Jesus set forth by which to distinguish the false
from the true prophets? Matt. 7:16-20.
    NOTES.—"Let the Testimonies be judged by their fruits. What is the spirit
of their teaching? What has been the result of their influence? All who desire
to do so can acquaint themselves with the fruits of these visions. . . .
    " 'God is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs, and strengthen-
ing their faith, or He is not. This work is of God, or it is not. God does nothing

    10. What accounts for the popularity of some false prophets? Jer. 5:
30, 31; 1 John 4:1, 5; Lam. 2:14.
    NoTE.—"Those who seek to cloak sin, and make it appear less aggravating

condemned Jeremiah for afflicting the people with his severe denunciations;
and he sought to reassure them by promising them prosperity, thinking that
the poor people should not be continually reminded of their sins and threatened
with punishment. This course strengthened the people to resist the true
prophet's counsel, and intensified their enmity toward him."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 4, p. 185.
    11. What has ever been the attitude of "all the prophets" regarding
sin and the keeping of God's law? 2 Kings 17:13.
    12. What attitude on the part of a supposed prophet toward the Sab-
bath and God's holy things may be taken as evidence that God has not
spoken by that one? Ezek. 22:25, 26.

powers of earth, uniting to war against the commandments of God, will de-
cree that all, 'both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,' shall con-
form to the customs of the church by the observance of the false sabbath."—
"The Great Controversy," p. 604.
        Deceptive Teachings Regarding Christ's Coming
     13. What difference will characterize the teachings of true and false
prophets regarding the nature of the day of the Lord? Zeph. 1:14-17; 1
Thess. 5 :3; Jer. 14 :13-15.
     NoTE.—"Come when it may, the advent of Christ will surprise the false
teachers, who are saying, Peace and safety; all things continue as they were
from the beginning. Thus saith the Word of inspiration, 'Sudden destruction
cometh upon them' The day of God shall come as a snare upon all who dwell
upon the face of the whole earth."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 233.
     14. What will false prophets teach regarding the coming of Christ,
thereby deceiving many? What will the true prophet teach regarding this
event? Matt. 24:23, 26, 27; Rev. 1:7.
     NOTE.—"Ag the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan him-
self will personate Christ. . . . In different parts of the earth, Satan will mani-
fest himself among men as a majestic being of dazzling brightness. . . . The
shout of triumph rings out upon the air, 'Christ has come . . . But the peo-
ple of God will not be misled. . . . Satan is not permitted to counterfeit the
manner of Christ's advent. The Saviour has warned His people against decep-
tion upon this point, and has clearly foretold the manner of His second coming.
. . . This coming, there is no possibility of counterfeiting. It will be univer-
sally known—witnessed by the whole world."—"The Great Controversy," pp.

                  Lesson 11, for September 14, 1940
        Further Distinctions Between True and
                    False Prophets
    MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions
which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle." 2 Thess. 2:15.
    STUDY HELP: "The Abiding Gift of Prophecy," pp. 293-307.
    SEED THOUGHT: Belief in the immortality of the soul has opened the way for
Satan to communicate directly with deluded men through the methods and practices of
spiritualism. God has given most solemn warnings against this deception. The pres-
ence of the supernatural, either in the realm of the miraculous or in the foretelling of
future events, is not always evidence that a teacher is from God. False prophets are
usually characterized by a manifest failure to live godly lives, while the one whom God
chooses for the bestowal of the prophetic gift will manifest the•fruits of holy living. A
warfare against the organized church and its scriptural teachings is a mark of the enemy.

                      Warnings Against the Occult
    1. What methods of attempting to receive supernatural communications
are condemned by the Lord? Whose guidance are those following who seek
such methods? Deut. 18:10-12; Rev. 16:13, 14.
                                         [29 1
    NOTE.—"Through the agency of evil spirits, strange gods were introduced;
and because of transgression, the chosen people were finally scattered from the
Land of Promise. This history Satan is striving to repeat in our day. . . . The
word of the Lord to ancient Israel is addressed also to His people in this age:
`Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards to be
defiled by them ;"for all that do these things are an abomination unto the
Lord.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 689.
    2. How are God's people warned against following a similar course?
Isa. 8:19.
    NOTE.—"Deceived mortals are worshiping evil angels, believing them to be
the spirits of their dead friends. The word of God expressly declares that the
dead have no more a portion in anything done under the sun. Spiritualists say
that the dead know everything that is done under the sun; that they com-
municate to their friends on earth, give valuable information, and perform
wonders. . . . Some, I was shown, gratify their curiosity, and tamper with the
devil. They have no real faith in spiritualism, and would start back with
horror at the idea of being mediums. Yet they venture, and place themselves
in a position where Satan can exercise his power upon them. . . . They are
venturing on the devil's ground, and are tempting him to control them."—
"Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 298, 299.
    3. What example is given of God's displeasure because of making in-
quiry of the dead, through a spirit medium? 1 Chron. 10:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"Although his [Saul's] rebellion and obstinacy had well-nigh
silenced the divine voice in the soul, there was still opportunity for repentance.
But when in his peril he turned from God, to obtain light from a confederate
of Satan, he had cut the last tie that bound him to his Maker; he had placed
himself fully under the control of that demoniac power which for years had
been exercised upon him, and which had brought him to the verge of destruc-
tion."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 679.

             Supernatural Manifestations May Deceive
    4. What evidence do we have that the working of miracles is not an es-
sential characteristic of a prophet? Luke 7:26, 28; John 10:41.
    Nom.—Christ states that John the Baptist had no peer among the prophets.
Yet while the people witnessed that John did no miracle, they also said, ;`All
things that John spake of this Man were true."
    5. What supernatural phenomena sometimes accompanied the giving of
dreams and visions? 2 Cor. 12:1-3; Dan. 10:7, 17, 18; Num. 24:4.
    Nom.—Undue emphasis should not be placed upon the physical phenomena
accompanying visions, for some of these might be counterfeited by the power
of Satan. They d6 have a part, however, in demonstrating that some power
more than human is manifested. Many who have seen Mrs. White in vision
speak of witnessing one or more of the phenomena mentioned by Paul and
Daniel and Balaam. She seldom spoke or wrote of this part of her experience,
but we find the following from her pen:
    "Sometimes while I was in vision, my friends would approach me, and ex-
claim, 'Why, she does not breathe !' Placing a mirror before my lips, they
found that no moisture gathered on the glass. . . . These messages were thus
given to substantiate the faith of all, that in these last days we might have con-
fidence in the spirit of prophecy."—Review and Herald, June 14, 1906.
                                        [ 30 ]
     6. What will prove the falsity of an untrue prophet who claims to fore-
see the future? Deut. 18:20-22.
     7. How did God deal with one who made a piediction contrary to the
message sent through Jeremiah? Jer. 27:2, 3; 28:1-4, 10-17.
    NorE.—"The false prophet had strengthened the unbelief of the People in
Jeremiah and his message. He had wickedly declared himself the Lord's mes-
senger, and he suffered death in consequence. In the fifth month Jeremiah
prophesied the death of Hananiah, and in the seventh month his words were
proved true by their fulfillment."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 446.
    8. What conditions would warrant the rejection of a professed prophet
even though he gave a sign or wonder? Deut. 13:1-5.
    NorE.—No matter how marvelous the evidence of the supernatural guid-
ance seems to be, anyone who teaches disobedience to the law of God is a
false prophet.
    "Satan leads men to consult those that have familiar spirits; and by re-
vealing hidden things of the past, he inspires confidence in his power to fore-
tell things to come. By experience gained through the long ages, he can reason
from cause to effect, and often forecast, with a degree of accuracy, some of the
future events of man's life. Thus he is enabled to deceive poor, misguided souls,
and bring them under his power, and lead them captive at his will."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p. 687.

                         The Test of Character
    9. What is the character of the men whom God chooses as His messen-
gers? 2 Peter 1:21; Isa. 6:7; 52:11.
    10. On the other hand, what are mentioned as characteristics of those
whom God has not sent? Matt. 7:21-23; Jer. 23:14.
    11. What sin is pointed out as an evidence of one's being an emissary of
the enemy? 2 Peter 2:3, first part; Micah 3:11.
    12. In contrast to this, what could Paul say of his labors? Acts 20 : 33-
35.
      Tested by Attitude Toward the Organized Church
    13. What will be the relation of one who is endowed by the Holy Spirit
with the gift of prophecy to the organized church or body of Christ? Eph.
4:11-13.
    NoTE.—In contrast to the true prophets and teachers working to build up
and unify the organized church of Christ, are those who "draw away disciples
after them." Acts 20:30. "The gifts, and especially the gift of prophecy, have
a part to act in bringing the church into 'unity' and harmony. 'God is not the
author of confusion, but of peace.' In fact, the gathering of a people from the
confused elements of earth, and the various nations of the world, to move for-
ward as one, is one of the best evidences of a genuine work of the Lord."—
"Prophetic Gift in the Gospel Church," J. N. Loughborough, pp. 30, 31.
    14. How should the believers relate themselves to teachers who seek to
bring in divisions into the body of Christ? Rom. 16:17; 2 Thess. 3:6.
    NOTE.-"0 how Satan would rejoice to get in among this people and dis-
organize the work at a time when thorough organization is essential, and will
be the greatest power to keep out spurious uprisings, and to refute claims not
                                     [ 31)
endorsed by the word of God! We want to hold the lines evenly, that there
shall be no breaking down of the system of regulation and order. . . . We are
living in a time when order, system, and unity of action are most essential.
And the truth must bind us together like strong cords in order that no dis-
tracted efforts may be witnessed among the workers. If disorderly manifesta-
tions appear, we must have clear discernment to distinguish the spurious from
the genuine. Let no messages be proclaimed until they have borne a careful
scrutiny in every jot and tittle."—"Testimonies to Ministers," pp. 228, 229.


                   Lesson 12, for September 21, 1940

 The Spirit of Prophecy in the Remnant Church
    MEMORY VERSE: "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the
testimony of Jesus." Rev. 12:17.
    STUDY HELP: "The Abiding Gift of Prophecy," pp. 253-263.
    SEED THOUGHT: God promised continual guidance to His people as they set
themselves to bring about the restoration of the Sabbath. As Israel was led from
Egypt to the Promised Land by a prophet, so divine guidance would be given to the
movement which was to gather God's dispersed from all nations to the heavenly
Canaan. Anciently God could not consistently continue to speak through the prophets
to His people when they persisted in disregarding His messages which urged obedience
to His law and the observance of His Sabbath. But when the last gospel message was
to be proclaimed, calling all men to obedience to all God's commandments, the prophetic
gift was restored to guide the remnant church in its great task of enlightening the world.

                       Two Gathering Movements
    1. As a preparation for the ushering in of God's kingdom of righteous-
ness and peace, what, great gathering movement is described? To what
earlier movement is it likened? Isa. 10:20-22; Rom. 9:27, 28; Isa. 11:11,
12, 16.
    NOTE.—In the days of Ezra and Nehemiah God did in a marvelous way
"set His hand," to restore His people to the land from which they had been
dispersed in the captivity of Israel and Judah. Some fifty thousand responded
to the call of God to return, following the decree of Cyrus. The nation as a
whole stayed by the homes the y had established in other countries, and God's
ideal for the return and prosperity of Israel in their own land was not met.
The movement which might have taken place at that time finds a counterpart
today in the great second advent message which is gathering God's chosen ones
from all parts of the world.
    "These prophecies [Isa. 60:1-4, 10, 11; 45:22] of a great spiritual awaken-
ing in a time of gross darkness, are today meeting fulfillment in the advancing
lines of mission stations that are reaching out into the benighted regions of
earth. The groups of missionaries in heathen lands have been likened by the
prophet to ensigns set up for the guidance of those who are looking for the
light of truth. [Isa. 11:10-12.]"—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 375, 376.
    2. How did God lead and preserve Israel in the Exodus movement?
Hosea 12:13.
    NOTE.—Moses was God's mouthpiece to Israel during the time of the
Exodus and during the wilderness wandering.
    "Here we may note that this very movement of old [the Exodus movement]
                                          [32 }
is set forth as a type of the final gospel movement. Now all these things hap-
pened unto them for ensamples ["types," margin]: and they are written for
our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.' 1 Cor. 10:11.
    "In that first movement the Lord put the gift of the spirit of prophecy in
His 'church in the wilderness.' In the fullness of prophetic time the advent
movement came. The Lord has now 'set His hand again the second time to
recover the remnant of His people . . . from the four corners of the earth.'
Isa. 11:11, 12. And as this final movement should rise, the Lord again was to
give to His church the gift of the spirit of prophecy."—"The Spirit of Proph-
ecy in the Advent Movement," W. A. Spicer, pp. 20, 21.
      The Relation of the Gift of Prophecy to Obedience
    3. What is given as one reason why prophetic vision was often with-
held in olden times? Lam. 2:9; Ezek. 7:9, 26.
    Nora.—The expression "the law is no more," cannot mean that God had
released His people from their obligation to keep it. But they themselves had
resisted the appeals of the prophets to keep the law of God, and were violating
it. Because of this persistent attitude of resistance to God's commandments,
there came a time when it was useless for Him to continue to communicate
with them, and the prophetic voice became silent.
     4. For what similar reason may we conclude that the gift of prophecy
was largely withheld for many centuries during the Christian Era? 2 Thess.
2:3, 4; Dan. 7:25.
             God Guides, and Speaks to the Remnant
    5. What work of reform in the last days was predicted by the prophet
Isaiah? Isa. 58:12-14.
    NOTE.—"In the time of the end, every divine institution is to ,be restored.
The breach made in the law at the time the Sabbath was changed by man, is
to be repaired. God's remnant people, standing before the world as reformers,
are to show that the law of God is the foundation of all enduring reform, and
that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is to stand as a memorial of
creation, a constant reminder of the power of God. In clear, distinct lines they
are to present the necessity of obedience to all the precepts of the Decalogue.
Constrained by the love of Christ, they are to co-operate with Him in build-
ing up the waste places. They are to be repairers of the breach, restorers of
paths to dwell in."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 678.
    6. What promise of divine guidance is given to those who engage in this
work of reformation? Verse 11, first part.
    7. In.describing the people brought out by the threefold message, what
feature of their experience is twice mentioned by the prophet John? Rev.
14:12; 12:17.
    8. What was seen by the prophet to be present in this commandment-
keeping church? Rev. 12:17, last part; 19 :10.
                The Advent Movement in Prophecy
    9. With the announcement of what event does the remnant church begin
the proclamation of the last message to be carried to the world? Rev. 14:
6, 7. •
    10. When did this event take place, thus making its announcement due?
Dan. 8:14.
                                     ( 33 )
    NOTE.—"As in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the
close of the year, so before Christ's work for the redemption of men is com-
pleted, there is a work of atonement for the removal of sin from the sanctu-
ary. This is the service which began when the 2300 days ended. At that time,
as foretold by Daniel the prophet, our High Priest entered the most holy, to
perform the last division of His solemn work,—to cleanse the sanctuary. . . .
As the typical cleansing of the earthly was accomplished by the removal of
the sins by which it had been polluted, so the actual cleansing of the heavenly
is to be accomplished by the removal, or blotting out, of the sins which are
there recorded. But before this can be accomplished, there must be an exami-
nation of the books of record to determine who, through repentance of sin
and faith in Christ, are entitled to the benefits of His atonement. The cleans-
ing of the sanctuary therefore involves a work of investigation,—a work of
judgment."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 421, 422.
    11. What movement was being started at the ending of this long pro-
phetic period in 1844?
    ANSWER.—A remarkable advent movement was witnessed in many coun-
tries of the world, based upon the prophetic utterance of Daniel 8:14, "Unto
two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
In the United States of America, during the summer of that year, the believers
were convinced that that period would end specifically on the Jewish day of
atonement, which, according to Scripture reckoning, would be October 22. The
correctness of this reckoning is justifiable, though later light has revealed their
mistake in the nature of the event to take place at that time.
    12. Explain the prophet's description of the early advent movement and
the disappointment of 1844. Rev. 10:1-10.
    NOTE.—A comparison of this symbolic prophecy with the advent movement
makes it clear that they conform in every detail. The time is between the sixth
and seventh trumpets (about 1840). The rainbow is indicative of God's pres-
ence. The cloud and the unrecorded "seven thunders" fitly represent the lack
of clear understanding of the message. The little book, open, obviously rep-
resents the book of Daniel, in whose pages the prophetic period is found. The
reference to land and sea and the loud voice aptly describes a powerful and
widespread movement. The nature of the message was that "time should be
no longer." And the eaten book, sweet in the mouth, and afterward bitter,
graphically symbolizes the joy of expectation and bitterness of disappointment.
    13. What divine commission indicates that another world-wide message
was to be given after the disappointment of 1844? Verse 11.
    NoTE.—A superficial judgment would indicate that those who announced
their belief that the Lord was coming on a certain date had been greatly de-
ceived, and that their voice should be silent thereafter. The prophecy shows,
on the contrary, that out of the very movement which seemed to end in fail-
ure, was to grow another movement with a message to be carried to all the
world. Such a movement by such a people could only be possible if guided and
directed by God Himself. See "The Acts of the Apostles," p. 585.

                   Lesson 13, for September 28, 1940

              Confidence in the Prophetic Gift
    MEMORY VERSE: "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established;
believe His prophets, so shall ye prosper." 2 Chron. 20:20.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pp. 603-607, 613-623 (new ed., pp.
681-686, 693-704); "Prophets and Kings," pp. 722-733.
    SEED THOUGHT: The counsels sent from God to His people through His proph-
ets will, if received, make them perfect. The prophets solemnly urged the people to
receive their words as the words of God, and warned them that their future destiny de-
pended upon their acceptance or rejection of these words. Ancient Israel's defection
and rejection by God as His chosen people came as a result of their failure to heed the
messages of her prophets. The purposes of God for Israel are to be fulfilled,in the last
church. They were seen to be the heralds of God's saving message to the world, to be
perfected in character, and finally to triumph gloriously at Christ's coming. They were
seen to hold fast the spirit of prophecy, and to demonstrate the truthfulness of the wotds
of Jehoshaphat, "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe His
prophets, so shall ye prosper."

              Importance of Heeding God's Messages
    1. In what ways are the writings, inspired by God, of vital value to the
individual? 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
    NOTE.—"Scripture" as here used refers primarily to the Old Testament, the
"Holy Scriptures" with which Timothy had been familiar as a child (verse 15).
Peter speaks of all the "epistles" of Paul with "the other scriptures" (2 Peter
3:16). The spirit and content of other New Testament books show them to
be in harmony with the rest of the Holy Scriptures, thus bearing internal evi-
dence to their divine inspiration. 2 Timothy 3:16 sets forth a principle of
universal application. Whenever and wherever God bestows the gift of proph-
ecy on a human agent, sending messages for the instruction and guidance of
His people, these God-inspired writings will have the same power, and bear
the same fruitage. In fact, the demonstration of such values as are here set
forth by Paul is one of the strongest evidences of divine inspiration.
    2. To what is the sure word of prophecy likened? How are we exhorted
to relate ourselves to it? 2 Peter 1:19.
    3. With what earnest admonitions are messages of the prophets fre-
quently introduced? 2 Kings 20:16; Isa. 55:3; 48:12. •

                  Israel's Opportunity and Failure
    4. In what words did Isaiah set forth the importance of obedience to
the words that he was bidden to speak to backslidden Israel? Isa. 1:19, 20.
    5. What does Jeremiah say of Israel's response to the prophetic coun-
sels, and the results? Jer. 29:18, 19.
    6. In what pathetic words does God lament their failure to heed His
counsels? Isa. 48:17, 18.
    NoTE.—"That which God purposed to do for the world through Israel, the
chosen nation, He will finally accomplish through His church on earth today.
  . . Today the church of God is free to carry forward to completion the di-
vine plan for the salvation of a lost race. . . . To spiritual Israel have been

restored the privileges accorded the people of God at the time of their de-
liverance from Babylon."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 713, 714.
                The Remnant Church in Prophecy
   7. What picture of future glory for the church, in its ministry for
Christ, was foreseen by the prophets? Isa. 60:1-3; Rev. 18:1.
   NoTE.—"Among earth's inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those
who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which appear
only at night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the

earth and gross darkness the people. In heathen Africa, in the Catholic lands
of Europe and of South America, in China, in India, in the islands of the sea,
and in all the dark corners of the earth, God has in reserve a firmament of
chosen ones that will yet shine forth amidst the darkness, revealing clearly
to an apostate world the transforming power of obedience to His law."—
"Prophets and Kings," pp. 188, 189.
    8. What solemn pronouncement marks the end of the work of the in-
vestigative judgment, when our High Priest leaves the sanctuary? Rev.
22 : 11, 12.
    9. At the end of the great conflict between good and evil, what experi-
ences come to the inhabitants of the world? What assurance is given for
God's people during this time? Dan. 12:1.
                                    t36]
      NOTE.—"In the time of trouble just before the coming of Christ, the right-
  eous will be preserved through the ministration of heavenly angels; but there
  will be no security for the transgressor of God's law. Angels cannot then pro-
  tect those who are disregarding one of the divine precepts."—"Patriarchs and
  Prophets," p. 256.
      "When the third angel's message closes, mercy no longer pleads for the
  guilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of God have accomplished their
  work. They have received 'the latter rain,' the refreshing from the presence
  of the Lord,' and they are prepared for the trying hour before them. . . .
  Every case has been decided for life or death. Christ has made the atonement
  for His people, and blotted out their sins. The number of His subjects is made
  up ; the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the
  whole heaven,' is about to be given to the heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to
  reign as King of kings, and Lord of lords."—"The Great Controversy," pp.
  613, 614.
      10. How was the remnant church presented to the prophet Zephaniah?
  Zeph. 3 :12-17.
      NOTE.—"As the people of God afflict their souls before Him, pleading for
  purity of heart, the command is given, 'Take away the filthy garments,' and
  the encouraging words are spoken, 'Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to
  pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.' The spotless
  robe of Christ's righteousness is placed upon the tried, tempted, faithful chil-
  dren of God. The despised remnant are clothed in glorious apparel, nevermore
  to be defiled by the corruptions of the world. Their names are retained in the
  Lamb's book of life, enrolled among the faithful of all ages. They have re-
  sisted the wiles of the deceiver; they have not been turned from their loyalty
' by the dragon's roar. Now they are eternally secure from the tempter's devices.
  Their sins are transferred to the originator of sin. A 'fair miter' is set upon their
  heads."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 591.
       11. What glorious experience awaits the faithful followers of the Lamb,
  after their days of test and trial? Rev. 14:1-5; 15:2, 3.
       NOTE.—"While John was shown the last great struggles of the church with
  earthly powers, he was also permitted to behold the final victory and deliver-
  ance of the faithful. He saw the church brought into deadly conflict with the
  beast and his image, and the worship of that beast enforced on pain of death.
   But looking beyond the smoke and din of the battle, he beheld a company
   upon Mount Zion with the Lamb, having, instead of the mark of the beast, the
   `Father's name written in their foreheads.' And again he saw 'them that had
   gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and
   over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of
   God,' and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb."—"Testimonies," vol. 5,
   pp. 752, 753.
                           The Secret of Victory
     12. What was foreseen regarding the attitude of the remnant church
 toward the spirit of prophecy? Rev. 12:17.
     NoTE.—"Despise not prophesyings," admonished the apostle Paul. "Prove
 all things; hold fast that which is good." 1 Thess. 5:20, 21. In the original
 Greek, the basic word which is here translated "hold fast," is the same as that
 rendered in the text of the Authorized Version as "have" in Revelation 12:17.
 This fact led the translators of the Revised Version to render this text, "keep
                                       [ 37 1
the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus." The similarity of
these two passages of scripture in setting forth the proper attitude toward
"prophesyings" or "the testimony of Jesus," leads to the inference that there
will be in the remnant church a manifestation of the spirit of prophecy; and
further, that in harmony with the counsel of Paul, it will not be despised, but
proved, by being brought to the tests, of Scripture. Then being found "good,"
it will be accepted and held fast by the last church. The loyalty of the remnant
to the revelation of God in the Bible and their acceptance of His present-day
messages through the spirit of prophecy are primary reasons for the purity of
their doctrine, for the success of their divine commission to preach the message
to all the world, for their perfection of character so that they stand without a
mediator after the close of probation, and for their ultimate glorious triumph
at the coming of Christ.
    13. What attitude toward the words of God's prophets is the only basis
for success and prosperity? 2 Chron. 20:20.
    NOTE.—"Perilous times are before us. . . . The enemy is on our track. We
must be wide-awake, on our guard against him. We must put on the whole ar-
mor of God. We must follow the directions given through the spirit of proph-
ecy. We must love and obey the truth for this time. This will save us from
accepting strong delusions. God has spoken to us through His word. He has
spoken to us through the Testimonies to the church, and through the books
that have helped to make plain our present duty and the position that we
should now occupy. The warnings that have been given, line upon line, precept
upon precept, should be heeded. If we disregard them, what excuse can we
offer?"—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 298.

The Daily Lesson Study Cultivates Daily Bible
                           Study Habit
                                            Seventh-day Adventists have the rep-
              prOdultil                 utation of being Bible students. In our
                                        early history this was more true of our
                                        people than it is today. There is a tend-
                                        ency to superficiality in our search of
                                        the Scriptures in the study of the Sabbath
                                        school lesson as well as in other Bible
                                        study. We need to know and understand
                                        the Bible, however, as the only guide to
                                        eternal life, and the only rule for our
                                        Christian character building.
                                            Hence the Sabbath SchOol Depart-
                                        ment earnestly endeavors to encourage
daily lesson study, not merely to reach a goal, but for the salvation of our
souls. The Lord declared, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by, every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." Matt. 4:4. We are to desire
the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby. 1 Peter 2:2. We are
to grow in faith and a knowledge of God through the word. Rom. 10:17 ; 2
Peter 3:18. "There is but little benefit derived from a hasty reading of the
Scriptures. . . . There must be careful research and prayerful reflection."
—"Steps to Christ," p. 95.
    Because many misunderstood our aim in providing a chart for checking
their daily lesson study at the top of each lesson, this chart has been omitted
from the Quarterly. We earnestly appeal to every Sabbath school member,
young and old, to study the lesson every day, that daily Bible study may be-
come as natural and necessary as daily food. Job declared, "I have esteemed
the words of His mouth more than my necessary food." Job 23:12. Begin the
lesson study Sabbath afternoon, according to the counsel of the spirit of proph-
 ecy, and then devote sufficient study each day of the week to learn the lesson
well.
    "We should fear to skim the surface of the word of God."—"Testimonies,"
 vol. 6, p. 407.
    We live in perilous times, and more and more need the sustaining power of
 the word of God. Satan knows this, and will strive to keep us from Bible
 study. "Satan employs every possible device to prevent men from obtaining a
 knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his deceptions. . . .
 None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible will
 stand through the last great conflict."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 593, 594.

                  Southern European Division, and Its Mission Territory
THE OVERFLOW. September 28. Within recent years, overflows of the Thirteenth Sab-
bath Offerings have been given to the mission fields of the Southern European Division,
as follows : In 1935, $2,424.80 went to this field ; in 1937, to the medical work in north-
ern Africa, $5,729.04 ; in 1938, to the islands of Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion, and
the Seychelles, $6,343.89. Now the Portuguese islands and Portuguese Guinea in Africa
are urgently in need of chapels to which people may be invited to hear the gospel mes-
sage. The Portuguese islands, as shown on the map, include the Azores, Madeira, the
Cape Verde Islands, and also St. Thomas, all west of Africa. Will you not help gen-
erously on September 28, that a large overflow may provide chapels for these islands?
