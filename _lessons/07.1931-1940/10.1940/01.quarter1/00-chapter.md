    The Origin of the Home and Its Corruption
   MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
there He put the man whom He had formed. . . . And the Lord God said, It is not
good that the man should be alone; I will make him an helpmeet for him." Gen. 2:8, 18.
   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 49-51.
   SEED THOUGHT: "God made the first home. He made it right. It was a
pattern for all future earthly homes. He founded it on the marriage relation."—"The
Real Home," p. 10. In no other phase of human experience is the dire consequence of
sin more manifest than in, the marriage relation and the home life. As the home
became more and more degraded, society became corrupt until God destroyed the wicked
world by a flood.
                          God's Plan for Man
    1. What is the origin of the home? Gen. 1:26, 27.
    2. What did God say to the newly created pair? Verse 28.

                           The Creation of Eve
    3. Because it was not good for man to be alone, what did God purpose
to do? Gen. 2:18.
    4. Before giving Adam a companion, how did God cause him to feel
his need of one? Verses 18-20.
    5. What is the record of the creation of Eve? Gen. 2:21, 22.
    NOTE.—"God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided 'an help
meet for him,'—a helper corresponding to him,—one who was fitted to be
his companion, and who could be one with him in love and sympathy. Eve
was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was
not to control him as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior,
but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him. A part
of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self ; showing
the close union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this
relation."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 46.

                             The Ideal Home
    6. How is the first home described? Gen. 2:8-10.
    NOTE.—"The home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other
homes as their children should go forth to occupy the earth. That home,
beautified by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace. Men, in
their pride, delight in magnificent and costly edifices, and glory in the works
of their own hands; but God placed Adam in a garden. This was his dwelling.
The blue heavens were its dome; the earth, with its delicate flowers and carpet
of living green, was its floor; and the leafy branches of the goodly trees were
its canopy. Its walls were hung with the most magnificent adornings,—the
handiwork of the great Master Artist."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 49.
     7. What was to be the occupation of Adam and Eve? Gen. 2:15.
    NOTE.—"Though rich in all that the Owner of the universe could supply,
they were not to be idle. Useful occupation was appointed them as a blessing,
to strengthen the body, to expand the mind, and to develop the character."—
"Education," p. 21.
                           The Results of Sin
     8. How did sin affect Adam's love for his wife? Gen. 3 : 12.
     NOTE.—"Adam could neither deny nor excuse his sin; but instead of mani-
festing penitence, he endeavored to cast the blame upon his wife, and thus
upon God Himself: 'The woman whom Thou gayest to be with me, she gave
me of the tree, and I did eat.' He who, from love to Eve, had deliberately
chosen to forfeit the approval of God, his home in Paradise, and an eternal
life of joy, could now, after his fall, endeavor to make his companion, and
even the Creator Himself, responsible for the transgression. So terrible is the
power of sin."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 57, 58.
     9. Because of sin what change resulted in the relationship of Eve to
her husband? Gen. 3:16.
     10. How was the first home further disrupted by sin? Gen. 4:8.
     11. How did Cain as a fugitive, alter God's plan for a garden home?
 Gen 4:17.
     NOTE.—"The people who were under His direction still pursued the plan
of life that He had appointed in the beginning. Those who departed from
God built for themselves cities, and, congregating in them, gloried in the
splendor, the luxury, and the vice that make the cities of today the world's
 pride and its curse. But the men who held fast God's principles of life dwelt
among the fields and hills. They were tillers of the soil, and keepers of flocks
and herds; and in this free, independent life, with its opportunities for labor
and study and meditation, they learned of God, and taught their children
 of His works and ways."—"Education," pp. 33, 34.
     "It was not God's purpose that people should be crowded into cities,
huddled together in terraces and tenements. In the beginning He placed our
 first parents amidst the beautiful sights and sounds He desires us to rejoice
 in today. The more nearly we come into harmony with God's original plan,
 the more favorable will be our position to secure health of body, and mind,
 and soul."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 365.
     12. With whom did polygamy originate? Gen. 4:19.
     NOTE.—The ugly head of polygamy is first shown in connection with
                                       [ 1]
violence and bloodshed. And wherever it appears in the Old Testament, even
in the homes of the patriarchs,—in Abraham's, in Jacob's, in Elkanah's,—it
brings with it jealousy, rivalry, treachery, and deceit.
     13. To what extent was the purity of the home finally broken down?
With what result? Gen. 6:1-5.
     NOTE.—"For some time the two classes remained separate. . . . So long
as this separation continued, they [the children of Seth] maintained the
worship of God in its purity. But in the lapse of time they ventured, little by
little, to mingle with the inhabitants of the valleys. This association was pro-
ductive of the worst results. 'The sons of God saw the daughters of men that
they were fair' The children of Seth, attracted by the beauty of the daughters
of Cain's descendants, displeased the Lord by intermarrying with them. . . .
Mingling with the depraved, they became like them in spirit and in deeds;
the restrictions of the seventh commandment were disregarded, `and they took
them wives of all which they chose.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 81.

  SABBATH I SUNDAY      I   MONDAY   I   TUESDAY   I WEDNESDAY THURSDAY I     FRIDAY




                        Husbands and Wives
    MEMORY VERSE: "I therefore . . . beseech you that ye walk worthy of
the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffer-
ing, forbearing one another in love." Eph. 4:1, 2.
    STUDY HELP:' "Ministry of Healing," pp. 356-362.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Thus was the marriage institution ordained of God in
Eden, before man sinned. Like the Sabbath, it has come down to us with the Edenic
dews of divine blessing still upon it. It was ordained not only for the purpose of
peopling the earth and perpetuating the race, but to promote social order and human
happiness; to prevent irregular affection; and, through well-regulated families, to
transmit truth, purity, and holiness from age to age. Around it cluster all the purest
and truest joys of home and the race."—"Bible Readings for the Home Circle," p. 706,
(ed. 1914).
              'the Relationship of Husband and Wife
    1. What was God's plan in creating Eve? Gen. 2:20, 18.
     2. What was to be the relationship between our first parents? Gen.
2:23, 24.
    NoTE.—"God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for
its originator the Creator of the universe. 'Marriage is honorable' (Heb. 13:4) ;
it was one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is one of the two institutions
that, after the fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise.
When the divine principles are recognized and obeyed in this relation, mar-
riage is a blessing; it guards the purity and happiness of the race, it provides
for man's social needs, it elevates the physical, the intellectual, and the moral
nature."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 46.
    3. Who was to be the "head of the house?" Eph. 5:22-25.
                                         [4]
    NorE.—There are those who seek to discredit the fact that the- husband
was designed to be the head of the house, though the teaching of the Bible
is conclusive on this point. The most orderly and contented homes are those
where the husband fills his rightful place. However, the husband, conscious
of the sacrifice Jesus made to redeem him from his own selfish nature, will
manifest a Christlike spirit in this the closest of all human relationships.
Where there is the greatest temptation to abuse authority, there the greatest
effort is called for to acquire and maintain self-control. "Forbearance and un-
selfishness mark the words and acts of all who live the new life in Christ. As
you seek to live His life, striving to conquer self and selfishness and to minister
to the needs of others, you will gain victory after victory."—"Ministry of
Healing," p. 362.
    4. Against what are husbands cautioned? Col. 3:19.
    5. How can wives exert a winning influence on their husbands? 1 Peter
3:1.
         True Marriage Upheld by Christ and Apostles
    6. What is the witness of the New Testament on the sanctity of the
marriage relation?
    ANswEa.—Jesus. Matt. 5:27, 28; Mark 10:2-12. Paul. Eph. 5:31-33;
1 Tim. 3:2, 12.
    7. What ,is the warning against unequal marriages? 2 Cor. 6:14-18.
    NoTE.—"The Lord commanded Israel not to make marriages with the
idolatrous nations around them. 'Thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his
son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. For they will turn away
thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger
of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.'        thou art
a holy people unto the Lord thy od; the Lord thy God bath chosen thee to
be a special people unto Himself, above all people that are upon the face
of the earth.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 328.
    "The heart yearns for human love, but this love is not strong enough,
or pure enough, or precious enough, to supply the place of the love of Jesus.
Only in her Saviour can the wife find wisdom, strength, and grace to meet
the cares, responsibilities, and sorrows of life. She should make Him her
strength and her guide. Let woman give herself to Christ before giving her-
self to any earthly friend, and enter into no relation which shall conflict with
this. Those who would find true happiness, must have the blessing of Heaven
upon all that they possess, and all that they do. It is disobedience to God
that fills so many hearts and homes with misery. My sister, unless you would
have a home where the shadows are never lifted, do not unite yourself with
one who is an enemy of God."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 362, 363.
                            The Marriage Ideal
   8. What was the plan of God for marriage? Gen. 2:23, 24; Matt. 19:5-9.
   NorE.—At the dawn of creation the institution of monogamy was given
to man; i.e., the state of being paired with a single mate.
   9. In what beautiful symbolic language does God show at once His
high ideal of marriage among His people and His love for His church?
Song of Solomon 4:7; Eph. 5:25-27; Isa. 54:4, 5; Jer. 3:14; Rev. 19:6-9.
   NOTES FOR REFERENCE.—"Ministry of Healing," p. 361, paragraphs 2-5;
"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 527, last paragraph.
                                        (5)
    10. How only can marriage prove the mutual blessing God designed it
to be? Eph. 4:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"The grace of Christ, and this alone, can make this institution
what God designed it should be,—an agent for the blessing and uplifting of
humanity. And thus the families of earth, in their unity and peace and love,
may represent the family of heaven.
    "Now, as in Christ's day, the condition of society presents a sad comment
upon heaven's ideal of this sacred relation. Yet even for those who have found
bitterness and disappointment where they had hoped for companionship and
joy, the gospel of Christ offers a solace. The patience and gentleness which
His Spirit can impart, will sweeten the bitter lot. The heart in which Christ
dwells, will be so filled, so satisfied, with His love that it will not be consumed
with longing to attract sympathy and attention to itself. And through the
surrender of the soul to God, His wisdom can accomplish what human wisdom
fails to do. Through the revelation of His grace, hearts that were once in-
different or estranged may be united in bonds that are firmer and more
enduring than those of earth,—the golden bonds of a love that will bear the
test of trial."—"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," p. 101.
    "The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred, of any on earth.
It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. And it is a blessing wherever
the marriage covenant is entered into intelligently, in the fear of God, and
with due consideration for its responsibilities."—"Ministry of Healing," pp.
356, 357.
    11. What is the secret of a happy home? Prov. 15:17; 1 Tim. 6:6.
    NOTE.—"Home should be a place where cheerfulness, courtesy, and love
abide; and where these graces dwell, there will abide happiness;          and peace.
Troubles may invade, but these are the lot of humanity. Let patience, grati-
tude, and love keep sunshine in the heart, though the day may be ever so
cloudy. In such homes angels of God abide."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 393.

  SABBATH SUNDAY        I   MONDAY   I   TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY' THURSDAY FRIDAY




                        The Work of Parents
    MEMORY VERSE: "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth
them that fear Him." Ps. 103:13.
    STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 4, pp. 200-202; "Education," pp. 287, 288.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Every child born into the home is a sacred trust. God says
to the parents, 'Take this child, and bring it up for Me, that it may be an honor to My
name, and a channel through which My blessings shall flow to the world.' "—"Counsels
to Teachers," p. 145.
                    A Heritage of the Lord
   1. From whom are children a heritage? Ps. 127:3, 4; Gen. 33:5.
   2. For what did Ezra pray in behalf of Israel and all their children?
Ezra 8:21.
                                         [6 7
                    Training of Children Essential
    3. What is the Lord's will concerning the training of our children?
Prov. 29 17; Ps. 144:12.
    NOTE.—"As the children sang in the temple courts, 'Hosanna! Blessed is
He that cometh in the name of the Lord,' so in these last days, children's
voices will be raised to give the last message of warning to a perishing world.
When heavenly intelligences see that men are no longer permitted to present
the truth, the Spirit of God will come upon the children, and they will do a
work in the proclamation of the truth which the older workers cannot do,
because their way will be hedged up."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 202, 203.
    4. What is the result of failure to train and discipline children?
Prov. 29 : 15.
    5. In an effort to discharge their duties, against what are parents
warned? Eph. 6:4; Col. 3:21.
    NOTE.—"It will pay to manifest affection in your association with yOur
children. Do not repel them by lack of sympathy in their childish sports, joys,
and griefs. Never let a frown gather upon your brow, or a harsh word escape
your lips. God writes all these words in His book of records. Harsh words
sour the temper and wound the hearts of children, and in some cases these
wounds are difficult to heal. Children are sensitive to the least injustice, and
some become discouraged under it, and will neither heed the loud, angry voice
of command, nor care for threatenings of punishment. Rebellion is too fre-
quently established in the hearts of children through the wrong discipline of
the parents, when if a proper course had been taken, the children would have
formed good and harmonious characters."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, pp. 532, 533.
    6. What is always the accompaniment of transgression? Prov. 13:15;
Isa. 53:5.
    NoTE.—Not only does sin and transgression bring hardship and suffering
to the transgressor; upon the Saviour of mankind fell the punishment for
man's sin. Every sin willfully committed wounds the Son of God afresh. Yet
His suffering in our behalf brought our only hope for healing. "With His
stripes we are healed."
     7. What is the true office of punishment? Heb. 12:5-11.
    8. What should parents learn from God's dealing with us? Ps. 118:18;
 Isa. 63:7-9.
    NorE.—"Chasten" signifies to correct in love, to punish in justice. (See
Isa. 53:5.) That substitutionary punishment by which our peace, that is, our
reconciliation to God, salvation, and happiness, was purchased       , was laid
upon Christ by God's justice, with Christ's own consent. There is nothing
brutal nor cruel in the Lord's correction. That chastisement which comes
 from Him is tempered with mercy and is dealt only in love. There is no
warrant in the Bible for cruel beating. We do not forget, however, the passage
 from the word, "He that spareth his rod hateth his son."
    The objection to the brutalizing character of corporal punishment cannot
apply to the sting of a little switch applied to feet and legs. But this should be
 used very early,—while the child is still in the nursery. "Obedience there must
 be arbitrary; it will be too late if we wait for adolescence. As the child grows,
 reasoning should play a larger and larger part in his discipline. The aim of
 discipline is not to break or to crush the child, but to bring him to the point
                                          73
of accepting the responsibility of his own actions. . . . The habit of obedience
must be learned in early infancy, by using the simple law of pain and pleasure.
`No' must be linked with pain until 'No' can be substituted for pain. There
must be restraint in infancy, but self-control must be the ultimate end and
purpose of all discipline."—"The Way He Should Go," Agnes Lewis Caviness,
pp. 55, 56.
            The Necessary Instruction and Its Results
     9. How should children be instructed in the precepts of the kingdom?
Deut. 6:6, 7; Ps. 78:4-7.
     10. What examples have been given us? Gen. 18:17-19; Job 1:5.
    11. What is told us concerning the sons of Eli? 1 Sam. 2:12.
    12. How and why did Eli fail in his endeavor to correct their evil
course? Verses 23-25.
    NOTE.—"Eli did not manage his household according to God's rules for
family government. He followed his own judgment. The fond father over-
looked the faults and sins of his sons in their childhood, flattering himself that
after a time they would outgrow their evil tendencies. Many are now making
a similar mistake. They think they know a better way of training their
children than that which God has given in His word. They foster wrong
tendencies in them, urging as an excuse, 'They are too young to be punished.
Wait till they become older, and can be reasoned with' Thus wrong habits
are left to strengthen until they become second nature. The children grow
up without restraint, with traits of character that are a lifelong curse to them,
and are liable to be reproduced in others.
    "There is no greater curse upon households than to allow the youth to
have their own way. When parents regard every wish of their children, and
indulge them in what they know is not for their good, the children soon lose
all respect for their parents, all regard for the authority of God or man, and
are led captive at the will of Satan. The influence of an ill-regulated family
is widespread, and disastrous to all society. It accumulates in a tide of evil that
affects families, communities, and governments."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
pp. 578, 579.
               Failure to Correct—Its Consequences
    13. What sentence was pronounced by God upon Eli's failure to correct
his sons? 1 Sam. 3:11-14.
    14. As a comforting contrast, what beautiful example is given us in
the life of Hannah? 1 Sam. 1:9-11, 26-28.
    NorE.—"What a reward was Hannah's ! and what an encouragement to
faithfulness is her example ! There are opportunities of inestimable worth,
interests infinitely precious, committed to every mother. The humble round
of duties which women have come to regard as a wearisome task, should be
looked upon as a grand and noble work. It is the mother's privilege to bless
the world by her influence, and in doing this she will bring joy to her own
heart. She may make straight paths for the feet of her children, through sun-
shine and shadow, to the glorious heights above. But it is only when she
seeks, in her own life, to follow the teachings of Christ, that the mother can
hope to form the character of her children after the divine pattern."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p. 572.
    15. What grave question will be asked of us by our Master? Jer. 13:20.
                                      [8]

  SABBATH I SUNDAY I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY] THURSDAY I FRIDAY




                          Duties of Children
    MEMORY VERSE: "My son, attend to My words; incline thine ear unto My
sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes ; keep them in the midst of thine heart."
Prov. 4:20, 21.
    STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 573, 574.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Children, do you desire eternal life? . Then respect and
honor your parents. . . . If you have sinned in. not rendering love and obedience to
them, begin now to redeem the past. You cannot afford to take any other course;
for it means to you the loss of eternal life."—"Messages to Young People," p..332.

                           Blessing in Obedience
    1. Repeat the fifth commandment. Ex. 20:12.
    NoTE.—"Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due
to no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon them a responsibility
for the souls committed to their charge, has ordained that during the earlier
years of life, parents shall stand in the place of God to their children. And he
who rejects the rightful authority of his parents, is rejecting the authority of
God. The fifth commandment requires children not only to yield respect,
submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and
tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and
comfort them in old age. It also enjoins respect for ministers and rulers, and
for all others to whom. God has delegated authority."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 308.
    2. What instruction is given children with reference to their attitude
toward their parents? Prov. 1:8, 9; 23:22; Col. 3:20.
    3. What are some blessings pronounced on those obedient to this in-
struction? Prov. 4:20-22; 6:20-22.
    4. How will the wise child relate himself to his father's instruction?
Prov. 13:1; 15:5.
    NorE.—"Our youth profess to be among those who keep the command-
ments of God, and yet many of them neglect and break the fifth command-
ment; and the rich blessing promised to those who observe this precept, and
honor father and mother, cannot be fulfilled to them. Unless they repent of
their sin, and reform their practices and character through the grace of Christ,
they will never enter into the new earth, upon which they may live eternally.
Those who do not respect and love their parents will not respect and honor
 God. Those who fail to bear the test, who fail to honor their God-fearing
parents, fail to obey God, and therefore cannot expect to come into the land
 of promise."—"Messages to Young People," pp. 331, 332.
                              A Sign of the End
   5. What attitude of children constitutes one of the signs of the last
days? 2 Tim. 3:2.
                                         (91
    6. What is said of the future of the disrespectful, disobedient child?
Prov. 30:11, 17.
    7. What was the effect of the spirit of reform in the work of John
the Baptist? Luke 1:17.
   8. What is one of the reforms promised as part of the work of God's
remnant church? Mal. 4:6.
   NOTE. "The hearts of your parents have been drawn out in tender sym-
pathy toward you, and can you return their love with cold ingratitude?
They love your souls, they want you to be saved; but have you not often
despised their counsel and done your own will, your own way? Have you
not followed your own independent judgment, when you knew that such a
stubborn course would not meet the approval of God? Many fathers and
mothers have gone down brokenhearted to the grave because of the ingrati-
tude, the lack of respect, shown them by their children."—"Messages to
Young People," p. 332.
                       Examples of Faithfulness
     9. Name Bible examples of obedience due to parental instruction.
    a. Joseph. Gen. 39:2, 3.
     b. Servant maid in Naaman's household. 2 Kings 5:1-3.
    c. Josiah. 2 Chron. 34:1-3.
    d. Daniel. Dan. 1:8.
    e. Esther. Esther 2:10, 11, 20.
    f. Timothy. 2 Tifn. 1:5; 3:14, 15.
     10. What is the testimony concerning Jesus' home life? Luke 2:51, 52.
    NOTE.—"Jesus is our example. There are many who dwell with interest
upon the period of His public ministry, while they pass unnoticed the teaching
of His early years. But it is in His home life that He is the pattern for all
children and youth. The Saviour condescended to poverty, that He might
teach how closely we in a humble lot may walk with God. He lived to please,
honor, and glorify His Father in the common things of life. His work began
in consecrating the lowly trade of the craftsmen who toil for their daily bread.
He was doing God's service just as much when laboring at the carpenter's
bench as when working miracles for the multitude. And every youth who
follows Christ's example of faithfulness and obedience in His lowly home,
may claim those words spoken of Him by the Father through the Holy Spirit,
`Behold My servant, whom I uphold; Mine elect, in whom My soul de-
lighteth.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 74.
    "The life of Christ was marked with respect and love for His mother."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 90.
    "On the cross in His last act of tenderness toward His mother, Jesus again
addressed her in the same way, as He committed her to the care of His best-
loved disciple. Both at the marriage feast and upon the cross, the love ex-
pressed in tone and look and manner, interpreted His words."—"The Desire
o f Ages," p. 146.

  SABBATH I SUNDAY      I   MONDAY I TUESDAY     I WEDNESDAY THURSDAY I FRIDAY




                     The Home and Religion
    MEMORY VERSE: "Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and read." Isa. 34:16.
    STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 547, 548; "Education," pp. 52-56.
    SEED THOUGHT: The child born into a home brings with him a threefold
nature which must be nourished that it may develop sturdily and symmetrically. The
first year or two we are concerned chiefly with his physipl needs. As his capacity for
observation and expression begin to be manifest, we begin to plan for his intellectual
nourishment. But the spiritual side of his nature is often neglected or deliberately
left to lie dormant under the misapprehension that he is not old enough to compre-
hend spiritual things. However, the spiritual education is the most important work
given to earthly parents. Upon its faithful performance depends the child's welfare,
for time and eternity.
                            Teaching in the Home
    1. What beautiful example do we have from the childhood home of
Timothy? 2 Tim. 1:5; 3:15.
    NorE.—By precept and example we must teach our children how to come
to our Father in heaven. The parents' own relationship to their heavenly
Father affords the best opportunities for these first lessons..If we are living in
His presence, there will be an atmosphere of reverence and piety pervading
the home which leaves its impress upon the child. The child may not under-
stand his mother's words as she kneels by his crib, night after night, and in
fervent voice and heartfelt words invokes God's blessing upon her child; but
her kneeling position, reverent intonation, and manner all speak to him of
an invisible, loving, and powerful Being to whom she is speaking. Again, he
sees his father on his knees, in the same manner speaking to this same unseen
One at family worship. Before every meal he observes that every head is
bowed in gratitude when thanks is rendered to God for their food.
    Later, as his ears are opened to the understanding of words, he learns the
various names and attributes of this unseen Friend,—ever-present, ever-
loving,—and his heart is attracted to the same One by his parents' faith.
If in the home, love, patience, meekness, and gentleness are the prevailing
atmosphere, the child will readily understand when his mother tells him,
"Jesus loves and cares for you, my child." And since love begets love, it will
be an easy step for the child to love God and desire to please Him.
    2. With what diligence should parents instruct their children? Deut.
6:6, 7.
    NOTE.—In all of life's situations are to be interwoven God's holy precepts.
The child's realization of God's ownership of him, and, therefore, his obliga-
tion to God, will depend almost entirely upon the degree of sincerity which
he sees and feels in his parents' lives.

                    Trained in the Ways of the Lord
    3. How are children to be brought up? Eph. 6:4, last clause.
    NorE.—"Hearts that are filled with the love of Christ can never get very
                                     11
far apart. Religion is love • and a Christian home is one where love reigns,
and finds expression in words and acts of thoughtful kindness and gentle cour-
tesy. Let no harsh words be spoken. Let the family worship be made pleasant
and interesting. Be a Christian gentleman, my brother; for the very same
principles that characterize the home life will be carried into the church. A
lack of courtesy, a moment of petulance, a single rough, thoughtless word,
will mar your reputation, and may close the door to hearts so that you can
never reach them."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 335.
    4. What attitude should our children learn to take toward God's word?
Ps. 119:105, 111, 129.
                     Methods of Parental Training
     5. Against what human weakness are we warned by Paul in the epistle
 to the Hebrews? Heb. 13:5.
     NoTE.—The need for training our children against the sin of covetousness
 is strongly stated in the following sentences: "To live for self is to perish.
 Covetousness, the desire of benefit for self's sake, cuts the soul off from life.
It is the spirit of Satan to get, to draw to self. It is the spirit of Christ to give,
to sacrifice self for the good of others."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 259.
     6. What should we teach our children concerning judging by outward
appearance? 1 Sam. 16:7; James 4:11.
     NOTE.—"No outward beauty can recommend the soul to God. The wisdom
and excellence revealed in the character and deportment, express the true
beauty of the man; and it is the inner worth, the excellency of the heart, that
determines our acceptance with the Lord of hosts. How deeply should we
feel this truth in the judgment of ourselves and others. We may learn, from •
the mistake of Samuel, how vain is the estimation that rests on beauty of
face or nobility of stature. We may see how incapable is man's wisdom of
understanding the secrets of .the heart, or of comprehending the counsels of
God, without special enlightenment from heaven."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 638.
     7. What teaching should be given concerning diligence? Col. 3:23, 24j
Eccl. 9:10.
     NorE.—Training a child in habits of diligence and industry is essential to
success in afterlife. Concerning this element in human life we are told: "The
hill of progress is not to be climbed without effort. No one need expect to be
carried along to the prize, either in religious or secular matters, independently
of his own exertions. The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to
the strong, yet he that dealeth with a slack hand will become poor. The
persevering and industrious are not only happy themselves, but they contribute
largely to the happiness of others. Competency and comfort are not ordinarily
attained except at the price of earnest industry."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 180.
     8. How should the child be trained as to his speech? Eph. 5:4; 4:29.
     9. Concerning boastfulness, what should the parents teach? Prov.
10:19; 27:1, 2.
     10. What training should be given in the matter of self-control? Prov.
25:28; 16:23.
     NOTE.—"Many mistake strong passions for a strong character; but the
truth is that he who is mastered by his passions is a weak man. The real
                                        ( 12 )
greatness of the man is measured by the power of the feelings that he controls,
not by those that control him."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 567, 568.
    11. When guilty of wrongdoing, what should a child be taught to do?
Prov. 28:13.
    NorE.—"Confession of sin, whether public or private, should be heartfelt,
and freely expressed. It is not to be urged from the sinner. It is not to be
made in a flippant and careless way, or forced from those who have no realizing
sense of the abhorrent character of sin. The confession that is the outpouring
of the inmost soul finds its way to the God of infinite pity."—"Steps to Christ,"
p. 43.
    12. For what are all these scriptures concerning personal conduct
profitable? 2 Tim. 3:16.
    NorE.—Parents should seek by the careful use of the principles laid down
in the Sacred Book to instruct their children in the ways of God. Every
principle of righteous conduct, of true living in honesty and sobriety, worthy
of sons and daughters of God, is to be found therein. These words are
profitable for the guidance of children and youth, for their correction, for
their instruction in the ways of righteousness. Every father and mother
should seek in love to so implant these principles in the heart of the child
that they will be a shield and buckler against temptation in every experience
of life.
    13. To whom should God-fearing parents go for help in their task of
guiding their children? James 1:5.
    NorE.—"Brought up under the wise and loving guidance of a true home,
children will have no desire to wander away in search of pleasure and com-
panionship. Evil will not attract them. The spirit that prevails in the home
will mold their characters; they will form habits and principles that will be a
strong defense against temptation when they shall leave the home shelter
and take their place in the world."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 394.

  SABBATH I SUNDAY I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAYI THURSDAY I FRIDAY



                      The Home and Prayer
    MEMORY VERSE: "My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning, 0 Lord; in the
morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will look up." Ps. 5:3.
    STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 397, 398; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
pp. 171-175.
    SEED THOUGHT: "True family worship is a fountain that brings streams of
holy influences into every part of the household. It is a vase of perfume that sheds
fragrance over all. It softens asperities. It quells anger. It quiets impatience. It
settles differences. It subdues evil passions. Hearts that are drawn together at God's
feet every day cannot get very far apart. The frictions of the day are forgotten when
all voices mingle in the same heavenly song. As the tender words of inspiration fall
with their benign counsels, all feeling of unkindness melts away. The altar in the
                                           13
midst wondrously hallows and sweetens the home fellowship. Besides, it puts new
strength into every heart. It comforts sorrow. It is a shield against temptation. It
smooths out the wrinkles of care. It inspires strength for burden bearing. It quickens
every religious sentiment and keeps the fires burning on every heart's altar."—"Week
Day Religion," J. R. Miller, p. 79.

                   The Prayer Life of the Patriarchs
    1. What marked the patriarchs' pilgrimages through their life? Noah,
Gen. 8:20; Abraham, Gen. 12:7; Jacob, Gen. 35:1, 3; Moses, Ex. 17:15.
   NOTE.—"The father who is the 'house-band' of the family, will bind his
children to the throne of God by living faith. Distrusting his own strength,
he hangs his helpless soul on Jesus, and takes hold of the strength of the
Most High. Brethren, pray at home, in your family, night and morning; pray
earnestly in your closet; and while engaged in your daily labor, lift up the
soul to God in prayer. It was thus that Enoch walked with. God."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 4, p. 616.
    2. What does David say concerning the blessing of divine worship?
Psalm 84.
   3. What is the exhortation to the Hebrews concerning the habitual
worship of God in His sanctuary? Heb. 10:25.
         The Prayer Example of Christ and the Apostles
    4. Where did Jesus pray? Matt. 6:5, 6; 14:23; Luke 6:12.
    NoTE.—"It was from hours spent with God, that He came forth, morning
by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. The disciples had come to
connect His hours of prayer with the power of His words and works. Now
as they listened to His supplication their hearts were awed and humbled.
As He ceased praying, it was with a conviction of their own deep need that
they exclaimed, 'Lord, teach us to pray.' (Luke 11:1.)"—"Mount of Blessing,"
p. 152.
    5. Of which worthies of the Bible do we know the prayer habits?
Daniel, Dan. 6:10; Hezekiah, Isa. 37:14-20; Peter, Acts 10:9; Paul,
Acts 9:11.
                     Examples of Answered Prayer
   6. What was David's experience when in distress? What was the
answer? 2 Sam. 15:30, 31; 17:7-14.
   7. Recall the experience of Elijah in prayer. 1 Kings 18:36-39.
   8. What is the witness of the New Testament concerning Elijah's ex-
perience in prayer? James 5:17.
   9. When Israel was threatened with alien armies, what prayer was
prayed by Jehoshaphat? With what result? 2 Chron. 20:3-23.
              Heart Preparation for Answered Prayer

                                        ( 14 1
    NOTE.—"We never need to distrust God. The just Judge repulses no one
who comes to Him in contrition. He has more pleasure in His church struggling
with temptation here below than in the imposing host of angels that surround
His throne. Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial
choir God hears the cries of the weakest human being."—Mrs. E. G. White,
in "Signs of the Times," Sept. 15, 1898.
                    Rejoicing for Answered Prayer
   13. What triumphant refrain does the psalmist give in praise of the
Lord's response to those who cry to Him in their distress? What illustra-
tion of deliverance is noted? Ps. 107:8, 15, 21, 28-31.
   14. What is his conclusion? Ps. 107:43.

  SABBATH I SUNDAY I MONDAY I TUESDAY I WEDNESDAY I THURSDAY I FRIDAY



                  The Horne and the Sabbath
    MEMORY VERSE: "It shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,
and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the
Lord." Isa. 66:23.
    STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 47, 48, 296; "Education," pp.
250-252.
    SEED THOUGHT: "The Sabbath should be made so interesting to our families
that its weekly return will be hailed with joy. In no better way can parents exalt and
honor the Sabbath than by devising means to impart proper instruction to their
families, and interesting them in spiritual things, giving them correct views of the
character of God, and what He requires of us in order to perfect Christian characters
and attain to eternal life. Parents, make the Sabbath a delight, that your children may
look forward to it, and have a welcome in their hearts for it."—"Testimonies," vol.
2, p. 585.
                  The Sabbath of the Commandment
    1. Repeat the Sabbath commandment. Ex. 20:8-11.
    2. How are we to keep the Sabbath day? What is the force of the
word "remember"? Ex. 20:8.
    NorE.—We are to remember the Sabbath to keep it holy. Throughout the
entire week we are so to plan our secular affairs that, when the Sabbath comes
to us, we will be ready to receive it and not desecrate its sanctity because of
our forgetfulness. In this sense the fourth commandment, like the other nine,
covers all the transactions of life during the entire seven days of the week.
    3. When does the Sabbath begin and end? Lev. 23:32, last clause;
Mark 1:32.
    NorE.—There is no more fitting way to begin the Sabbath than, as its
sacred hours draw near, to assemble the family, and, after singing, and reading
God's blessed word, engage in a season of prayer, invoking pardon for sin,
and asking for a Sabbath blessing. Then as its closing moments draw nigh,
offer a prayer of thanksgiving, and ask for strength for the coming week.

                     Preparation for the Sabbath
   4. What is the day before the Sabbath called? Ex. 16:5; Mark 15:42.
   NOTE.—"Friday is the day of preparation. Time can then be devoted to
making the necessary preparation for the Sabbath, and to thinking and con-
versing about it. Nothing which will in the sight of Heaven be regarded as a
violation of the holy Sabbath should be left unsaid or undone, to be said or
done upon the Sabbath."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 702, 703.
   5. What preparation should be made for the Sabbath? Ex. 16:4, 5, 23.
                     Proper Sabbath Observance
   6. What miracle was wrought to teach proper reverence for the Sab-
bath? Ex. 16:19, 20, 24-29.
   7. How was the Sabbath observed by the New Testament believers?
Luke 23:55, 56.
                          Lawful to Do Good
    8. What example of Christ's indicates the true spirit of Sabbath ob-
servance? Matt. 12:10-13.
    9. What else is included in proper Sabbath observance besides refrain-
ing from work? Isa. 58:13, 14.
   NOTE.—"God requires not only that we refrain from physical labor upon
the Sabbath, but that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sacred themes.
The fourth commandment is virtually transgressed by conversing upon worldly
things, or by engaging in light and trifling conversation. Talking upon any-
thing or everything which may come into the mind, is speaking our own
words."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 703.
    10. What is the character of God's law? Rom. 7:12, 14.
    11. What condition of heart is essential for properly keeping the
Sabbath? Ezek. 36:26, 27.
                       Blessing to the Obedient
    12. What blessings are promised to the obedient? Ps. 19:7-11.
    13. What further significance is attached to the Sabbath day? Ezek.
20:12.
   NOTE.—" 'If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy
pleasure on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord,
honorable; . . . then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord.' To all who
receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative and redeeming power, it will
be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight themselves in Him. The Sabbath
points them to the works of creation as an evidence of His mighty power in
redemption. While it calls to mind the lost peace of Eden, it tells of peace
restored through the Saviour. And every object in nature repeats His invita-
tion, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give
you rest.' "—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 288, 289.

                        Christian Education
    MEMORY VERSE: "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." 2 Tim. 2:15.
    STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 330-334.
    SEED THOUGHT: "To restore in man the image of his Maker, to bring him
back to the perfection in which he was created, to promote the development of body,
mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in his creation might be realized, this was
to be the work of redemption. This is the object of education, the great object of
life."--"Education," pp. 15, 16.

                    The Purpose of True Education
    1. What is the purpose of true education? 2 Tim. 2:15.
    NoTE.—"To dwell forever in this home of the blest, to bear in soul, body,
and spirit, not the dark traces of sin and the curse, but the perfect likeness
of our Creator, and through ceaseless ages to advance in wisdom, in knowledge,
and in holiness, ever exploring new fields of thought, ever finding new wonders
and new glories, ever increasing in capacity to know and to,enjoy and to love,
and knowing that there is still beyond us joy and love and wisdom infinite,—
such is the object to which the Christian's hope is pointing, for which Chris-
tian education is preparing. To secure this education, and to aid others to
secure it, should be the object of the Christian's life."—"Counsels to Teachers,"
p. 55.
    2. What should be the basic principles studied? Phil. 4:8.
    NOTE.—"To many who place their children in our schools, strong tempta-
tions will come because they desire them to secure what the world regards as
the most essential education. To these I would say, Bring your children to
the simplicity of the word, and they will be safe. This Book is the foundation
of all true knowledge. The highest education they can receive is to learn how
to add to their 'faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to
godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.' "—"Counsels
to Teachers," p. 15.•
    3. What choice must be made by all who would truly live? Deut.
30 : 19, 20.
    NoTE.—Whatever may bring life, bothaemporal-and eternal, whatever
 may lengthen the days here and eternally, is of God. '"He is thy life," tells the
 whole story. If we would live, we must choose to know Him, to obey Him,
to be like Him. To truly know Christ is life eternal, In choosing an education
that truly elevates, one must study that which leads to the fuller understanding
 of God and of Christ.
                               The First School
  4. When God created man, what provision was made for his education?
Gen. 2:15.
                                        ( 171
   NOTE.—"The Garden of Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson
book, the Creator Himself was the instructor, and the parents of the human
family were the students."—"Education," p. 20.
    5. What did God intend the Garden of Eden to be?
    ANSWER.—"The Garden of Eden was a representation of what God desired
the whole earth to become, and it was His purpose that, as the human family
increased in numbers, they should establish other homes and schools like the
one He had given. Thus in course of time the whole earth might be occupied
with homes and schools where the words and the works of God should be
studied, and where the students should thus be fitted more and more fully
to reflect, throughout endless ages, the light of the knowledge of His glory."—
"Education," p. 22.
    "The holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care of God, but
students receiving instruction from the all-wise Creator. They were visited
by angels, and were granted communion with their Maker, with no obscuring
veil between."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 50.
    6. What promise of instruction has God made to all His children?
Ps. 32:8.
    7. Through whom should all education begin? Deut. 6:7, first clause.
    8. What should be the schoolroom of children of tender age?
    ANSWER.—"The fields and hills—nature's audience chamber—should be
the schoolroom for little children. Her treasures should be their textbook. The
lessons thus imprinted upon their minds will not be soon forgotten."—"Funda-
mentals of Christian Education," p. 61.
    9. How early in life should the principles laid down in God's word be
taught? 2 Tim. 3:15.
    NOTE.—"Children may be trained for the service of sin or for the service
of righteousness. Solomon says, 'Train up a child in the way he should go:
and when he is old, he will not depart from it.' Prov. 22:6. This language is
positive. The training that Solomon enjoins is to direct, educate, develop. But
in order for parents to do this work, they must themselves understand the
`way' the child should go."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 108.

                  The Source and Goal of Wisdom
   10. What is everyone urged to seek? Prov. 2:2-5.
    11. From whom does all true knowledge come? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—"In a knowledge of God, all true knowledge and real development
have their source. . . . Whatever line of investigation we' pursue, with a
sincere purpose to arrive at truth, we,are brought in touch with the unseen,
mighty Intelligence that is working in and through all. The mind of man is
brought into communion with the mind of God, the finite with the Infinite.
The effect of such communion on body and mind and soul is beyond estimate.
In this communion is found the highest education. It is God's own method
of development."—"Education," p. 14.
    12. What ideal in Christian character and cultural development is set
for the youth in God's family? Ps. 144:12.
                                   f 18 1
   13. What is the ultimate goal in all Christian education? Col. 3:4.
   NOTE.—"For Christ's sake, let the aim of your education be shaped by the
inducements of the better world."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education,"
p. 235.

     True Education Illustrated by Experience
    MEMORY VERSE: "As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and
skill in all learning and wisdom." Dan. 1:17, first part.
   STUDY HELP: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 398-402.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Fine mental qualities and a high moral tone are not the
result of accident. God gives opportunities; success depends upon the use made of
them."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 486.

              The Schooling of Patriarch and Prophet
    1. For what was Abraham commended of God? Gen. 18:18, 19.
   NorE.—"It is God that speaks. He who understands the thoughts afar off,
and places the right estimate upon men, says, 'I know him.' There would be,
on the part of Abraham, no betraying of the truth for selfish purposes. He
would keep the law, and deal justly and righteously. And he would not only
fear the Lord himself, but would cultivate religion in his home. He would
instruct his family in righteousness. The law of God would be the rule in his
household.
    "Abraham's household comprised more than a thousand souls. Those who
were led by his teachings to worship the one God, found a home in his en-
campment ; and here, as in a school, they received such instruction as would
prepare them to be representatives of the true faith. Thus a great responsibility
rested upon him. He was training heads of families, and his methods of govern-
ment would be carried out in the households over which they should preside."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 141.
    2. When Joseph was sold by his brethren into Egypt, what held him
true to principle?
    ANSWER.—"Then his thoughts turned to his father's God. In his childhood
he had been taught to love and fear Him. Often in his father's tent he had
listened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as he fled from his home an
exile and a fugitive. He had been told of the Lord's promises to Jacob, and
how they had been fulfilled,—how, in the hour of need, the angels of God
had come to instruct, comfort, and protect him. And he had learned of the
love of God in providing for men a Redeemer. Now all these precious lessons
came vividly before him. Joseph believed that the God of his fathers would
be his God. He then and there gave himself fully to the Lord, and he prayed
that the Keeper of Israel would be with him in the land of his exile."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 213, 214.
                                        [19
    3. Tested by trial, educated in the wisdom of Egypt, what was the effect
of his early education upon his afterlife? Gen. 50:24, 25; Heb. 11:22.
    NOTE.—"When he saw that his end was near, he summoned his kinsmen
about him. Honored as he had been in the land of the Pharaohs, Egypt was
to him but the place of his exile ; his last act was to signify that his lot was cast
with Israel."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 240.
     4. What was the effect of the principles of true education upon the life
and decisions of Moses? Heb. 11:23-27.
    NOTE.—"God had heard the mother's prayers; her faith had been rewarded.
It was with deep gratitude that she entered upon her now safe and happy task.
She faithfully improved her opportunity to educate her child for God. She
felt confident that he had been preserved for some great work, and she knew
that he must soon be given up to his royal mother, to be surrounded with in-
fluences that would tend to lead him away from God. All this rendered her
more diligent and careful in his instruction than in that of her other children.
She endeavored to imbue his mind with the fear of God and the love of truth
and justice, and earnestly prayed that he might be preserved from every
corrupting influence. She showed him the folly and sin of idolatry, and early
taught him to bow down and pray to the living God, who alone could hear
him and help him in every emergency."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp.
243, 244.
    "Only twelve years did he spend with his Hebrew kindred; but during these
years was laid the foundation of his greatness; it was laid by the hand of one
little known to fame. . . . Those principles of truth that were the burden
of his mother's teaching and the lesson of her life, no afterinfluence could
induce Moses to renounce."—"Education," p. 61.
     5. Who in early childhood was called to become a prophet of God?
What part did his mother have in his consecration to the Lord? 1 Sam.
3:2-4, 20; 1:27, 28.
    NOTE.—"Once more Hannah journeyed with her husband to Shiloh, and
presented to the priest, in the name of God, her precious gift. . . . Eli was
deeply impressed by the faith and devotion of this woman of Israel. Himself
an overindulgent father, he was awed and humbled as he beheld this mother's
great sacrifice in parting with her only child, that she might devote him to
the service of God. He felt reproved for his own selfish love, and in humilia-
tion and reverence he bowed before the Lord and worshiped."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 571.
     6. At the time of the captivity, who among those taken gave outstand-
ing witness to godly training? Dan. 1:4, 17.
    NorE.—"Daniel and his associates had been trained by their parents to
habits of strict temperance. They had been taught that God would hold them
accountable for their capabilities, and that they must never dwarf or enfeeble
their powers. This education_was to Daniel and his companions the means of
their preservation amidst the demoralizing influences of the court of Babylon.
Strong were the temptations surrounding them in that corrupt and luxurious
court, but they remained uncontaminated. No power, no influence, could sway
them from the principles they had learned in early life by a study of the word
and works of God."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 482.

The 13th Sabbath offering goes to the Far Eastern Division.

                      The Schools of the Prophets
    7. Aside from the home training of the youth of Israel, what special
schools were established?
    ANSWER.—"Further provision was made for the instruction of the young,
by the establishment of the schools of the prophets. If a youth desired to
search deeper into the truths, of the word of God, and to seek wisdom from
above that he might become a teacher in Iirael, these schools were open to
       '
him. The   schools of the prophets were founded by Samuel, to serve as a
barrier against the widespread corruption, to provide for the moral and
spiritual welfare of the youth, and to promote the future prosperity of the
nation by furnishing it with men qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders
and counselors. . . . They enjoyed the respect and confidence of the people,
both for learning and piety."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 593.
    8. How many such schools were there in Samuel's day?
    ANSWER.—TWO—one at Ramah and the other at Kirjath-jearim. (See
pages 592-602 in "Patriarchs and Prophets.") 0,
    9. What was the objective'of the study in these schools?
    ANswEa.—"In those schools of the olden time it was the grand object of
all study to learn the will of God, and man's duty toward Him."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," pp. 593,594.                         •
    10. What recorded experiences indicate the character of these schools?
2 Kings 2:7, 8, 15, 19-22; 6:1-7.

                       Solomon's Choice and Ours
   11. When Solomon ascended the throne at David's death, what wise
choice did he make? 1 Kings 3:7-9.
   12. How did God respond to his plea? Upon what conditions was his
request to be granted? Verses 11-14.
   13. What similar assurance is given to all God's children? James 1:5.
   Nora.—"When a burden bearer desires wisdom more than he desires wealth,
power, or fame, he will not be disappointed. Such a one will learn from the
great Teacher not only what to do, but how to do it in a way that will meet
with the divine approval."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 31.

          Christ the 'Center of True Education
    MEMORY VERSE: "In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowl-
edge." Col. 2:3.
    STUDY HELP: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 456, 457; "The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 249-251.
                                 [ 21 )
    SEED THOUGHT: "To obtain an education worthy of the name, we must
receive a knowledge of God, the Creator, and of Christ, the Redeemer, as they are
revealed in the sacred word."—"Education," p. 17. "In the highest sense, the work
of education and the work of redemption are one; for in education, as in redemption,
'other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.' It was
the good pleasure of the Father that in Him should all the fullness dwell.' "—Id., p. 30.

                             The School of Christ
    1. For what was Christ recognized in His interview with Nicodemus?
John 3:2.
    2. In His earliest ministry to the multitudes, how is His work spoken
of? Matt. 5:2.
    NOTE.—"The beatitudes were His greeting to the whole human family.
Looking upon the vast throng gathered to listen to the Sermon on the Mount,
He seemed for the moment to have forgotten that He was not in heaven, and
He used the familiar salutation of the world of light. From His lips flowed
blessings as the gushing forth of a long-sealed fountain."—"Education," p. 79.
    3. What manner of training for life did He give His disciples? Matt.
4:19, 20; chapter 10.
    NOTE.—"As Jesus ministered to the vast multitudes that gathered about
Him, His disciples were in attendance, eager to do His bidding and to lighten
His labor. They assisted in arranging the people, bringing the afflicted ones
to the Saviour, and promoting the comfort of all. They watched for interested
hearers, explained the Scriptures to them, and in various ways worked for
their spiritual benefit. They taught what they had learned of Jesus, and were
every day obtaining a rich experience. But they needed also an experience in
laboring alone. They were still in need of much instruction, great patience and
tenderness. Now, while He was personally with them, to point out their errors,
and counsel and correct them, the Saviour sent them forth as His representa-
tives."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 349.
    4. With what did He endow them for life's service? John 20:22.

                      The Christian School of Today
    5. What is the true foundation of all understanding and wisdom?
Prov. 9 : 10 ; Job 28 : 28.
    6. What last-day conditions emphasize the necessity for true education?
2 Tim. 3:1-5, 7; 4:3,4.
    7. Against what class of teaching are the youth warned? 1 Tim. 6:20.
    NOTE.—This scripture warns against science, falsely so called. Of such
scientific teaching we are told: "Human knowledge of both material and
spiritual things is partial and imperfect; therefore many are unable to har-
monize their views of science with Scripture statements. Many accept mere
theories and speculations as scientific facts, and they think that God's word is
to be tested by the teachings of 'science falsely so called' The Creator and His
works are beyond their comprehension; and because they cannot explain these
by natural laws, Bible history is regarded as unreliable. Those who doubt the
reliability of the records of the Old and New Testaments, too often go a step
farther, and doubt the existence of God, and attribute infinite power to nature.
Having let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks of
infidelity."—"The Great Controversy," p. 522.
                                      [ 22]
    8. Toward what should all teaching in the Christian school of today
point the way? Titus 2:11-14.
    NorE.—All that is taught in the Christian school of today should aid in
preparation for the coming of our Lord and Saviour. Knowledge gained in the
study of the sciences fills its place when rightly related to sacred truth. All
true knowledge and wisdom finds its source in the Creator of heaven and
earth, the One who guides the stars in their courses. In every study the aim
of the teacher should be to lead to preparation for the higher school under
the Master Teacher, and the aim of every pupil to obtain a fitting for a place
in the school of the hereafter.
    9. What should be the attitude of both teacher and pupil toward false
theories in science or religion? 1 Cor. 2:13; 2 Cor. 11:2, 3; Phil. 3:8.
    NOTE.-"By many, man's wisdom is thought to be higher than the wisdom
of the divine Teacher, and God's lesson book is looked upon as old-fashioned,
stale, and uninteresting. But by those who have been vivified by the Holy
Spirit it is not so regarded. They see the priceless treasure, and would sell all
to buy the field that contains it. Instead of books containing the suppositions
of reputedly great authors, they choose the word of Him who is the greatest
author and the greatest teacher the world has ever known, who gave His life
for us, that through Him we might have everlasting life."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," pp. 107, 108.
    10. What is the natural result of seeking the wisdom of this world?
Matt. 11:16-19.
    No a.—That which fails to recognize God brings in confusion of judg-
ment. Thus in the days of John the Baptist and of Christ, the teachings of
the day led to a rejection of John and of Christ and a condemnation of their
lives. "Wisdom is justified of her children." Of the present times we read: "In
too many schools of our day God's word is set aside. Other subjects occupy
the mind. The study of infidel authors holds a large place in the educational
system. Skeptical sentiments are interwoven in the matter placed in school-
books. Scientific research becomes misleading, because its discoveries are
misinterpreted and perverted. The word of od is compared with the sup-
posed teachings of science, and is made to appear uncertain and untrustworthy.
Thus the seeds of doubt are planted in the minds of the youth, and in time
of temptation they spring up. When,faith in God's word is lost, the soul has
no guide, no safeguard. The youth are drawn into paths which lead away
from God and from everlasting life.
    "To this cause may in great degree be attributed the widespread iniquity
in our world today. When the word of God is set aside, its power to restrain
the evil passions of the natural heart is rejected. Men sow to the flesh, and
of the flesh they reap corruption."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 41.
    11. How does worldly wisdom appear in the sight of God? 1 Cor. 3:19.
    12. What are the characteristics of the wisdom from above? James
3:17.
                             In the Hereafter
   13. What indicates that in the new earth the saints will continue to
study the wisdom of God? Eph. 2:6, 7; 3:17-19.
   14. What are we told will be the occupation of the redeemed in the
heavenly land? Isa. 65:17-25.
                                 [ 23 )
    NOTE.—"There, immortal minds will contemplate with never-failing delight
the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love. There will be
no cruel, deceiving foe to tempt to forgetfulness of God. Every faculty will
be developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge will
not weary the mind or exhaust the energies. There the grandest enterprises
may be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the highest ambitions
realized; and still there will arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to
admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of
mind and soul and body."—"The Great Controversy," p. 677.

            The Home and Character Building
    MEMORY VERSE: "I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and
I will save thy children." Isa. 49:25, last part.
    STUDY HELP: "Ministry of Healing," pp. 350-354, 358.
    SEED THOUGHT: "It is by the youth and children of today that the future of
society is to be determined, and what these youth and children shall be depends upon
the home. To the lack of right home training may be traced the larger share of the
disease and misery and crime that curse humanity. If the home life were pure and
true, if the children who went forth from its care were prepared to meet life's responsi-
bilities and dangers, what a change would be seen in the worldl"—"Ministry of
Healing," p. 351.
                            Builders of Character
     1. What is the true foundation for character building? Deut. 4:5, 6;
Luke 10:27, 28.
     NOTE.—"In every generation and in every land the true foundation and
pattern for character building have been the same. The divine law, 'Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, . . . and thy neighbor as thyself,'
the great principle made manifest in the character and life of our Saviour, is
the only secure foundation and the only sure guide.. .
     "Here is the only safeguard for individual integrity, for the purity of the
home, the well-being of society,' or the stability of the nation. Amidst all
life's perplexities and dangers and conflicting claims, the one safe and sure
rule is to do what God says. The statutes of the Lord are right,' and 'he that
doeth these things shall never be moved.' "—"Education," pp. 228, 229.
     2. Where lies the responsibility for character formed in childhood?
Dent. 4:9; .6:20, 21.
     NoTE.—"Upon them [parents] depends in a great measure the well-being
of their children in this world, and their happiness in the world to come. To
a great extent they determine both the physical and the moral stamp that the
little ones receive. And upon the character of the home depends the condition
of society; the weight of each family's influence will tell in the upward or the
downward scale."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 357.
                                          24 )
    "Fathers and mothers should carefully and prayerfully study the characters
of their children. They should seek to repress and restrain those traits that
are too prominent, and to encourage others which may be deficient, thus
securing harmonious development. This is no light matter. The father may
not consider it a great sin to neglect the training of his children; but thus does
God regard it. Christian parents need a thorough conversion upon this subject.
Guilt is accumulating upon them, and the consequences of their actions reach
down from their own children to children's children. The ill-balanced mind,
the hasty temper, the fretfulness, envy, or jealousy, bear witness to parental
neglect. These evil traits of character bring great unhappiness to their pos-
sessors. How many fail to receive from companions and friends the love which
they might have, if they were more amiable. How many create trouble
wherever they go, and in whatever they are engaged !"—"Fundamentals of
Christian Education," pp. 66, 67.
    3. What is the promise to God-fearing parents? Isa. 49:25, last clause.
    NoTE.—"There is a God above, and the light and glory from His throne
rests upon the faithful mother as she tries to educate her children to resist the
influence of evil. No other work can equal hers in importance. She has not;
like the artist, to paint a form of beauty upon canvas, nor, like the sculptor,
to chisel it from marble. She has not, like the author, to embody a noble
thought in words of power, nor, like the musician, to express a beautiful
sentiment in melody. It is hers, with the help of God, to develop in a human
soul the likeness of the divine."—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 377, 378.
     4. What relationship exists between God, parents, and the child?
    ANSWER.—"Parents, in the training of your children, study the lessons
that God has given in nature. If you would train a pink, or rose, or lily, how
would you do it? Ask the gardener by what process he makes every branch
and leaf to flourish so beautifully, and to develop in symmetry and loveliness.
He. will tell you that it was by no rude touch, no violent effort; for this would
only break the delicate stems. It was by little attentions, often repeated. He
moistened the soil, and protected the growing plants from the fierce blasts
and from the scorching sun, and God caused them to flourish and to blossom
into loveliness. In dealing with your children, follow the method of the
gardener. By gentle touches, by loving ministrations, seek to fashion theit
characters after the pattern of the character of Christ.
    "Encourage the expression of love toward God and toward one another.
The reason why there are so many hardhearted men and women in the world
is that true affection has been regarded as weakness, and has been discouraged
and repressed. The better nature of these persons was stifled in childhood;
and unless the light of divine love shall melt away their cold selfishness, their
happiness will be forever ruined. If we wish our children to possess the tender
spirit of Jesus, and the sympathy that angels manifest for us, we must en-
courage the generous loving impulses of childhood."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 515, 516.
      The Purpose and Foundation of Character Building
   5. What is the supreme purpose to be sought in character building?
Prov. 6:20-22.
   NorE.—"The object of discipline is the training of the child for self-
government. He should be taught self-reliance and self-control. Therefore as
                                  [251
 soon as he is capable of understanding, his reason should be enlisted on the
side of obedience. Let all dealing with him be such as to show obedience to
 be just and reasonable. Help him to see that all things are under law, and
 that disobedience leads, in the end, to disaster and suffering. When God says
 `Thou shalt not,' He in love warns us of the consequences of disobedience, in
 order to save us from harm and loss."—"Education," p. 287.
     6. What is one of the first requisites of character building?
     ANSWER.—Obedience. Heb. 5:8; Eph. 6:1.
     NOTE. "One of the first lessons a child needs to learn is the lesson of
obedience. Before he is old enough to reason, he may be taught to obey. By
gentle, persistent effort, the habit should be established. Thus, to a great
degree, may be prevented those later conflicts between will and authority
that do so much to create alienation and bitterness toward parents and
teachers, and too often resistance of all authority, human and divine."—
"Education," p. 287.
     "Rules should be few and well considered; and when once made, they
should be enforced. Whatever it is found impossible to change, the mind learns
to recognize and adapt itself to; but the possibility of indulgence induces desire,
hope, and uncertainty, and the results are restlessness, irritability, and in-
subordination."—"Education," p. 290:
     7. Name another cardinal virtue that must be established in childhood.
     ANswER.—Faithfulness. Ps. 31:23; Matt. 25:21, 23 ; Rev. 2:10.
     NoTE.—"Only by faithfulness in the little things can the soul be trained to,
act with fidelity under larger responsibilities."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
p. 356.
     "Christ in His life on earth taught the lesson of careful attention to the
little things. The great work of redemption weighed continually upon His
soul. As He was teaching and healing, all the energies of mind and body were
taxed to the utmost ; yet He noticed the most simple things in life and in
nature. His most instructive lessons were those in which by the simple things
of nature He illustrated the great truths of the kingdom of God. He did not
overlook the necessities of the humblest of His servants. His ear heard every
cry of need. He was awake to the touch of the afflicted woman in the crowd;
the very slightest touch of faith brought a response. When He raised from
the dead the daughter of Jairus, He reminded her parents that she must have
something to eat. When by His own mighty power He rose from the tomb,
He did not disdain to fold and put carefully in the proper place the grave-
clothes in which He had been laid away."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp.
357, 358.
     8. Name a third virtue essential to firm and steadfast character.
     ANswER.—Honesty. Prov. 11:1; Rom. 12:17, last clause ; Phil. 4:8, first
three phrases.
     NOTE.—"It is neither the magnitude nor the seeming insignificance of a
business transaction that makes it fair or unfair, honest or dishonest. By the
least departure from rectitude we place ourselves on the enemy's ground, and
may go on, step by step, to any length of injustice. A large proportion of the
Christian world divorce religion from their business."—"Testimonies," vol. 4,
p. 337.
    "These truths are not for the closet more than for the counting room. The
goods that we handle are not our own, and never can this fact safely be
                                        [26
lost sight of. We are but stewards, and on the discharge of our obligation to
God and man depend both the welfare of our fellow beings and our own destiny
for this life and for the life to come."—"Education," p. 139.
                       Seeking for God's Approval
    9. According to what principles must this training be done? Ps. 24:3,
4; Rom. 12:21.
    10. 'What is the greatest joy possible to parents at the coming of our
Lord? Heb. 2:13.
    11. How should we labor toward this end?
    ANSWER.—In love, Jer. 31:3; in sacrifice, Matt. 13:45, 46; in ministry,
Matt. 20:28.
    NOTE.—"But when we give ourselves wholly to God, and in our work
follow His directions, He makes Himself responsible for its accomplishment.
He would not have us conjecture as to the success of our honest endeavors.
Not once should we even think of failure. We are to co-operate with One who
knows no failure."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 363.
    "There are fathers and mothers who long to labor in some foreign mission
field; there are many who are active in Christian work outside the home,
while their own children are strangers to the Saviour and His love. The work
of winning their children for Christ many parents trust to the minister or the
Sabbath school teacher; but in doing this they are neglecting their own God-
given responsibility. The education and training of their children to be Chris-
tians is the highest service that parents can render to God. It is a work that
demands patient labor, a lifelong diligent and persevering effort. By a
neglect of this trust we prove ourselves unfaithful stewards. No excuse for
such neglect will be accepted by God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 195

                    The Home a Soul Winner
    MEMORY VERSE: "She shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call His name
JESUS: for He shall save His people from their sins." Matt. 1:21.
    STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 429, 430; "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
pp. 142-144.
    SEED THOUGHT: "One great reason why there is so much evil in the world
today is that parents occupy their minds with other things to the exclusion of the
work that is all-important,—the task of patiently and kindly teaching their children
the way of the Lord. Parents should allow nothing to prevent them from giving to
their children all the time that is necessary to make them understand what it means
to obey and trust the Lord fully."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 129.

          Our Children's Salvation to Be on Our Hearts
   1. What is the desire of our Lord for all His earthly children? 2 Peter
3:9.
                                  [ 27 ]
    2. Why need we be specially concerned today about our children's
salvation? 2 Tim. 3:1-5; Rev. 12:12.
    NOTE.—"We are living in an unfortunate age for the young. The prevailing
influence in society is in favor of allowing the youth to follow the natural turn
of their own minds. If their children are very wild, parents flatter themselves
that when they are older and reason for themselves, they will leave off their
wrong habits, and become useful men and women. What a mistake h For years
they permit an enemy to sow the garden of the heart, and suffer wrong prin-
ciples to grow and strengthen seeming not to discern the hidden dangers and
the fearful ending of the path that seems to them the way of happiness. In
many cases all the labor afterward bestowed upon these youth will avail
nothing."—"Counsels to Teachers," pp. 325, 326.
                          Why Do Parents Fail?
     3. What is one reason for the failure of parents in training their.
children?
    ANswEn.—Parents are busy about many things and neglect to train their
children. (See 1 Kings 20:40.)
    NoTE.;—"The woman in the parable searches diligently for her lost coin.
She lights' the candle and sweeps the house. She removes everything that might
obstruct her search. Though only one piece is lost, she will not cease her efforts
until that piece, is found. So in the family, if one member is lost to God, every
means should be used for his recovery. On the part of all the others, let there
be diligent, careful self-examination. Let the life practice be investigated. See
if there is not some mistake, some error in management, by which that soul is
confirmed in impenitence.
    "If there is in the family one child who is unconscious of his sinful state,
parents should not rest. Let the candle be lighted. Search the word of God,
and by its light let everything in the home be diligently examined, to see why
this child is lost. Let parents search their own hearts, examine their habits and
practices. Children are the heritage of the Lord, and we are answerable to
Him for our management of His property."—"ChrisCs Object Lessons," pp.
194, 195.
     4. In what is our encouragement? Luke 15:110.
    NorE.—"But those who have been guilty of neglect, are not to despair.
The woman whose coin was lost searched until she found it. So in love, faith,
and prayer let parents work for their households, until with joy they can
come to God saying, 'Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given
me.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 195, 196.
    5. What is another reason for failure of parental training? Prov.
23:13, 14.
    NorE.—It is a great mistake to allow a child to grow to any age unrebuked.
Our 'negligence to control gives false ideas of authority. God requires of us
that we bring up our children to recognize and respect legitimate authority. So
they learn to acknowledge the authority of GOd and to yield to it with grateful
submission. Of course all correcting should be done in love.
    "Few parents begin early enough to teach their children to obey. The child
is usually allowed to get two or three years the start of its parents, who forbear
to discipline it, thinking it too young to learn to obey. But all this time self is
                                      [ 28 )
growing strong in the little being, and every day makes harder the parents'
task of gaining control. At a very early age children can comprehend what is
plainly and simply told them, and by kind and judicious management can be
taught to obey. Never should they be allowed to show their parents dis-
respect. Self-will should never be permitted to go unrebuked. The future
well-being of the child requires kindly, loving, but firm discipline."—"Counsels
to Teachers," pp. 111, 112.
                      The Only Safe Foundation
    6. How must parents build to ensure their children's standing firm?
Matt. 7:24-27.
    NorE.—"The question that should come home to each of us is, Upon what
foundation am I building? We have the privilege of striving for immortal life;
and it is of the greatest importance that we dig deep, removing all the rubbish,
and build on the solid rock, Christ Jesus. He is the sure foundation. 'Other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.' 1 Cor.
3:11. In Him alone is our salvation."—"Counsels to Teachers," pp. 61, 62.
    7. What is the only safe foundation? Acts 4:12.
    8. By what means only can success be attained in character building?
John 15:4, 5; Job 17:9.
    NorE.—In His word God has given us a wealth of material largely in the
form of examples of the right way, and dangers of the wrong Way. These
examples are for our education. On few topics have we been given more
instruction than upon homemaking and the training of our children for
eternity. Various precious lessons are given us in the books "Christ's Object
Lessons," "Ministry of Healing," "Patriarchs and Prophets," and "Education."
With these aids within our reach our duty to educate ourselves is-clear.
    9. What is necessary that our children be saved for God?
    ANswER.—"If more attention were given to teaching parents hdw to form
the habits and character of their children, a hundredfold more good would
result."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 352.
    "Never will education accomplish all that it might and should accomplish
until the importance of the parents' work is fully recognized, and they receive
a training for its sacred responsibilities."—"Education," p. 276.
    10. What is another cause of failure? Ps. 66: 1 8..
    NOTE.—When sin clogs the channel from the heart of God to the worker's
heart, the life-giving stream is cut off and we struggle on alone. This channel
must be cleared of obstacles so that the contact can be restored. "As activity
increases, and men become successful in doing any work for God, there is
danger of trusting to human plans and methods. There is a tendency to pray
less, and to have less faith. Like the disciples, we are in danger of losing sight
of our dependence on God, and seeking to make a savior of our activity.
We need to look constantly to Jesus, realizing that it is His power which does
 the work. While we are to labor earnestly for the salvation of the lost, we
 must also take time for meditation, for prayer, and for the study of the word
                                                                                4—

                 ists within its territory.

of God. Only the work accomplished with much prayer, and sanctified by the
merit of Christ, will in the end prove to have been efficient for good."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 363.
                          The Battle Is the Lord's
    11. Whose is the battle against the enemy of our children? 2 Chron.
20:15, last part.
    NOTE.—"The secret of success is the union of divine power with human
effort. Those who achieve the greatest results are those who rely most im-
plicitly upon the Almighty Arm."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 509.
    12. In seeking for victory, of what may we be assured? 1 Cor. 15:57;
1 John 5:4.

                          Our Father's Home
    MEMORY VERSE: "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have
told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you,
I will come again, and receive you unto Myself ; that where I am, there ye may be also."
John 14:1-3.
    STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 674-678.
    SEED THOUGHT: "From that scene of heavenly joy, there comes back to us
on earth the echo of Christ's own wonderful words, 'I ascend to My Father and
your Father; and to My God, and your God.' The family of heaven and the family
of earth are one. For us our Lord ascended, and for us He lives. 'Wherefore He
is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever
liveth to make intercession for them.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 835.

                             Heavenly Dwellings
    1. What does the Lord promise the redeemed? John 14:2, first clause;
Isa. 65:21, 22. "Mansions" in John 14:2 is rendered in many versions
"dwelling places."
    NoTE.-,-"There the Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and field."
—"Education," p. 303.
    2. How has our heavenly home been described? 1 Cor. 2:9; Rev. 21:1,
2, 23.
    3. What is the center of our heavenly dwelling place?
    ANSWER.—"The tabernacle of God." Rev. 21:3.

                                         [ 30 I
    NOTE.—"There the loves and sympathies that God has planted in the soul
will find truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy beings,
the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful ones
of all ages, the sacred fellowship that binds together 'the whole family in
heaven and earth,'—all are among the experiences of the hereafter."—"Educa-
tion," p. 306.
    6. What is the promise for the joy of music? Ps. 87:7; Isa. 51:3.
    7. How fully will the desire for wisdom and knowledge be satisfied?
    ANSWER.—"There every power will be developed, every capability in-
creased. The grandest enterprises will be carried forward, the loftiest aspira-
tions will be reached, the highest ambitions realized. And still there will arise
new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend,
fresh objects to call forth the powers of body and mind and soul.
    "All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God's
children. With unutterable delight we shall enter into the joy and the wisdom
of unfallen beings. We shall share the treasures gained through ages upon ages
spent in contemplation of God's handiwork. And the years of eternity, as they
roll, will continue to bring more glorious revelations. 'Exceeding abundantly
above all that we ask or think' will be, forever and forever, the impartation
of the gifts of God."—"Education," p. 307.

meled by the limitations of sinful humanity, it is in service that our greatest
joy and our highest education will be found;—witnessing, and ever as we
witness learning anew the riches of the glory of this mystery ;"which is Christ
in you, the hope of glory' "—"Education," p. 309.

    10. What is the crowning assurance? 1 John 3:2.
    NorE.—"We shall be like Him." Already transformed in character by the
movings of His blessed Spirit, we shall experience at Christ's return a trans-
formation affecting our bodies, making them like His glorious body. Then
will humanity be restored to the likeness of God, in whose image man was
created. In character, in physique, in mind and understanding he will "be
filled with all the fullness of God." Wonderful prospect! Worthy of our
greatest sacrifices, our most ardent love, our most faithful service.

Rev. 22:20.

          THE THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
    When we gave to the Far Eastern Division the first quarter of 1936, the
Thirteenth Sabbath offering amounted to $80,732.27, the overflow, $3,073.23.
We again gave to the Far East the second quarter of 1938, and the Thirteenth
Sabbath offering amounted to $83,302.08, the overflow being $6,660.42. Thus
almost $10,000 went to this needy mission field above their regular appropria-
tions. The overflow in 1938 helped to provide equipment in schools and hos-
pitals, establish small schools, purchase land in new centers; and now plans
have been laid for a clinic in French Indo-China.
    The gospel message is making progress in this division of our world work;
twenty-five years ago there were only 674 Seventh-day Adventists in this ter-
ritory, whereas today there are nearly 32,000. Through the help of our Sabbath
schools in all the world, we can extend the work still farther and finish the
task commissioned us. The Thirteenth Sabbath offering in March is to help
take the message of salvation to those who now wait. We therefore ask our
Sabbath school members to give liberally on the Thirteenth Sabbath.
