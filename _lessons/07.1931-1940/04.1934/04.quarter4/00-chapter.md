       Malayan and Philippine Island' Union Missions
   THE fields to which the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for De-
cember 29, 1934, will go, the Malayan and Philippine Island
Union Missions, are included within the dot-and-dash lines on
the map. Remember that when the Thirteenth Sabbath Offer-
ing reaches $60,000, $1,000 of the amount will be considered an
"overflow" to these two union mission fields. In addition, 10
per cent of the excess above $60,000 will be added to the over-
flow. Make your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering a liberal one
this last quarter of the year, that these needy mission fields may
have a generous overflow.
   The places indicated by the large black dots are the loca-
tions of enterprises helped by the Thirteenth Sabbath overflow
offerings of past years, a list of which follows :

                       INTRODUCTORY NOTE
    "With what wonder his amanuensis must have looked up, as the apostle
broke into this exquisite sonnet on love ! His radiant spirit had caught a glimpse
of the living Saviour. Jesus sits for His portrait in these glowing sentences, and
of Him every clause is true. Substitute His name for love throughout the chap-
ter, and say whether it is not an exact likeness. With Paul love stands for that
strong, sustained, and holy subordination of self for others, which begins in, will
and act and is afterward suffused by emotion, as a cloud lying in the pathway
of the rising sun. But if you want the divine love, you must get it after the
manner of the bay which opens its bosom to the incoming tide. God is love,
and if you would love, you must abide in Him and He in you... . Love is the
best of all, because it is eternal. All else will perish. Our highest attainments
will be as the babblings and playthings of childhood. But when we are in
touch with the reality of things, love will be all in all."—"Through the Bible
Day by Day," F. B. Meyer, vol. 6, pp. 123, 124.
    In this rather intensive study of this greatest of subjects,—a theme deeper
than faith, more transcendent than hope, more •excellent than all other graces
of the Holy Spirit's gift (1 Cor. 12: 31) ,—it is desired that the student may ob-
tain a richer experience in that love in which the apostle expresses the hope that
every believer may be "rooted and grounded" till each in God's time and at
His will may be "filled with all the fullness of God." Eph. 3:16-19. There is
room for deeper searching than is possible in these lessons to find that love
"which passeth knowledge." As each pupil searches, may the Son of Love; as
with the disciples on the road to Emmaus, walk beside him in the way and
make known to him that which is written concerning,Himself.
    NoTE.—In this series of studies on 1 Corinthians 13, the word "love" has
been substituted from the Revised Version in place of the word "charity" used
in the King James Version.

                           Love and Speech
   MEMORY VERSE: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal." 1,Cor. 13:1.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 1.

                                  The Lesson
                     IMPORTANCE OF RIGHT SPEECH
    1. What prayer is offered by the psalmist concerning the speech of his
lips? Ps. 141:3.
                                       [3]
    2. What counsel is given by the apostle James concerning hearing and
speaking? James 1:19.
    3. For what reason does the Saviour say we should watch our utter-
ances? Matt. 12:37.
    4. How did God reply to Job and his companions for their eloquent, but
misleading speeches? Job 38:1, 2.
    NOTE—Job, afflicted and suffering, had met the arguments and accusations
of his friends with an eloquent defense of his own life and position before God.
In chapters 38 to 41, God contrasts man's vanity in speech and knowledge with
His own power as Creator. In chapter 40 Job answers God in humility, saying,
"I am vile; what shall I answer Thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth."
In chapter 42, he replies to the Lord, "Therefore have I uttered that I under-
stood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. . . . I have heard
of Thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth Thee. Wherefore I
abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." Job's powerful replies to his
friends availed him nothing. His humble submission to God's revelation of his
foolishness in wasting words without knowledge brought the divine blessing of
God and the continued companionship and love of his friends.
    5. What may be the result of a godly walk and conversation? 1 Peter
2:12.
    NOTE.—Not a profession of godliness, but a straightforward course in life
speak's eloquently of our relation to Christ and may cause even our enemies
to glorify God.
                            THE SOURCE OF SPEECH
   6. What attitude is assumed by those who are careless of their utter-
ances? Ps. 12:4.
   7. What will God do to those who thus speak? Verse 3.
    8. Whence cometh.the speech of men? Luke 6:45.
    NoTE.—"Every seed sown produces a harvest of its kind. So it is in human
life. We all need to sow the seeds of compassion, sympathy, and love; for we
shall reap what we sow."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 84.
    The sowing of the lips, proceeding as it does from the abundance of the
heart, either tells for Christ and love, or for the enemy and self. Love speaks
more eloquently.bY acts than by words, yet words spoken from the heart and
accompanied by a life of love have unmeasured influence and power for good.
                  ELOQUENCE IN MAN AND NATURE
    9. With what eloquence does the natural world speak of God's love?
Ps. 19:1-3.
   NoTE.—All nature speaks silently of its Creator. The heavens above, the
earth beneath, and the waters under the earth are a comprehensive revelation
of His creative power, His sustaining hand, and His love. Their voice is heard

Sabbath School Lesson Quarterly, No. 158, October, 1934. 20c a year. Published in the
U. S. A. by Pacific Press Publishing Association (a corporation of S. D. A.), Moun-
tain View, California. Entered as second-class matter Oct. 13, 1904, at the post office
in Mountain View, Calif., under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1879. Acceptance
 for mailing at special rate of postage provided for in section 1103, Act of Oct. 3, 1917,
                              and authorized Sept. 18, 1918:
                                           [4)
in the rolling ocean waves, in the sighing night winds, in the whispered con-
verse of the leafy glade, in storm and in calm, in the delicate coursings of the
life-giving sap in the forest giant as in the microscopic development of the tiny
plantlet. The voice of nature may speak in the rumble of the quaking earth,
or the sudden, destructive eruption of a volcanic cone. There may be a vast
difference in the quality of the vocal tones, and the eloquence of the message
they bring to human hearts, but there is expressed therein a love beyond
human comprehension, a love in the mind of that Power which is behind the
speaking voice, which can bring help and healing to the souls of men.
    10. Upon what occasion did Paul seek by Well-planned argument to per-
suade men to accept Christ? What results followed? Acts 17:22-32.
    NoTE.—The eloquent appeal of the missionary apostle fell for the most part
upon deaf ears. Yet "his labors in Athens were not wholly in vain. Diony*is,
one of the most prominent citizens, and some others, accepted the gospel mes-
sage, and united themselves fully with the believers."—"The Acts of the Apos-
tles," p. 240. The fruitage, however, was comparatively meager, for the men
of Athens failed td'recognize the love of the Saviour.
    11. After his experience at Athens, what decision did Paul make con-
cerning his aims and objectives? 1 Cor. 2:1, 2; Gal. 6:14.
    NOTE.—"Viewing the wisdom of the world in the light of the cross, Paul
`determined not to know anything, . . save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.' "
—Id., pp. 127, 128.
    Paul had learned that eloquence or skill in debating over doctrine availed
 but little in.behalf of the cause of his Lord, and he recognized that only the
love expressed by the cross of Calvary could reach the hearts and transform
the fives of men.
                     SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE
   12. In what spirit should all public or private speech be made? Eph.
4:15, first clause.
    13. What reason does Christ give why men should believe Hii teachings?
John 14:10, 11.
   NOTE. "Believe Me for the very works' sake." The life of Christ, His
works of mercy and love done in behalf of needy men, were an evidence in
themselves which should have spoken more eloquently than speech.
    14. In what way did Christ exemplify His teaching and demonstrate
His love? What spirit should we cherish in following His example? 1 John
3:16.
    15. What contrast does the apostle show between eloquence and love?
1 Coi. 13:1.
   NorE.—Our speech may be fluent in the sight of men, our eloquence of utter-
ance may greatly impress them, our very prayers may make an impression upon
human listeners, but if we have not the love of God in the heart, they will not
reach the throne. Eloquence of speech either from• the pulpit, or in private
conversation, counts for nothing if -the loving spirit of our Master is not pres-
ent in the life of the one who utters the words. .
   "Many offer prayer in's, dry, sermonizing manner. These pray to men, not
to God. If they were praying to God, and really understood what they were
doing, they would be alarmed at their audacity; for they deliver a discourse
                                      [5 1
to the Lord in the mode of prayer, as though the Creator of the universe needed
special information upon general questions in relation to things transpiring in
the world. All such prayers are as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal."—

                 Love and the Prophetic Gift
  MEMORY VERSE: "Though I. have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; . . . and have not love, I am nothing." 1 Cor. 13:2.
  LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 2.

                                 The Lesson
                    SOURCE OF THE PROPHETIC GIFT
    1. Whence comes the gift of prophecy? Num. 12:6.
    2. Who then speaks through .the human agent? Ex. 4:11, 12.
    3. How did the Lord say He would make known His will to a prophet?
In what very personal and direct way did God speak to and through MoSes?
Num. 12:6-8.
    4. By what may we know that God has called an individual to prophesy?
Jer. 28:9; Num. 16:28-32. (See also Isa. 8:19 20; Matt. 7:16; 1 John 4:
1-4; Deut. 13:1-4.)
   NoTE.—Moses had through the years of Israel's sojourn in the wilderness
been God's spokesman, His prophet. In Israel's experience a time had come
when through the rebel  ion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, his, inspiration and
leadership were challenged. Under inspiration and direction of Heaven Moses
accepted the challenge and named the conditions of the test, the fulfillment of
the word he had received from God. "The eyes of all Israel were fixed upon
Moses, as they stood, in terror and expectation, awaiting the event. As he
ceased speaking, the solid earth parted, and. the rebels went down alive into
the pit, with all that pertained to them, and 'they perished from among the
congregation.' The people fled, self-condemned as partakers in the sin."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 400, 401.
                PROPHECY WITHOUT LOVE VALUELESS
   5. What experience,demonstrates that the prophetic word is not gov-
erned by the desires of the prophet? Num. 23:5, 12, 20, 26; 24:13.
   NoTs.—"Disappointed in his hopes of wealth and Promotion, in disfavor
with the king, and conscious that he had incurred the displeasure of God,
                                    r6)
Balaam returned from his self-chosen mission. After he had reached his home,
the controlling power of the Spirit of God left him, and his covetousness, which
had been merely held in check, prevailed. He was ready to resort to any means
to gain the reward promised by Balak. Balaam knew that the prosperity of
Israel depended updn their obedience to God, and that there was no way to
cause their overthrow but by seducing them into sin. He now decided to se-
cure Balak's favor by advising the Moabites of the course to be pursued to
bring a curse upon Israel:
    "In the war of Israel against the Midianites, Balaam was slain. He had felt
a presentiment that his own end was near when he exclaimed, 'Let me die the
death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.' But he had not chosen
to live the life of the righteous, and his destiny was fixed with the enemies of
God."—Id., pp. 451, 452.
               THE PLACE OF PROPHECY IN THE CHURCH
    6. In God's plans for His church, of what importance is prophecy?
Amos 3:7.
    NOTE.—God reveals to His servants those things which are to come. So
far as it is for , His children's 'good to know His purpose, He withholds no
knowledge. "Man cannot by searching find out God. Let none seek with pre-
sumptuous hand to lift the veil that conceals His glory. `Unsearchable are His
judgments, and His ways past finding out.' It is a proof of His mercy that
there is the hiding of His power; for to lift the veil that conceals 'the divine
presence is death. No mortal mind can penetrate the secrecy in which the
Mighty One dwells and works. Only that which He sees fit to reveal can we
comprehend of Him. Reason must acknowledge an authority superior to itself.
Heart and intellect must bow to the great I AM."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 285.
   7. Through what agency does God bestow the prophetic gift? 2 Peter
1:21.
   8. With whom are the secrets of the Lord? Prov. 3:.32; Matt. 13:11, 35.
      SEEK KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF MYSTERIES
    9. What deep spiritual mystery has it been given the saints to under-
stand? Col. 1:25-27.
    NOTE.—The mystery revealed to every saint of God is "Christ in you, the
hope of glory." As this mystery is revealed, Christ becomes a reality to the in-
dividual.
    "When we trust God fully, when we rely upon the merits of Jesus as a
sin-pardoning Saviour, we shall receive all the help that we can desire. Let
none look to self, as though they had power to save themselves. Jesus died for
us because we were helpless to do this. In Him is our hope, our justification,
our righteousness."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 431.
    "If we are Christ's, our sweetest thoughts will be of Him. We shall love
to talk of Him; and as we speak to one another of His love, our hearts will be
softened by 'divine influences. Beholding the beauty of His character, we
shall be 'changed into the same image from glory to glory.' "—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 83.
    10. What counsel does Solomon give to the youth? Prov. 2:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"The knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ expressed in character
is an exaltation above everything else that is esteemed on earth or in heaven.
                                       7
It is the very highest education. It is the key that opens the portals of the
heavenly city. This knowledge it is God's purpose that all who put on Christ
shall possess."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 457.
    11. How diligently should one seek for understanding of the word of
God? What is promised to those who strive earnestly to obtain wisdom?
Verses 3-6.
    12. Whence may wisdom and knowledge be obtained? Col. 2:3.
    13. To whom will wisdom be given? What will be the experience of one
in whom the word of God dwells? Col. 3:10, 16.
    NOTE.—"God is able and willing to bestow upon His servants all the
strength they need, and to give them the wisdom that their varied necessities
demand. He will more than fulfill the highest expectations of those who put
their trust in Him."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 242.
    14. Although prophecy, the understanding of the mysteries, and knowl-
edge are to be desired by the Christian, what surpasses them all? 1 Cor. 13 : 2.
    NOTE.—One may be endowed with many gifts, God's bounties and bless-
ings may have been richly bestowed in knowledge and understanding; and with
the ability to foretell future events; yet what are these without the spirit which
sent our Saviour to earth to die for men? God loved. Christ loved to the
end. Without this priceless gift and attribute of Christian life all else is nothing.

                             Faith and Love

and have not love, I am nothing." I Cor. 13:2, last part. '

                                  The Lesson
                 FAITH ESSENTIAL TO THE CHRISTIAN
    1. What does the apostle Paul say concerning faith? Heb. 11:1. ,
    Noti.—"Faith is trusting in God,—believing that He loves us, and knows
what is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to choose
His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of our
weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. • Our
lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges His ownership, and ac-
cepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, are pointed out as secrets of
life's success. It is faith that puts us in possession of these. Every good impulse
                                           i8 3
or aspiration is the gift of God; faith receives from God the life that alone can
produce true growth and efficiency."—"Gospel Workers," p. 259.
    2. What example of. the faith of a righteous man is given by the apostle
Paul? 2 Cor. 4:8, 9, 16-18.
    NOTE.—"In the religion of Christ there is a regenerating influence that
transforms the entire being, lifting men above every debasing, groveling vice,
and raising the thoughts and desires toward God and heaven. Linked to the
Infinite One, man is made partaker of the divine nature. Upon him the shafts
of evil have no effect; for he is clothed with the panoply of Christ's righteous-
ness."—"Counsels to Teachers," pp. 51, 52.
    3. What promise is made to the man whose faith lays hold on God?
Isa. 26:3.
    4. What must accompany true faith?. Ps. 78:7; James 2:21, 22.
    NOTE.—"They [the children of Israel] had not realized that their faith was
only a nominal faith, and had lost its power to prevail with God. The law of
God, contained in the ark, was also a symbol of His presence; but they had
cast contempt upon the commandments, had despised their requirements, and
had grieved the Spirit of the Lord from among than. . . . They looked to the
ark as the idolatrous nations looked to their gods, as if it possessed in itself the
elements of power and salvation. They transgressed the law it contained; for
their very worship of the ark led to formalism, hypocrisy, and idolatry. Their
sin had separated them from God, and He could not give them the victory
 until they had repented of and forsaken their iniquity."—"Patriarchs and
 Prophets," p. 584.
                         THE FRUITAGE OF FAITH
     5. By what means is peace brought to the human heart? Rom. 5:1;
Isa. 32:17.
     NOTE. "Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we can
find no rest. The masterful'passions of the heart no human power can con-
trol. We are as helpless here as were the disciples to quiet the raging storm.
But He who spoke peace to the billows-of Galilee, has spoken the word of
peace for every soul. However fierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus
with the cry, 'Lord, save us,' will find deliverance. His grace, that reconciles
the soul to God, quiets the strife of human passion, and in His love the heart
is at-rest."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 336, 337.
     6. By whose power does true, faith stand? 1 Cor. 2:5.
     7. Through whom does the gift of faith come? Eph. 2:8.
     NOTE.—"Bear in mind, the time will never come when the hellish shadow
of Satan will not be cast athwart our pathway to obstruct our faith. . . . Our
faith must not stagger, but cleave through that shadow. We have an experi-
ence that is not to be buried in the darkness of doubt. Our faith is not in feel-
ing, but in truth. The inspired apostle speaks of our being built upon the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
corner stone."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 387.
   •- 8. Of what should the man of faith not be guilty? James 2:1.
     NorE.—Should there be any difficulty in understanding this text, it may be
made plain by Moffett's`translation:
                                       [9]
    "My brothers, as you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Glory,
pay no servile.,regard to people." That is, do not neglect one and honor an-
other on account of the rich clothing of one and the poor garments of another,
as the three verses following point out.
    9. Upon whom is a blessing pronounced? To what is he compared?
Jer. 17:7, 8.
    NOTE.—"When the testing time shall come, those who have made God's
word their rule of life will be revealed. . . . The false-hearted professor may
not now be distinguished from the real Christian, but the time is just upon us
when the difference will be apparent. Let opposition arise, let bigotry and in-
tolerance again bear sway, let persecution be kindled, and the half-hearted
and hypocritical will waver and yield the faith; but the true Christian will
stand firm as a rock, his faith stronger, his hope brighter, than' in days of
prosperity."—"The Great Controversy," p. 602.
    10. What did Christ say had brought about the healing of a sorely af-
flicted woman? Matt. 9 : 22:
    11. 'What may one who rests his faith in God expect to receive? 1 Peter
1:7, 9.
    NOTE.—"God has always tried His,people in the furnace of affliction. It is
in the heat of the furnace that the dross is separated from the true gold of the
Christian character. Jesus watches the test ; He knows what is needed to purify
the precious metal, that it may reflect the radiance of His love. It is by close,
testing trials that God disciplines His servants."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 129.
   12. How much is possible to him who has faith? Mark 9:23.
   NOTE.—"Faith is an essential element of prevailing prayer. . . . With the
persevering faith of Jacob, with the unyielding persistence of Elijah, we may
present our petitions to the Father, claiming all that He has promised. The
honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His word."—"Prophets
and Kings," pp. 157,158.
                 VICTORY THROUGH FAITH WITH LOVE
    13. Through what attribute of Christian life is victory attained? 1 John
5:4, last part.
    NOTE.—"In life's. conflict, we must meet evil agencies that have arrayed
themselves against the right. Our hope is not in man, but in the living God.
With full assurance of faith, we may expect that He will unite His omnipotence
with the efforts of human instrumentalities, for the glory of His name. Clad
with the armor of His righteousness, we may gain the victory over every foe."
—Id., p. 111.
    "Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding
trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power."—"Gospel Workers,"
p. 261.
    14. After steadfastly maintaining his faith, what cry of victory did Paul
utter near the close of his life? 2 Tim. 4:7, 8..
   15. What assurance of eternal life did Christ giye to one who believes?
John 11:25-27.
                                  [ 10
    16. What statement concerning faith was made by the Saviour to His
disciples? Mark 11:23.
    17. How did the apostle Paul use a similar statement to emphasize the
need of love in Christian experience? 1 Cor. 13:2, last part.
    NOTE.—"Love, true love for our fellow men, evinces love to God. We may
make a high profession, yet without this love it is nothing. Our faith may lead
us to even give our bodies to be burned, yet without self-sacrificing love, such
as lived in the bosom of Jesus, and was exemplified in His life, we are as
sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 116.

                    Love and Christian Duty
   MEMORY VERSE: "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, . . . and
have not love, it profiteth me nothing." 1 Cor. 13:3.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 4.

                                The Lesson
                         IN BEHALF OF THE' NEEDY
   1. What instruction did our Saviour give to His disciples concerning
giving?. Matt. 5:42; 19:21.
   NOTE,—"Practical work will have far more effect than there sermonizing..
We are to give food to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and shelter to the
homeless. And we are called to do more than this, The wants of the soul, only
the love of Christ can satisfy. If Christ is abiding in us, our hearts will be full
of divine sympathy. The sealed fountains of earnest, Christlike love will be
unsealed."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 417.
    2. What attitude were His disciples to maintain toward earthly posses- ' •
sions? Where would their treasure be? What were they to seek? Luke 12:
33, 34, 31.
    3. Because the poor should never cease out of the land, what were the
children of Israel instructed to do for them? Deut. 15:7, 8, 11.
   NoTE.—"At times following the return of the exiles from Babylon, the
wealthy Jews had gone directly contrary to these' commands. When the poor
were obliged to borrow to pay tribute to the king, the wealthy had lent them
money, but had exacted a high rate of interest. By taking mortgages on the
lands of the poor, they had gradually reduced the unfortunate debtors to the
deepest poverty. Many had been forced to sell their sons and daughters into
                                    f11 ]
servitude; and there seemed no hope of improving their condition, no way to
redeem either their children or their lands, no prospect before them but ever-
increasing' distress, with perpetual want and bondage. Yet they were of the
same nation, children of the same covenant, as their more favored brethren."
—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 647,, 648.
    The instruction given of God to ancient Israel contains principles or truth
and equity that should be heeded by the church to-day. The man who has
love for God will not burden the lives of his brethren. He will seek to amel-
iorate the hardships, provide for the needs, and soften the blows that fall
upon the helpless and improvident.
    4. What were those who possessed this world's goods to practice in their
Christian living? 1 Tim. 6:17, 18.
    5. Even though the needy weie strangers, what attitude should Israel
take toward them? Lev. 25:35, 37.
    6. What experience should have made Israel sympathetic toward the
stranger? Ex. 23:9.
    NoTE.—Had Israel obeyed these injunctions and shown kindness toward
those not of their race and religion, their influence upon surrounding nations
would have been much wider and more effective. Likewise were every be-
liever to-day truly representative of the kindly, loving, long-suffering Man
of Calvary, the influence of the life would be beyond computation in drawing
men to Christ.
               THE MEASURE AND PURPOSE OF GIVING
    7. What commendation is given to one who gives even a cup of cold
water to another? Mark 9:41.
    8. In what spirit should all giving be done? Whom are we told God
loves? 2 Cor. 9:6, 7.
    9. For what purpose is no gift or liberality to be manifest? What as-
surance is given that the Father beholds our secret acts? Matt. 6:1-4.
    NoTE.—"Jesus had shown in what righteousness consists, and had pointed
to God as its source. Now He turned to practical duties. In almsgiving, in
prayer, in fasting, He said, let nothing be done to attract attention or win praise
to self. Give in sincerity, for the benefit of the suffering poor: In prayer, let
the soul commune with God. In fasting, go not with the head bowed down,
and heart filled with thoughts of self. . . . It is he who yields himself most
unreservedly to God that will render Him the most acceptable service. For
through fellowship with God men becpme workers together with Him in pre-
senting His character in humanity."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 312.
   10. For whom is every kindness and gift of love to others reckoned?
Matt. 25:35-40.
   11. Who is pleased with the sacrifices made in sharing our possessions
with others? Heb. 13:16.                      •
   12. What is an acceptable part of the fast God has chosen for His peo-
ple in the last days? Isa. 58:6, 7.
   13. What cannot be accepted in plaCe of definite help for those in need?
James 2:15, 16.
                                      1 12]
   NOTE.—"Divine truth exerts little influence upon the world, when it should
exert much influence through our practice. The mere profession of religion
abounds, but it has little weight. We may claim to be followers of Christ, we
may claim to believe every truth in the word of God; but this will do our
neighbor no good unless our belief is carried into our daily life. Our profession
may be as high as heaven, but it will save neither ourselves nor.our fellow men
unless we are Christians. A right example will do more to benefit the world
than all our profession."--"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 383.
           JUSTICE AND LOVE MUST ACCOMPANY GIVING
   14. Who does God say will surely live? Eze. 18:5, 7, 9.
   15. With what must our gifts to those in need always be accompanied to
be acceptable to the Lord? 1 Cor. 13:3.
   NorE.—It is love alone which draws man to Christ. It matters little what
may be the greatness of our gifts, of money, of ministry, of ourselves,—if the
gift carry not with it the love' of an overflowing heart, it is profitless to the
giver.
    "However wretched may be the specimens of humanity that men spurn
and turn aside from, they are not too low, too wretched, for the notice and
love of God. Christ longs to have care-worn, weary, oppressed human beings
come to Him. He longs to give them the light and joy and peace that..are to
be found nowhere else. The veriest sinners are the objects of His deep, earn-
est pity and love. He sends His Holy Spirit to yearn over them with tender-
ness, seeking to draw them to Himself."—Id., p. 226.

       Love With Long-suffering and Kindness
   MEMORY VERSE: "Though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it
profiteth me nothing. Love suffereth long, and is kind." 1 Cor. 13:3, 4.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 5.

                                 The Lesson
                      LONG-SUFFERING COUNSELED
    1. What did the apostle Paul endure that he might stand appro•'ed as
the minister of God? What qualities of heart and mind are included in this
list? 2 Cor. 6:4-6.
   2. In the ministry of God's word to the lost, what spirit is to be shown?
2 Tim. 4:2, last clause.
                                     ( 13
    3. 'What spirit should be shown by believers one to another? Whose
example do we thus follow? Col. 3:12, 13.
    NOTE.—"Cultivate the habit of speaking well of others. Dwell upon the
good qualities of those with whom you associate, and see as little as possible
of their errors and failings. When tempted to complain of what some one
has said or done, praise something in that person's life or character. Cultivate
thankfUlness. Praise God for His wonderful love in giving Christ to die for
us. It never pays to think of our grievances. God calls upon us to think of
His mercy and His matchless love, that we may be inspired with praise."—
"Gospel Workers," p. 479.
    4. What should accompany patience and long-suffering? Col. 1:11.
    NorE.—"If impatient words are spoken to you, never reply in the same
spirit. Remember that 'a soft answer turneth away wrath? And there is won-
derful power in silence. Words spoken in reply to one who is angry some-
times serve only to exasperate; but anger met with silence, in a tender, for-
bearing spirit, quickly dies away. Under a storm of stinging, faultfinding
words, keep the mind stayed upon the word of God. Let mind and heart be
stored with God's promises."—Id., pp. 475, 476.
    5. Of what is long-suffering the fruitage? Gal. 5:22.
                           THE LAW OF KINDNESS
    6. What statement shows the goodness of the Lord to the undeserving?
 Luke 6:35, last part.
     7. What should be the attitude of one who ministers to the weak and
erring? For what reason? Heb. 5:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"There is tactful work for the under shepherd to do as he is called
 to meet alienation, bitterness, envy, and jealousy in the church ; and he will
need to labor in the spirit of Christ to set things in order. Faithful warnings
are to be given, sins rebuked, wrongs made right, both by the minister's work
in the pulpit and by personal labor. The wayward heart may take exception
to the message, and the servant of God be misjudged and criticized. , Let him
then remember that 'the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peace-
able, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in
peace of them that make peace.' "—Id., pp. 185, 186.
    8. How should the Christian relate himself toward his neighbor? Rom.
15:1, 2, 5.
    9. What will be the reward of a merciful, kindly attitude? Matt. 5:7.
    10. How deep should the feeling of kindness go? Zech. 7:9, 10. -
    NOTE.—We have this comment on the text: "Rich were the rewards, both
temporal and spiritual, promised those who should put .into practice these
principles of righteousness.'!—"Prophets and Kings," p. 704. God blesses abun-
dantly the man or woman who manifests the spirit of love and kindness, who
does not judge his brother, but shows mercy and compassion toward all, es-
pecially to those in need or to those who suffer through the neglect of others.
For a time the one showing mercy, compassion, or true brotherly kindness
may apparently see little to reward his services of love. But God sees. He
dOes not forget, and to those who obediently carry out these principles in
their lives, sure rewards are promised.
                                      [14)
    11. What does the wise man say is one of the attributes of a true
woman? Prov. 31:26.
    12. What should be our attitude toward one who has been overtaken in
a fault? In bearing the burdens of others, whose law are we fulfilling?
Gal. 6:1, 2.
     13. With what should our love for the brethren be accompanied? 1 Pe-
ter 3:8.
     NOTE.—"Courtesy is one of the graces of the Spirit. To deal with human
minds is the greatest work ever given to man; and he who would find access
to hearts must heed the injunction, 'Be pitiful, be courteous.' Love will do
that which argument will fail to accomplish. But a moment's petulance, a
single gruff answer, a lack of Christian politeness and courtesy in some small
matter, may result in the loss of both friends and influence."—"Gospel Work-
ers," p. 121.
                        LOVE THE IMPELLING POWER
     14. What is essential to true kindness even among brethren? 2 Peter 1 :7.
     15. In our relations with others, what alone demonstrates that this love
dwells in us? 1 John 3:17.
     No-rE.—"In placing among them the helpless and the poor, to be dependent
upon their care, Christ tests His professed followers. By our love and service
 for His needy children we prove the genuineness of our love for Him. To neg-
 lect them is to declare ourselves false disciples, strangers to Christ and His
love."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 205.
     16. How did the Saviour exemplify this spirit in His sacrifice on C 1-
 vary? Luke 23:34.
      NOTE.—"The Son of God is Himself the great intercessor in the sinner's
 behalf. He who has paid the price for its redemption knows the worth of the
 human soul. With an antagonism to evil such as can exist only in a nature
 spotlessly pure, Christ manifested toward the sinner a love which infinite good-
 ness alone could conceive. In the agonies of the crucifixion, Himself burdened
 with the awful weight of the sins of the whole world, He prayed for His re-
 vilers and murderers, 'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.' "
  —"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 140. In the same loving spirit of forgiveness,
 Stephen, under the stoning of his enemies, cried, "Lord, lay not this sin to
 their charge." This spirit of love and long-suffering must dominate Christ's
  followers. No spirit of revenge, no reaction of hatred—only pity, kindness,
 long-suffering—can be permitted in the life of the Christian.
      17. Though the surrender of the life to Christ seems to be complete,
 what alone reveals it to be genuine, and therefore acceptable to God? 1 Cor.
  13:3, 4.
      NorE.—It is possible to suffer, even to die without complaint upon our lips,-
  and still fall far short of the ideals of God and our Saviour. Though we give
  our all and pass away in physical and mental agony, and yet carry with us
  a bitter hatred for those who made us suffer, it will be unavailing, for only
  those who hive are Christlike. "Love your enemies, , bless them that curse
  you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
  you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is
  in heaven." Matt. 5:44, 45. "Love suffereth long, and is kind" is closely akin
  to "His compassions" that "fail not." Lam. 3:22. •

                     Love and Our Neighbor
   MEMORY VERSE: "Love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh
no evil." 1 Cor. 13:4, 5.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 6.

                                   The Lesson
                               THE SIN OF ENVY
    1. In what spiritual condition did the psalmist at one time find himself?
What caused his backsliding? What did he say further of his experience?
What did God make known to him that changed his heart? Ps. 73:2, 3, 12-
14, 17, 18.
    NOTE.—The psalmist was envious of the temporal prosperity of the worldly,
pleasure-seeking men all about him, just as so many to-day stand covetously
looking upon their neighbor's abundance. To the psalmist God gave a vision
of the latter end of the transgressor, who, though he might apparently pros-
per in this world, could not hope to escape the penalty of his pleasure seek-
ing, of his grasping selfishness, or of his flaunting disregard of the claims of
the needy, or those to whom he might have given temporal or spiritual com-
fort. Far more to be desired is poverty with righteousness than abundance
with no future hope. This the psalmist finally realized.
    2. Of whom should we never be envious? To whom is the wayward man
an abomination? Prov. 3:31,. 32.
     3. What accompanies envy? James 3:14-16.
     4. With what vicious sins does the apostle Paul associate envy? Rom.
1 : 29, 30.
                        "FRET NOT;" "GRUDGE NOT"
 • 5. Against what other evil does the psalmist warn us? What does he
counsel us to do? Ps. 37:1, 7.
    6. What reason does the apostle James give for not grudging? James
5:9.
   NOTE.—The meaning of "grudge" is to grumble, begrudge, or to envy, and
also "to be loath to give, or to give with reluctance."—Webster. To envy
others, to begrudge them what is theirs, is but to condemn ourselves. To al-
low this evil spirit to take possession of our hearts would be to bring condem-
nation from the Judge who "standeth before the door."
   7. Why cannot envy enter a heart that loves? 1 Cor. 13:4;second clause.
                                       [ 163
                   PRIDE AND LOVE ARE STRANGERS
    8. From the example of Israel, what may we learn concerning the dan-
ger facing God's children in prosperity? If God be forgotten and pride
enter, what is inevitable? Deut. 8:11-14, 17-20.
    9. How does God regard the proud heart? Ps. 101:5, last part.
    NOTE.—"It is God who gives men power to get wealth k and in the hands
of him who acts as God's steward, using his means unselfishly, wealth is a
blessing, both to its possessor and to the world. But many, absorbed in their
interest in worldly treasures, become insensible to the claims of God and the
needs of their fellow men. They regard their wealth as a means of glorifying
themselves. They add house to house, and land to land; they fill their homes
with luxuries, while all about them are human beings in misery and crime, in
disease and death. Those who thus give their lives to self-serving are develop-
ing in themselves, not the attributes of God, but the attributes of the wicked
one."—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 212, 213.
    10. What brought about the downfall of Lucifer? Isa. 14:12-16.
    11. With what sins of the last days is pride associated? 2 Tim. 3:2.
    12. What manifestations of pride did Jesus note? What opposite course
did Christ counsel for His disciples? Matt. 23:5-12.
    13. Why cannot love commingle with pride? 1 Cor. 13:4, last part.
    NOTE.—"Whenever pride and ambition are indulged, the life is marred;
for pride, feeling no need,, closes the heart against the infinite blessings of
Heaven. He who makes self-glorification his aim will find himself destitute
of the grace of God, through whose efficiency the truest riches and the most
satisfying joys are won. But he who gives all and does all for Christ will know
the fulfillment of the promise, "The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and
He addeth no sorrow with it." With the gentle touch of grace, the Saviour
banishes from the soul unrest and unholy ambition, changing enmity to love,
and unbelief to confidence. When He speaks to the soul, saying, 'Follow Me,'
the spell of the world's enchantment is broken. At the sound of His voice, the
spirit of greed and ambition flees from the heart, and men arise, emancipated,
to follow Him."—"Prophets. and Kings," p. 60.
                        SELF-SEEKING AND ANGER
    14. What should be the Christian's attitude toward others? Rom. 12:10.
    15. What counsel are God's children given concerning self-control?
Eph. 4:31, 32; James 1:19, 20.
    NOTE.—"Let Christ, the divine Life, dwell in you, and through you reveal
the heaven-born love that will inspire hope in the hopeless, and bring heaven's
peace to the sin-stricken heart. As we come to God, this is the condition
which meets us at the threshold, that, receiving mercy from Him, we yield
ourselves to reveal His grace to others."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 167.
    16. What natural traits of character will not therefore be seen in the
life of one who loves God? 1 Cor. 13:4, 5, first part.
    NOTE.—Love, through • Christ's dwelling in the heart, will manifest itself
in every attribute of life. Envy cannot abide where Christ reigns supreme.
Pride is utterly absent from the life of the surrendered Christian, and with
Paul he will exclaim, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
                                     [ 17 )
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world." Gal. 6:14. If we follow "in His steps," our conversation and our ex-
ample will be such as will cause us to "lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty." 1 Tim. 2:2. Such is the influence of Christ's love upon
the heart of His followers.

               Love and the Thought of Evil
   MEMORY VERSE: Love "thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoic-
eth in the truth." 1 Cor. 13:5, 6.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 7.

                                 The Lesson
                           AS A MAN THIN-KETH
    1. What naturally follows the thought of ' the heart? Prov. 23:7, first
part.
    NoTE.—"As man `thinketh in his heart, so is he.' The heart must be re-
newed by divine grace, or it will be in vain to seek for purity of life. He who
attempts to build up a noble,' virtuous character independent of the grace of
Christ, is building his house upon the shifting sand. In the fierce storms of
temptation it will surely be overthrown. David's prayer should be the peti-
tion of every soul: 'Create in me a clean heart, 0 God; and renew a right spirit
within me.' And having beconie partakers of the heavenly gift, we are to go
on unto perfection, being 'kept by the power of God through faith.' "—"Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," p. 460.
    "As a man `thinketh in his heart, so is he;' for 'out of it are the issues of
life.' What a man is, in the most secret desires and purposes of his soul, that is
his character and life. record in the sight of Heaven. 'The Lord seeth not as
man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh
on the heart.' "—"Mount of Blessing," p. 86, old edition.
    2. What is one reason for our being lenient with those in fault? Eccl.
7:22.
    3. What is revealed Concerning the natural tendencies of man? Job 15:
16; Ps. 41:6.          ,
    4. What is the attitude of heaven toward iniquity? Heb. 1:8, 9.
    NOTE.—"He [God] hates sin, but He loves the sinner, and He gave Him-
self in the person of Christ, that all who would, might be saved, and have

eternal blessedness in the kingdom of glory. What stronger or more tender
language could have been employed than he has chosen in which to express His
love toward us? He declares, 'Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she
should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,
yet will I not forget thee.' Isa. 49:15."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 59, 60.
                         LOVERS OF TRUTH
   5. What does God desire should be in the hearts of His children? Pt.
51:6, first part.
   6. Upon what are we admonished to think? Phil. 4:8. Answer—"What-
soever things are true."
    7. Whom did John say the world .beheld dwelling among them? With
what was He filled? John 1:14.
    NOTE.—"John had begun to discern the glory of Christ,—not the worldly
pomp and power for which he had been taught to hope, but 'the glory as of
the only-begotten of the Father, full of, grace and truth.' The depth and fervor
of John's affection for his Master was not the cause of Christ's love for him,
but the effect Of that love. John desired to become like Jesus; and under the
transforming influence of the love of Christ, he did become meek and lowly.
Self was hid in Jesus. Above all his companions, John yielded himself to the
power of that wondrous life. He says, 'The life was manifested, and we have
seen it.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 544.
    Like John, the follower of Christ must see in Jesus the one altogether
lovely, full of grace and truth, the center of his affection. Christ so revealed
will be seen in our lives, and we in turn will have a "saving, transforming in-
fluence upon the lives of others.'.'
    8. What does Jesus declare Himself to be? John 14:6.
                 UNITED TO CHRIST BY LOVE OP TRUTH
    9. If we regard iniquity in our hearts, from whom are we separated?
Ps. 66:18.
    NOTE .—"Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. The eye
of faith will discern God very near, and the suppliant may obtain precious
evidence of the divine love and care for him. But why is it that so many
prayers are never answered? Says David, 'I cried unto the Lord with my
mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue. If I regard iniquity in 'my heart,
the Lord will not hear me.' By another prophet, the Lord gives us the prom-
ise, 'Ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with. all your
heart.' Again, He speaks of some who 'have-not cried unto Me with their
heart.' Such petitions are prayers of form, lip service only, which the Lord
does not accept."-7"Testimonies," vol. 4, pp. 533, 534.
    10. Who only will be able to dwell in God's holy hill? Ps. 15:1-3.
   Nom.—One who "speaketh the truth in his heart" is not a "man of pre-
tenses; speaking one thing, and meaning another. He professes nothing but
what' he feels and intends ;—with him there are no hollow friendships, vain
compliments, nor empty professions of esteem, love, regard, or friendship. His
mouth speaks nothing but what his heart dictates. His heart, his tongue, and
his hand, are all in unison. Hypocrisy,'guile, and deceit, have no place. in his
soul."—Adam Clarke.
                                     [ 19 3
    11. How alone can one who, has indulged in evil thoughts find pardon?
Isa. 55:7.
    12. What will the Lord do for such a one? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—"The only power that can create or perpetuate true peace is the
grace of Christ. When this is implanted in the heart, it will cast out the evil
passions that cause strife and dissension. 'Instead of the thorn shall come up
the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree;' and life's
desert 'shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.' "--"The Desire of Ages," p. 305.
    The transforming influence of Jesus Christ upon the lives of men and
women sunk in the depths of sin and heathen superstition has been amply
demonstrated in modern missions. In Africa, in China, in India, in the islands
of the sea, His Spirit has changed robbers into soul winners, blood-thirsty
cannibals into peace-loving people, drunken debauchees into sober Christian
leaders, examples of transforming grace, while drawing from the depths of
superstition and darkness tens of thousands whose lives have been illuminated
by grace and given a fadeless hope of eternal life. To the prophet it was as the
transformation of a thorn into a fir tree and of a brier into• a myrtle tree.
These transformations are to God "for a name, for an everlasting sign that
shall not be cut off."
    13. If we love God with all the heart, whom also will we love,? 1 John
4:20, 21.
    14. What, therefore, will be our attitude toward those we love? 1 Cor.
13:5, 6.
   NOTE.—The- spirit of. love cherishes no evil thought against another ; that
spirit in pity and true sympathy seeks to lift the guilty to new heights in
Christ; it develops the truest and best in individual life and character. Such
was the Christ. Such is true love.

         Love the Companion of Patience and
                    Perseverance
    MEMORY VERSE: "Love . . . beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth
all things, endureth all things." 1 Cor. 13:7.
    LESSON HELP: "God's Gieatest Gift," chapter 8.

                                The Lesson
                    LOVE BEARETH AND ENDURETH
   1. What counsel does the Lord give concerning the Christiaa's endur-
ing hardness?- 2 Tim. 2:3.
                                ('20 .)
   2. What is one necessary qualification of God's servants? 2 Tim. 4:5.
Answer—"Endure afflictIons."
    3. Although the servant of Christ may sometimes fall into discourage-
ment, what hopeless condition cannot be his? Why? Ps. 37:24.
    4. What alone can destroy the steadfastness of the Christian? 2 Peter
3:17.
    NOTE.—"The Saviour had not come to set aside what patriarchs and proph-
ets had spoken; for He Himself had spoken through these representative men.
All the truths of God's word came from Him. But these priceless gems had
been placed in false settings. Their precious light had been made to minister
to error. God desired them to be removed from their settings of error and
replaced in the framework of truth. This work only a divine hand could ac-
complish. By its connection with error, the truth had been serving the cause
of the enemy of God and man. Christ had come to place it where it would
glorify God, and work the salvation of humanity."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 287, 288.
    The warning of the apostle to the church to beware lest they be "led away
with the error of the wicked," is timely for the church to-day. As in Christ's
day the tendency in the church to-day is to mix error, the false philosophies
of men, with sacred truth ; to destroy not by direct attack but by compromis-
ing with the thought of evil, by specious reasoning that glosses over unright-
eousness and destroys the high standards of Christian teaching and practice.
    5. What trying experiences does the apostle Paul mention as not being
sufficient to separate us from the love of Christ? Of what was he fully per-
suaded? Rom. 8:35-39.
    NOTE.—"Though now He has ascended to the presence of God, and shares
the throne of the universe, Jesus has lost none of His compassionate nature.
To-day the same tender, sympathizing heart is open to all the Woes of hu-
manity. To-day the hand that was pierced is reached forth to bless more
abundantly His people that are in the world. 'And they shall never perish;
neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.' The soul that has given
himself to Christ is more precious in His sight than the whole world. The
Saviour would have passed through the agony of Calvary, that one might be
saved in His kingdom. He will never abandon one for whom He has died.
Unless His followers choose to leave Him, He will hold them fast. Through all
our trials we have a never-failing Helper. He does not leave us alone to
struggle with temptation, to battle with evil, and be finally crushed with bur-
dens and sorrow."—Id., pp. 480, 481.
    6. What is reserved for those who are faithful? HA. 11:39, 40.
    7. What should the loyalty of those of old encourage us to do? In so
doing, whose example do we follow? Heb. 12:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Love for souls for whom Christ died, means crucifixion of self.
He who is a child of God should henceforth look upon himself as a link in the
chain let down to save the world, one with Christ in His plan of mercy, going
forth with Him to seek and save the lost. The Christian is ever to realize that
he has consecrated himself to God, and that in character he is to reveal Christ
to the world. The self-sacrifice, the sympathy, the love, manifested in the
life of Christ, are to reappear in the life of the worker for God. . . .
                                      [21 1
   "Beyond the poverty and humiliation of the present, He pointed the dis-
ciples to His coming in glory, not •in the splendor of an earthly throne, but
with the glory of God and the hosts of heaven."—Id., p. 417.
      8. Who will be saved? Matt. 24:13.
      9. How is this promise of salvation stated by the revelator? Rev. 2:
10, last part.
      NoTE.—"The seasori of distress before God's people will call for a faith
  that will not falter. His children must make it manifest that He is the only
  object of their worship, and that no consideration, not'even that of life itself,
  can induce them to make the least concession to false worship. To the loyal
  heart the commands of sinful, finite men will sink into insignificance beside
  the word of the eternal God. Truth will be obeyed though the result be im-
  prisonment or exile or death... . .
      "He who walked with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery furnace will be
  with His followers wherever they are. His abiding presence will comfort and
  sustain. In the midst of the time of trouble,—trouble such as has not been
  since there was a nation,—His chosen ones will stand unmoved."—"Prophets
  and Kings," pp. 512, 513.
                                 LOVE BELIEVETH
       10. When in danger of discouragement, to whom did the psalmist turn?
  Ps. 42:11.
      NOTE.—"Nothing more quickly inspires faith than the exercise of faith."—
  Id., p. 351. Speaking of the experience of Elijah at Carmel, the same volume,
  page 157, says, "Faith such as this is needed in the world to-day,—faith that
  will lay hold on the promises of God's word, and refuse to let go until Heaven
  hears. Faith such as this connects us closely with Heaven, and brings us
  strength for coping with the powers of darkness. . . . And through faith
  we to-day are to reach the heights of God's purpose for us."
       11. Wliat attribute must each Christian possess that he may please
  God? Heb. 11:6.
       12. How much is possible to him who truly believes? Mark 9:23.
       NOTE.—"Another element of prevailing prayer is faith. . . . The assur-
  ance is broad and unlimited, and He is faithful who has promised. When we
  do not receive the very things we ask for, at the time we ask, we are still to
  believe that the Lord hears, and that He will answer our prayers. We are so
   erring and shortsighted that we sometimes ask for things that would not be
  a blessing to us, and our heavenly Father in love answers our prayers by
  giving us that which will be for our highest good."—"Steps to Christ," p. 100.
       13. What is the sustaining power in the lives of the just and true?
   Rom. 1:17.
       NOTE.—"A living faith like threads of gold should run through the daily
   experience in the performance of little duties. . . . Then all the daily work
   will be of such .a character as to promote Christian growth. Then the vital
  vrinciples of faith, trust, and•love for Jesus will penetrate into the most minute
',details of daily life. • There will be a: looking unto Jesus, and love for Him will
 ,be the continual motive, giving vital force to every duty that is undertaken.
 - There will be a striving after righteousness, a hope that `maketh not ashamed.'
  Whatever is done will .be' done to the glory of God."—"Testimonies," vol. 6,
   p. 1-71.      -     •

                                 LOVE HOPETH
    14. What was Job's attitude in God's dealings with Him? Job 13:15.
    15. When Paul's long conflict in service for Christ was near its end, of
what was he supremely confident? 2 Tim. 4:7, 8.
    Norn.—"Ransonied by the sacrifice of Christ, washed from sin in His
blood, and clothed in His righteousness, Paul has the witness in himself that
his soul is precious in the sight of his Redeemer. His life is hid with Christ
in God, and he is persuaded that He who has conquered death is able to keep
that which is committed to His trust. Ylis mind grasps the Saviour's promise,
`I will raise him up at the last day.' His thoughts and hopes are centered on
the second coming of his Lord. And as the sword of the executioner descends,
and the shadows of death gather about the martyr, his latest thought springs
forward, as will his earliest in the great awakening, to meet the Life-giver,
who shall welcome him to the joy of the blest."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
pp. 512, 513.
    16. What, then, may the world expect of every Christian who has
Christ's spirit of love in the heart? 1 Cor. 13:4, 7.
    NOTE.-If love abide in the heart of the follower of Christ, forbearance
will be an attribute of the soul. If love is an indwelling presence, its pos-
sessor will see the good, the spark of divine fire, in every heart, and will seek
to fan it into flame. If love be the glass through which our eyes behold, hope
will spring anew from•every cheerless prospect and after every crushing blow.
Yea, if love supreme, Christlike, be the current that revivifies our beings, no
torture of human devising, no conflict that may rage within or without, can
eradicate its holding power—it will endure as seeing Him, who to others, is
invisible, for love endures.

                             Unfailing Love
   MEMORY VERSE: "Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecics, they
shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it
shall vanish away." 1 Cor. 13:8.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 9.

                                   The . Lesson.
                        THE BOND OF PERFECTNESS
   1. What did the apostle Paul expressly desire for both himself and the
believers? 1 Thess. 3:12.
                                        [ 23 )
    2. After an experience or repentance and revival, in what graces did
the church at Corinth abound? What wish did Paul express concerning
another grace? To whose example did he refer? 2 Cor. 8:7, 9.
    NorE.—"You know the height from which He [Christ] stooped, the depth
of humiliation to which He descended. His feet entered upon the path of
sacrifice, and turned not aside until He had given His life. There was no rest
for Him between the throne in heaven and the cross. His love for man led
Him to welcome every indignity, and suffer every abuse. . .
    "In the life of Christ, everything was made subordinate to His work, the
great work of redemption which He came to accomplish. And the same de-
votion, the same self-denial and sacrifice, the same subjection to the claims
of the word of God, is to be manifest in His disciples."—"Ministry of Heal-
ing," pp. 501, 502.
    3. What did Paul say is the bond of perfection? Col. 3:14.
   4. What other attributes are coupled with love? Verses 12, 13.
   5. How would men recognize the spirit of love in the lives of the disci-
ples? John 13:34, 35.
                      LOVE EVER SERVES
     6. In what manner did Christ manifest His love in the upper chamber?
Verses 14, 15.
    NOTE.—Christ taught His disciples in the service of .humility the lesson of
humble, loving ministry. It was the duty of one of their number to wash the
dusty feet of his fellows before partaking of the evening meal. Instead, pride
filled their hearts. Each was waiting for some other to perform this humble
service. But no one moved. All were seemingly unconcerned. Before this
hour of the Passover supper they had been contending among themselves as
to who should be greatest. Under these conditions the Saviour instituted the
service of humility, a continuous reminder that we should, like Him, be will-
ing to serve others under any conditions, and in any manner, if by this means
we might win them as followers of our Lord.
     7. How does unfailing love express itself toward God and man? Matt.
25:34-40.
     NOTE.—"Those whom Christ commends in the judgment, may have known
little of theology, but they have cherished His principles. Through the influ-
ence of the divine Spirit they have been a blessing to those about them. . . .
     "His [Christ's] followers are not to feel themselves detached from the
perishing world around them. They are a part of the great web of humanity;
and Heaven looks upon them as brothers to sinners as well as to saints. The
fallen, the erring, and the sinful, Christ's love embraces; and every deed of
kindness done to uplift a fallen soul, every act of mercy, is accepted as done
to Him."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 638.
    8. How had 'the believers in Paul's day given evidence'of having found
salvation? Heb. 6:9, 10.
    9. What does the apostle admonish the Hebrews to continue? What
classes of service does he particularly mention? Heb.
    10. What is the end or object of the commands of God? 1 Trin. 1:5.
                                    [ 24')
   NOTE.—"Ten precepts, brief, comprehensive, and authoritative, cover the
duty of man to God and to his fellow man; and all based upon the great
fundamental principle of love. 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.' In the Ten Commandments these princi-
ples are carried out in detail, and made applicable to the condition and cir-
cumstances of man."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 305.
   The end of the law—its objective—its goal—is to restore love between God
and man and between man and his fellow• man. Without an acceptance of
thege principles and the practice of them in the life, love is impossible.
                     THE FORBEARANCE OF LOVE
     11. How may we fulfill the law of Christ? Gal. 6:1, 2.
    12. How will this spirit manifest itself among the brethren? Eph. 4:
1f 2, 32.
    13. To whom especially should the spirit of loving ministry be mani-
fested? Gal: 6:10.
    NOTE.—"In a special sense, Christ has laid upon His church the duty of
caring for the needy among its own members. He suffers His poor to be in
the borders of .every church. They are always to be among us, and He places
upon the members of the church a personal responsibility to care for them."—
"Ministry of Healing," p. 201.                                   -
                          LOVE NEVER FAILETH
   14. If we follow, Christ's example, how long will this spirit of self-
sacrificing love continue? John 13:1.
    15. Though all else should fail,.what will endure eternally? 1 Cor. 13:8.
    NorE.—Men may fail,—their plans, their prophecies, their wisdom, even
their regard for one another. God's love is stronger than the strongest known
human tie. Christ's love led Him to give HiMself to death for man. That love
imparted to His followers will give them also a love that "never faileth" in
its attitude toward the Giver, toward God's own, and toward our enemies.
Matt. 5:44, 48. God's love never fails.
    "Love 'never faileth.'. It can never lose its value; it is the attribute of
Heaven. As a precious treasure, it will be carried by its possessor through
the portals, of the city of God. . . Let each ask himself: Do I possess the
grace of love? Have I learned to suffer long, and to be kind? Talents, learn-
ing, and eloquence, without this heavenly attribute, will be as meaningless as
§ounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. Alas that this precious treasure is so
lightly valued and so little sought by many who profess the faith !"—"Testi-
monies," vol. 5, p. 169.

        From Christian Childhood to Christian
                      Manhood
  MEIV,ORY VERSE: "The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day." Prov. 4:18.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 10.

                                The Lesson
                    THE BIRTH OF THE CHRISTIAN
    1. What -experience must come to every man who becomes a Christian?
John 3:3.
    2. Through what agency does this experience come? Verses 5, 8.
  • NOTE.—"While the wind is itself invisible, it produces effects that are seen
and felt: So the work of the Spirit upon the soul will reveal itself in every
act of him who has felt its saving power.' When the Spirit of God takes pos-
session of the heart, it transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil
deeds are renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy,
and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness, and the countenance reflects the
light of heaven. No one sees the hand that lifts the burden, or beholds the
light descend from the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the
soul surrenders itself to God. .Then that power which no human eye can see,
creates a new being in the image of God."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 172, 173.
    3. How does Christ again speak of the spiritual birth? What will be
the result of failus:e in this experience? Matt. 18:3; Mark 10:15.
     4. What lesson of humility in Christian living did Christ teach through,
a little child? Luke 9:46-48.
    NoTE.—"It was not enough for the disciples of Jesus to be instructed as
to the nature of His kingdom. What they needed was a change of heart that
would bring them into harmony with its principles. Calling a little child to
Him Jesus set him in the midst of them; then tenderly folding the little one
in His arms He said, 'Except ye be converted, and become as little children,
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.' The simplicity, the self-forget-
fulness, and the confiding love of a little child are the attributes that Heaven
values. These are the characteristics of real greatness."—Id., p. 437.
   5. What will the newly born child of God desire? For what purpose?
1 Peter 2:2.
                                     ( 26 )
    6. What ordinance indicates to the world that one has been "born
again"? Rom. 6:3-5.
    NOTE.—"Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who
are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the'Holy Spirit,
at the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have
forsaken the service of Satan, and have become members of the royal family,
children of the heavenly King."—"Testintonies," vol. 6, p. 91.
                          THE GROWING CHILD
   7. As the Christian develops, what change of spiritual food is sug-
gested as desirable? 1 Cor. 3:2.
   8. What condition and need may develop even with one who is an
older Christian? Heb. 5:12-14.
     9. What should be the natural development of the Christian convert?
Prov. 4:18.
     NOTE.—"Many who are already members of God's great- family know
little of what it means to behold His glory, and to be changed from glory to
glory. Many have a twilight perception of Christ's excellence, and their hearts
thrill with joy. They long for a fuller, deeper sense of the Saviour's love. Let
these cherish every desire of the soul after God. The Holy Spirit works with
those who will be worked, molds those who will be molded, fashions those
who will be fashioned. Give yourselves the culture of spiritual thoughts and
holy communings. You have seen but the first rays of the early dawn of His
glory. As you follow on to know the Lord, you will know that the 'path of
the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the
perfect day !"—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 503, 504.
     "We need constantly a fresh revelation of Christ, a daily experience that
harmonizes with His teachings. High and holy attainments are within our
 reach. Continual progress in knowledge and virtue is God's purpose for us.
His law is the echo of His own voice, giving to all the invitation, 'Come up
higher. Be holy, holier still.' Every day we may advance in perfection of
Christian character."—Id., p. 503.
    10. Of what was Paul confident in connection with the work at Philippi?
What description is given of successful Christian development? Phil. 1:
6, 9-11.
                                 •
    11. What will be the fruitage of such a life? Col. 1:10.
    NoTE.—"In all the busy activity of his [Paul's] life, he never lost sight
of the one great purpose,—to press toward the mark of his high calling. Paul
carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who associated with him felt
the influence of his union with Christ. The fact that his own life exemplified
the truth he proclaimed, gave convincing poWer to his preaching. Here lies
the power of the truth. The unstudied, unconscious influence of a holy life
is the most convincing sermon that can be given in favoi• of Christianity."—
"Gospel Workers," p. 59.
                          THE END OF THE ROAD
    12. What may we expect to see in every Christian experience? 2 Peter
3:18.
                                      { 27 ]
    13. While in this world, what will be true of our knowledge of the plans
of God? When will our knowledge be more complete? 1 Cor. 13:9, 10.
    NorE.—The newly born son of God, the convert to Christ, is but a babe
in his knowledge of spiritual things. Yet that babe in confident faith, submit-
ting its life to the guidance of the all-wise Father, rapidly learns the needed
spiritual lessons, quickly becomes able to take solid food, and develops into
Christian manhood or womanhood. Nevertheless, even, with a lifetime of
knowledge and experience of spiritual things, how meager is the measure of
wisdom obtained! Even those things which are seen by faith are but partly
understood. It will take the endless ages to reveal the fullness of God 10. His
children.
    14. What transformation in Christian character does the apostle illus-
trate by childhood and manhood? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—As a child in Christ one may be excused for his fears or for his
lack of confidence or of knowledge. But with the dawn of Christian man-
hood, when strong meat is required for food, no longer can the excuses of
childhood be made. It is as if one physically broken in health begins anew to
feed on liquid food, the food of babes, until the body is built up and able to
take solid foods again. But when the spiritual, structure is restored (he has
become a man), faith and confidence and an 'unquestioned knowledge of God
will be his, his childish shortcomings are put away.

           The Unknown Becomes the Known
   MEMORY VERSE: "Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face •to face:
now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." 1 Cor. 13:12.
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 11.

                                The Lesson
                      PEACE MIDST SIN AND STRIFE
    1. What is the natural condition of the human heart? Jer. 17:9.
    2. Where does God promise to hide those who trust Him while living
in the midst of the evils of the world? Ps. 31:20.
    3. What did Christ know would come to His followers due to their ac-
ceptance of His teachings? Matt. 10:34-36.
    NOTE.—"The Prince of Peace, He was yet the cause of division. He who
came to proclaim glad tidings and to create hope and joy in the hearts of the
                                     { 28}
  children of men, opened a controversy that burns deep and arouses intense
  passion in the human heart. And He warns His followers, 'In the world ye
• shall have tribulation.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 84.
      4. In spite of suffering, what should be the state of the Christian's
  mind? John 14:27.
      NOTE.—" 'Peace I leave with you,' He said, 'My peace I give unto 'you: not
  as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
  let it be afraid.' This peace is not the peace that comes through conformity
  to the world. Christ never purchased peace by compromise with evil. The
  peace that Christ left His disciples is internal rather than external, and was
  ever to remain with His witnesses through strife and contention."—Ibid.
                         THE HOPE OF HIS PEOPLE
     5. In the midst of earth's disappointments and trials, to what did
 Abraham and Moses look forward? Heb. 11:8-10, 24-26.
     6. While outward circumstances may seem dark and forbidding, to
 what may we also look forward? Verses 13, 39, 40.
     NOTE.—"Those who are children of Abraham will be seeking the city
 which He looked for, 'whose builder and maker is God.' "—"Patriarchs and
 Prophets," p. 170.
     7. With what confidence did Job look forward to the future? Job 19:
25-27.
     NOTE.—"The patriarch Job, looking down to the time of Christ's second
 advent, said, 'Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and
 not a stranger.' To His faithful followers Christ has been a daily companion
 and familiar friend. They have lived in close contact, in constant commun-
 ion with God. Upon them the glory of the Lord has risen. In them the light
 of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ has been re-
 flected. Now they rejoice in the undimmed rays of the brightness and glory
 of the King in His majesty. They are prepared for the communion of heaven;
 for they have heaven in their hearts."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 421.
     8. What did Paul assure the church would result from the steadfast
 holding of their confidence? Heb. 10:35-37.
     9. Of what was John the beloved confident? What would every man
 who had this confidence do? 1 John 3:2, 3.
     NOTE.—Christ "taught that the Christian must be pure in heart and life.
 Never should he be satisfied with an empty profession. As God is holy in His
 sphere, so fallen man, through faith in Christ, is to be holy in his sphere."— •
 "The Acts of the Apostles," p. 559.
           THE FULLNESS OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE
     10. What glorious prospect lies beyond the horizon of faith for every
  Christian? 1 Thess. 4:14-18. Answer.—To "ever be with the Lord."
     11. How has the provision made for God's children been described by
  the revelator? Rev. 21:1, 10-27; 22:1-5.
      NOTE.—"Human language is inadequate to describe the reward of the
  righteous. It will be known only to those who behold it. No finite mind can
  comprehend the glory of the paradise of God.

    "In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called'a country. There the
heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to fountains of living waters. ..The tree
of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the service
of the nations. There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and beside
them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the ran-
somed of the Lord. There the widespreading plains swell into hills of beauty,
and the mountains of God rear their lofty summits. On those peaceful plains,
beside those living streams, God's people, so long pilgrims and wanderers,
shall find a home."—"The Great Controversy," p. 675.
    12. How does Isaiah, the prophet of hope, describe the sinless land?
Isa. 65:21-25.
     13. What is the character of the companionship promised to those who
dwell in the new earth? In view of the nearness of our seeing Him face
to face, what are we admonished to do? 2 Peter 3:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"The greatest praise that men can bring to God is to become con-
secrated channels through whom He can work. Time is rapidly passing into
eternity. Let us not keep back from God that which is His own. Let us not
refuse Him that which, though' it cannot be giVen without merit, cannot be
denied without ruin. . .
    "As your soul yearns after God, you will find more and still more of the
unsearchable riches of His grace. As you contemplate these riches, you will
come into possession of them, and will reveal the merits of the Saviour's sac-
rifice, the protection of His righteousness, the fullness of His wisdom, and
His power to present you before the Father 'without spot, and blameless.' "
—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 566, 567.
    14. In the words of the apostle, how are the experiences of this sinful
world and of the new earth contrasted? 1 Cor. 13:12.
    NOTE.—"There the redeemed shall 'know, even as also They are known.'
The loves and sympathies which God Himself has planted in the soul, shall
there find truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy be-
ings, the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful
ones of all ages, who have washed their robes and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb, the sacred ties that bind together 'the whole family in
heaven and earth,'—these help to constitute the happiness of the redeemed.
   "There, immortal minds will contemplate with never-failing, delight the
wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love. There is no
cruel, deceiving foe to tempt to forgetfulness of God. Every faculty will be
developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge will not
weary the mind or exhaust the energies. There the grandest enterprises may be
carried forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the highest ambitions real-
ized; and still there will arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to ad-
mire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of
mind and soul and body."—"The Great Controversy," p. 677.

               The Greatest of These Graces
    MEMORY VERSE: "Now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest
of these is love." 1 Cor. 13:13. •
   LESSON HELP: "God's Greatest Gift," chapter 12.

                                The Lesson
                 MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN SACRIFICE'
   1. What attitude does love take toward evil? What does God do for
those who love Him?. Ps. 97:10.
     2. What did Christ say was the first commandment?, What, did He
say of the second? What comparison did the scribe who questioned Christ
make? Mark 12:29-33.
    NOTE. "Both these commandments are an expression of the principle of
love. The first cannot be kept and the second broken, nor can the second be
kept while the first is broken. When God has His rightful place on the throne
of the heart, the right place will be given to our neighbor. We shall love
him as ourselves. And only as we love God supremely is it possible to love
our neighbor impartially. . . .
     "The scribe was near to the kingdom of God, in that he recognized deeds
of righteousness as more acceptable to God than burnt offerings and sacri-
 fices. But he needed to recognize the divine character of Christ, and through
 faith in Him receive power to do the works of righteousness. The ritual serv-
 ice was of no value, unless connected with Christ by living faith. Even the
 moral law fails of its purpose, unless it is understood in its relation to the
 Saviour. Christ had repeatedly shown that His Father's law contained some-
 thing deeper than mere authoritative commands. In the law is embodied the
 same principle that is revealed in the gospel. The laws points out man's duty
 and shows him his guilt. To Christ he must look for pardon and for power
 to do what the law enjoins."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 607, 608.
    3. What does God regard as more important than gifts and offerings
 to His work? Luke 11:42. •
    NoTE.—Love to God and for one's fellows will lead to loyalty in the pay-
 ment of tithe and offerings, but faithfully carrying out every requirement of
 God in the tithing of our goods can never be substituted for love manifest
 toward others, itself an evidence of our love for God.

                     THE MEASURE OF TRUE LOVE
    4. For what did Paul pray in behalf of the Philippian church? Phil. 1:9.
    5. What is the perfect bond which binds the church together? Col. 3:14.
    NOTE.—"The fact that we are under so great obligation to Christ, places
us under the most sacred obligation to those whom He died to redeem. We
are to manifest toward them the same sympathy, the same tender compas-
sion and unselfish love, which Christ has manifested toward us. Selfish ambi-
tion, desire for supremacy, will die when Christ takes possession of the affec-
tions."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 170. Love eliminates from the life all self-
ishness, and hence becomes the bond that binds heart to heart, and all hearts
to their Father.
    6. How closely does the spirit of true love unite us with our Father?
1 John 4:7.
    NoTE.—An Oriental story says that a prince asked- two of his wisest coun-
selors how he might make his peciple most happy ; and allowed them two
months to prepare their reply. At the required time the two wise men stood
before their master,—the one bending beneath a great roll of papyrus leaves
containing two hundred written rules, the other walking empty-handed. The
reading of the two hundred rules sadly wearied the prince, who then called
upon the other counselor to produce his reply, which was given in two words:
"Love God." "How?" said the prince. "Did I not require to know how I
might 'render my people most happy? And thou only directest me to love
God." "True," replied the wise man; "but thou canst not love God without
loving thy people also."—Sunday School Times.
    7. How will this union with God affect our earthly relationships?
Verses 11, 12.
    NorE.—"Selfishness and cold formality have well-nigh extinguished the
fire of love, and dispelled the graces that should make' fragrant the character.
Many who profess His name have lost sight of the fact that Christians are
to represent Christ. Unless there is practical self-sacrifice for the good of
others, in the family circle, in the neighborhood, in the church, and wherever
we may be, then whatever our profession, we are not Christian."—"The De-
sire of Ages," p. 504.
    8. What relationships of life are to be subordinated to our love for
Christ? Matt. 10:37.
    9. What will a comprehension of true love enable the Christian to
understand? Eph. 3:17, 19.
    NOTE.—"Here are revealed the heights of attainment that we may reach
through faith in the promises of our heavenly Father, when we fulfill His
requirements. Through the merits of Christ, we have access to the throne of
infinite power, 'He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for
us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?' The Father
gave His Spirit without measure to His Son, and we also may partake of its
fullness."—"The Great Controversy," p. 477.
    "Christ's gracious presence in His word is ever speaking to the soul, rep-
resenting Him as the well of living water to refresh the thirsting soul. It is
our privilege to have a living, abiding Saviour. He is the?source of spiritual
power implanted within us, and His influence will flow forth in words and
                                    1 32-1'
actions, refreshing all within the sphere of our influence, begetting in them
desires and aspirations for strength and purity, for holiness and peace, and
for that joy which brings no sorrow with it. This is the result of an indwell-
ing Saviour."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 390.
                     LOVE'S LIMITS—LOVE'S REWARD
    10. By what supreme gift did God reveal His love for man? John 3:16.
    NOTE.—"Ever since the fall of man, Christ had been the Revealer of truth
to the world. By Him the incorruptible seed, 'the word of God, which liveth
and abideth foreveri' is communicated to men. . . .
    "The word of God is the seed. Every seed has in itself a germinating
principle. In it the life of the plant is infolded. So there is life in God's
word. Christ says, 'The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit,. and
they are life.' He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me,
hath everlasting life.' In every command and in every promise of the word
of God is the power, the very life of God, by which the command may be
fulfilled and the promise realized. He who by faith receives the word is re-
ceiving the very life and character of God."-="Christ's Object Lessons," p. 38.
    11. Where does love rank in the list of Christian attributes? 1 Cor.
13:13.
    NOTE.—"Supreme love for God and unselfish love for one another,—this
is the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is not an im-
pulse, but a divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart
cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it
found. 'We love Him, because He first loved us.', In the heart renewed by
divine grace, love is the ruling principle of action. It modifies the character,
governs the impulses, controls the passions, -and ennobles the affections. This
love, cherished in the soul, sweetens the life, and sheds a refining influence on
all around.",—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 551.        •
     12. Surrendered to the control of God's unfathomed love, to what may
every Christian look forward? James 1:12; 2 Tim. 4:8.
    NOTE.—"However short our service or humble our work, if in simple
faith we follow Christ, we shall not be disappointed of the reward. That
which even the greatest and wisest cannot earn, the weakest and most humble
may receive. Heaven's golden gate opens not to the self-exalted. It is not
lifted up to the proud in spirit. But the everlasting portals will open wide to
the trembling touch of a little child. Blessed will be the recompense of grace
to those who have wrought for God in , the simplicity of faith and love."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 404.

LESSON HELP
                                      Many Sabbath school
     members will be interested in securing the little book which
     has just been published as an aid iri studying the lessons
     for this quarter on 1 Corinthians 13. The author is S. A.
     Wellman, associate secretary of the Sabbath School De-

                                    THOUGHTS FROM THE


MOUNT OF BLESSING
    MHE sermon on the side of that mountain somewhere near the
     1 Lake Gennesaret takes on new beauty and value as we read
    the comments of the gifted author of this book. There is so much
    wrapped up in the few verses of Scripture recording the Beatitudes
    and the sermon following that most of us do not fully appreciate
    as we read the record; but this book covers each point very care-
    fully, and brings forth the gems in all their brilliancy.
        "The Sermon on.the Mount is Heaven's benediction to the world,
    —a voice from the throne of God. It was given to mankind to be to
    them the law of duty and the light of heaven, their hope and conso-
    lation in despondency, their joy and comfort in all the vicissitudes
    and walks of life. Here the Prince of preachers, the Master Teacher,
    utters the words that the Father gave Him to speak."
