        The Great Open Secret of the Universe
   MEMORY VERSE: "We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hid-
den wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory." 1 Cor. 2 :7.
   Note.—"The word 'mystery' signifies a secret, a thing kept secret and hid from

    NOTES.—"The works of creation testify of God's power and greatness."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 116.
    "Among the heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom
the light is never brought by human instrumentality, yet they will not perish.
Though ignorant of the written law of God, they have heard His voice speak-
ing to them in nature, and have done the things that the law required."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 638.
    "The things of nature that we now behold give us but a faint conception
of Eden's glory. Sin has marred earth's beauty ; on all things may be seen traces
of the work of evil. Yet much that is beautiful remains. Nature testifies that.
One infinite in power, great in goodness, mercy, and love, created the earth, and
filled it with life and gladness. Even in their blighted state, all thingo reveal
the handiwork of the great Master Artist. Wherever we turn, we may hear the
voice of God, and see evidences of His goodness.
    "From the solemn roll of the deep-toned thunder and old ocean's ceaseless
roar, to the glad songs that make the forests vocal with melody, nature's ten
thousand voices speak His praise."—"The Ministry of Healing," pp. 410, 411.
   2. Aside from what has been made known through nature and, revela-
tion, how much may be known of the Creator? Job 11:7-9. Answer.—
Nothing.
   NorEs.—"No finite mind can fully comprehend the existence, the power, the
wisdom, or the works of the Infinite One."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 116.
   "Never can humanity, of itself, attain to a knowledge of the divine. .
Only the spirit of adoption can reveal to us the deep things of God."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 412.

universe? Deut. 29:29.
    Norn.—Beyond what is revealed in nature and the written word is an im-
penetrable wall of mystery 'which human speculation may not enter.

to men; human science cannot search out the secrets of the Most High. His
creative power is as incomprehensible as His existence."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 113.
    4. How much of the Bible is a revelation from God concerning Jesus

the gloom in which sin had wrapped the world, came from Christ. And from
Him has come every ray of heaven's brightness that has fallen upon the inhab-
itants of the earth. In the plan of redemption, Christ is the Alpha and the
Omega,—the First and the Last."—Id., p. 367.
   "The Old Testament sheds light upon the New, and the New upon the Old.
Each is a revelation of the glory of God in Christ. Both present truths that

God:"—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 412.
    9. What is said concerning the personality of the Godhead? 1 John 5:7.
    NOTES.—"Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty
agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified

the obedient subjects of heaven in their efforts to live the new life in Christ."—

                    The First Advent of Christ
   MEMORY VERSE: "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father,) full of grace and
truth." John 1:14.
                           INTRODUCTION
   "Even before He took humanity upon Him, He saw the whole length of the
path He must travel in order to save that which was lost.. Every pang that
                                          5
rent His heart, every insult that was heaped upon His head, every privation
that He was called to endure, was open to His view before He laid aside His
crown and royal robe, and stepped down from the throne, to clothe His divin-
ity with humanity. The path from the manger to Calvary was all before His
eyes. He knew the anguish that would come upon Him. He knew it all, and
yet He said, To, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of Me, I de-
light to do Thy will, 0 My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.'
    "Ever before Him He saw the result of His mission. His earthly life, so
full of toil and self-sacrifice, was cheered by the prospect that He would not
have all this travail for naught. By giving His life for the life of men, He
would win back the world to its loyalty to God. Although the baptism of blood
must first be received; although the sins of the world were to weigh upon His
innocent soul; although the shadow of an unspeakable woe was upon Him; yet
for the joy that was set before Him, He chose to endure the cross, and despised
the shame."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 410.
                                THE LESSON
    1. What has been the greatest of all events in human history? Luke
2:4-11.
    NOTE.—"With profound and reverent interest the elders of Israel should
have been studying the place, the time, the circumstances, of the greatest
event in the world's history,—the coming of the Son of God to accomplish the
redemption of man. All the people should have been watching and waiting
that they might be among the first to welcome the world's Redeemer. But lo,
at Bethlehem two weary travelers from the hills of Nazareth traverse the
whole length of the narrow street to the eastern extremity of the town, vainly
seeking a place of rest and shelter for the night. No doors are open to receive
them. In a wretched hovel prepared for cattle, they at last find refuge, and
there the Saviour of the world is born."—"The Great Controversy," p. 313.
    2. How did the prophet Isaiah describe the mission of the Son of God
to this world? Isa. 42:2-4.
    NoTE.—"The Sun of Righteousness did not burst upon the world in splen-
dor, to dazzle the senses with His glory. It is written of Christ, 'His going
forth is prepared as the morning.' Quietly and gently the daylight breaks upon
the earth, dispelling the shadow of darkness, and waking the world to life.
So did the Sun of Righteousness arise, 'with healing in His wings.' "—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 261.
    3. How definitely was the place of Jesus' birth foretold in prophecy?
Micah 5:2.
    NOTE.—"The decree of imperial Rome for the enrollment of the peoples of
her vast dominion, has extended to the dwellers among the hills of Galilee. As
in old time Cyrus was called to the throne of the world's empire that he might
set free the captives of the Lord, so Cxsar Augustus is made the agent for the
fulfillment of God's purpose in bringing the mother of Jesus to Bethlehem.
She is of the lineage of David, and the Son of David must be born in David's
city."—Id., p. 44.
    4. What details are revealed concerning His birth? Isa. 7:14; Matt.
1:22, 23.
    5. What was foretold concerning the exact year of His Messiahship?
Dan. 9:25.
                                      [6]
     NOTE.—" 'Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of
 the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the
 Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks,' sixty-nine weeks,
•or four hundred and eighty-three years. The commandment to restore and
 build Jerusalem, as completed by the decree of Artaxerxes Longimanus, went
 into effect in the autumn of B. c. 457. From this time four hundred and eighty-
 three years extend to the autumn of A. D. 27. According to the prophecy, this
 period was to reach to the Messiah, the Anointed One. In A. D. 27, Jesus at His
 baptism received the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and soon afterward began
 His ministry."—Id., p. 233.
    6. What is said of the Child born to Mary? Isa. 9:6, 7.
    NOTES.—"By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than
recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's purpose to bring
about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ we become
more closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature,
the'Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken.
. . . To,assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-be-
gotten Son to become•one of the human family, forever to retain His human
nature. . . . God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and
has carried the same into the highest heaven. . . . In Christ the family of
earth and the family of heaven are bound together. Christ glorified is our
brother."—Id., pp. 25, 26.
    "In Christ the cry of humanity reached the Father of infinite pity. As a
man He supplicated the throne of God, till His humanity was charged with a
heavenly current that should connect humanity with divinity. Through con-
tinual communion He received life from God, that He might impart life to
the world. His experience is to be ours."—Id., p. 363.
    7. Whom did Christ reveal in His earthly mission? John 14:8, 9.
   NOTE.—"Christ came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, full of
mercy, tenderness, and compassion. The thick darkness with which Satan had
endeavored to enshroud the throne of Deity was swept away by the world's
Redeemer, and the Father was again manifest to men as the light of life."—
"Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 738, 739.
     8. How early in the history of mankind was the mission of Christ fore-
 told? Gen. 3:15.
     NOTE.—"To man the first intimation of redemption was communicated in
 the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden. The Lord declared, 'I will
 put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her Seed;
 it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.'"—"Patriarchs and
 Prophets," p. 65.
   9. When was the compact entered into that Christ should be the one to
represent the Father in a lost world? Rev. 13:8; 1 Peter 1:19, 20.
   NOTE. "Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the Father and the
Son had united in a covenant to redeem man if he should be overcome by
Satan. They had clasped their hands in a solemn pledge that Christ should
become the surety for the human race. This pledge Christ has fulfilled."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 834.
                                      [7)
     10. In addressing the Father, what did Christ say concerning His min-
istry on the earth? John 17:4.
     11. What prayer did He offer in behalf of His followers? Verse 24.
     NOTE.—"When upon the cross He cried out, 'It is finished,' He addressed
the Father. The compact had been fully carried out. Now He declares, 'Father,
it is finished. I have done Thy will, 0 My God. I have completed the work of
redemption. If Thy justice is satisfied, "I will that they also, whom Thou hast
given Me, be with Me where I am." ' "—Ibid.
     12. Near the close of His earthly ministry, what comforting assurance
did Jesus give His followers? John 14:16, 17.
     13. Why did Jesus withhold many things that He would gladly have
told His disciples? John 16:12.
     14. Through whoin did He say He would reveal those things later?
Verses 13, 14.
     NorE.—"Henceforth through the Spirit, Christ was to abide continually
in the hearts of His children. Their union with Him was closer than when He
was personally with them. The light, and love, and power of the indwelling
Christ shone out through them, so that men, beholding, 'marveled; and they
took knowledr of them, that they had been with Jesus.' "—"Steps to Christ,"
p. 80.

               The Advent of the Holy Spirit
   MEMORY VERSE: "I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you." John
14:18, margin.
                              INTRODUCTION
    We know from the study of the Old Testament Scriptures, that the Son of
God visited this world before the time we speak of as His first advent. But
there came a time, in the plan for man's salvation, when the Son of God was
to leave His home in heaven, and for a time make this world His'home. From
the manger birth in Bethlehem until the ascension from the Mount of Olives,
was what might be called the time ministry of Jesus.
    We also know that the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Godhead, was
often in this world, before the first advent of Christ. But there came a time,
in the working out of that great plan, when He, the Holy Spirit, in a special
sense should be given to this world. It is well to bear in mind that, while Jesus
clothed His divinity with the garb of humanity, no such limitation was neces-
sary on the part of His successor, the Holy Spirit.
                                      [8I
                                THE LESSON
    1. After being with their divine-human teacher for three and a half
years, how did the disciples feel when He spoke of leaving them? John
16:5, 6.
    2. Who did He say would take His place after He left them? John
14:16.
    3. How real was to be the presence of the Holy Spirit in the church?
Verse 17.
    4. What was the greatest of all gifts that Jesus could solicit for His
followers in this world? John 14:16.
    NoTE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit
from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was to be given
as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been
of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries, and the
submission of men to this satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted
and overcome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person of the God-
head, who would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine
power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the
world's Redeemer."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 671.
    5. What assurance have we that this heavenly gift will be bestowed
upon those who ask for it, and fulfill the conditions on which the promise
is based? Luke 11 : 13.'
    6. What precedes the comfort which the Holy Spirit gives? Matt. 5:4.
    NarE.—"Real sorrow for sin is the result of the working of the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit reveals the ingratitude of the heart that has slighted and grieved
the Saviour, and brings us in contrition to the foot of the cross."—Id., p. 300.
    7. What will be the experience of those to whom the Holy Spirit makes a
full revelation of the terrible sinfulness of the human heart? Zech. 12 : 10.
    NoTE.—"By every sin, Jesus is wounded afresh ; and as we look upon Him
whom we have pierced, we mourn for the sins that have brought anguish upon
Him. Such mourning will lead to the renunciation of sin. . . . The tears of
the penitent are only the raindrops that precede the sunshine of holiness. This
sorrow heralds a joy which will be a living fountain in the soul."—Ibid.
    8. With whom does the Lord dwell? Isa. 57:15.
    9. To whom does the Lord give the Holy Spirit without measure?
John 3:34.
    NOTE.—"So with the followers of Christ. We can receive of heaven's light
only as we are willing to be emptied of self. . . . To all who do this, the Holy
Spirit is given without measure."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 334.
    10. What will be the experience of those who renounce the works of the
flesh, and walk "after the Spirit?" Rom. 8:1.
    11. In the provisions of the gospel, when do we become sons of God?
John 1:12; 1 John 3:1-3.
    12. Through what agency are we made members of the heavenly fam-
ily,—sons of the living God? Rom. 8:13, 14.
                                      [9]
    13. When we become sons. of God, through the ministry of the Holy
-Spirit, what relation do we sustain to Christ? Heb. 2:11.
    14. Who, besides the Holy Spirit, ministers to God's children in the
world? Heb. 1:13, 14.
    NoTEs.—Wonders of redeeming love and grace ! Mysterious union ! God,
-our Father ! Jesus, our Elder Brother ! The Holy Spirit, our friend and helper !
The angel family, our ministering. spirits !
    "We need to understand better than we do the mission of the angels. It
would be well to remember that every true child of God has the cooperation
-of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and power attend the meek and
lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God."—"Acts of the Apos-
ties," p. 154.

                Personality of the Holy Spirit .
   MEMORY VERSE: "Great is the mystery of godliness." 1 Tim. 3:16.

                               INTRODUCTION
     "Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the
Third Person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but
in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has
been wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is
made pure."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 671.
     Beyond the fact that the Holy Spirit is the person or power associated with
Christ and God in the work of creation (Gen. 1:2, 26), in the work of recrea-
tion through the new birth (John 3), in the regeneration of sinners, leading
them in the paths of righteousness (Rom. 8:1), God has seen fit to make but
little known. Invisible, yet all powerful (John 3:8), unseen yet shaping the
lives and characters of multitudes of hearts that have freely surrendered to
Him (Acts 2:41-47; 5:14), comforting, instructing, guiding those who have
given their all to the Master, still the Spirit is unseen except in the revelation
of the Christ in the daily life of human souls- (John 14:15-20) who are being
reborn and prepared for the kingdom of heaven.
                                 THE LESSON
    1. What fundamental truth of revelation is expressed in the first four
words of the Bible? Gen. 1:1.
   NOTE.—The Bible is a revelation from God of His plans and purposes for
the human family. Everything that is essential to man's salvation is included
                                       1 101
in that revelation. Belief in the existence of a living, personal God is the very
foundation stone upon which the plan for the redemption of a lost world, or
of a lost soul rests. "He that cometh to God must believe that He is." This
mighty pillar of truth, which is now held loosely or openly denied in the Chris-
tian world, is the opening declaration of God's revelation to man,—"In the be-
ginning God."
     2. What implies that God, the Father, was not alone in the work of
creation? Verses 2, 3, 26.
     NOTE.—"The Sovereign of the universe was not alone in His work of benef-
icence. He had an associate,—a coworker who could appreciate His purpose,
and could share His joy in giving happiness to created beings. 'In the begin-
 ning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.' Christ, the Word, the only-begotten
 of God, was one with the Eternal Father,—one in nature, in character, in pur-
 pose,—the only being that could enter into all the counsels and purposes of
 God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 34.
     3. How much can human reasoning find out concerning the nature of
the Godhead? Isa. 40:28.
     NOTES.—"The nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery. Men cannot explain
it, because the Lord has not revealed it to them. Men having fanciful views
 may bring together passages of Scripture and put a human construction on
 them; but the acceptance of these views will not strengthen the church. Re-
garding such mysteries, which are too deep for human understanding, silence
 is golden."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 52.
     "We cannot rightly understand or appreciate divine revelation without the
 aid of that Spirit by whom the word was given."—"Testimoniesrvol. 5, p. 241.
    4. What fact does faith accept without being able to explain? Matt.
1:18.
    NOTE.—"That which happened historically must take place experimentally.
In each of us Jesus Christ must be born through the direct action of the Holy
Spirit. See Gal. 4:1-5. This is what we mean by the new birth; and when He
has so entered our hearts, our Lord will become our Saviour, not merely from
the penalty but from the love and the power of our sins."—F. B. Meyer.
    5. What does the apostle Paul state concerning the union of the divine
and human nature in Christ? 1 Tim. 3:16.
    NOTE.—"The union of the divine with the human nature is one of the most
precious and most mysterious truths of the plan of redemption. It is this of
which Paul speaks when he says, 'Without controversy great is the mystery of
godliness; God was manifest in the flesh.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 746.
    6. How much of the mystery surrounding the personality of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, is open to our study? Deut. 29 : 29.
    NOTE.—"The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for
our study. This we may seek to understand. But, beyond this we are not to
penetrate. The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in con-
jectures regarding the nature of God; but the effect will be fruitless. This
problem has not been given us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God.
Let not finite man attempt to interpret Him. Let none indulge in speculation
regarding His nature. Here silence is eloquence. The Omniscient One is above
discussion."—Id., vol. 8, p. 279.
                                       11
     7. What is declared to be "the riches of the glory of this mystery"?
Col. 1:27.
    8. What special preparation did Gideon receive when called to leader-
ship? Judges 6:34, margin.
    9. How was Amasai prepared for his work in defending David? 1 Chron.
12:18, margin.
    10. What is stated concerning the experience of Zechariah? 2 Chron.
24:20, margin.
    11. When the Holy Spirit came in fulfillment of the promise, whose
spiritual presence did He bring to the disciples? John 14:18.
    NOTES.—"It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit
of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal"—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 388.
    "Christ Himself calls our attention to the growth of the vegetable world
as an illustration of the agency of His Spirit in sustaining spiritual life. The
sap of the vine, ascending from the root, is diffused to the branches, sustaining
growth and producing blossoms and fruit. So the life-giving power of the Holy
Spirit, proceeding from the Saviour, pervades the soul, renews the motives and
affections, and brings even the thoughts into obedience to the will of God, en-
abling the receiver to bear the precious fruit of holy, deeds."—"Acts of the
Apostles," p. 284.
    12. What work was the Holy Spirit commissioned to do? John 16:13-15.
    Notts.—"On the day of Pentecost the promised Comforter descended, and
the power from on high was given, and the souls of the believers thrilled with
the conscious presence of their ascended Lord."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 351.
    "Pentecost brought them the heavenly illumination. The truths they
could not understand while Christ was with them were now unfolded. With
a faith and assurance that they had never before known, they accepted the ,
teachings of the Sacred Word. No longer was it a matter of faith with them 4
that Christ was the Son of God. They knew that although clothed with hu-
manity, He was indeed the Messiah, and they told their experience to the,
world with a confidence which carried with it the conviction that God was
with them."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp: 45, 46.


    During the first three months of last year there was an increase in our Sab-
bath school membership of 16,991. Every world division showed an increase,
—Southern Africa and Central Europe more than 3,600 each ; North America,
China, and Inter-America more than 2,400 each, while two others of the world
divisions, Northern and Southern Europe, exceeded the thousand mark in that
first quarter's gains. Counted by Sabbath schools, this would add 170 new
schools of a hundred each. It is soul-thrilling to think of this army of Bible
students who are making ready for the coming of the Lord. Every new pupil
is an omen of cheer, every new school a beacon light in the darkness, an evi-
dence that God is baring His arm to make a short work in the earth.

                   Intercession in Our Behalf
  MEMORY VERSE: "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous." 1 John 2:1.

                              INTRODUCTION
    The word Paraclete occurs four times in the Gospel of John,—chapter 14:
16, 26; 15:26; and 16:7. "Paraclete is simply the Greek word transferred into
English. . . . In general the word signifies (1) a legal advocate, or counsel
for defense, (2) an intercessor, (3) a helper. . . . Perhaps there is no English
word broad enough to cover all the significance of the word `Paraclete' except
the word 'Helper.' "—International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, art., "Para-
clete."
                                  THE LESSON
    1. Who is our attorney, or advocate, in the supreme court of the uni-
verse? 1 John 2:1.
    NOTES.—"In the courts above, Christ is pleading for His church—pleading
for those for whom He has paid the redemption. price of His blood."—"Acts
of the Apostles," p. 552.
    "No sooner does the child of God approach the mercy seat than he becomes
the client of the great Advocate. At his first utterance of penitence and appeal
for pardon; Christ espouses his case, and makes it His own, presenting the sup-
plication before the Father as His own request."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 364.
    "He has placed at. His altar an Advocate clothed in our nature. As our
intercessor, Christ's office work is to introduce us to God as His sons and daugh-
ters. He intercedes in behalf of those who receive Him. With His own blood
He has paid their ransom. By virtue of His merits, He gives them power to
become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. And the
Father demonstrates His infinite love for Christ by receiving and welcoming
Christ's friends as His friends."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 177.
    2. Who besides Christ intercedes with God in behalf of man? Rom. 8:
26, 27.
    NOTE.—"In the great and measureless gift of the Holy Spirit are contained
all of heaven's resources. It is not because of any restriction on the part of God
that the riches of His grace do not flow earthward to man. If all were willing
to receive, all would become filled with His Spirit."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. 419.
     3. What reason did Christ give why it would be expedient for Him to
leave His disciples? John 16:7.
                                         ( 13
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the per-
sonality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity,
Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their in-
terest that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor
on earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his location or his
personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible
to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended
on high."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 669.
    4. What mysterious relationship, closer than simply dwelling among
us, does the Holy Spirit sustain to believers? John 14:17.
   5. Of whom does the Holy Spirit testify? John 15:26.
   6. By what other term is the work of Christ, our Advocate, brought to
view? 1 Tim. 2:5.
   NOTE.—The guilt of His clients is admitted. The plea of guilty is the only
one that can be entered. The law has been broken, the penalty for which is
death. In order to present a successful plea in man's behalf, as an advocate,
He must offer some means by which the demands of justice can be satisfied.
    7. Who only possessed sufficient merit to meet the demands of justice,
thus bridging the gulf of separation between God and man? Heb. 2:9, 10;
Acts 4:12.
    NOTE.—"The broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all
the universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its claims.
Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God
could make atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem
fallen man from the curse of the law, and bring him again into harmony with
Heaven. Christ would take upon Himself the guilt and shame of sin,—sin so
offensive to a holy God that it must separate the Father and His Son. Christ
would reach to the depths of misery to rescue the ruined race."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 63.
    8. What impelled the Father and the Son to provide a way of salvation
for man? John 3:16; Heb. 12:2.
    NOTES.—"Though corruption and defiance might be seen in every part of
the alien province [our lost world], a way for its recovery was provided. At
the very crisis, when Satan seemed about to triumph, the Son of God came
with the embassage of divine grace. Through every age, through every hour,
the love of God had been exercised toward the fallen race. Notwithstanding
the perversity of men, the signals of mercy had been continually exhibited.
And when the fullness of the time had come, the Deity was glorified by pour-
ing upon the world a flood of healing grace that was never to be obstructed
or withdrawn till the plan of salvation should be fulfilled."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 37.
    "Love is the 'Alpha and Omega' of redemption, the love of God to man.
Read it in the journey of the Mediator from heaven to earth! Read it in His
pilgrimage through the land of sorrow ! Behold Him 'nailed to the shameful
tree !' See the blood and water gushing from His side ! Hear the sound of the
waterspouts, as the floods of wrath roll over Him ! Then ask the reason. The
answer is: 'God is love.' "—Evangelistic Cyclopaedia, pp. 290, 291.
                                     [ 14 I
    9. What plea does His mediation enable Him to present to the Father
in behalf of His followers? John 17:9-11.
    10. What must be the qualifications of such a Mediator? Heb. 4:15..
    NOTE.—"Wonderful must be the qualifications of such a Mediator. He
fills with His own merit the gap between two worlds. He bows the heavens
and lifts up the earth to meet them. He takes hold of God and man and brings
them together in Himself. He reconciles the rebel and the law, glorifies the-
Father by humbling Himself, and His cross becomes our life."—Id., p. 291.
     11. What should the fact that Christ, as Mediator and Advocate, repre-
sents us before the Father in heaven inspire in the heart of every believer?
Verse 16.
    NOTES.—"If ever there was a time when every house should be a house of
prayer, it is now. Infidelity and skepticism prevail. Iniquity abounds. Cor-
ruption flows in the vital currents of the soul, and rebellion against God breaks.
out in the life. . . . And yet, in this time of fearful peril, some who profess to• _
be Christians have no family worship."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 42.
     Is it possible that this great lack prevails in any Seventh-day Adventist
home? If so, may the study of this lesson lead to the erection of the family
altar, ere it shall be too late to pray.
    12. How does the apostle John give expression to the love of God, re-
vealed through Christ as mediator and advocate? 1 John 3:1, 2.
    NoTE.—"In our life here, earthly, sin-restricted, though it is, the greatest
joy and the highest education are in service. And in the future state, untram-
meled by the limitations of sinful humanity, it is in service that our greatest
joy and our highest education will be found ;—witnessing, and ever as we wit-
ness learning anew 'the riches of the glory of this mystery ;"which is Christ-
in you, the hope of glory.' "—"Education," p. 309.

                   The Holy Spirit as Teacher
   MEMORY VERSE: "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your ,re-
membrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." John 14:26.

                                INTRODUCTION
  We have learned that it is the cooperation between Christ, as advocate and
mediator in heaven, and the Holy Spirit, as another advocate and helper on-
                                    [ 15 1
the earth, that makes successful the plan of our salvation. We are now to study
their cooperation as divine teachers.
                         THE LESSON
   1. Whom did Nicodemus recognize in the Saviour? John 3:1, 2.
    2. What qualifications, as the world's great teacher, did Christ possess?
Col. 2:3.
    NOTE.—"To all eternity men may be ever searching, ever learning, and yet
never exhaust the treasures of His wisdom, His goodness, and His power."—
"Steps to Christ," p. 114.
    3. What could Jesus therefore say of Himself? John 8:12.
    NOTE.—"We can trace the line of the world's great teachers as far back as
human records extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the
stars of the solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun, so, as far as
their teaching is true, do the world's great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun
of Righteousness. Every gem of thought, every flash of the intellect, is from
the Light of the world."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 464, 465.
    4. Since Christ, the "teacher come from God," returned to His home
in heaven, who continues the work of teaching which He began? How much
does the Holy Spirit teach concerning what Christ said to His disciples?
John 14:26.
    NOTE.—"Many of His lessons, when spoken, they [the disciples] had not
appreciated or understood; now they longed to recall these lessons, to hear
again His words."—"Education," p. 94.
    5. What is this other "Comforter" called? Verse 17.
      6. From what inexhaustible source does the Holy Spirit receive the light
and truth which He imparts? John 16:14, 15.
     NOTE.—"It is plainly declared regarding the Hdly Spirit, that in His work
of guiding men into all truth, 'He shall not speak of Himself.'"—"Acts of the
Apostles," p. 51.
      7. What should inspire believers to pray earnestly for the presence of
the Holy Spirit? John 14:16.
     NoTE.—"Wherever the need of the Holy Spirit is a matter little thought
of, there is seen spiritual drought, spiritual darkness, spiritual declension and
death. Whenever minor matters occupy the attention, the divine power which
is necessary for the growth and prosperity of the church, and which would
bring all other blessings in its train, is lacking, though offered in infinite pleni-
tude."—Id., p. 50.
     8. 'What blessings follow the reception of the Holy Spirit? Acts 1:8.
     NOTE.—"Since this is the means by which we are to receive power, why
do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit? Why do we not talk of
it, pray for it, and preach concerning it? The Lord is more willing to give
the Holy Spirit to those who serve Him than parents are to give good gifts to
their children. For the daily baptism of the Spirit, every worker should offer
his petition to God. Companies of Christian workers should gather to ask for
special help, for heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to plan and exe-
cute wisely. Especially should they pray that God will baptize His chosen
    •                                    {16]
ambassadors in mission fields with a rich- measure of His Spirit. The presence
of the Spirit with God's workers will give the proclamation of truth a power
that not all the honor or glory of the world could give."—Id., pp. 50, 51.
    9. If unhindered by sin and unbelief, how much truth will the Holy
Spirit unfold to us? John 16 : 12-15.
    10. How is the receiving of the Holy Spirit referred to by the apostle?
1 John 2:20, 27.
    NoTE.—"An unction" means an anointing. The phrase, "the Holy One,"
doubtless refers to the Holy Spirit. The text does not say that those who had
once received the teaching of the Holy Spirit would have no further need of
instruction in the gospel, but rather that they would have no need of the minis-
try of the false teachers mentioned in 1 John 2:18, 19, nor of any other teach-
ing different from, or opposed to, that which the Spirit of God had given them.
   11. From whom does the heavenly anointing come? 2 Cor. 1:21.
    12. Through whom does God send the heavenly anointing? Acts 10:38.
    NOTE.—"Christ, the outshining of the Father's glory, came to the world
as its light. He came to represent God to man, and of Him it is written that
He was anointed 'with the Holy Ghost, and with power.' "—"Prophets and
Kings," p. 718.
    13. What does the great Teacher point out as being the greatest need
of the remnant church? Rev. 3:14-18.
    NOTES.—"The Laodicean message applies to the people of God who profess
to believe present truth. The greater part are lukewarm professors, having a
name but no zeal."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 87.
    "The True Witness counsels us to buy of Him gold tried in the fire, white
raiment,' and eye salve. The gold here recommended as having been tried in
the fire, is faith and love."—Id., p. 88.
    "To those who are indifferent at this time Christ's warning is, 'Because
thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of My
mouth' Rev. 3 :16. The figure of spewing out of His mouth means that He
cannot offer up your prayers or your expressions of love to God. He cannot
indorse your teaching of His word or your spiritual work in any wise. He
cannot present your religious exercises with the request that grace be given
you."—Id., vol. 6, p. 408.
    14. As we come in close, daily contact with the Holy Spirit, the promised
teacher, how will our pathway be made clearer? Prov. 4:18.
    NOTES.—"Wonderful possibilities are open to those who lay hold of the
divine assurances of God's word. There are glorious truths to come before the
people of God. Privileges and duties which they do not even suspect to be in
the Bible will be laid open before them."—Id., vol. 8, p. 322.
    "The truths of redemption are capable of constant development and ex-
pansion. Though old, they are ever new, constantly revealing to the seeker for
truth a greater glory and a mightier power."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p.
127.
   15. What enables the Holy Spirit to "teach you all things"? 1 Cor. 2:10.
   NOTE.—"It is impossible for any human mind to exhaust even one truth or
promise of the Bible. One catches the glory from one point of view, another
                                   [ 17
from another point; yet we can discern only gleamings. The full radiance is
beyond our vision.
    "As we contemplate the great things of God's word, we look into a foun-
tain that broadens and deepens beneath our gaze. Its breadth and depth pass
our knowledge. As we.gaze, the vision widens; stretched out before us we be-
hold a boundless, shoreless sea. Such study gives vivifying power. The mind
and heart acquire new strength, new life."—"Education" p. 171.

          The Holy Spirit and the New Birth

tible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever." 1 Peter 1:23.

                               INTRODUCTION                                 .
    "The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the old, but
a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a new life
altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual working
of the Holy Spirit."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 172.

                                  THE LESSON
    1. What solemn statement did the Saviour make.to Nicodemus? John
3:3.
    NorE.—"It is impossible for finite minds to comprehend the work of re-
demption. Its mystery exceeds human knowledge; yet he who passes from
death to life realizes that it is a divine reality. The beginning of redemption
we may know here through a personal experience. Its results reach through
the eternal ages."—"The Desire of Ages,' p. 173.
    2. How much could Nicodemus, whose heart was unrenewed, under-
stand concerning this spiritual experience? With what words did Jesus
seek to make His ,meaning clear? Verses 4-6.
   3. How only can spiritual truth be discerned? 1 Cor. 2:14.
   NOTES.—"It is by faith that the soul beholds the glory of Jesus. This glory
is hidden, until, through the Holy Spirit, faith is kindled in the soul."—Id.,
p. 392.
    "Not by the decisions of courts or councils or legislative assemblies, not
by the patronage of worldly great men, is the kingdom of Christ established,
but by the implanting of Christ's nature in humanity through the work of the
Holy                p. 509.
    4. What conflict is going on in the human heart? Rom. 7:23, 24.
    NOTE.—"To man the first intimation of redemption was communicated in
the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden. . . . This sentence, uttered
in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a promise. While it foretold
war between man and Satan, it declared that the power of the great adver-
sary would finally be broken. . . . When Satan heard that enmity should exist
betweei. himself and the woman, and between his seed and her Seed, he knew
that his work of depraving human nature would be interrupted; that by some
means man would be enabled to resist his power."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
pp. 65, 66.
    5. What decides the conflict and gives victory to the struggling human
soul? Rom. 8:1, 2.
    6. To what is the new birth likened? John 3:8.
    NOTE.—"Like the wind, which is invisible, yet the effects of which are
plainly seen and felt, is the Spirit of God in its work upon the human heart.
That regenerating power, which no human eye can see, begets a new life in
the soul ; it creates a new being in the image of God. While the work of the
Spirit is silent and imperceptible, its effects are manifest."—"Steps to Christ,"
p. 61.
    7. How are the natural and the spiritual birth defined by the Saviour?
Verse 6.
    8. What is accomplished by the new birth? Gal. 6:15.
    9. What agency does the Holy Spirit use in bringing about the new
birth? 1 Peter 1:23.
    10. What must always precede the new birth? Gal. 2:19, 20.
   11. By whom is the new creation? Eph. 2:10.
   NoTE.—He who created the world and man in the beginning, is the One
who creates men and women anew, and who. will one day create new heavens
and a new earth.
   12. How is it shown that the One who created the worlds is the One
who purges our sins, thus making us new creatures in Christ Jesus? Heb.
1:1-3.
    13. What part did the Holy Spirit act in the work of creation, in the
beginning? Gen. 1:2, last part.
    NOTE.—In the work of the new creation, the Holy Spirit moves upon the
sinful human heart, bringing conviction, which is the first step in the work
of conversion.
   14. What then is accomplished through the new birth? Eph. 2:4-6.
   NoTE.—"By an agency as unseen as the wind, Christ is constantly work-
ing upon the heart. Little by little, perhaps unconsciously to the receiver, im-
pressions are made that tend to draw the soul to Christ. These may be re-
ceived through meditating upon Him, through reading the Scriptures, or
through hearing the word from the living preacher. Suddenly, as the Spirit
comes with more direct appeal, the soul gladly surrenders itself to Jesus."—

Indwelling and Abiding Presence ©f the Holy Spirit
   MEMORY VERSE: "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them;
because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world." 1 John 4:4.

                             INTRODUCTION
   "The Saviour was pointing forward to the time when the Holy Spirit
should come to do a mighty work as His representative. The evil that had
been accumulating for centuries was to be resisted by the divine power of the
Holy Spirit. . . The lapse of time has wrought no change in Christ's part-
ing promise to send the Holy Spirit as His representative. . . . Since this is
the means by which we are to receive power, why do we not hunger and thirst
for the gift of the Spirit? Why do we not talk of it, pray for it, and preach
concerning it?"—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 47-50.
                                 THE LESSON
     1. After Christ had been personally present in the world for thirty-
 three years, what did He promise concerning the length of time His suc-
 cessor would remain in the world? John 14:16.
    NoTE.—"The dispensation in which we are now livino is to be, to those
 that ask, the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. Ask for His'   blessing. It is time
.we were more intense in our devotions. To us is committed the arduous,
 but happy, glorious work of revealing Christ to those who are in darkness. We
 are called to proclaim the special truths for this time. For all this the outpour-
 ing of the Spirit is essential. We should pray fOr it. The Lord expects us to
 ask. Him. We have not been whole-hearted in this work."—"Testimonies to
 Ministers," pp. 511, 512.
    2. To whom is the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit assured? Verses
20, 21.
    NOTE.—"What was the strength of those who in the past have suffered
persecution for Christ's sake? It was union with God, union with the Holy
Spirit, union with Christ. Reproach and persecution have separated many
from earthly friends, but never from the love of Christ."—"Acts of the
Apostles," p. 85.
    3. What promise is made to those who ask in faith for the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit in the time of the latter rain? Zech. 10:1.
   NoTE.—"Under the figure of the early and the latter rain, that falls in
Eastern lands at seedtime and harvest, the Hebrew prophets foretold the be-
stowal of spiritual grace in extraordinary measure upon God's church. The
                                      [ 20 ]
outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was the beginning of the
early, or former, rain, and glorious was the result. To the end of time, the
presence of the Spirit is to abide with the true church."—Id., pp. 54, 55.
    4. Upon what foundation is the living temple, the household of God,
being built? Eph. 2:19-21.
    NOTE.—"To those who believe, Christ is a sure foundation. Upon this
living stone, Jews and Gentiles alike may build. It is broad enough for all,
and strong enough to sustain the weight and burden of the whole world."—
Id., p. 175.
    5. Who is one of the agents in the erection of this spiritual building?
Verse 22.
    NOTES.—By His representative, the Holy Spirit, Christ dwells in the hearts
of believers.
    "Not those whose hearts are touched by the Spirit, not those who now and
then yield to its power, but they that are led by the Spirit, are the sons of
God."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 215.
    6. In order to dwell in the church, in whom must the Holy Spirit abide?
1 Cor. 3:16, 17.
    NoTEs.—The Holy Spirit continually observes our course of action, seek-
ing to guide us in harmony with God's will.
    "Heaven is brought near to earth by that mystic ladder [Gen. 28:10-12],
the base of which is firmly planted on the earth, while the topmost round
reaches the throne of the Infinite. Angels are constantly ascending and de-
scending this ladder of shining brightness, bearing the prayers of the needy
and distressed to the Father above, and bringing blessing and hope, courage
and help, to the children of men. These angels of light create a heavenly at-
mosphere about the soul, lifting us toward the unseen and the eternal. We
cannot behold their forms with our natural sight ; only by spiritual vision can
we discern heavenly things. The spiritual ear alone can hear the harmony of
heavenly voices."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 153.
    7. What change is the Holy Spirit w•rking in human hearts? 2 Cor. 3:
17, 18.
    NoTE.—"The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through
the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is effecting transforma-
tions so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, with all his
confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government, stands
viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delusions. They
are to him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels of God, seraphim and
cherubim, the powers commissioned to cooperate with human agencies, look
on with astonishment and joy, that fallen men, once children of wrath, are
through the training of Christ developing characters after the divine simili-
tude, to be sons and daughters of God, to act an important part in the occu-
pations and pleasures of heaven."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 18.
    8. What importance does the apostle attach to the indwelling presence
of the Holy Spirit? Rom. 8:9.
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit seeks to abide in each soul. If it is welcomed as
an honored guest, those who receive it will be made complete in Christ. The
good work begun will be finished; the holy thoughts, heavenly affections, and
                                     { 21]
Christlike actions will take the place of impure thoughts, perverse sentiments,
and rebellious acts."—"Counsels on Health," p. 561.
    9. What longing does the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit create
in the soul? Phil. 3:10.
    NOTE.—"Transformation of character is the testimony to the world of an
indwelling Christ. The Spirit of God produces a new life in the soul, bringing
the thoughts and desires into obedience to the will of Christ; and the inward
man is renewed in the image of God."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 233.
   10. Who only are sons of God? Rom. 8:14.
     11. Who witnesses to our sonship? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"This conformity to Jesus will not be unobserved by the world.
It is a subject of notice and comment. The Christian may not be conscious of
the great change; for the more closely he resembles Christ in character, the
more humble will be his opinion of himself ; but it will be seen and felt by all
around him. Those who have had the deepest experience in the things of God,
are the farthest removed from pride or self-exaltation. They have the hum-
blest thoughts of self, and the most exalted conception of the glory and excel-
lence 01 Christ."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 223.
     12. How can one person be said to dwell in the heart of another whom
he loves? Phil. 1:7, 8.
     13. What promise does Christ make of His indwelling presence? Rev.
3:20.
     14. Who does the apostle Paul say will be the chief crown of his re-
joicing at the second coming of Christ? 1 Thess. 2:19, 20.
    NOTE.—"Who can measure the results to the world of Paul's life work?
Of all those beneficent influences that alleviate suffering, that comfort sor-
row, that restrain evil, that uplift life from the selfish and the sensual, and
glorify it with the hope of immortality, how much is due to the labors of Paul
and his fellow workers, as with the gospel of the Son of God they made their
unnoticed journey from Asia to the shores of Europe?
    "What is it worth to any life to have been God's instrument in setting in
motion such influences of blessing? What will it be worth in eternity to wit-
ness the results of such a life work?"—"Education," p. 70.

       The Holy Spirit and the New Covenant
   MEMORY VERSE: "In that He saith, A new covenant, He hath made the first
old." Heb. 8:13.

                              INTRODUCTION
   No theme is of more vital interest and importance to mankind, than is
that of the new covenant. It is God's eternal covenant of grace whereby sin-
ners, members of Satan's "kingdom of darkness," may become members of the
royal family, members of "the kingdom of His dear Son."

                                 THE LESSON
   1. What evidence is given us that God's eternal purpose to redeem a
fallen race was formed before sin entered into the world? 1 Peter 1:18-20;
Rev. 13:8.
    NOTE.—"The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan
formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of the mystery which
hath been kept in silence through times eternal.' It was an unfolding of the
principles that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God's throne.
From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of
the fall of man through the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not or-
dain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision
to meet the terrible emergency."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 22.
    2. What intimation do we have of a council having been held when the
plan of redemption was agreed upon? Zech. 6:13.
    NOTE.—"Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the Father and the
Son had united in a covenant to redeem man if he should be overcome by
Satan. They had clasped Their hands in a solemn pledge that Christ should
become the surety for the human race. This pledge Christ has fulfilled. When
upon the cross He cried out, 'It is finished,' He addressed the Father. The
compact had been fully carried out."—Id., p. 834.
    3. Who only of all the familrof heaven was qualified to bridge the gulf
of separation that sin had made? Acts 4:10, 12.
    NOTES.—"Since the law of Jehovah is the foundation of His government
in heaven as well as upon the earth, even the life of an angel could not be ac-
cepted as a sacrifice for its transgression."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 66.
    "None but the Son of God.could accomplish our redemption; for only He
who was in the bosom of the Father could declare Him. Only He who knew
the height and depth of the love of God could make it manifest. Nothing less
                                     [ 23
than the infinite sacrifice made by Christ in behalf of fallen man could express
the Father's love to lost humanity."—"Steps to Christ," p. 16.
    4. When was God's eternal covenant of grace first announced to man-
kind? Gen. 3:15.
    NOTE.—"To man the first intimation of redemption was communicated in
the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 65.
         THE OLD COVENANT BY WAY OF COMPARISON WITH THE NEW
    5. How does the apostle speak of the enduring nature of the new cove-
nant, the covenant of grace? Heb. 13:20, 21.
    6. What was the basis of the old covenant? Ex. 19:5, 8.
    7. After the Israelites had thrice solemnly promised to keep the Ten
Commandments, of how much value did their promises prove to be? Ex.
32: 7, 8.
    NoTE.—The old covenant on the people's part was based solely on their
promise to keep the Ten Commandments. In other words, it was the promise
of the people to make themselves righteous.
    8. In what respect does Inspiration declare the new covenant better
than the old? Heb. 8:6.
    9. What are the "better promises," and by whom were the promises of
the new covenant made? Jer. 31:31-33.
    NOTE.—The old covenant was a mutual agreement based upon the promises
of God and His people, but the promise of God was conditioned upon the
promise of the people. Ex. 19:5, 6, 8. The failure of the people to keep their
promise (Ex. 32:1-6) released God from His obligation under that particular
covenant.
    10. What agency does the Lord employ in writing the law of God upon
the human heart? 2 Cor. 3:3.
    NOTES.—Under the terms of the old covenant, the people promised to make
themselves righteous by keeping the law of God, written upon tables of stone.
Under the terms of the new covenant, the Lord promises to make the people
righteous by writing the same law upon the fleshly tables of the heart.
    "The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone, is written by the
Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 372.
    11. When we comply with the conditions of the new covenant, permit-
ting the Holy Spirit to write the law of God in the heart, what do we become
to those with whom we associate? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"In every one of His children, Jesus sends a letter to the world.
If you are Christ's follower, He sends in you a letter to the family, the village,
the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts
of those who are not acquainted with Him. Perhaps they do not read the
Bible, or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see
the love of God through His works. But if you are a true representative of
Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand something of
His goodness, and be won to love and serve Him."—"Steps to Christ," p. 119.
   12. When permitted to have His full right of way in our hearts, what
change does the .Holy Spirit work in our Christian experience? Verse 18.
                                 [24)
     13. What exalted mission does the Holy Spirit qualif 7 the believer to
fill in this world? John 17:18.
     NOTE.—"It is through the agency of the Holy Spirit that God communi-
cates with man; and those who deliberately reject this :agency as satanic, .,lave
cut off the channel of communication between the coal and Heaven. God
works by the manifestation of His Spirit to reprove and convict the sinner;
and if the Spirit's work is finally rejected, there is no more that God -.an do for ,
the soul. The last resource of divine mercy            been employed' fhe trans-
gressor has cut himself off from God; and sir Das no remedy i o cure itself.
There is no reserved power by which God car work to convict and convert the
sinner."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 405
     14. What was Christ's attitude towr.s.d the law of God? Ps. 40:8.
    15. When the•Holy Spirit control' sis heart, what change of attitude on
the part of the sinner takes place it       relationship to the law of God? Ps.
1:2; Rom. 7:22.
    NoTE.—When the Holy Spirit           the heart or the sinner and transforms
and changes it, the sinner no longer 1,_,2S his manner of living. His pleasures
are now found, not in sinful practices an.-: worlehy pleasures, but in righteous-
ness. He loves the law and meditates upon it. With the S'aviour he can exclaim,
"I delight to do Thy will, 0 my God: yea, Thy law is within my heart."

                      The Fruits of the Spirit
    MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them." Matt. 7:20.

                               INTRODUCTION
   It is true we are not to judge one another. We cannot read a man's heart
and judge the motive that prompts his actions. But, as expressed in Dr. Wey-
mouth's translation, "Are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from brambles?
Just so every good tree produces good fruit, but a poisonous tree produces bad
fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a poisonous tree good fruit. . . .
So by their fruits at any rate, you will easily recognize them."
                                THE LESSON
     1. What shows whether a man is a true Christian or a lifeless professor?
 Matt. 7:16-20.
     NOTE.—"It is a solemn and terrible truth that many who have been zealous
 in proclaiming the third angel's message are now becoming listless and indif-
                                     [ 25
ferent ! The line of demarcation between worldlings and many professed Chris-
tians is almost indistinguishable."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 118.
    2. How long will the good and the bad mingle together? Matt. 13:30.
    NOTE.—"The tares closely resembled the wheat while the blades were green ;
but when the field was white for the harvest, the worthless weeds bore no like-
ness to the wheat that bowed under the weight of its full, ripe heads. Sinners
who make a pretension of piety mingle for a time with the true followers of
Christ, and the semblance of Christianity is calculated to deceive many; but
in the harvest of the world there will be no likeness between good and evil.
Then those who have joined the church, but who have not joined Christ, will
be manifest."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 74.
     3. What are the fruits of the Holy Spirit? Gal. 5:22, 23.
    NorE.—"It is possible with our lips to confess Christ, yet in our works
deny Him. The fruits of the Spirit manifested in the life, are a confession of
Him."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 303.
     4. How does the apostle contrast the works of the flesh with the fruits
of the Spirit? Verses 19-23.
    NOTE.—"Those who become new creatures in Christ Jesus will bring forth
the fruits of the Spirit, 'love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance.' They will no longer fashion themselves accord-
ing to the former lusts, but by the faith of the Son of God they will follow in
His steps, reflect His character, and purify themselves even as He is pure.
The things they once hated, they new love; and the things they once loved,
they hate. The proud and self-assertive become meek and lowly in heart. The
vain and supercilious became serious and unobtrusive. The drunken become
sober, and the profligate pure. The vain customs and fashions of the world are
laid aside. Christians will seek not the `outward adorning,' but 'the hidden
man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a
meek and quiet spirit.'"—"Steps to Christ," pp. 62, 63.                   •
     5. How should Christians stand as related to the works of the flesh?
Eph. 5:3-6.
    NorE.—Observe that the "covetous man, who is an idolater" is in the list
of those who shall not have any inheritance in the kingdom of God. "And
yet, notwithstanding all these warnings, covetousness abounds. Everywhere
its slimy track is seen. It creates discontent and dissension in families; it ex-
cites envy and hatred in the poor against the rich; it prompts the grinding op-
pression of the rich toward the poor. And this evil exists not in the world
alone, but in the church. How common even here to find selfishness, avarice,
overreaching, neglect of charities, and robbery of God in tithes and offerings.'"
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 497.
     6. How is the fruit of the Spirit manifested? Verse 9.
     7. How only is one enabled to bear the fruits of the Spirit? John 15:
4-8.
    Norns.—"You are just as dependent upon Christ, in order to Jive a holy
life, as is the branch upon the parent stock for growth and fruitfulness."—
"Steps to Christ," p. 73.
    "A character formed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure
that we can take from this world to the next. Those who are under the in-
                                        [ 26
struction of Christ in this world will take every divine attainment with them
to the heavenly mansions. And in heaven we are continually to improve. How
important, then, is the development of character in this life."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," p. 332.
    "All the true followers of Christ bear fruit to His glory. Their lives testify
that a good work. has been wrought in them by the Spirit of God, and their
fruit is unto holiness."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 329.
    8. What prayer did the apostle offer concerning fruit bearing? Phil.
1:9-11.
    NOTE.—"Oh, what can I say to open blind eyes, to enlighten the spiritual
understanding Sin must be crucified. A complete moral renovation must be
wrought by the Holy Spirit. We must have the love of God, with living, abid-
ing faith."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 105. •
    9. What comparison does the apostle make between earthly and heav-
enly wisdom? James 3:13-17.
    Narks.—"In one who is learning of Jesus, there will be manifest a grow-
ing distaste for careless manners, unseemly language, and coarse thought.
When Christ abides in the heart, there will be purity and refinement of thought
and manner."—"The Mount of Blessing," p. 42.
    "Who can be trifling, who can engage in frivolous, common talk, while by
faith he sees the Lamb that was slain pleading before the Father as the inter-
cessor of the church upon earth? By faith let us look upon the rainbow round
about the throne, the cloud of sins confessed behind it. The rainbow of promise
is an assurance to every humble, contrite, believing soul, that his life is one
with Christ, and that Christ is one with God."—"Testimonies to Ministers,"
p. 157.
    10. What counsel is given the members of the Laodicean church? Rev.
3:18.
    NOTE.—"The gold tried in the fire is faith that works by love. Only this
can bring us into harmony with God. We may be active, we may do much
work; but without love, such love as dwelt in the heart of Christ, we can
never be numbered with the family of heaven."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
p. 158.
    "Only the covering which Christ Himself has provided, can make us meet
to appear in God's presence. This covering, the robe of His own righteousness,
 Christ will put upon every repenting, believing soul. . . . This robe, woven
in the loom of heaven, has in it not one thread of human devising. Christ in
His humanity wrought out a perfect character, and this character He offers
to impart to us."—Id., p. 311.
     11. What is the experience of him who tries himself to cover his sin?
Prov. 28 : 13.
     12. Why does self-righteousness not cover us? Isa. 64:6.
     13. What will those do at Christ's appearing who do not have the cover-
ing of His righteousness? Rev. 6:15, 16.
     NOTE.—The robe of Christ's righteousness is the only perfect covering for
sin. Rags of self-righteousness cannot cover and hide one's nakedness, hence
those so clothed will be ashamed before the Lord of righteousness when He
shall appear. Those who stand properly clothed will hail His coming with
gladness.

     14. What covering will shelter God's people in the great day of trouble?
Ps. 91 : 4-8.
     NoTE.—"I saw a covering that God was drawing over His people to pro-
tect them in the time of trouble; and every soul that was decided on the truth,
and was pure in heart, was to be covered with the covering of the Almighty.
. . . Satan was trying his every art to hold them where they were, until the
sealing was past, until the covering was drawn over God's people, and they
left without a shelter from the burning wrath of God, in the seven last plagues.
God has begun to draw this covering over His people, and it will soon be drawn -
over all who are to have a shelter in the day of slaughter. God will work in
power for His people; and Satan will be permitted to work also."—"Early
Writings," pp. 43, 44.

        The Holy Spirit and the Sealing Work
   MEMORY VERSE: "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
unto the day of redemption." Eph. 4:30.

                              ,INTRODUCTION
    The sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads is a work that takes
place while people are living in this world, surrounded with all the unhallowed
influences of wicked men and evil angels. They are to be "sealed unto the day
of redemption." Their salvation will then be made eternally sure.
    "I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful, and were
looking to the time of 'refreshing' and the 'latter rain' to fit them to stand in
the day of the Lord, and to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw in the time
of trouble without a shelter.! They had neglected the needful preparation,
therefore- they could not receive the refreshing that all must have to fit them
to live in the sight of a holy God."—"Early Writings," p. 71.
                                 THE LESSON
    1. What experiences were the disciples to have which would enable them
to carry the gospel to all the world? Acts 1:8.
    NOTE.—"The work committed to the disciples would require great effi-
ciency; for the tide of evil ran deep and strong against them. A vigilant, deter-
mined leader was in command of the forces of darkness, and the followers of
Christ could battle for the right only through the help that God, by His Spirit,
would give them."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 31.
   2. As Christ was about to take leave of His disciples, what did He as-
sure them they would receive? For what were they to tarry? Luke 24:49.
                                 {28 1
     3. With what are believers sealed? Eph. 1:12, 13.
    NorE.—"The Lord has shown me the danger of letting our minds be filled
with worldly thoughts and cares. I saw that some minds are led away from
present truth and a love of the Holy Bible, by reading other exciting books;
others are filled with perplexity and care for what they shall eat, drink, and
wear. Some are looking too far off for the coming of the Lord. Time has
continued a few years longer than they expected, therefore they think it may
continue a few years more, and in this way their minds are being led from
present truth, out after the world. In these things I saw great danger; for if
the mind is filled with other things, present truth is shut out, and there is no
place in our foreheads for the seal of the living God. I saw that the time for
Jesus to be in the most holy place was nearly finished, and that time can last
but a very little longer. What leisure time we have should be spent in search-
ing the Bible, which is to judge us in the last day."—"Early Writings," p. 58.
     4. What does the promise of God, sealed by the Holy Spirit, make sure
to the one who is sealed with the seal of the living God? Verse 14.
    NoTE.—The Spirit is given the believer as a pledge, an earnest, of the full
inheritance in due time. "Christ, by His sacrifice paying the penalty of sin,
would not only redeem man, but recover the dominion which he had forfeited. .
All that was lost by the first Adam will be restored by the second."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p. 67.
     5. How is this thought of the Holy Spirit's being given as a pledge—
part payment for the full inheritance—again stated by the apostle? 2 Cor.
1 : 21, 22.
     6. Having been established in our faith in Christ, what are we exhorted
to do? Gal. 5:1; 1 Thess. 3:8.
     7. What are Christians admonished to guard against? What are some
of the things that grieve the Holy Spirit? Eph. 4:30, 31.
     8. For what did Jesus say men should labor? What declaration is made
concerning the Son of man? What declaration did He make concerning
Himself? John 6:26, 27.
     9. When Christ should come to restore that which was lost through
Adam, in what would He take delight? Where would be found His Father's
law? Ps. 40:7, 8.
    NOTE.—"We marvel at the Saviour's sacrifice in exchanging the throne of
heaven for the manger, and the companionship of adoring angels for the beasts
of the stall. Human pride and self-sufficiency stand rebuked in His presence.
Yet this was but the beginning of His wonderful condescension. It would have
been an almost infinite humiliation for the Son of God to take man's nature,
even when Adam stood in his innocence in Eden. But Jesus accepted human-
ity when the race had been weakened by four thousand years of sin. Like
every child of Adam He accepted the results of the working of the great law
of heredity. What these results were is shown in the history of His earthly an-
cestors. He came with such a heredity to share our sorrows and temptations,
and to give us the example of a sinless life. . . . Into the world where Satan
claimed dominion God permitted His Son to come, a helpless babe, subject
to the weakness of humanity. He permitted Him to meet life's peril in common
with every human soul, to fight the battle as every child of humanity must
fight it, at the risk of failure and eternal loss."—"The Desire of Ages,"pp.48, 49.
                                          [29 1
    10. As the Son of man, what did Jesus learn? Of what did He become
the author? Heb. 5:7-9.
    11. In evidence that He had kept His father's law, hidden in His
heart, what challenging question was addressed Jesus' enemies near the
close of His life? John 8:46.
    12. Confirming Jesus' statement, "Him hath God the Father sealed,"
what further testimony was heard from heaven? Matt. 3:16, 17; John 12:
27, 28.
    NOTES.—"The word that was spoken to Jesus at the Jordan, 'This is My
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,' embraces humanity. God spoke to
Jesus as our representative. . . . The voice which spoke to Jesus says to
every believing soul, 'This is My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.' "
—Id., p. 113.
    "The religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God's glory is the motive
implanted by the Holy Spirit ; and only the effectual working of the Spirit
can implant this motive. Only the power of God can banish self-seeking and
hypocrisy. This change is the sign of His working. When the faith we accept
destroys selfishness and pretense, when it leads us to seek God's glory and not
our own, we may know that it is of the right order. 'Father, glorify Thy
name,' was the keynote of Christ's life, and if we' follow Him, this will be the
keynote of our life. He commands us to 'walk, even as He walked;' and
`hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.' "—
Id., p. 409.
    13. What was the experience of the disciples in the upper room during
their ten days of tarrying? Acts 1:14.
    NoTE.—"These disciples prepared themselves for their work. Before the
day of Pentecost they met together, and put away all differences. They were
of one accord. They believed Christ's promise that the blessing would be
given, and they prayed in faith."—Id., p. t27.
    "Christ's visible presence was about to be withdrawn from the disciples,
but a new endowment of power was to be theirs. The Holy Spirit was to be
given them in its fullness. . . . The Saviour knew that no argument, however
logical, would melt hard hearts, or break through the crust of worldliness and
selfishness. He knew that His disciples must receive the heavenly endow-
ment."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 30, 31.
    14. What work is to be accomplished for God's servants while the winds
of strife and commotion are being held in check by the angels? Rev. 7:1-3.
    15. Under the new covenant, where has God promised to write His law?
Jer. 31:31-33.
    16. What testimony is borne concerning that company heeding the last
gospel messages recorded in Revelation 14:6-11? Rev. 14:12.
    NOTE.—The psalmist, speaking for the Messiah, says: "Thy law is within
My heart." God promises to those who are of the Israel of God, "I will put.
My laws into their mind, and write them. in their hearts." Of those who are
sealed and chosen, the remnant church, He says, "Here are they that keep
the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." There is a close relation-
ship between the Saviour and God's earthly children. Each is sealed by the
working of the Spirit upon the heart to a life of complete obedience.
                                    (30]
    17. What character will have been attained by this company whom
John saw having "the seal of the living God"? Rev. 14:1, 5.
   NOTE.—"Now is the time to prepare. The seal of God will never be placed
upon the forehead of an impure man or woman. It will never be placed upon
the forehead of the ambitious, world-loving man or woman. It will never be
placed upon the forehead of men or women of false tongues or deceitful hearts.
All who receive the seal must be without spot before God—candidates for
heaven."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 216.
                         •
    18. Through whom alone may this perfectness of character be obtained?
Jer. 23:6; Rom. 3:22.
    NOTE.—" 'All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.' Everything that we of
ourselves can do is defiled by sin. But the Son of God 'was manifested to take
away our sins; and in Him is no sin.' Sin is defined to be 'the transgression of
the law.' But Christ was obedient to every requirement of the law. . . . When
we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His heart, the will is
merged in His will, the mind becomes one with His mind, the thoughts are
brought into captivity to Him; we live His life. This is what it means to be
clothed with the garment of His righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon
us, He sees, not the fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and deformity of sin,
but His own robe of righteousness, which is perfect obedience to the law of
 Jehovah."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 311, 312.

          The Holy Spirit and the Latter Rain
   MEMORY VERSE: "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon.
the dry ground: I will pour My Spirit upon thy seed, and My blessings upon thine off-
spring." Isa. 44:3.
                              INTRODUCTION
   "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the.
promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples. But like every other
promise, it is given on conditions. There are many who believe and profess to
claim the Lord's promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit,.
yet receive no benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and con-
trolled by the divine agencies. We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is
to use us. Through the Spirit God works in His people 'to will and to do of
His good pleasure.' But many will not submit to this. They want to manage
themselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those
who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the
Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand and reception. This.
                                        ( 31 ]
promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is
given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply
every soul according to the capacity to receive."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 672.
                                 THE LESSON
    1. What promise is given to those who return to the Lord with full
purpose of heart? Hosea 6:1.
    2. What experience is for those who "follow on to know the Lord"?
Verse 3.
    3. What is a cause of joy in heaven? Luke 15:7.
    NOTE.—"When sinners are led to give themselves to the Saviour, angels
bear the tidings heavenward, and there is great rejoicing among the heavenly
host. . . . A report is borne to heaven of every successful effort on our part
to dispel the darkness and to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ. As the
deed is recounted before the Father, joy thrills through all the heavenly host."
—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 154.
    4. What parable illustrates the heavenly Father's joy when a soul re-
turns to Him? Verses 11-24.
    NOTE.—"Arise and go to your Father. He will meet you a great way off.
If you take even one step toward Him in repentance, He will hasten to enfold
you in His arms of infinite love. His ear is open to the cry of the contrite soul.
The very first reaching out of the heart after God is known to Him. Never a
prayer is offered, however faltering, never a tear is shed, however secret, never
a sincere desire after God is cherished, however feeble, but the Spirit of God
goes forth to meet it."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 206.
    5. What gracious appeal and message await those who respond to the
Saviour's invitation? Rev. 3:20.
    6. What announcement is due the church and the world when the day of
the Lord is near? Joel 2:1.
    NOTE.—"To prepare a people to stand in the day of God, a great work of
reform was to be accomplished. God saw that many of His professed people
were not building for eternity ; and in His mercy He was about to send a mes-
sage of warning to arouse them from their stupor, and lead them to make
ready for the coming of the Lord."—"The Great Controversy," p. 311.
    7. How earnestly does the Lord, through the prophet, plead with His
remnant people? Verses 12-14.
    NoTE.—"I saw that the remnant were not prepared for what is coming
upon the earth. Stupidity, like lethargy, seemed to hang upon the minds of
most of those who profess to believe that we are having the last message. My
accompanying angel cried out with awful solemnity, 'Get ready ! get ready !
get ready ! for the fierce anger of the Lord is soon to come. His wrath is to be
poured out, unmixed with mercy, and ye are not ready'."—"Early Writings,"
p. 119.
   8. What blessed experience belongs to the members of the remnant
church who seek God earnestly? Verses 23-27.
. 9. How does God regard one who has friendship with the world? James
4:4.
                              132 7
    10. What does the Lord say of the spirit of the people when the latter
rain is due? Jer. 5:23, 24.
    11. What is the result of sins within the church? Verse 25.
    12. With a heaven-sent message to go to the world, where must that
message spring up and bring forth the fruits of righteousness? Hosea
10:12.
    NOTES.—"The garden of the heart must be cultivated. The soil must be
broken up by deep repentance for sin. Poisonous, satanic plants must be up-
rooted. The soil once overgrown by thorns can be reclaimed only by diligent
labor. So the evil tendencies of the natural heart can be overcome only by
earnest effort in the name and strength of Jesus. The Lord bids us by His
prophet, 'Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.' Sow to
yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy.' This work He desires to accom-
plish for us, and He asks us to cooperate with Him."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. 56.
    "Let me tell you that the Lord will work in this last work in a manner
very much out of the common order of things, and in a way that will be con-
trary to any human planning."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 300.
     13. In our individual experience, what must precede the outpouring of
the latter rain? Joel 2:23..
    NOTE.—"We may be sure that when the Holy Spirit is poured out, those
who did not receive and appreciate the early rain will not see or understand
the value of the latter rain. When we are truly consecrated to God, His love
will abide in our hearts by faith, and we will cheerfully do our duty in accord-
ance with the will of God.
     "But the little interest that has been manifested in the work of God by our
churches alarms me. I would ask all who have means, to remember that God
has intrusted this means to them to be used in the advancement of the work
which Christ came to our world to do. The Lord tells every man that in the
sight of God he is not the owner of what he possesses, but only a trustee. Not
thine, but Mine, saith the Lord. God will call you to account for your stew-
ardship."—Id., p. 399.
     14. What is an appropriate subject of prayer at this time? Zech. 10:1.
     NOTE.—"Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual
grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son of man.
This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter rain; and it
is for this added power that Christians are to send their petitions to the Lord
of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain.' In response, 'the Lord shall make
bright clouds, and give them showers of rain.' He will cause to come down
. . . the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain.'"—"Acts of the Apostles,'
p. 55.

      The Holy Spirit and the Kingdom of God
        A Spiritual Contest for the Supremacy of the World
   MEMORY VERSE: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness;
and all these things shall be added unto you." Matt. 6:33.

                              INTRODUCTION
    When Adam was'created he was endowed with life which might have been
as measureless as the unending years of eternity. Gen. 2:7. He was intrusted
with the family name—"son of God." Luke 3:38: He was given the dominion
and rulership of this earth. Gen. 1:26. In other words he was given a king-
ship. Through disobedience Adam lost: (a) the life that had been given to
him; (b) the family name; (c) his kingship over the family inheritance. Jesus
Christ came to this world to seek and to save that which was lost. This mis-
sion involved a spiritual warfare between Christ and Satan for the supremacy
of the world. When Jesus went back to heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit, "the
representative of the Captain of the Lord's host, to direct the battle."
                                 THE LESSON
    1. Where had the first battle for supremacy been fought? Rev. 12:7-9.
    2. What then became the place of conflict? Rev. 12:13.
    3. For what purpose did the Lord fix beforehand the time limit and
the boundary limit of all nations? Acts 17:26, 27.
    NorE.—One of God's purposes in the existence of organized human govern-
ments is that men may have opportunity to seek the Lord.
    4. When, in the divine plan for this world, was the division of nations
made? Deut. 32:8.
    5. How were the righteous and the wicked designated at that time?
Gen. 6:1, 2.
    NorE.—"For some time the two classes remained separate. The, race of
Cain, spreading from the place of their first settlement, dispersed over the
plains and valleys where the children of Seth had dwelt; and the latter, in
order to escape from their contaminating influence, withdrew to the moun-
tains, and there made their home. So long as this separation continued, they
maintained the worship of God in its purity. But in the lapse of time they
ventured, little by little, to mingle with the inhabitants of fhe valleys. This
association was productive of the worst results. 'The sons of God saw the
daughters of men that they were fair.' The children of Seth, attracted by the
                                        [ 34 3
beauty of the daughters of Cain's descendants, displeased the Lord by inter-
marrying with them. Many of the worshipers of God were beguiled into sin
by the allurements that were now constantly before them, and they lost their
peculiar, holy character. Mingling with the depraved, they became like them
in spirit and in deeds; the restrictions of the seventh commandment were dis-
regarded, 'and they took them wives of all which they chose.' "—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 81.

des, is impregnable to the assaults of Satan. But unless we do yield ourselves
to the control of Christ, we shall be dominated by the wicked one. We must
