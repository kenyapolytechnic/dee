                                USE THE MAP
    Wrto does not like to follow on a map the places mentioned in the Missions
Quarterly as the story of the fields abroad is presented in the missions exercise !
But frequently a blackboard on which to sketch a map, or a large map itself,
is not available; or perhaps one may be sitting too far away to see the details
of a map dearly. To make it easy for each member personally to •locate the
scene of the story for the week, future Sabbath School Quarterlies will contain
a map of the field to which the "Overflow" goes. This will be a regular feature.
Study the map at home also, and watch the onward progress of the message in
all the world. Seventh-day Adventists should be conversant with the geog-
raphy of all lands, and should follow intelligently every development of our
world-wide work.
                       THE OVERFLOW PLAN
    The Autumn Council (1933) voted to restore the slogan "Dollar Day" as
the goal for Sabbath schools in North America.
    A new schedule also was adopted for the "Overflow" offering on the Thir-
teenth Sabbath. When $60,000 is reached on a Thirteenth Sabbath, $1,000 over
and above the regular appropriation will go to the field designated as the
objective for that quarter. Above $60,000 ten per cent of the excess will be
added to the overflow. For instance, if the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering .is
$61,000, the overflow will be $1,100, and thus on up to whatever amount may
be received on the Thirteenth Sabbath, the base sum being $60,000. We believe
this will be a definite encouragement to larger giving on the part of many. Let
all rally to the consistent increase of the weekly offerings Sabbath by Sabbath
by which the regular work is maintained, and to increased liberality on each
Thirteenth Sabbath, that some special work may be accomplished.

     THE EPISTLES OF PAUL TO TIMOTHY
                                 INTRODUCTION
    The two Epistles of Paul to Timothy and the Epistle to Titus have been
designated the Pastoral Epistles. "They abound in instruction relative to the
oversight of the church and other duties of the Christian ministry. They also
abound in instruction suited for the churches themselves."
    Timothy was a resident of Lystra. His father was a Greek; his mother and
grandmother devout Jewesses (Acts 16:1), by whom he early was trained in
a knowledge of the Scriptures (2 Tim. 1:5; 3:14, 15).
    Ussher gives A. D. 65 as the time when Paul wrote the First Epistle to Timo-
thy, and 66 as the date of the writing of the Second Epistle.
    The first epistle is chiefly concerned with instruction as to Timothy's duties
and privileges as overseer of the church committed to his care, with counsel
and warning relative to the special dangers to be met. The second epistle must
be regarded "as the last known writing of Paul before his martyrdom, and in
that regard alone possesses an intense and unique interest. But for the general
guidance of the church there is something still more precious in instructions
prompted by the matured wisdom of the apostle, and addressed to his most
trusted followers, respecting the manner in which they should 'behave them-
selves,' as pastors, 'in the house of God' (1 Tim. 3:15). It would, indeed, have
been strange and unfortunate if we had been left without some such guidance.
The other epistles afford us all needful instruction respecting the great dog-
matic truths of Christianity, and the chief points of Christian morals. But
respecting the practical organization and government of the church, they furn-
ish only incidental hints. The deficiency is supplied by these three epistles.
They were written . . . near the close of the apostle's career, when it was be-
coming necessary for him to provide for the due government, after he should
have passed away, of the churches he had founded. Brief as they are, they
afford a clear insight into the principles by which he was guided, and they give
advice which in all ages of the church has been accepted as the apostolic stand-
ard of pastoral duty."—"The Bible Commentary," pp. 749, 750.
                               A Suggestion
   The author of these lessons suggests that the lesson scripture be read in its
entirety before the student engages in the verse-by-verse study. Thus a full
view of the lesson may be had before the details are dwelt upon.

      False Teachers; Christ's Abundant Grace
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 1.
  MEMORY VERSE: "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." 1 Tim. 1:15.

                                 THE LESSON
    1. By whose authority was Paul appointed an apostle of Christ? 1 Tim.
1:1.
    2. What close spiritual relationship existed between Paul and Timo-
thy? With what salutation does the epistle open? Verse 2.
    NorEs.—"The relation of Paul to Timothy is an example of one of those
beautiful friendships between an older and a younger man, in which each is
the complement of the other (1 Cor. 4:17; Phil. 2:22). . . . He was enthu-
siastic and devoted but at times showed signs of timidity, and the apostle
watched over him with tender interest."—"Through the Bible Day by Day,"
F. B. Meyer.
    "Paul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and he chose
him as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had taught Timothy in
his childhood were rewarded by seeing the son of their care linked in close
fellowship with the great apostle. Timothy was a mere youth when he was
chosen by God to be a teacher; but his principles had been so established by
his early education that he was fitted to take his place as Paul's helper. And
though young, he bore his responsibilities with Christian meekness. . . . Paul
loved Timothy, his 'own son in the faith.' The great apostle often drew the
younger disciple out, questioning him in regard to Scripture history; and as
they traveled from place to place, he carefully taught him how to do successful
work. . . . In his work, Timothy constantly sought Paul's advice and instruc-.
tion. . . . The Holy Spirit found in him one who could be molded and
fashioned as a temple for the indwelling of the divine Presence."—"Acts of the
Apostles," pp. 203-205.
    3. Why did Timothy remain in the city of Ephesus? Verses 3, 4.
    NOTE.—What thus far had been philosophies outside the church gradually
became heresies within it. There were at least three distinct kinds of error:
Jewish speculation and mystical interpretation concerning Old Testament mat-
ters ; the dualism of the East, which is defined as "the doctrine that the universe
is under the dominion of two opposing principles, a good and an evil," result-
ing in "a stern asceticism and an unblushing licentiousness;" and Greek phi-
losophy, leading to new and fanciful interpretations of the Scriptures of the
                                      f4 }
Old Testament. "By degrees these elements, combined in different proportions
and under various influences, began also to attach themselves to the doctrines
of Christianity."
    4. What is declared to be the aim of the commandment? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—The word "end" is here used in the sense of purpose, and the word
"charity" is otherwise translated "love." That is, "The purpose of the com-
mandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith
unfeigned." The Emphatic Diaglott and the Douay Version express the same
thought, the rendering of the Diaglott being as follows: "Now the end of the
commandment is love, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an un-
dissembled faith."
    The object of God in giving His law was that man should love God with
all his heart, and his. neighbor as himself. See Matt. 22:36-40.
  • In the succeeding verses Paul emphasizes this thought, showing that it is
God's purpose, through both His perfect law and His abounding grace to save
the worst of sinners if they will but yield to Him. And as an assurance that
God is able through the gospel to save to the uttermost all who come unto
God by Him, Paul presents his own experience, declaring that he was a blas-
phemer and a persecutor of the saints, even the chief of sinners. As God had
saved Saul of Tarsus, who slew the saints and persecuted them even to strange
cities, so He would save all who were willing to be saved. In the seventeenth
verse the apostle breaks forth in an expression of thanksgiving for the glorious
salvation provided in Christ Jesus. This chapter, from the fifth to the seven-
teenth verses, is a striking dissertation on the law and the' gospel.
    5. In swerving from "the commandment," to what have some turned?
What was the true condition of certain ambitious ones? Verses 6, 7.
    NorE.—"Some" in verse 6 probably alludes to the "some" of verse 3.
     6. Of what is Paul assured? Verse 8.
     7. For whom is the law made?' With what had Paul been intrusted?
Verses 9-11.
    NOTE.—"Paul guards himself against seeming to minimize the value of the
law. Properly understood it was of the uttermost use as a restraint to evil-
doers. Thus he preached according to the gospel committed to his trust. This
is a part of Christian teaching."—Dummelow's Commentary.
     8. For what did the apostle give thanks? Verses 12, 13.
    NorE.—Evidently it is the thought of the gospel committed to his trust
(verse 11) that stirs the author of this epistle to grateful memories. His own
life is an illustration of the power of the gospel to accomplish what the law
could not. It changed a blasphemer and persecutor into a humble apostle.
     9. With what was the abundant grace of God accompanied? Verse 14.
    10. What fact is worthy of universal acceptance? In comparing him-
self with others, what conclusion did Paul draw? Verse 15.
    11. What reason does the apostle give as to why mercy was shown to
him? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"The apostle breaks off into expressions of heartfelt thanks to God
for the abounding grace which had overcome his former obstinacy and blind-
ness. Only his ignorance could palliate his outrage and insult toward Christ,
                                    I53
who was now the beloved object of his entire surrender. He had been a blas-
phemer against God, a persecutor toward his fellow men, injurious, insolent,
full of overweening pride. He felt that he had been the chief of sinners, be-
cause he had sinned against more knowledge and opportunity than others. It
is only when we see God, that we know ourselves and repent in dust and
ashes."—"Through the Bible Day by Day," F. B. Meyer.
    12. With what beautiful reference to the King eternal does Paul con-
clude this allusion to his own experience? Verse 17.
    13. Upon what was the charge to Timothy based? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—Murdock's translation of the Syriac Testament reads: "This in-
junction I commit to thee, my son Timothy, according to the former predic-
tions concerning thee, that in them thou mightest war this good warfare."
    14. What disaster resulted as some were led to mat away their faith?
Who are mentioned by name? Verses 19, 20.
    NOTE.—" `Hymeneeus' is mentioned again as a heretical teacher in 2 Tim-
othy 2:17, 18, where one of his erroneous tenets is stated to be that the resur-
rection is past already.' Of 'Alexander' nothing is known, unless he be the
same with 'Alexander the coppersmith,' referred to by Paul in 2 Timothy 4:14,
as having done him much evil."—"The Bible Commentary,' vol. 3, p. 769.
    15. Of what are we all in danger? 1 Cor. 10:12.
    NOTE.—"He that is self-confident is already half fallen. He Who professes
to believe that God will absolutely keep him from falling finally, and neglects
watching unto prayer, is not in a safer state. He who lives by the moment,
walks in the light, and maintains his communion with God, is in no danger
of apostasy."—Adam Clarke.

                Instruction in Church Matters
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 2.
    MEMORY VERSE: "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
the Man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
1 Tim. 2:5, 6.
                           THE LESSON
   1. For whom should prayers be offered? 1 Tim. 2:1.
   NOTE.—"The fourth term, 'giving of thanks,' expresses that which ought
                                 (6)
 never to be absent from any of our devotions, gratitude for past mercies."—
 "New Testament Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
    Prayers not merely for ourselves or the church, but "for all men."
     2. As prayer for those in authority is answered, what will it mean in the
 life of God's children? Verse 2.
     NoTE.—In this world God has permitted to rulers authority to govern.
 "The powers that be are ordained of God." Rom. 13:1. "He removeth kings,
 and setteth up kings" (Dan. 2:21), "and giveth it [the kingdom] to whomso-
 ever He will, and setteth up over it the basest of men" (Dan. 4:17). That
 peace and quiet may reign, permitting a life of godliness and honesty, is a suit-
 able and fitting reason for every Christian to pray God in behalf of the human
 authorities in whose hands has been placed so much temporal power. As by
 God's permission men reign and are given power over men's lives and happi-
 ness, so by God's control their period of power may be seasons of happiness
 and peace, or the very reverse. Well may we pray for the intervention of God's
 Spirit that peace and quiet in government may make possible "all godliness
 and honesty" in the individual Christian's life.
     3. Anciently, what similar counsel was given to believers who were cap-
 tives in a heathen land? Jer. 29:7.
     4. What is the will of God our Saviour for all men? 1 Tim. 2:3, 4.
     NOTE.—"God's 'servants are to make use of every resource for enlarging
 His kingdom. The apostle Paul declares that it is 'good and acceptable in the
 sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come
 unto the knowledge of the truth,' that 'supplications, prayers, intercessions,
 and giving of thanks, be made for all men.' 1 Tim. 2:3, 4, 1. And James says,
 `Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way
 shall save a soul from death, and, shall hide a multitude of sins' James 5:20.
 Every believer is pledged to unite with his brethren in giving the invitation,
 `Come; for all things are now ready.' Luke 14:17. Each is to encourage the
 others in doing whole-hearted work. Earnest invitations will be given by a
 living church. Thirsty souls will be led to the water of life."—"Testimonies,"
 vol. 7, pp. 14, 15.
       5. How only is it possible for human beings to come to God? Verse 5,
  first part.
       NoTE.—There are not lords many and gods many—there is but one God,
  our heavenly Father. None other is entitled to our worship. And there is only
  one Mediator between man and God, that is, Christ Jesus our Lord. No man
  or woman, however good, no angelic being however exalted, is to come be-
  tween. Through Jesus only may we come in prayer to our heavenly parent.
  Of Jesus we read:
      "'He shall build the temple of the Lord.' By His sacrifice and mediation,
  Christ is both the foundation and the builder of the church of God. . . .
       " 'If any man sin, .we. have. an advocate with the Father.' His intercession
• is that of a pierced and broken body, of a spotless life. The wounded hands,
  the pierced side, the marred feet, plead for fallen man, whose redemption was
  purchased at such infinite cost."—"The Great Controversy," p. 416.
    6. To become the mediator between God and men, what nature did Christ
 take upon Himself? Verse 5, last part.
                                        [7 ]
    NOTE.—"Although Jesus Christ has passed into the heavens, there is still
a living chain binding His believing ones to His own heart of infinite love.
The most lowly and weak are bound' by a chain of sympathy closely to His
heart. He never forgets that He is our representative, that He bears our na-
ture."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 19.
    7. For what reason did Christ yield Himself up to death? When was
this fact attested? Verse 6.
    NorEs.—The Revised Version renders the latter part of verse 6, "The tes-
timony to be borne in its own times."
    "The Spirit, of God is freely bestowed, to enable every man to lay hold
upon the means of salvation. Thus Christ,. 'the true Light,' lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.' Men fail of salvation through their own willful
refusal of the gift of life."—"The Great Controversy," p. 262.
    8. What positive assertion does Paul make concerning his calling?
Verse 7.
    9. What is the will of God concerning the praying of men? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"It was the Jewish practice, not only in taking a solemn oath—or
in blessing—but also in prayer, to lift up the hands. Compare Psalms 28:2;
63:4. This seems to have been generally adopted by the early Christians as
the attitude in prayer."—"A New Testament Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
    We may notice with profit that doubt, as well as wrath, hinders the efficacy
of prayer.
    10. What counsel is given believing women relative to modest attire?
Verse 9.
    NOTES.—"The Bible teaches modesty in dress. 'In like manner also, that
women adorn themselves in modest apparel.' This forbids display in dress,
gaudy colors, profuse ornamentation. Any device designed to attract atten-
tion to the wearer or to excite admiration, is excluded from the modest apparel
which God's word enjoins. Our dress is to be inexpensive,—not with 'gold, or
pearls, or costly array.' "—"Ministry of Healing," p. 287.
    "Many look upon these injunctions as too old-fashioned to be worthy of
notice; but He who gave them to His disciples understood the dangers from
the love of dress in our time, and sent to us the note of warning. Will we heed
the warning and be wise? Extravagance in dress is continually increasing.
The end is not yet. Fashion is constantly changing, anthour sisters follow in
its wake, regardless of time or expense. There is a great amount of means ex-
pended upon dress, when it should be returned to God the giver."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 4, pp. 630, 631.
   11. What sort of adornment befits women professing godliness? Verse 10.
   NOTE. "Many of our sisters are persons of good ability, and if their tal-
ents were used to the glory of God, they would be successful in winning many
souls to Christ. Will they not be responsible for the souls they might have
saved, had not extravagance in dress and the cares of this world so crippled ,
and dwarfed their God-given powers that they felt no burden of the work?
Satan invented the fashions, in order to keep the minds of women so engrossed
with the subject of dress that they could think of but little else. . . .
   "God would be pleased to see our sisters clad in neat, simple apparel, and
earnestly engaged in the work of the Lord. . . . Were our sisters conscientious
                                       (8)
Bible Christians, seeking to improve every opportunity to enlighten others, we
should see scores of souls embracing the truth through their self-sacrificing
endeavors alone."—Id., pp. 629, 630.
    12. What similar instruction is given by the apostle Peter? 1 Peter
3:1-4.
    13. What further instruction concerning women is given? 1 Tim. 2:
11, 12.
    NOTE.—"The spirit that Christ manifests toward us is the spirit that hus-
band and wife are to manifest toward each other. 'As Christ also hath loved
us,' walk in love.' As the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be
to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, even as
Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it.'
    "Neither the husband nor the wife should attempt to exercise over the
other an arbitrary control. Do not try to compel each other to yield to your
wishes. You cannot do this and retain each other's love. Be kind, patient, and
forbearing, considerate, and courteous."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 361. .
    "Let there be mutual love, mutual forbearance. Then marriage, instead
of being the end of love, will be as it were the very beginning of love. The
warmth of true friendship, the love that binds heart to heart, is a foretaste of
the joys of heaven."—Id.,
    14. What statements are made concerning our first parents? Verses
13, 14.
    NOTE.—"Eve had been the first in transgression; and she had fallen into
temptation by separating from her companion, contrary to the divine direc-
tion. It was by her solicitation that Adam sinned, and she was now placed in
subjection to her husband. Had the principles enjoined in the law of God
been cherished by the fallen race, this sentence, though growing out of the
results of sin, would have proved a blessing to them; but man's abuse of the
supremacy thus given him, has too often rendered the lot of women very bit-
ter, and made her life a burden.
    "Eve had been perfectly happy by her husband's side in her Eden home;
but, like restless modern Eves, she was flattered with the hope of entering a
higher sphere than that which God had assigned her. In attempting to rise•
above her original position, she fell far below it. A similar result will be
reached by all who are unwilling to take up cheerfully their life duties in ac-
cordance with God's plan. In their efforts to reach positions for which He
has not fitted them, many are leaving vacant the place where they might be
a blessing. In their desire for a higher sphere, many have sacrificed true
womanly dignity, and nobility of character, and have left undone the very
work that Heaven appointed them."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 58, 59.
   15. What promise is made to believing womanhood? Verse 15.

   " `Goo loveth a cheerful giver,' and those who love Him will give freely and
cheerfully when by so doing they can advance His cause and promote His
glory. The Lord never requires His people to offer more than they are able,
but according to their ability He is pleased to accept and bless their thank
offerings. Let willing obedience and pure love bind upon the altar every offer-
ing that is made to God; for with such sacrifices He is well pleased"."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 5, p. 269.

                                  THE LESSON
    1. In one of the epistles of Peter, what titles are applied to Christ?
1 Peter 2:25.
    2. What is said of a man aspiring to be an overseer or bishop in the
church? 1 Tim. 3:1.
    NoTE.—According to commentators, bishop means overseer, or one who
has the charge and direction of anything. The most common acceptance of
the word is that which is given in Acts 20:28, and Philippians 1:1, margin.
In these texts it signifies the pastor of a church, and is equivalent to elder.
    3. What essential qualifications of a bishop or elder are given? Verse 2.
    NorEs.—In order that the gospel may be proclaimed and the work of
God's people be done in harmony with His will, "the church itself must be
properly governed, and recognize the true meaning of her existence. Turning
to the subject of government, the apostle dealt with two orders, bishops and
deacons. The bishop is an overseer—that is, one whose duty it is to watch over
the flock, and know them, to become acquainted with their condition and their
needs. After declaring the excellence of the office, he proceeded to describe the
qualifications necessary for its fulfillment. The picture is that of a perfectly
balanced life, neither given to excess in any direction, nor ascetic. The office
of the deacon was . . . complementary and cooperative. In a description of
the qualifications therefore for this work the apostle was as careful as when
dealing with the calling of the bishop."—"The Analyzed Bible," pp. 218, 219.
   4. What other becoming virtues of a spiritual leader are stressed?
Verse 3.
    5. What responsibility has an elder of the church toward his own fam-
ily? For what would a failure here indicate unfitness? Verses 4, 5.
   NOTE.—"The gospel net gathers both good and bad. It takes time for
character to be developed; there must be time to learn what men really are.
The family of the one suggested for office should be considered. Are they in
subjection? Can the man rule his own house with honor? What character
                                     10
have his children? Will they do honor to the father'S influence? If he has
no tact, wisdom, or power of godliness at home, in managing his own family,
it is safe to conclude that the same defects will be carried into the church, and
the same unsanctified management will be seen there. It will be far better
to criticize the man before he is put into office than afterward; better to pray
and counsel before taking the decisive step, than to labor to correct the con-
sequences of a wrong move."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 618.
    6. Why should a new convert of inexperience not be chosen to leader-
ship? Verse 6, margin.
    NOTES.—"Not a novice." This "would mean a plant that was not strong,
or not fitted to bear the severity of storms; that had not as yet struck its.
roots deep, and could not resist the fierceness of a cold blast. Then the word
comes to mean a new convert; one who has had little opportunity to test his
own faith, or to give evidence to others that he would be faithful to the trust
committed to him. The word does not refer so much to one who is young in
years, as one who is young in faith."—Barnes.
    "Among God's people are some who have had long experience in His work,
men who have not departed from the faith. Notwithstanding the great trials
throughwhich they have passed, they have remained faithful. These men ,
should be regarded as tried and chosen counselors. They should be respected,
and their judgment should be honored by those who are younger or who have
had less experience, even though these younger men may be in official posi-
tions."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 497.
    7. How should a bishop be regarded by people outside the church? Why
is this essential? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"Who are without the church; that is, of those who are not Chris-
tians. This includes, of course, all classes of those who are not Christians—
heathen, infidels, Jews, moral men, and scoffeq. The idea is, that he must have
a fair reputation with them for integrity of character. His life must be in their
view upright. He must not be addicted to anything which they regard as in-
consistent with good morals. His deportment much be such that they shall
regard it as not inconsistent with his profession. He must be true and just
and honest in his dealings with his fellow men, and so live that they cannot
say that he has wronged them. He must not give occasion for scandal or re-
proach."—Barnes.
    8. What similar standards for deacons are given by Paul? Verses 8, 9.
    NoTE.—Concerning the appointment of the seven deacons in the early
church we read, "The appointment of the seven to take the oversight of special
lines of work, proved a great blessing to the church. These officers gave care-
ful consideration to individual needs as well as to the general financial inter-
ests of the church; and by their prudent management and their godly example,
they were an important aid to their fellow officers in binding together the
various interests of the church into a united whole."—"The Acts of the Apos-
tles," p. 89.
    Helpful instruction regarding the responsibilities and work of the deacon
is given in the "Church Manual," pages 30-34.
    9. Before being chosen assistants or deacons, what course is to be taken
with candidates? Verse 10.
                                      1 11 1
    10. What qualifications should be possessed by the wife of a deacon?
Verse 11.
    11. What is a deacon's responsibility toward his family? Verse 12.
    12. What blessings come to one filling the deacon's office acceptably?
Verse 13.
    NOTE.—The rendering of this verse in the Twentieth Century New Testa-
ment is: "Those who have filled that post with honor gain for themselves an
honorable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they
place in Christ Jesus."
    13. What hope did Paul entertain? Verse 14.
    14. In case he should be detained, what knowledge would Timothy pos-
sess? What beautiful description is given of the house of God? Verse 15.
    NOTE.—Edgar J. Goodspeed renders verses 14, 15: "I hope to come to you
soon, but I am writing you all this so that if I am delayed, you may know
how we are to conduct ourselves in the household of God, for it is the church
of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."
    15. What elements comprise the mystery of godliness? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—This rhythmical expression, containing three pairs of antitheses,
is better comprehended as arranged in the American Revised Version and
many other translations: "And without controversy great is the mystery of
godliness;
                        "He who was Manifested in the flesh,
                            Justified in the spirit,
                               Seen of angels,
                          Preached among the nations,
                            Believed on in the world,
                               Received up in glory."

   "He was eternally rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, that we through
His poverty might be made rich. He was clothed with light and glory, and
was,surrounded with hosts of heavenly angels, waiting to execute His com-
mands. Yet He put on our nature, and came to sojourn among sinful mortals.
Here is love that no language can express. It passes knowledge. Great is the
mystery of godliness. Our souls should be enlivened, elevated, and enrap-
tured with the theme of the love of the Father and the Son to man. The fol-
lowers of Christ should here learn to reflect in some degree that mysterious
love preparatory to joining all the redeemed in ascribing 'Blessing, and honor,
and glory, and power unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
Lamb forever and ever.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 215.

    MEASURING the progress of our Sabbath schools in soul saving in any coun-
try, far or near, the results are encouraging. During a recent quarter 469 new
schools were added, with over 30,000 new Sabbath school members. Surely
this is cause for rejoicing, for we know that the gospel of Jesus' soon coming
is being given to many people. During that same quarter 53,000 received honor
cards for regular attendance at Sabbath school and daily study of the lesson,
while 4,000 received bookmarks for yearly records. Were you among this
number?

     Apostasy Foretold; "Be Thou an Example"
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 4.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of
the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity." 1 Tim.
4:12.
                                THE LESSON
    1. What explicit warning pertaining to latter times did the Spirit give?
1 Tim. 4:1.
    NoTcs.—Modern spiritism "is but a revival, in a new form, of the witch-
craft and demon worship that God condemned and prohibited of old. It is
foretold in the Scriptures, which declare that 'in the latter times some shall
depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.' "
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 686.
    "They will apostatize from the faith, i. e. from Christianity; renouncing
the whole system in effect, by bringing in doctrines which iender its essential
truths null and void, or denying and renouncing such doctrines as are essen-
tial to Christianity as a system of salvation. A man may hold all the truths
of Christianity, and yet render them of none effect by holding other doctrines
which counteract their influence; or he may apostatize by denying some es-
sential doctrine."—Adam Clarke.
     2. What is said of the conscience of these hypocritical teachers of lies?
Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"Just what took place in Pharaoh's heart, will take place in every
soul that neglects to cherish the light, and walk promptly in its rays. God
destroys no one. The sinner destroys himself by his own impenitence. When
a person once neglects to heed the invitations, reproofs, and warnings, of the
Spirit of God, his conscience becomes seared, and the next time he is admon-
ished, it will be more difficult to yield obedience than before. And thus with
every repetition. Conscience is the voice of God, heard amid the conflict of
human passions; when it is resisted, the Spirit of God is grieved."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 5, p. 120.
     3. What two false "doctrines" are here mentioned? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—Verses 1-3 present a picture of conditions "in the latter times."
Especially in these last days would some be "forbidding to marry." The Old
Testament taught that it was permissible for prophets, priests, Levites, and
all those connected with the service of the Lord to marry. The New Testa-
ment alike gives express allowance -for the clergy to marry. (See 1 Cor. 9:5;
                                       [ 13 ]
Titus 1:6; 1 Tim. 3:2, 4, 5, 11, 12.) But some would depart from faith in
God's word.
    "We see the fulfillment of the Spirit's prediction in the enforced celibacy
of the priesthood in the Roman Church and in those organizations which, under
the pretense of holiness, forbid all marriage of its members as fornication.
    "The word translated 'meats' is broma, meaning food of any kind. See
John 4:34; Matt. 14:15. In that latter text it is rendered 'victuals,' its literal
meaning. 'Commanding to abStain from foods' does not mean instruction or
advice as to what foods are good, proper, or injurious. It does not say to
abstain from flesh meats or cereals or fruit; but from food in general. . . .
The prophecy relates to enjoined and stated fasts as meritorious in them-
selves, even as the forbidding to marry. These can be seen in plenty in the
enjoined fasts in the Roman Church.
    "Fasts are often beneficial if voluntary and reasonable; they are good for
the spiritual, mental, and physical man; but they should be voluntary. . . .
[Read Col. 2:20-23, A. R. V.] Fast if need be, but be sure it is not will worship,
self-righteousness, or from mere commandments of men.
    "God has created all that man needs for food, of every variety. Let the
Christian select from that abundance, as he is able, that which will glorify
God."—"Questions and Answers," M. C. Wilcox, pp. 193, 194.
    4. What is stated concerning "every creature of God"? In what spirit
should our food be received? Verse 4.
   NorE.—" 'Every creature,' meaning a created thing, whether animal, min-
eral, or vegetable, would in common sense include only the things that God.
gave for food. Because 'every creature' is used, we would not gather that it
meant that men were bound to eat everything that God had created. Nothing
that God has created for man's good and His glory is to be rejected at the
command of men. Let every child of God know the truth of this, and so eat
with thanksgiving."—Id., p. 194.
    5. By what is our food consecrated? Verse 5.
    NorE.—" 'Sanctified through the word of God and prayer' would cer-
tainly seem to limit the food to be used to that which God had Himself given
and set apart for man's use, and upon which man could with assurance pray
for God's blessing."—Ibid.
    6. What use was Timothy to make of these truths received of the Spirit
through the apostle Paul? Verse 6.
    7. Against what was Timothy to shut his mind? For what was he to
train himself? Verse 7.
    8. What contrast is made between bodily exercise and godliness?
Verse 8.
    NOTES.-"It is no evidence that a man has zeal for God because he works
himself up into a frenzy of excitement and gesticulation. 'Bodily exercise,'
says the apostle, `profiteth little.' The Saviour of the world would have His
colaborers represent Him; and the more closely a man walks with God, the
more faultless will be his manner of address, his deportment, his attitude,
and his gestures. Coarse and uncouth manners were never seen in our Pat-
tern, Christ Jesus. He was a representative of Heaven, and His followers
must be like Him."—"Testimonies," vol. 4,.p. 405.
                                        14
    " 'Godliness is profitable,' as it tends greatly to alleviate the sorrows of life.
Godliness is profitable because it imparts sweetness to the enjoyments and
an additional relish to the pleasures of life. It is a libel on piety, to represent
it as something gloomy and morose. 'Godliness,' because it confers upon its
possessors pleasure peculiarly its own, 'is profitable.' Godliness is profitable,
as it disarms death of its terrors and the grave of its gloom. 'Godliness is
profitable,' for it prepares its possessor for eternal glory. From this subject
we learn the importance—the value—of religion."—"The Biblical Illustrator,"
p. 190.
     9. With what words is the foregoing counsel reenf orced? Verse 9.
    10. What was the motive of these early disciples in toiling and suffer-
ing reproach? Verse 10.
   NOTE.—"For this end—to obtain this glorious promise, this highest blessed-
ness here, that endless life with God hereafter, to win this glorious promise—
we Christian missionaries and teachers care for no toil, however painful—
shrink from no shame, however agonizing."—"A New Testament Commen-
tary," C. J. Ellicott.
    11. What was Timothy to do with this knowledge of practical godliness
in contrast to strained austerity, myths, and fables? Verse 11.
    12. Instead of being looked down upon because of his youth, in what
was Timothy to be an example to his fellow Christians? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"Now, supposing Timothy to have been eighteen years old, A. D. 50,
when he became Paul's assistant, he would be no more than thirty-two, A.D. 64,
two years after the apostle's release, when it is supposed this epistle was writ-
ten. Wherefore, being then in the period of life which, by the Greeks as well
as the Romans, was considered as youth, the apostle with propriety might
say to him, 'Let no man despise thy youth.' "—Adam Clarke.
    13. To what three special points in his public ministry was Timothy to
attend? Verse 13.
    14. What earnest exhortation is next given by Paul? Verse 14.
    15. That Timothy's spiritual progress might be evident to all, what
was he advised to do? What eternal blessing would reward his faithful-
ness? Verses 15, 16.
    Norz.—"The teachers of truth must be wise men, very careful of their
words and actions. They must be men who will give meat in due season to the
flock of God; men who will not give the least sanction to low standards of
living; men who have that faith which works by love, and purifies the soul
from all carnal thoughts and desires. . . . Nothing takes so strong a hold
upon the affections, nothing reaches so fully down to the deepest motives of
action, nothing exerts so potent an influence upon the life, and gives so great
firmness and stability to the character, as the religion of Christ. It leads its
possessor ever upward, inspiring him with noble purposes, teaching him pro-
priety of deportment, and imparting a becoming dignity to every action."—
"Gospel Workers," p. 127.
    The admonitions to Timothy are appropriate to us all. Attention to read-
ing, to doctrine, to meditation, is as necessary in the spiritual life of the be-
lievers in the pew as to the preacher in the pulpit.

   Gentleness in Rebuke; Directions Concerning
                     Widows
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 5:1-16.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
from the world." James 1:27.

                                    THE LESSON
   1. What method was Timothy to follow in reproving men and women?
1 Tim. 5:1, 2.
    2. What is the responsibility of the church toward widows who are
really dependent? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"One of the earliest cares of the Christian church was the main-
tenance of widows out of its charitable funds. . . . Similar provision would
doubtless be made for these helpless members of the society wherever a church
was founded; and directions might be needed to prevent any misapplication
of charity in their case by admitting the claims of those who had children or
relatives naturally responsible for their support. Paul therefore instructs
Timothy (verses 3-8) to honor with the alms of the church only those who
are 'widows indeed,' being destitute of relatives on whom the duty of sup-
porting them ought to rest, and themselves bearing a good character."—
"The Bible Commentary," vol. 3, p. 784.
    3. In case a widow has children or other descendants, whose is the re-
sponsibility of her support? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—Many translations of the Scriptures give "grandchildren" instead
of "nephews." The idea seems to be that children "learn first to show piety at
home" by providing for aged or helpless parents or relatives.
    We would. naturally expect to find in the church of Christ the same con-
sideration given to widows as was the custom in the days of Israel. Read
Deuteronomy 24:17-21; Exodus 22:22, 23 ; and also Malachi 3:5, all of which
are applicable in the last days.
    4. Upon whom only can a widow, left quite alone, place her depend-
ence? How complete will be her trust? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—"The widows indeed—a class, no doubt, in those days of selfish
luxury and of extreme misery and hopelessness, often utterly neglected, and
                                   ( 16 )
not unfrequently left to starve and to perish in want and misery. . . . It is
more than probable that there were, especially in these Eastern cities, a very
large class of these desolate and unprotected women."—"A New Testament
Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
   5. What widow is spoken of with honor in connection with her ex-
perience when the infant Jesus was brought to the temple? Luke 2:36-38.
     6. In what sad condition is the pleasure-loving widow? 1 Tim. 5:6.
    NoTss.—"In pleasure" "properly means to live in luxury, voluptuously;
to indulge freely in eating and drinking; to yield to the indulgence of the appe-
tites. It does not indicate grossly criminal pleasures; but the kind of pleasure
connected with luxurious living, and with pampering the appetites. It is
probable that in the time of the apostle there were professedly Christian
widows who lived in this manner—as there are such professing Christians of
all kinds in every age of the world.
    " 'Is dead while she liveth.' To all the proper purposes of life she is as if
she were dead. There is great emphasis in this expression, and nothing could
convey more forcibly the idea that true happiness is not to be found in the
pleasure of sense. There is nothing in them that answers the purposes of life.
They are not the objects for which life was given, and as to the great and
proper designs of existence, such persons might as well be dead."—Barnes.
    "Only through the surrender of our will to God is it possible for Him to
impart life to us. Only by receiving His life through self-surrender is it possible,
said Jesus, for these hidden sins, which I have pointed out, to be overcome. It
is possible that you may bury them in your hearts, and conceal them from
human eyes, but how will you stand in God's presence? If you cling to self,
refusing to yield your will to God, you are choosing death. To sin, wherever
found, God is a consuming fire."—"Mount of Blessing," • p. 96.
    7. That widows might live free from reproach, what was Timothy in-
structed to do? Verse 7.
    8. What condemnation is passed upon one who fails to care for his own.
relatives and household? Verse 8.
    9. What were the qualifications of women admitted into the class of
deserving widows? Verses 9, 10.
    10. Why were younger widows to be excluded from the special list?
Verses 11, 12.
    11. Into what would the visits of young widows most likely have degen-
erated had they been appointed to official responsibilities? Verse 13.
    12. What was Paul's judgment as to the wisest course for younger
women? Verse 14.
    13. What unfchtunate course already had been taken by some? Verse 15.
    14. What responsibility should be assumed by any believer related to
widows? Why is this essential? Verse 16.

                      Elders; Personal Advice
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 5:17-25.
    MEMORY VERSE: "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
an men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the
glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." Titus 2:11-13.

                                   THE LESSON
     1. What respect was to be shown toward elders who presided well?
1 Tim. 5:17.
     NOTE.—"The elders to whom Timothy was to accord some special honor,
were those who, in the congregations and Christian schools of so great a city
as Ephesus, in addition to their many duties connected with organization and
administration, were distinguishing themselves in a marked manner by their
preaching and teaching."—"A New Testament Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
     The apostle here presents the obligation which rests upon the church to
give respect and esteem to faithful elders in recognition of their valuable serv-
ice in the gospel of Christ in rightly dividing the word of' truth and in main-
taining the pure doctrines taught by Christ and His, apostles. To the. Thessa-
lonians, Paul wrote, "We beseech you, brethren, to know them which labor
among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to esteem
them very highly in love for their work's Sake:" '1 Thess. 5:12, 13. And Peter,
following Pentecost when the number of believers hair 'greatly multiplied, said,
"It is not reason that we should leave the word .of God, and serve tables." Acts
6:2. Paul, in his counsel to Timothy, in the expression "especially they who
labor in the word and doctrine," therefore may have but emphasized this same
principle laid down by Peter, how no calling exceeds in importance the minis-
tration of the word of God, and to those thus called of God and who,serve the
church well, to such is due "double honor."
    2. What quotation from the Old Testament does Paul use? Verse 18,
first part; Deut. 25:4.
    3. With what statement that Jesus made is the idea reenforced that a
gospel worker is to be supported by the believers? 1 Tim. 5:18, last part;
Luke 10:7.
    NoTE.—"The payment of the tithe was but a part of God's plan for the
support of His service.. Numerous gifts and offerings were divinely specified.
Under the Jewish system, the people were taught.to'cherish a spirit of liberality,

     "It is not God's purpose that Christians whose privileges far exceed those
 of the Jewish nation, shall give less freely than they gave. 'Unto whomsoever
-much is given,' the Saviour declared, 'of him shall be much required.' The
 liberality required of the Hebrews was largely to benefit their own nation;
 to-day the work of God extends over all the earth. In the hands of His fol-
 lowers, Christ has placed the treasures of the gospel, and upon them He has
 laid the responsibility of giving the glad tidings of salvation to the world.
 Surely our obligations are much greater than were those of ancient Israel."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 336-338.
     4. On what condition only should an accusation against an elder of the
 church be entertained? Verse 19.
    5. What precedent did Paul have for the instruction in verse 19?
Deut. 17:6.
    6. How was sin to be dealt with? What reason is given for this method?
1 Tim. 5:20.
    NOTE.—If in carrying out the instruction of the apostle each one would be
careful to follow the example of the Master, there would be no danger in lit-
erally following this injunction. Of Jesus it is said. "Christ Himself did not
suppress one word of truth, but He spoke it always in love. He exercised the
greatest tact, and thoughtful, kind attention in His intercourse with the people.
He was never rude, never needlessly spoke a severe word, never gave needless
pain to a sensitive soul. He did not censure human weakness. He fearlessly
denounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity, but tears were in His voice as
He uttered His scathing rebukes. He wept over Jerusalem, the city He loved,
that refused to receive Him,.the way, the truth, and the life. They rejected
Him, the Saviour, but He regarded them with pitying tenderness, and sorrow
so deep that it broke His heart. Every soul was precious in His eyes. While
He always bore Himself with divine dignity, He bowed with tenderest regard
to every member of the family of God. In all men He saw fallen souls whom
it was His mission to save."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 352, 353.
    Our danger lies in the spirit with which we administer rebuke, and our
mistaken choice of time and place. Let us before one word is spoken, be cer-
tain that every rebuke we give is to be administered in Christ's stead and with
His tender, compassionate love.
    7. What solemn charge is given Timothy? Verse 21.
    NorE.—"Very solemnly is Timothy adjured to carry out the varied duties
of his great charge, the government of the church of Ephesus, impartially—
doing nothing hastily, ever watchful of himself. Paul has just pressed upon
him how needful it was to exercise care in the case of an accused presbyter
[elder]. He must listen to no charge except several competent witnesses were
produced to support the accusation. He now reminds Timothy—the chief
presbyter—of the ever-present unseen witnesses of his conduct (see Heb. 12:1).
In that awful presence—in sight of the throne of God, with Messiah on the
right hand, and the angels, the chosen attendants and ministers of God, gath-
ering round about the throne—would Timothy guide and rule the congrega-
tions of Christians in that famous Eastern city.
    "The church of Ephesus had been built up and consolidated by the personal
presence and influence of Paul, resident there some three years; and at the time
                                     [ 19 )
when Paul wrote to Timothy it was second in numbers and in influence to none
of the early groups of congregations (except, perhaps, to the Christian com-
munities of Syrian Antioch). Placed by an apostle as the first head of such a
community, intrusted with one of the greatest and most important charges in
Christendom, Timothy indeed needed to be watchful. Well might Paul remind
him of the tremendous witnesses who would be present in his hour of trial."—
"A New Testament Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
     8. What threefold counsel is next given? Verse 22.
    NOTE.—"Said the inspired apostle, 'Lay hands suddenly on no man.' In
some of our churches the work of organizing and of ordaining elders has been
premature; the Bible rule has been disregarded, and consequently grievous
trouble has been brought upon the church. There should not be so great haste
in electing leaders as to ordain men who are in no way fitted for the responsible
work,—men who need to be converted, elevated, ennobled, and refined, before
they can serve the cause of God in any capacity."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 617.
     9. In view of Timothy's frequent ailments, what advice does Paul give?
Verse 23.
    NOTE.—That the apostle here advises Timothy to take even a little wine of
a fermented nature is unthinkable in view of the very definite instruction given
to the people of God concerning intoxicants, as found in Proverbs 20:1; 23:
29-32; Isaiah 5:11, 22 ; Habakkuk 2:5, 15. In Leviticus 10:8-10 the priests are
forbidden to touch intoxicants, while Proverbs 31:4 states, "It is not for kings
to drink wine." Even in partaking too liberally of sweet wine (grape juice),
there was a tendency to develop a taste for the juice of the grape that might
lead to carelessness concerning its use "when it moveth itself aright" in the cup.
It is possible that Timothy, knowing this tendency, was refusing himself the
physical help which the sweet wine might bring him. Here the apostle admon-
ishes him to partake for the sake of his physical well-being.
    10. In his necessary judgments of men and women in the church, what
two classes of sins would be encountered? Verse 24.
   NOTE.—"I warn all who profess the name of Christ'to closely examine them-
selves, and make full and thorough confession of, all their wrongs, that they
may go beforehand to judgment, and that the recording angel may write par-
don opposite their names."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 263.
    11. What is said concerning good deeds? Verse 25.
   NOTE.—Weymouth renders this verse: "So also the right actions of some
are obvious, and those that are not cannot remain forever hidden."


    "THE study of the Bible demands our most diligent effort and persevering
thought. As the miner digs for the golden treasure in the earth, so earnestly,
persistently, must we seek for the treasure of God's word.
    "In daily study the verse-by-verse method is often most helpful. Let the
student take one verse, and concentrate the mind on ascertaining the thought
that God has put into that verse for him, and then dwell upon the thought
until it becomes his own. One passage thus studied until.its significance is clear,
is of more value than the perusal of many chapters with no definite purpose
in view, and no positive instruction gained."—"Education," p. 189.

               False Teaching; True Wealth
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 6:1-10.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might
be rich." 2. Cor. 8:9.

                               THE LESSON.
    1. What attitude were Christian slaves to show toward their heathen
masters? 1 Tim. 6:1, first part.
   NOTE,—"In the days of the early Christians the institution of slavery was
universal throughout the Roman Empire, and was recognized and established
by law. It gave rise to questions of the most delicate and difficult character
within. the membership of the church.
   "Should a master who became a Christian set his slaves free? Should a
slave who accepted Christ demand his liberty? How should Christian masters
and slaves be related to one another?
    "Not unnaturally, therefore, when Paul has instructed Timothy as to the
duty of the pastor toward the various classes in his congregation, he turns last
of all•to tell.him of the conduct which he is to enjoin upon Christian slaves."
—"The Pastoral Epistles of Paul," Charles R. Erdman, p. 69.
   2. What reason does Paul give for the assertion that believing servants
should honor their masters? Verse 1, last part.
    NOTE.—"There would indeed be a grave danger of this, if the many Chris-
tian slaves, instead of showing increased zeal for their masters' service, should,
as the result of the teaching of the new society they had joined, become morose,
impatient of servitude, rebellious. Very soon in pagan society would the name
of that Redeemer they professed to love, and the beautiful doctrines He had
preached, be evil spoken of, if the teaching were for one moment suspected of
inculcating discontent or suggesting rebellion. An act, or course of acting, on
the part of professed servants of God which gives occasion to the enemies of
the Lordito,blaspheme, is ever reckoned in Holy Scripture as a sin of the deepest
dye. Compare Nathan's words to King David (2 Sam. 12:14) and Paul's
reproach to the Jews (Rom. 2:24)."—"A New Testament Commentary," C. J.
Ellicott.
  3. What was to be the relationship of a Christian slave to his believing
master? Verse 2.
                                 [ 21 ]
    NorEs.—"An equally great temptation would confront slaves when their
masters became Christians. They would be assured of their equality before
God, and of their common brotherhood in Christ. Presuming upon these rela-
tionships they might be inclined to show toward their masters unbecoming
familiarity and contempt."—"The Pastoral Epistles of Paul," Charles R. Erd-
man, p. 69.
     Dr. Adam Clarke says: "The civil state in which a man was before his con-
version is not altered by that conversion ; nor does the grace of God absolve
him from any claims which either the state or his neighbor may have on him.
All these outward things continue unaltered."
     4. In what language did Paul elsewhere give similar counsel? 1 Cor.
7:20-24.
     5. Whose words or counsel was Paul in reality expressing? 1 Tim. 6:3.
     6. What is said of the spirit and knowledge of those who teach differ-
ently? Verse 4, first part.
     7. What is the fruitage of idle speculation and arguments about words?
Verse 4, last part; verse 5, first part.
    NoTE.—"Paul, with righteous anger, flames out against these perverse men,
who, using the name of Christ, substitute their shortsighted views of life for
His, throw doubt and discredit upon the teaching of His chosen apostles and
servants, stir up discord, excite party spirit, barring, often hopelessly, the
onward march of Christianity. The true, Christian teaching is healthy, prac-
tical, capable of being carried out by all orders in the state, by every age or
sex, by bond and free. The spurious Christian maxims of these men deal with
subtle, useless, unpractical questions, which have no influence on ordinary
life, and only tend to stir up strife and useless inquiry, and to make men dis-
contented and rebellious. These unhappy men he first characterizes as `proud:'
literally, blinded with pride."—"A New Testament Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
     8. How is godliness or religion regarded by these corrupt disputers?
What attitude should Timothy take toward them? Verse 5, last part.
     9. What is godliness with contentment declared to be? Verse 6.
     10. What two evident but oft-forgotten truths does Paul mention?
Verse 7. -            •
    NoTE.—"Paul declares, 'Godliness with contentment is great gain.' Although
rich persons may devote their whole lives to the one object of getting riches,
yet as they brought nothing into the world, they can carry nothing out. They
must die and leave that which cost them so much labor to obtain. They staked
their all, their, eternal interest, to obtain this property, and have lost both
worlds."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 541.
    11. With what should we be satisfied? Verse 8.
    NorE.—"Gbdrcannot approve of the least degree of covetousness or selfish-
ness, and He abhors the prayers and exhortations of those who indulge these
evil traits. As Satan sees that his time is short, he leads men on to be more and
more selfish and Covetous, and then exults as he sees them wrapped up in them-
selves, ddie, penurious 'and selfish. If the eyes of such could be opened, they
would see Satan in hell ish triumph, exulting over them, and laughing at the
folly of those who accept his suggestions and enter his snares. . . . Every self-
ish, covetous person will fall out by the way."—"Early Writings," pp. 268, 269.
                                       ( 22 )
    12. Into what do people fall who strive to become rich? What is the
final result? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—"Paul shows what risks men will run to become rich. But many
are determined to be rich; this is their study; and in their zeal eternal consid-
erations are overlooked. They are blinded by Satan, and make themselves
believe that it is for good purppses they desire this _gain; they strain their
consciences, deceive themselves, and are constantly coveting riches. Such have
erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. They
have sacrificed their noble, elevated principles, given up their faith for riches,
and if not disappointed in their object, they are disappointed in the happiness
which they supposed riches would bring. They are entangled, perplexed with
care; they have made themselves slaves to their avarice, and compelled their
families to the same slavery, and the advantages they reap are 'many sorrows.' "
—"Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 541, 542.
    13. What is declared to be the root of all sorts of evil? Verse 10, first
part.
    NoTE.—Dr. Adam Clarke in his comment on the expression "root of all evil"
states that it would perhaps be better translated, "of all these evils; i. e., the
evils enumerated above; for it, cannot be true that the love,of money is the
root of all evil, it certainly was not the root whence the transgression of Adam
sprang; but it is the root whence all the evils mentioned in the preceding verse
spring. This text has been often very incautiously quoted; for how often do
we hear, 'The scripture says, Money is, the root of all evil'! No, the scripture
says no such thing. Money is the root of no evil, nor is it an evil of any kind;
but the love of it is the root of all the evils mentioned here."
    The love of money has its root in covetousness. Covetousness underlies all
evil. It was Lucifer's coveting the place occupied, by .God that led him into
sin. He coveted the worship, the honor, the power, belonging to the Creator.
Those who will be rich., those who bend every power of their being to acquire
the possession of money, fall into hurtful lusts which drown men in perdition.
This is an age of the world when this one thing has well-nigh become the over-
mastering ambition. Colossal fortunes are amassed only to become a curse to
the possessor, to drag the soul down to perdition. From all this God seeks to
deliver His children.
    14. In their eagerness to get riches, what sad course had some believers
taken? Verse 10, last part.
    NoTE.—"The law of tithing was founded upon an enduring principle, and
was designed to be a blessing to man. The system of benevolence was arranged
to prevent that great evil, covetousness Christ saw that in the prosecution of
business the love of riches would be the greatest cause. of rooting true godliness
out of the heart. He saw that the love of money would freeze deep and hard
into men's souls, stopping the flow of generous impulses, and closing their
senses to the wants of the suffering sand the afflicted. 'Take heed,' was His oft-
repeated warning, 'and beware of covetousness.' 'Ye cannot serve God and
mammon.' The oft-repeated and striking warnings of our Redeemer are in
marked contrast with the actions of His professed followers who evidence in
their lives so great eagerness to be rich, and who show that the words of Christ
are lost upon them. Covetousness is one of the most common and popular sins
of the last days, and has a paralyzing influence upon the soul."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 3, p. 547.

        A Stirring Appeal; Counsel to the Rich
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Timothy 6:11-21.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly
all things to enjoy." 1 Tim. 6:17.

                                  THE LESSON
    1. What is Timothy personally charged to do? What counsel is given
him? 1 Tim. 6:11, first part.
    NOTE.—"These things" refers to the love of money and attendant evils
spoken of in verses 9 and 10.
    "The poor need not envy the rich. Wealth makes no difference in the
audit of eternity. A man cannot eat more than a certain amount of food, and
wear more than a certain amount of clOthing. If we have enough, why envy
others? The true wealth of life is in self-renunciation and beneficence. How
different from the money grabber is the man of God who flees such things, and
follows after righteousness."—F. B. Meyer.
    2. What six attributes is he admonished to seek to attain? Verse 11,
last part.
    3. In place of the struggle of the covetous, what fight was Timothy to
wage? Upon what was he to lay hold? Verse 12, first clause.
    4. To what experience in Timothy's life does Paul refer? Verse 12, last
clause.
    NOTE.—The American Revised Version renders "bast professed a good pro-
fession before many witnesses" as "didst confess the good confession in the
sight of many witnesses." A .similar rendering is given in many other trans-
lations.
    We find but little recorded of the young man Timothy as a witness for the
gospel, but Paul in his letter to the Hebrews cites one fact which may have a
bearing on the occasion referred to in verse 12, last clause. He says in Hebrews
13:23, "Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty." Likely Timothy
had been imprisoned while in Rome, and called upon at that time to defend his
faith. That to Paul would have been an outstanding occasion for witnessing a
good confession. Or it may have been at his ordination to the ministry, as
some have thought. In that tiying period of the history of the church he had
doubtless many occasions to witness for Christ before the multitude.
                                        [ 24 ]
    5. In the presence of whom is Timothy charged? What reference is
made to God the Father and to Jesus Christ? Verse 13.
    6. What conversation passed between Jesus and Pilate? How plainly
did Jesus testify before Pilate that He was Messiah, the King? John
18:33-37.
    7. What charge was given Timothy? Until what time was he to prove
his faithfulness? 1 Tim. 6:14.
    NOTE.—"Two things are mentioned here: 1. That the commandment itself
—the whole doctrine of Christ, should be kept entire. 2. That his life should
be agreeable to that doctrine. Keep it without spot—let there be no blot on
the sacred book; add nothing to it; take nothing from it; change nothing in it.
Deliver down to thy successors the truth as thou hast had it from God Himself.
    " `Unrebukable.' ["Without reproach," A. R. V.] Let there be nothing in
thy conduct or spirit contrary to this truth. Keep the truth, and the truth will
keep thee."—Adam Clarke.
    8. When is this "appearing" to be manifest? Verse 15.
    NoTE.—"Many who have called themselves Adventists have been time
setters. Time after time has been set for Christ to come; but repeated failures
have been the result. The definite time of our Lord's coming is declared to be
beyond the ken of mortals. Even the angels who minister unto those who shall
be heirs of salvation, know not the day nor the hour. 'But of that day and
hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only.'
Because the times repeatedly set have passed, the world is in a more decided
state of unbelief than before in regard to the near advent of Christ. They look
upon the failures of the time setters with disgust; and because men have been
so deceived, they turn from the truth substantiated by the word of God, that
the end of all things is at hand. Those who so presumptuously preach definite
time, in so doing gratify the adversary of souls; for they are advancing infi-
delity rather than Christianity."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 307.
   9. What sublime description is given of God? Verse 16.
   NOTE.—"The apostle Paul exclaims, '0 the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His
ways past finding out !' But though 'clouds and darkness are round about Him,
righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.' We can so far
comprehend His dealing with us, and the motives by which He is actuated,
that we may discern boundless love and mercy united to infinite power. We
can understand as much of His purposes as it is for our good to know ; and
beyond this we must still trust the might of the Omnipotent, the love and
wisdom of the Father and Sovereign of all."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 699.
    10. In what language does David refer to the Eternal One? Ps. 104:1-4.
    11. Returning to the subject of riches, what advice is offered to the
possessors of them? How does God bestow His gifts? 1 Tim. 6:17.
    NOTE.—"Paul in this letter to Timothy would impress upon his mind the
necessity of giving such instruction as should remove the deception which so
easily steals upon the rich, that because of their riches they are superior to
those who are in poverty; that because of their ability to acquire they are
superior in wisdom and judgment—in short, that gain is godliness. Here is a
fearful deception. How few heed the charge which Paul commissioned Timothy
                                      [ 25 ]
to make to the rich ! How many flatter themselves that their acquisitiveness
is godliness !"—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 541.
    12. To what use should riches be put? Verse 18.
    NoTE.—"Look at the life of many who claim to be Christians. The Lord
has endowed them with capabilities, and power, and influence ; He has intrusted
them with money, that they may be coworkers with Him in the great redemp-
tion. All His gifts are to be used in blessing humanity, in relieving the suffering
and the needy. We are to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to care for the
widow and the fatherless, to minister to the distressed and downtrodden. God
never meant that the widespread misery in the world should exist. He never
meant that one man should have an abundance of the luxuries of life, while
the children of others should cry for bread. The means over and above the
actual necessities of life are intrusted to man to do good, to bless humanity."
—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 370.
    13. What will be accomplished by the proper use of means? Verse 19.
    NoTE.—The reading of the Twentieth Century New Testament is helpful:
"Urge upon them to show kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be
open-handed and generous, storing up for themselves what in the future will
prove to be a good foundation, that they may gain the only true life."
    14. In conclusion, what earnest counsel does Paul give? What was
Timothy to avoid? Verse 20.
    15. What caused some to go astray? With what blessing does Paul end
his first letter to Timothy? Verse 21.

                    Exhortations to Timothy
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Timothy 1.
    MEMORY VERSE: "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He
is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day." 2 Tim. 1:12.

        INTRODUCTORY THOUGHT TO THE SECOND EPISTLE
    "The Second Epistle to Timothy was written by Paul from Rome during
his second imprisonment in that city, about the year A. D. 66. We may suppose
that shortly after the writing of the First Epistle to Timothy the apostle had
been arrested at Nicopolis, `the city of victory,' in Epirus (see Titus 3:12),
probably on the capital charge of being connected with the burning of Rome
(A. D. 64), and after a short delay had been conveyed to Italy. . . . It was no
                                      [ 26 ]
doubt shortly after this first hearing, that Paul, feeling that the end for him
was at hand, wrote this Second Epistle to Timothy. The exact date of the
martyr's passing to his rest is unknown. . . . Notwithstanding the urgent
summons, no tradition speaks of Timothy again looking on the face of his
beloved master."—"A New Testament Commentary," C: J. Ellicott.
   The reading of "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 485-513, will prove most
helpful in connection with the study of the last five lessons of this series.
                                THE LESSON
    1. Upon whose authority was Paul an apostle? What promise was he
to make known? 2 Tim. 1:1.
    2. What greeting does Paul use? Verse 2.
    NorE.—"This is the last epistle of the great apostle, who was apparently
awaiting sentence. He had already had audience with Cmsar, and escaped
(2 Tim. 4:16, 17) ; but there could be no doubt as to the ultimate issue. When
Paul indited these words he was imprisoned in the Mamertine dungeon, exposed
to the chill ague of its damp walls, reeking with pestilence and recalling the
miseries of generations of condemned criminals. There was one desire for the
fulfillment of which he yearned. He longed to see once more the dear friend
of earlier years, whom he had led into this life of stern suffering, and whose
spirit seems to have been somewhat overwhelmed by its severity. It was this
that led Paul to dispatch this second letter, filled with advice and exhortation
in case Timothy could not come, but specially full of desire that he should come
before winter set in and traveling becamedifficult. (2 Tim. 4:9, 21.) .
Though Paul had lost all things, he had gained Christ. 'Glorious apostle!
Would that every leader's voice could burst, as he falls, into such a trumpet
sound, thrilling the young hearts that pant in the good fight and must never
despair of final victory!'"—"Through the Bible Day by Day," F. B. Meyer.
    3. What does Paul say of his own experience in serving God? How con-
tinuously was Timothy remembered in prayer by Paul? Verse 3.
    4. What longing did Paul have? Why? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—"Sitting day after day in his gloomy cell, knowing that at a word
or a nod from Nero his life might be sacrificed, Paul thought of Timothy, and
determined to send for him. To Timothy had been committed the care of the
church at Ephesus, and he had therefore been left behind when Paul made his
last journey to Rome. Paul and Timothy were bound together by an affection
unusually deep and strong. Since his conversion, Timothy had shared Paul's
labors and sufferings, and the friendship between the two had grown stronger,
deeper, and more sacred, until all that a son could be to a loved and honored
father, Timothy was to the aged, toil-worn apostle. It is little wonder that
in his loneliness and solitude, Paul longed to see him."—"Acts of the Apostles,"
pp. 498, 499.
    5. What spiritual gift possessed by Timothy, did Paul especially re-
member? In whom did this faith first dwell? Verse 5.
    6. What suggestion did Paul make? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—"It seems, from the general tenor of the epistle, that Timothy was
deeply cast down by the imprisonment of Paul. Timothy, as well as the martyr
himself, was conscious that the end of that great and glorious career of his old
master was at last come; and the heart of the younger man sank—as well it
                                       [ 27 ]
might—under the prospect of having to fight the Lord's battle at Ephesus—
that famous center of Greek culture and of Oriental luxury—against enemies
without and enemies within, alone, and without the help of the great genius,
the master mind, and the indo mitable courage of the man who for a quarter
of a century had been the guiding spirit of Gentile Christianity, and his dear
and intimate friend. . . . The Greek word rendered 'stir up' literally means to
kindle up, to fan into flame."—"A New Testament Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
     7. The Spirit given us of God is of what nature? Verse 7.
    8. Of what therefore was Timothy not to be ashamed? On the contrary
what should he be willing to face if need be? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—It would have been easy for Timothy to fear and to be ashamed of
his old friend and teacher, for "after a time, the unbelieving Jews conceived
the idea of fastening upon Paul the crime of instigating the burning of Rome.
Not one of them thought for a moment that he was guilty; but they knew that
such a charge, made with the faintest show of plausibility, would seal his doom.
Through their efforts, Paul was again arrested, and hurried away to his final
imprisonment. . . .
    "Upon his arrival at Rome, Paul was placed in a gloomy dungeon, there
to remain until his course should be finished. Accused of instigating one of
the basest and most terrible of crimes against the city and the nation, he was
the object of universal execration."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 489, 490.
    9. Of what is the author of this letter assured? Upon what does salva-
tion rest? Verse 9.                                     •
    10. How and when was the love of God made apparent? What was ac-
complished through the advent of our Saviour? Verse 10.
    11. Of what was Paul appointed a herald? To whom? Verse 11.
    12. To what had Paul's appointment brought him? What was his atti-
tude? Why was he courageous? Of what was he persuaded? Verse 12.
    NOTES.—"Wherever Paul_ was,—whether before scowling Pharisees, or Ro-
man authorities; before the furious mob at Lystra, or the convicted sinners in
the Macedonian dungeon; whether reasoning with the panic-stricken sailors
on the shipwrecked vessel, or standing alone before Nero to plead for his life,—
he had never been ashamed of the cause he was advocating. The one great
purpose of his Christian life had been to serve Him whose name had once filled
him with contempt; and from this purpose no opposition or persecution had
been able to turn him aside. His faith, made strong by effort and pure by sac-
rifice, upheld and strengthened him."—"Gospel Workers," pp. 107, 108.
    "The sanctifying power of the truth should lead every one who teaches in
the Sabbath school, or holds a position in our institutions, to have such an
experience that he may say, 'I know whom I have believed.' "—"Testimonies
on Sabbath School Work," p. 85.
    13, To what did Paul exhort Timothy to hold? What was he to keep?
Verses 13, 14.
   14. To what sad fact did Paul allude? Verse 15.
   NOTE.—"Large numbers of Christians, if not whole churches, repudiated
their connection with the great father of Gentile Christianity, and possibly
disobeyed some of his teaching. What, in fact, absolutely took place in Asia
                                     ( 28 I
while Paul lay bound, waiting for death in Rome, had been often threatenea
in Corinth and in other centers. Party feeling ran high in those days, we know ;
and one of the most sorrowful trials the great-hearted Paul had to endure in
the agony of his last witnessing for his Lord, was the knowledge that his name
and teaching no longer was held in honor in some of those Asia churches so
dear to him."—"A New Testament Commentary," C. J. Ellicott.
    15. In striking contrast to his traitorous friends, who loyally and boldly
had stood by Paul? What ministrations are mentioned? Verses 16-18.
    NOTE.—"In this trying time Paul's heart was cheered by frequent visits
from Onesiphorus. This warm-hearted Ephesian did all in his power, to lighten
the burden of the apostle's imprisonment. His beloVed teacher was in bonds
for the tnuth's sake, while he himself went free; and he spared himself no
effort to make Paul's lot more bearable."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 490.

 Enduring Hardship; the Danger of Controversy
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Timothy 2:1-14.
    MEMORY VERSE: "It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with Him, we
 shall also live with Him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we deny Him,
'He also will deny us." 2 Tim. 2:11, 12.

                                 THE LESSON
    1. Since many believers in Asia had turned away from Paul, how did
he counsel Timothy? 2 Tim. 2:1.
    2. What was Timothy to do with the truths received of Paul in the
hearing of many witnesses? What was then to follow? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—" 'Among many witnesses.' These . . . included pagans and Jews,
the rich and poor, the untaught sinners of the Gentiles and the skilled rabbis
trained in the schools of Jerusalem and Alexandria.
    " 'The same commit thou to faithful men.' Not to men merely who were
`believers' in Jesus Christ. This, of course, was intended, but the 'faithful men'
here denoted loyal, trusty souls—men who, under no temptation, would betray
the charge committed to them."—"A New Testament Commentary," C. J.
Ellicott.
   3. What must Timothy endure? What comparison is made? Verse 3.
   NOTE.—"It is now an easy and pleasant task to preach the truth of the third
angel's message, in comparison with what it was when the message first started,
                                        [ 29 3
 when the numbers were few, and we were looked upon as fanatics. Those who
 bore the responsibility of the work in the rise and early progress of the mes-
sage, knew what conflict, distress, and soul anguish were. Night and day the
 burden was heavy upon them. They thought not of rest or convenience even
 when they were pressed with suffering and disease. The shortness of time called
 for activity, and the laborers were few.
     "Frequently, when brought into strait places, the entire night has been spent
 in earnest, agonizing prayer, with tears, for help from God, and for light to
shine upon His word. . . .
     "Men who now go forth to preach the truth, have things made ready to
their hand. They cannot now experience such privations as the laborers in
present truth have endured before them. The truth has been brought out, link
after link, till it forms a clear, connected chain. To bring the truth out in such
clearness and harmony has required careful research. Opposition, the most
 bitter and determined, drove the servants of God to the Lord and to their
Bibles. Precious indeed to them was the light which came from God."—"Tes-
timonies," vol. 3, pp. 326, 327.
     4. What lesson can a Christian worker learn from a soldier? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—"Thus the apostle emphasized the minister's need of unreserved
consecration to the Master's service. The minister who is wholly consecrated
to God refuses to engage in business that would hinder him from giving himself
fully to his sacred calling. He is not striving for earthly honor or riches; his
one purpose is to tell others of the Saviour, who gave Himself to bring to
human beings the riches of eternal life. His highest desire is not to lay up
treasure in this world, but to bring to the attention of the indifferent and the
disloyal the realities of eternity. He may be asked to engage in enterprises
which promise large worldly gain, but to such temptations he returns the an-
swer, 'What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his
own soul?'"—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 366.
     5. How must an athlete compete if he expects the wreath of victory?
Verse 5.
     6. Who first receives a share of the fruits of the earth? Verse 6.
  7. What help was assured to Timothy as he gave thought to the apostle's
words? Verse 7.
    8. What was Timothy ever to keep before his mind? Verse 8.
    9. For what did Paul suffer imprisonment? In spite of his bonds what
cause of rejoicing did he find? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—"It could not be expected that Paul, a poor and friendless prisoner,
would be able to gain the attention of the wealthy and titled classes of Roman
citizens. To them vice presented all its glittering allurements, and held them
willing captives. But from among the toil-worn, want-stricken victims of their
oppression, even from among the poor slaves, many gladly listened to the words
of Paul, and in the faith of Christ found a hope and peace that cheered them
under the hardships of their lot.
    "Yet while the apostle's work began with the htuible and the lowly, its
influence extended until it reached the very palace of the emperor. Rome was
at this time the metropolis of the world. The haughty Cmsars were giving laws
to nearly every nation upon the earth. King and courtier were either ignorant
of the humble Nazarene, or regarded Him with hatred and derision. And yet
                                      ( 30 )
in less than two years the gospel found its way from the prisoner's lowly home
into the imperial halls. Paul is in bonds as an evildoer; but 'the word of God
is not bound.' "—Id., pp. 461, 462.
    10. For whom did Paul gladly endure all things? To what end? Verse 10.
    11. What Christian maxim did he quote? Verses 11, 12.
    12. What is the consequence of our disowning Christ? Verse 12, last part.
    13. Even though we may be unfaithful, what is true of Christ? What
can He not do? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—"Those who have understood these words as containing soothing,
comforting voices for the sinner, for the faithless Christian who has left his
first love, are gravely mistaken. The passage is one of distinct severity—may
even be termed one of the sternest in the Book of Life; for it tells how it is
impossible even for the pitiful Redeemer to forgive in the future life. 'He can-
not deny Himself'—cannot treat the faithless as though he were faithful—
cannot act as though faithfulness and faithlessness were one and the same thing.
The Christian teacher, such as Timothy, and the members of his flock likewise,
must remember that, sure and certain as are the promises of glory and happi-
ness to those who love the Lord and try to live His life, so surely will fall the
chastisement on all who are faithless and untrue."—"A New Testament Com-
mentary," C. J. Ellicott.
    14. What charge was to be given the believers by Timothy? What is
the fruitage of idle argument? Verse 14.
    NOTE.—Dr. E. J. Goodspeed's translation reads as follows: "Remind men
of these things. Charge them before God to avoid idle arguments which do no
one any good and only bring destruction on those who listen to them."

     The Danger of Controversy; the Work o a
                 Servant of God
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Timothy 2:15-26.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." 2 Tim. 2:15.

                            THE LESSON
   1. What instruction was given to Timothy to which we should all give
heed? What sort of workman does God desire? 2 Tim. 2:15.
                                      131 1
    NorE.—"The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living. Rulers
and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and authority, thinking men
and women of all classes, have their attention fixed upon the events taking
place about us. They are watching the strained, restless relations that exist
among the nations. They observe the intensity that is taking possession of
every earthly element, and they recognize that something great, and decisive is
about to take place,—that the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.
    "Angels are now restraining the winds of strife, that they may not blow
until the world shall be warned of its coming doom; but a storm is gathering,
ready to burst upon the earth; and when God shall bid His angels loose the
winds, there will be such a scene of strife as no pen can picture.
    "The Bible, and the Bible only, gives a correct view of these things. Here
are revealed the great final scenes in the history of our world, events that
already are casting their shadows before, the sound of their approach causing
the earth to tremble, and men's hearts to fail them for fear."—"Education,"
pp. 179, 180. Surely this is a time when every believer should heed the admo-
nition of this verse of Scripture.
    2. What should we all shun? Why? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"Their tendency is to alienate the soul from God, and to lead to
impiety. Such kinds of disputation are not merely a waste of time, they are
productive of positive mischief. A man fond of contention in religious things
is seldom one who has much love for the practical duties of piety, or any very
deep sense of the distinction between right and wrong. You will'not usually
look for him in the place of prayer, nor can you expect his aid in the conver-
sion of sinners, nor will you find that he has any very strict views of religious
obligation."—Barnes.
    3. To what are "profane babblings" likened? Who are mentioned as
examples? Verse 17.
    Nom.—"But from irreligious and frivolous talk hold aloof, for those who
indulge in it will proceed from bad to worse in impiety, and their teaching will
spread like a running sore. Hymenmus and Philetus are men of that stamp."
—Weymouth's Translation.
   Of these false teachers nothing is known beyond the mention, in the First
Epistle to Timothy, of Hymenwus, who, regardless of what Paul said con-
cerning him (1 Tim. 1:20), was apparently still continuing in his evil way.
Some commentators think these men were Jews or Samaritans. Their names
are probably given as examples of the teachers of error to whom Paul was
referring—famous leaders, no doubt, in their erroneous forms of doctrine.
    4. What false teaching was disseminated by that class represented by
Ilymenmus and Philetus? What influence did their teaching have upon
some? Verse 18.
    Nora.—The false teaching of these, men is compared to a canker, or "gan-
grene," margin. No man at any time can safely hold to a single error of doc-
trine, any more than he can safely be satisfied to have some part of his body
affected by the first stage of mortification.
    5. Notwithstanding the departure of some from the faith, what is true
of the church of Christ? What twofold inscription is engraved upon "the
foundation"? Verse 19.
                                      [ 321
    NOTE.—"Is there not enough taking place about us to show us the dangers
that beset our path? Everywhere are seen wrecks of humanity, neglected
family altars, broken-up families. There is a strange abandonment of prin-
ciple, a lowering of the standard of morality ; the sins are fast increasing which
caused the judgments of God to be poured upon the earth in the Flood and in
the destruction of Sodom by fire. We are nearing the end. God has borne
long with the perversity of mankind, but their punishment is no less certain.
Let those who profess to be the light of the world, depart from all iniquity."
—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 601.
    6. With what words will Christ dismiss "many" "in that day"? Matt.
7:23.
    NorE.—"I never knew you." Awful words will they be in the final judg-
ment. Jesus Christ is. not the minister of sin. He came to save from sin, not in
sin. He died to "redeem us from all iniquity [lawlessness, lawbreaking], and
purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." Titus 2:14.
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that faith in Christ leads to sin cleansing,
clean living, and righteousodoing.
    7. With what figure did Paul illustrate the different kinds of leaders
and members always to be found in the church? 2 Tim. 2:20.
    NoTE.—"Here the apostle carries on the allusion introduced in the preced-
ing verse. As the foundation of God refers to God's building, namely, the whole
system of Christianity, so here theogreat house is to be understood of the same ;
and the different kinds of vessels mean the different teachers, as well as the
different kinds of members. In this sacred house at Ephesus there were vessels
of gold and silver—eminent, holy, sincere, and useful teachers' and members;
and also vessels of wood and of earth—false and heretical teachers, such as
Hymenmus and Philetus, and their followers. There are also in such houses
vessels employed, some in a more honorable, others in a less honorable, office."
—Adam Clarke.
    8. If one would "be a vessel unto honor," "meet for the Master's use,"
what must he do? Verse 21.
    9. From what was Timothy to flee or turn away? For what was he to
strive? In company with whom? Verse 22.
    10. What should be avoided? Why? Verse 23.
   11. What attitude should a servant of God at all times manifest toward
others? Verse 24.
   12. In what spirit should he correct the errors of opponents? With
what hope? Verses 25, 26.


      "THE great work of life is character building; and a knowledge of God is
 the foundation of all true education. To impart this knowledge, and' to mold
'the character in harmony with it, should be the object of the teacher's work.
 The law of God is a reflection of His character. Hence the psalmist says, 'All
  Thy commandments are righteousness;' and 'through Thy precepts I get under-
 standing.' God has revealed Himself to us in His word and in the works of
  creation. Through the volume of inspiration and the books of nature, we are
  to obtain a knowledge of God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 596.

             The Sin and Error of the Last Days
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Timothy 3.
   MEMORY VERSE: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profit-
able for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the
man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

                                   THE LESSON
    1. What warning does Paul give concerning the last days? 2 Tim. 3:1.
    2. What are some of the characteristics of those living just before the
second coming of Christ? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"All these evils are to manifest themselves among church members,
professed Christians. They have 'a form of godliness,' but deny 'the power
thereof ;' they 'keep up a make-believe of piety, and yet live in defiance of its
power;' they 'keep up a form of religion,' yet 'they will have nothing to do
with it as a force;' they have 'an appearance of religion, while denying its
power;' they keep up 'the forms of religion,' while 'resisting its influence.' . . .
    "The passage quoted, 2 Timothy 3:1-5, . . . is God's own photograph of
religious conditions which were to prevail in 'the last days.' That it is a good
likeness can be readily seen by a comparison of religious conditions with its
clear statements."—"The Return of Jesus," C. B. Haynes, p. 193.
    3. What further characterization is given of people of the last days?
Upon what are their affections really centered? Verses 3, 4.
    NOTE.—"Like ancient Israel, the church has dishonored her God by de-
parting from the light, neglecting her duties, and abusing her high and exalted
privilege of being peculiar and holy in character. Her members have violated
their covenant to live for God and Him only. They have joined with the selfish
and world-loving. Pride, the love of pleasure, and sin have been cherished, and
Christ has departed. His Spirit has been quenched in the church. Satan works
side by side with professed Christians; yet they are so destitute of spiritual
discernment that they do not detect him. They have not the burden of the
work. The solemn truths they profess to believe are not a reality to them.
They have not genuine faith."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 441, 442.
    4. What contradictory attitude toward religion is adopted by these so-
called Christians? What course toward them should be taken by the true
believer? Verse 5.
   NOTE.—The catalogue begins with "lovers of their own selves," that vice
                                          (34 3
which excludes all love for others; it closes with "lovers of pleasures," such
extreme worldliness that it shuts out all love of God. "Having a form of god-
liness, but denying the power thereof." Such men and women keep up a show
of observing the outward forms of religion, but renounce its power and its
influence over the heart and the life. They openly deny the guidance of a
spiritual power in their lives. Although wearing the uniform of Christ, they
dishonor His name, and do the gravest injury to His cause.
    5. What illustration is furnished of the life and work of these hypo-
critical professors of religion? Verse 6.
    6. Although always learning, what inability was manirest? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"That some of these false teachers laid claim to occult arts, to a
knowledge of magic and sorcery, is clear from the statement contained in the
next verse, where certain sorcerers of the time of Moses are compared to them."
—C. J. Ellicott.
    7. With whom were false teachers compared? How did they relate
themselves to the truth? Why? Verse 8.
    Nom.—The names of Jannes and Jambres are not mentioned elsewhere in
the Bible. They are supposed to be two of the magicians mentioned in Exodus
as opposing their miracles to those of Moses and Aaron. "The point of the
remark of the apostle here, is, that they resisted Moses by attempting to imitate
his miracles, thus neutralizing the evidence that he was sent from God. In like
manner, the persons here referred to, opposed the progress of the gospel by
setting up a similar claim to that of the apostles; by pretending to have as
much authority as they had; and by thus neutralizing the claims of the true
religion, and leading off weak-minded persons from the truth. This is often
the most dangerous kind of opposition that is made to religion."—Barnes.
    8. What reassuring statement is added? Verse 9.
    9. What had Timothy had opportunity to observe? From what source
had help come to Paul? Verses 10, 11.
    10. What is the common heritage of the godly? Verse 1 2.
    Nom.—Concerning the final conflict between the truth and its enemies,
Mrs. E. G. White says: "Conscientious, obedience to the word of God will be
treated as rebellion. Blinded by Satan, the parent will exercise harshness and
severity toward the believing child; the Master or mistress will oppress the
commandment-keeping servant. Affection will be alienated; children will be
disinherited, and driven from home. The words of Paul will be literally ful-
filled, 'All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.' As the
defenders of truth refuse to honor the Sunday sabbath, some of them will be
thrust into prison, some will be exiled, some will be treated as slaves. To human
wisdom, all this now seems impossible; but as the restraining Spirit of God
shall be withdrawn from men, and they shall be under the control of Satan,
who hates the divine precepts, there will be strange developments. The heart
can be very cruel when God's fear and love are removed."—"The Great Con-
troversy," pp. 607, 608.
   11. In what words does the apostle indicate that we cannot expect the
world's conversion? Verse 13.
   NorE.—The idea that the world is growing better and better as the years
pass has become deeply intrenched in the hearts of those who believe that
                                       [35}
gradually the world will be converted and the millennium ushered in. Pleasing
as this doctrine may be,"it is contrary to the teachings of Christ and His
apostles, who declared ttathe wheat and the tares are to grow together until
the harvest, the end of the world; that 'evil men and seducers shall wax worse
and worse ;' that 'in the last days perilous times shall come ;' and that the king-
dom of darkness shall continue until the advent of the Lord, and shall be con-
sumed with the spirit of His mouth, and be destroyed with the brightness of
His coming."—Id., p. 321.
    12. To what was Timothy to cling? What two facts was he to remem-
ber? In contrast with all other writings, what power is possessed by the
Holy Scriptures? Verses 14, 15.
    13. From what divine source does all Scripture come? For what is it
profitable? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"It is impossible for any human mind to exhaust even one truth
or promise of the Bible. One catches the glory from one point of view, another
from another point; yet we can discern only gleamings. The full radiance is
beyond our vision. As we contemplate the great things of God's word, we look
into a fountain that broadens and deepens beneath our gaze. Its breadth and
depth pass our knowledge. As we gaze, the vision widens; stretched out before
us we behold a boundless, shoreless sea. Such study has vivifying power. The
mind and heart acquire new strength, new life."—"Education," p. 171.
    14. For what purpose are the Holy Scriptures given? Verse 17.
    NOTES.—"That the man of God may be perfect." "The object is not merely
to convince and to convert him; it is to furnish all the instruction needful for
his entire perfection. . . . There is no deficiency in the Bible for man in any
of the situations in which he may be placed in life; and the whole tendency of
the book is to make him who will put himself fairly under its instructions,
absolutely perfect."—Barnes.
    "This standard is not one to which we cannot attain. In every command
or injunction that God gives, there is a promise, the most positive, underlying
the command. God has made provision that we may become like unto Him,
and He will accomplish this for all who do not interpose a perverse will, and
thus frustrate His grace."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 116.

                      South and West China
         Make the Thirteenth Sabbath Dollar Day in your school. If
     all Sabbath schools in North America would give as many dollars
     as there are church members, South and West China would have
     a generous "overflow" this quarter. Lift mightily that this goal
     may be reached.

         A Solemn Charge; Paul's Work Ended
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Timothy 4.
    MEMORY VERSE: "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the right-
eous Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that
love His appearing." 2 Tim. 4:6-8.

                                 THE LESSON
    1. In the presence of whom was Timothy given his charge? To what
awful occasion are all men moving? 2 Tim. 4: 1.
    NOTE.—"This solemn charge to one so zealous and faithful as was Timothy,
is a strong testimony to the importance and responsibility of the work of the
gospel minister. Summoning Timothy before the bar of God, Paul bids him
preach the word, not the sayings and customs of men; to be ready to witness
for God whenever opportunity should present itself,—before large congrega-
tions and private circles, by the way and at the fireside, to friends and to
enemies, whether in safety or exposed to hardship and peril, reproach and loss."
—"Gospel Workers," p. 30.
    2. What further instruction is given? Verse 2.
    NoTE.—"To hate and reprove sin, and at the same time to show pity and
tenderness for the sinner, is a difficult achievement. The more earnest our own
efforts to attain to holiness of heart and life, the more acute will be our per-
ception of sin, and the more decided our disapproval of it. We must guard
against undue severity toward the wrongdoer; but we must also be careful not
to lose sight of the exceeding sinfulness of sin. There is need of showing Christ-
like patience and love for the erring one, but there is also danger of showing
so great toleration for his error that he will look upon himself as undeserving
of reproof, and will reject it as uncalled for and unjust."—Id., pp. 30, 31.
    3. To what time did Paul point? What kind of teachers will men
choose? Why? With what result? Verses 3, 4.
    NOTE.—"The apostle Paul declared, looking down to the last days, 'The
time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.' That time has fully
come. The multitudes do not want Bible truth, because it interferes with the
desires of the sinful, world-loving heart; and Satan supplies the deceptions
which they love."—The Great Controversy," pp. 594, 595.
     4. What further counsel did the apostle give? Verse 5.
                                          ( 37 3
   5. Of what imminent event was Paul aware? What was his attitude
toward it? Verse 6.
    6. What triumphant declaration did the apostle make? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"Well-nigh a score of centuries have passed since Paul the Aged
poured out his blood as a witness for the word of God and the testimony of
Jesus Christ. No faithful hand recorded for the generations to come the last
scenes in the life of this holy man; but Inspiration has preserved for us his
dying testimony. Like a trumpet peal his voice has rung out through all the
ages since, nerving with his own courage thousands of witnesses for Christ,
and wakening in thousands of sorrow-stricken hearts the echo of his own tri-
umphant joy."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 513.
    7. To what reward did Paul look forward? From whom would he receive
it? Who also would share the reward? Verse 8.
  8. What request was made of Timothy? What is said of Demas? Of
Tychicus? Verses 9, 10, 12.
     9. Who only was with Paul? Whom else did the apostle wish to see?
Verse 11.
    NOTE.—This Mark is doubtless John Mark, the evangelist, who was son of
the sister of Barnabas, and author of the Gospel which bears his name. John
Mark started with Paul and Barnabas upon the apostle's first missionary jour-
ney (Acts 12:25), but on their second journey to visit the churches and preach
the word, Paul refused to take him, evidently because he felt that the young
man had not been sufficiently zealous for the work of the gospel in the face of
hardships, trials, and persecutions which had befallen them. The brief record
is that on that occasion John Mark "went not with them to the work." Acts
15 : 38.
     As a result of this difference in viewpoint, Barnabas took Mark, his sister's
son, while Paul chose Silas for his companion, thus forming two evangelistic
teams instead of one. This doubtless was one of the circumstances of which
Paul could afterwards say, •"The things which happened unto me have fallen
out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel."
     How refreshing to find in Paul's last epistle, when he is about to give his
life for his faith, this testimony concerning Mark that "he is profitable to me
for the ministry." And what an encouragement to all Christian youth who
know God has called them to do a special work for Him, to press on with
confidence and zeal.
   16. For what things did the aged prisoner have need? Verse 13.
    11. Who is next mentioned in this letter? For what is he remembered?
According to what would he be rewarded? What indicates that he was still
an enemy of the truth? Verses 14, 15. (See Acts 19:33, 34.)
   NOTE.—Commenting on the demonstration that took place in the city of
Ephesus when Paul once visited there, Mrs. E. G. White says: ."The tumult in
the theater was continually increasing. . . . The, fact that Paul and some of
his companions were of Hebrew extraction, made the Jews anxious to show
plainly that they were not sympathizers with him and his work. They there-
fore brought forward one of their own number to set the matter before the
people. The speaker chosen was Alexander, one of the craftsmen, a copper-
                                   {38I
smith, to whom Paul afterwards referred as having done him much evil.
Alexander was a man of considerable ability, and he bent all his energies to
direct the wrath of the people exclusively against Paul and his companions."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 294.
    12. What account does Paul give of his first defense? What hope did
he express? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"Among the Greeks and Romans it was customary to allow an
accused person the privilege of employing an advocate to plead in his behalf
before courts of justice. . . . But when Paul was summoned before Nero, no
man ventured to act as his counsel or advocate; no friend was at hand even
to preserve a record of the charges brought against him, or of the arguments
that he urged in his own defense. Among the Christians at Rome, there was
not one who came forward to stand by him in that trying hour. The only
reliable record of the occasion is given by Paul himself, in his second letter to
Timothy. 'At my first answer,' the apostle wrote, 'no man stood with me,
but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.' "
—Id., pp. 492, 493.
    13. Though human help failed, what company and support did Paul
enjoy? To what end? What deliverance was his? Verse 17.
    NOTE.--"Never before had that company listened to words like these. They
struck a chord that vibrated in the hearts of even the most hardened. Truth,
clear and convincing, overthrew error. Light shone into the minds of many
who afterwards gladly followed its rays. The truths spoken on that day were
destined to shake nations, and to live through all time, influencing the hearts
of men when the lips that had uttered them should be silent in a. martyr's grave.
    "Never before had Nero heard the truth as he heard it on this occasion.
Never before had the enormous guilt of .his own life been so revealed to him.
The light of heaven pierced the sin-polluted chambers of his soul, and he
trembled with. terror at the thought of a tribunal before which he, the ruler
of the world, would finally be arraigned, and his deeds receive their just award.
He feared the apostle's God, and he dared not pass sentence upon Paul, against
whom no accusation had been sustained. A sense of awe restrained for a time
his bloodthirsty spirit.
    "For a moment, heaven was opened to the guilty and hardened Nero, and
its peace and purity seemed desirable. That moment the invitation of mercy
was extended' even to him. But only for a moment was the thought of pardon
welcomed. Then the command was issued that Paul be taken back to his dun-
geon ; and as the door dosed upon the messenger of God, the door of repentance
closed forever against the emperor of Rome. No ray of light from heaven was
ever again to penetrate the darkness that 'enveloped him. Soon he was to
suffer the retributive judgments of God."—Id., pp. 495, 496.
   14. What triumphant words did the aged prisoner next record? Verse 18.
   15. In conclusion, to whom is reference made? Verses 19, 20.
   16. What wish did Paul express a second time? Who sent greetings?
Verse 21.
   17. With what words does the author conclude his second letter to
Timothy and his final epistle? Verse 22.
