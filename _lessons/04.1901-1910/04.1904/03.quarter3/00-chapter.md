OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION
                   FOR SENIOR CLASSES



                 Third Quarter, 1904


     General Note.—Under the symbols of a great red dragon, a
leopard beast, and a beast with lamb-like horns, are represented
the powers especially engaged in warfare against God's people.
Their war is carried forward till the close of time, till only a
remnant are left. That we live in the time when the final strug-
gle is to take place, and the remnant be developed, and the long
drawn-out controversy is to be finished, makes these studies of
special interest. Note throughout these studies that out of the
darkest hour in the history of the world, there will be a glorious
deliverance of the remnant. Then before us is spread out in
panoramic view Paradise restored, and the weary, worn, and
faithful children of the Most High, of every age and clime, safe
at home in the earth made new.

          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                        5

17. What is one way that Satan attacks the church?
Rev. 12:10. Note S.
                               Notes.
     I. The apostolic church is here introduced, and its history
briefly outlined till the end. The glory of the Gospel, as revealed
in the types and shadows (the moon), being in the past, she was
clothed with greater Gospel light (the sun), and fully organized
and filled with power; she went forth "conquering and to
conquer."
     2. Satan is symbolized by the dragon, as shown in verse 9.
At the time of which the prophet is speaking he worked through
Rome in pagan form.
     3. When Satan overcame Adam, he became the prince of this
world (John 14 :30), and took Adam's place in the heavenly
council as a representative from this world. Job I :6-12. His
relentless persecution of Christ revealed his true character to the
universe, and, when Jesus died on the cross, he was again cast out.
He lost his place in the council of heaven, and the second Adair'
appears now instead. From Rev. 12:4 and "Spirit of Prophecy,"
Vol. I, pages 22, 23, it seems that about one-third of the angels
sympathized with him, and were cast out of heaven with Lucifer.
By a comparison of this statement with the unnumbered host that
remains faithful (Rev. 5 :II), we can gain some idea concerning
the number of fallen angels with which the church must cope.
     4. "Satan again counseled his angels, and with bitter hatred
against God's government told them that while he'retained his
power and authority upon the earth, their efforts must be tenfold
stronger against the followers of Jesus. They had prevailed
nothing against Christ, but must overthrow His followers, if
possible. In every generation they must seek to ensnare those
who believe in Jesus. He related to his angels that Jesus had
given His disciples power to rebuke them and cast them out, and
to heal those whom they would afflict. Then Satan's angels went
forth like roaring lions, seeking to destroy the followers of Jesus."
—Early Writings, page 59.
     5. The 1260 years of papal supremacy as, a persecuting power
are here brought to view, beginning in A. D. 538, and ending in
A. D. 1798. The church was indeed in the wilderness during this
time. "That church which, during all the Dark Ages, trumpeted
her lordly commands into the ears of listening Christendom, and
flaunted her ostentatious banners before gaping crowds, was not
the church of Christ ; it was the body of the mystery of iniquity."
 —Thoughts on Revelation.

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
6         OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

    6. "The Reformation of the sixteenth century began its work.
God raised up the noble Luther and his colaborers to expose the
true character of the Papacy, and break the power with which
superstition had enslaved the minds of the people."—Thoughts
en Revelation.
    7. The remnant church is distinguished by three things: (I
They are a persecuted people; (2) they keep the commandments
of God; (3) they have the "Spirit of prophecy." We can not
consistently believe that the end is near and the remnant church
now doing its work in the earth, unless we believe that there is
a church which has all these characteristics.
    8. "Satan is constantly encouraging unbelief. He notes the
mistakes and failings of Christ's professed followers, and taunts
the angels of God with them. He is an accuser of the brethren,
and he will influence as many as possible to do the same work.
Those who take it upon themselves to watch their neighbor's
garden, instead of weeding their own plot of ground, will surely
find their own gardens so grown up to weeds that every precious
plant will be crowded out."—Testimoniei for the Church, No.
32, page 42.

          LESSON 11.—A Terrible Persecutor.
                         JULY 9, 5904.
                           Questions.
   I. What efil'ilie'prop.het,..b.e.14old arising out of the
sea? Rev. 13:1.
   2. Describe the beast. Rev. 13 :I, 2. Note I.
   3. How many points of identity can you find be-
tween this beast and the little horn of Daniel 7? Corn=
parecarefully Rev. 13: 2, 5, 6, 7, 10 with Dan. 7:8, zo,
21, 25, 26.
   4. How many worship him? Rev. 13:8:
   5. With what words do the people worship the
beast? What else do they worship? Rev. 13:4. Of
what is the dragon a symbol?
   6. Who gave to the beast his seat? Verse 2. Note 2.
We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                    7

   7. Against whom does he speak? Rev. 13:6.
From whence do words proceed? Matt. 12:35, 36.
What then is this professedly Christian power at heart?
   8. What does he do to the saints? Rev. 13:7.
   9. How long was the supremacy of the beast as a
persecuting power. to continue? Rev. 13:5; 12:6, 14..
  10. 'What was then to occur? WaS the wound to be
healed? Rev. 13:3, :10. Note 3.
   N. Will this power be permitted to persecute in the
last clays? Rev. 12:17.
  12. What admonition is given to the church for this
time? Rev. 13:9.
  13. Amid the moral darkness, how are the true peo-
ple of God referred to? Verse to, last part; Rev. 14:12.

                             Notes.

     1. The description given of this beast indicates that the
characteristics of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome have
been inherited by the Papacy, of which this symbol is a repre-
sentative. Though professedly Christian, it wages a relentless
warfare against truth and righteousness. It continues till the
end, and goes alive into the lake of fire. Rev. 19:20; Dan. 7:26.
     2. The dragon is a symbol of Satan. Satan offered his seat
and great. authority to Christ once when He was here on earth.
Luke 4:5-7. The price which he placed upon it was that Jesus
should bow down and worship him. It is not reasonable to sup-
pose that he has transferred it to the beast for anything less; so
that power is, therefore, the servant, full and complete, of the
prince of darkness, pledged to bow down and do obeisance to
him. Any homage, therefore, that is rendered to this ecclesiasti-
cal power, is in reality paying homage to the evil power by which
sin came into the world.
     3. This wound was inflicted when the beast went into cap-
tivity in A. D. 1798, when the French general, Berthier, entered
 Rome and took the pope prisoner, and abolished for a time the
 papal government—a deadly wound indeed.

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period:"

     LESSON ILL—Another Persecuting Power.
                     JULY   16, 1904.

                       Questions.
    I. Describe briefly the work of the . first beast of
Revelation 13. What is his number? Rev. 13:18.
Note I.
    2. When did he go into captivity?
    3. What attracted the prophet's attention at this
time? Rev. 13:11.
    4. Out of what did this power arise? How did this
differ from the- manner in which the other beast arose?
What does this .suggest?
    5. What beast is used as a symbol?
    6. What do the two horns denote? Note 2.
    7. With what voice did the beast speak? What
does this indicate as to its real character? How does
a nation speak?—Through its goVernment. The laws
enacted are its voice.
    8. What power was coming up in A. D. 1798, when
the other beast went into captivity? How accurately
does this nation meet the specifications of the proph-
ecy? Note 3.
    9. What marvelous things will this power do?
Verse 13.
   io. For what purpose will these miracles be wrought?
Verse 14.
       What power will this beast exercise? Verse 12.
   12. What will he .do? Verses 16, 17.
   13. What is the mark of the beast? Note 4.
"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                       watchword.
          OUTLINE gttilpits 1\1_114R itEVELAtto14               9

  14. What are the people commanded to make?
Verse 14.
  15. Will the image be a living thing? Verse 15.
What would constitute an image to the beast? Note 5.
  16. What will finally be the penalty for refusing to
bow to this image? Verses 15.-17. What decree will
go forth? Note 6.
  17. Will any gain the victory over the beast, the
image, and.the mark? Rev. 15:1, ; 20:4.
                                Notes.
     1. The pope wears in jeweled letters on his triple crown the
blasphemous title, "Vicarius Filii Dei,"—"Vicegerent of the Son
of God." Taking the letters which the Latins used as numerals
cut of this title, and giving them their numerical value, we have
just 666. Thus we have: V-5;             C-400; ("a" and "r" not
used as numerals) ; I-1 ; U-5 (formerly the same as V) ; ("s"
and "f" not used as numerals) ; I-1 ; L-5o; I—i; I—s ; D-500;
("e" not used as a numeral) ; I—s.
     2. "Here is a striking figure of the rise and growth of our
nation. And the lamb-like horns, emblems of innocence and
gentleness, well represent the character of our government, as
expressed in its two fundamental principles—Republicanism and
Protestantism."—Great Controversy.
     3. The only power which was coming up at the time when
the beast went into captivity in A. D. 1798, was the United States.
The Declaration of Independence was signed in A. D. 5776,
setting forth the truths that men are created equal, and endowed
with the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The
Constitution was adopted and ratified April 3o, 5789. Every
specification touching the rise of this power is met in the rise of
this nation, and the movements to fulfil the specifications indi-
cated by the dragon voice are already far advanced.
     4. "The light we have received' upon the Third Angel's Mes-
sage is the true light. The mark of the beast is exactly what it
has been proclaimed to be."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol.
6, page 17.
     God's law is a definition of His character. The fourth pre-
cept, enjoining the seventh day as the Sabbath, defines who the
true God is. The beast sits in the temple of God, exalting him-
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."
I0        OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

 self above God, claiming even to be God, and having power to
change His precepts. His purpose is to shut away from mankind
the true God and substitute himself. To do this, he must
necessarily change that commandment which defines who is the
true God, and substitute one which will exalt himself. This the
man of sin has done. When this change is enforced and accepted
intelligently, the mark of the beast will be received. That
Catholicism recognizes the substitution of Sunday for the Sab-
bath of Jehovah as the special mark of her power is acknowledged
in her standard works. The following is clear :—
     "Ques.—How prove you that the church has power to com-
mand feasts and holy days?
     "Ans.—By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday,
which Protestants allow of ; and therefore, they fondly contra-
dict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most
other feasts commanded by the same church."—Abridgement of
Christian Doctrine.
     5. The characteristic feature of the beast as a persecuting
power is a union of the church and the state, the church being
the controlling power, and enforcing religious dogmas through
the civil laws. An image to the beast would be another ecclesias-
tical power doing a similar work.
     6. "In the conflict, the Sabbath will be the special point of
controversy throughout all Christendom. Secular rulers and
religious leaders will unite to enforce the observance of the Sun-
day; and, as milder measures fail, the most oppressive laws will
be enacted. It will be urged that the few who stand in opposition
to an institution of the church and the law of the land ought not
to be tolerated, and a decree will finally be issued denouncing
them as deserving of the severest punishment, and giving the
people liberty, after a certain time, to put them to death. Roman-
ism in the old world, and apostate Protestantism in the new, will'
pursue a similar course toward those who honor the divine
precepts."
     "In one night they determine to strike the decisive blow that
shall forever silence the voice of the reprover."—Great Con-
troversy.
     "The decree which is to go forth against the people of God
will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus avainst the Jews
in the time of Esther. . . . The Protestant world to-day see
in the little company keeping the Sabbath a Mordecai in the
gate."—Testimony Number 32, page 206.




       "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.

     LESSON IV.—The Victory of the Remnant.
                       JULY 23, 1904.
                         Questions.
    1. With what powers were God's people in conflict
in our last lesson?
    2. What severe measures were being taken to com-
pel all to worship this beast and his image? Rev.
13:16.
    3. Do all worship the beast and his image? Rev.
T3:8.
    4. What will be the experience of those who do not
worship the beast? Rev. 15:2: Dan. 12:1.
    5. After, beholding the remnant under sentence of
death for refusing to bow to the decrees of men, what
next attracted the attention of the -prophet? Where
did they stand? How many were delivered? Whose
name did they bear?. Where was it written? Rev.
14:1.
    6. How many were sealed under the message pre-
sented in Revelation 7? Where was the seal placed?
Verse 3. At what period is this sealing work com-
pleted?
    7. Are the companies mentioned in chapters 7 and 14
the same? What comes next? Rev. 8:1.
    8. What did the seer hear in heaven? Rev. 14:2.
Note I.
    9. What song will the remnant sing? Rev. 15: 2, 3.
   10. Has this song ever been sung on the sea of glass
before? Rev. 14:3. Can any others learn this song?
          Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
12        OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

Why?--They sing a song of an experience that no
others have ever passed through.
    1. From whom are they redeemed? Are they de-
filed with the sins of Babylon? To whom are they
the first fruits? What exalted privilege have they?
Rev. 14: 4. Note 2.
  12. What is said of their character? Verse 5. Eph.
5:25-27; Jude 24.
                              Notes.
    1. The aged prophet was in exile on lonely Patmos. But
though placed where he could not hear the church militant sin,
the song of Zion, his connection with heaven was not interrupted.'
In vision of the future, the Lord permitted His servant to hear
the ransomed multitude sing and play upon the heavenly instru-
ments. He heard the final song of victory over the beast and
his image. His name was inscribed in the records of Rome's
criminal annals, but the Lord encouraged His servant by show-
ing him the city of God, with his name inscribed in the founda-
tions of its wall. Rev. 21 :54. The Lord is a present help in
time of trouble. In the fiery furnace was seen the "form of
the Fourth."
    2. The saved will have the privilege of going with the Saviour
and visiting all the worlds in the universe, and singing the song
of their deliverance. The unfallen inhabitants of other worlds
will listen with joy to the song of the 544,000, those who have
come from the weakest generation of men, when the enemy was
working with the greatest power. They can not join this re-
deemed choir, for they have never had such an experience. This
glorious privilege is within the reach of each of us. See "Early
Writings," page 33.



         LESSON V.—The Judgment Message.
                          JULY 30, 1904.
     General Note.—The line of prophecy commenced in chapter
12, closed with the fifth verse of chapter 14, with a description
of the overcomers in the redeemed state. A new line of prophecy
"This - Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
           OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                     13

is now introduced. The prophet begins with the hour of the
judgment impending, and emphasizes the Gospel messages which
will be given as specially applicable to the solemnity of that time;
a period just before the coming of the Lord.
     In connection with this study, read the chapter entitled,
"The Judgment," in "Testimonies for the Church," Vol. 4, pages
384-387.

                            Questions.

    r. For what event are the messages of Revelation
14 to prepare the world? Verse 14. What will any
effort to detract from them bring upon us? Rev. 22:19.
Note i.
    2. What symbol is used to introduce this line .of
prophecy? What did the angel proclaim? What
shows the message to be world-wide? Rev. 14:6.
Note 2.                              •
    3. What startling Gospel Message does he bear?
Flow is the message heralded? To whom are we di-
rected to give glory? Who alone should be -worshiped?
Verse 7.
    4. Which precept of the decalogue is specially sug-
gested by the wording of the message? Ex. 20:8-11..
    5. What will God bring into judgment? Eccl.

                             Notes.
    I. "I saw a company who stood well guarded and firm, and
giving no countenance to those who would unsettle the established
faith of the body. God looked upon them with approbation. I
was shown three steps,—the first, second, and third angel's
messages. Said my accompanying angel: 'Woe to him who shall
move a block or stir a pin of these messages. The true under-
standing of these messages is of vital importance. The destiny
of souls hangs upon the manner in which they are received.'"—
Early Writings, page 121.
    2. When the Lord wishes to represent earthly governments,
he selects as the most fitting symbol a wild and ravenous beast.
But the work of the Gospel for these last days is represented by
an angel flying in the heaven. Though the Gospel is preached
by men, doubtless special angels have charge of the work.
    3. The judgment is a real thing. The Judge upon the
throne is a real, actual, personal Being; the throne upon which
He is seated is a real throne; the books opened are real books;
the angels who surround the throne are real angels; and
those who are being judged are real beings.
   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.

    4. The judgment message, being a Gospel message, must be
given before probation closes. It is synonymous with the cleans-
ing of the sanctuary, and began at the end of the 2300 days of
Dan. 8:14, on the tenth day of the seventh month, of Oct. 22,
1844—nearly threescore years ago.
    "The prophecy of the first angel's message, brought to view
in Revelation 14, found its fulfilment in the Advent Movement of
I84o-I844."—Great Controversy.
    5. "Silently, unnoticed as a midnight thief, will come the de-
cisive hour which marks the fixing of every man's destiny, the
final withdrawal of mercy's offer to guilty men. . . . While
the man of business is absorbed in the pursuit of gain, while the
pleasure-lover is seeking indulgence, while the daughter of fash-
ion is arranging her adornments,—it may be in that hour the
Judge of all the earth will pronounce the sentence, 'Thou art
weighed in the balances, and found wanting.' "—Great Contro-
versy, page 491.



           LESSON VI. — The Final Warning.
                         AUGUST 6, 1904.

    Note.—"I then saw the third angel. Said my accompanying
angel: 'Fearful is his work. Awful is his mission. He is the
angel that is to select the wheat from the tares, and seal, or
bind, the wheat for the heavenly . garner. These things should
engross the whole mind, the whole attention.'"—Early Writings,
page 31 (Supplement).

                            Questions.

    1. What message is introduced in Rev. 14:9? How
is the message delivered? Against what is the warn--
ing uttered? Note 1.
    2. If this warning follows the judgment message
given in the 1844 movement, when must it be given to
the world?
    3. Is this message world-wide?      Give proof.
Note 2.

   4. What is the beast power? The image? The
mark? See lessons 3 and 4.
   5. What terrible penalty is threatened for worship-
ing the beast and his image, and receiving the mark
of his name? Rev. 14:9-11. Note 3.
   6. How is the remnant church described in contrast
with the worshipers of the beast power? Whose com-
mandments do they keep? Whose faith? What is a
further characteristic of this people? Rev. 14:12;
12:17.
     7. What angel unites his voice with that of the
third angel? Rev. 18:1. Note 4.
    8. During this struggle, what does a voice from
heaven say? Rev. 14:13.
    9. What great event follows the proclamation of
this message? Upon what is the Saviour seated?
What has He upon His head? What in His hand?
Verse 14.
   10. What is then ripe? Verses 15, 16.
   it. What is the harvest? Matt. 13:30, 39.
   12. Does this message seal the wicked for destruc-
tion? Rev. 14:18.
  13. Where are tile wicked cast? Verses 19, 20.
   14. Where are the remnant seen? Rev. 15 : 2, 3.
                             Notes.
    I. "I have been shown that but a small number of the people
in our churches know for themselves what constitutes the Third
Angel's Message."—Gospel Workers, page 229. The judgment
message will continue till the close of time; likewise that of the
second angel. With these go the terrible warning of the third
angel, making a great threefold message with which to close
human probation, and end the problem of sin.
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                    17

     2. The fact that this message follows the other two shows it
to be world-wide, for they went to "every nation, kindred, and
tongue, and people."
     3. By consulting any standard Greek lexicon, it will be seen
that, while the terms from which "for ever and ever" are trans-
lated sometimes mean absolute eternity of duration, they are also
used to denote limited duration. Compare Ex. 21:6. They are
used in the lesson text to indicate finality of punishment, as the
beast and his image are to be entirely destroyed, and the territory
they now occupy becomes the home of the redeemed. The doc-
trine of eternal torture in a lake of fire is contrary to the at-
tributes of God, and foreign to the teachings of the Bible.
      4. "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, descending to
earth, and again ascending to heaven, preparing for the fulfilment
of some important event. Then I saw another mighty angel
 commissioned to descend to earth, to unite his voice with the
 third angel, and give power and force to his message. Great
 power and glory were imparted to the angel, and as he ascended
 the earth was lightened with his glory. . . . This message
 seemed to be an addition to the third angel, joining it as the
 midnight cry joined the second angel's message in 1844. . . •
 Mighty miracles were wrought, the sick were healed, and signs
 and wonders followed the believers. God was in the work, and
 every saint, fearless of consequences, followed the conviction of
 his own conscience, and united with those who were keeping
 all the commandments of God; and with power they sounded
  abroad the third message. I saw that this will close with power
  and strength far exceeding the midnight cry."—Early Writings,
  pages 137-139.

Rev. 16:17. How do they affect the earth? Verses
18-2o; Joel 3:16.
  18. What assurance of protection given to God's
people? Ps. 91:1-11.

                             Notes.
     1. " It was impossible for the plagues to be poured out while
Jesus officiated in the sanctuary; but as His work there is
finished, and His intercession closes, there is nothing to stay
the wrath of God, and it breaks with fury upon the shelterless
head of the guilty sinner, who has slighted salvation, and hated
reproof. In that fearful time, after the close of Jesus' mediation,
the saints were living in the sight of a holy God without an in-
tercessor. . . . The last tear for sinners had been shed, the
last agonizing prayer offered, the last burden borne, the last
warning given. The sweet voice of mercy was no more to invite,
them."—Early Writings, page 141.
     "When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the
unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast
and his image and receive his mark, will be poured out. . . .
These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the earth
would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the most awful
scourges that have ever been known to mortals."—Great Con-
troversy.
      2. The Turkish Empire is clearly symbolized by the River
Euphrates in Rev. 9:14. There is no reason to believe that the
Spirit uses the symbol here with a different meaning. Under
 this plague apparently the Ottoman power, which for so many
years has been crumbling away, will be literally "dried up ;" will
come to its end. This fact is stated, though the steps in detail
by which this will be brought to pass may not all be clearly
given.
      3. The Turk, having been driven from the soil of Europe,
has established the capital of his kingdom at Jerusalem, and here
 in the valley of Jehoshaphat the terrible battle of Armageddon
 will take place. The preliminary steps to bring this to pass are
 now being seen among the nations. Truly this will be a time
of trouble such as never was, a time of "confused noise, and
 garments rolled in blood." In the midst of the turmoil, the long-
 suffering God intervenes. The seventh vial is unstopped. He
 opens the armory of heaven, and brings forth the "weapons of

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."

Ills indignation," and pours out the reserved treasures of the hail.
All the proud and stately nations of earth will be quickly over-
thrown.


                  LESSON VI11.—Babylon.
                         AUGUST 20, 1904.
                         18 points to the time when, as a result
of rejecting.
    jecting. the threefold warning of Rev. 14:6-12, the church
    re
will have fully reached the condition foretold by the second angel,
and the people of God, still in Babylon, will be called upon to
separate from her communion. This message is the last that
will ever be given to the world; and it will accomplish its work.
When those that 'believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness,' shall.be left to receive strong delusion, and to
believe a lie, then the light of truth will shine upon all whose
hearts are open to receive it, and all the children of the Lord
that remain in Babylon will heed the call, 'Come out of her, My
people.' "—Great Controversy.
                             Questions.

17:1, 2.
    2. What did the angel show him? Verses 3, 4.
    3. What was the name of this woman? Verse 5.
Note 1.
    4. Through rejecting the judgment message, what
did Babylon experience? ' Rev. .t.4:8.
    5. What is the inevitable result of rejecting light?

18:2,-5, 24.
    7. Is there a remnant left? Rev. 18:4.

heaven? Verse 4. Why are they exhorted to leave
this apostate body? Note 2.

   9, Upon what will those who come out of Babylon
he united? Rev. [4:12; 12:17.
  1o. How will Babylon be rewarded? Rev. 18:6,8.
See also Isa. 47:1-15.
   I. Is Babylon conscious of her danger? Rev. 18:7.
       What striking illustration is given of her over-
throw? Rev. 18:21. Will her destruction be final?
  13. What does the. merchandise of this figurative city
include? Rev. 18:12-14.
  14. How will her destruction affect the kings of the
earth? Verses 9-11.
  15. What are those who have dealt in her merchan-
dise represented as doing? Verses 15, 16.
  16. Is ocean commerce affected? Verses 17-19.
Note 3.
  17. In contrast with the lathentations of the wicked,
what emotions of joy do the righteous express?
Verse 20.
                             Notes.
    I. The illicit connection between the church and worldly
power is here clearly illustrated by the woman, a symbol of the•
church, seated upon a beast, a symbol of earthly government.
The Church of Rome, with its gigantic organization, stands as
chief representative of this iniquitous system, and is here called
Babylon.
    2. Some of the true people of the Lord are scattered through-
out Babylon. In all the churches there are those who sigh and
cry because of the abominations which are cherished in their
midst. On these the Lord has His eye; they are dear to Him.
And as the storm of indignation against sin gathers and 'is about
to break, a voice from heaven, a mighty message, calls -them to
"come out of her."      "Servants of God, endowed with power
from on high, with their faces lighted up, and shining with holy
consecration, went forth to proclaim the message from heaven.
Souls that were scattered all through the religious bodies
answered •to- the call, and the precious were hurried out of the

doomed churches, as Lot was hurried out of Sodom before the
destruction."—Early Writings, page 139.
     3. With the plagues of wrath falling upon them, their earthly
traffic gone, and unable to deliver themselves with their silver
and gold, one universal cry of lamentation and woe is heard. In
despair they will cast their treasures to the moles and bats (Isa.
2:17-2I), and seek to hide themselves with these creatures of
darkness in the dens of the earth. How true are the words of
the prophet ! Isa. 3:10, 11.



LESSON IX.—The Song of Triumph and the Marriage
                  Supper.
                        AUGUST 27, 1904.
                            Questions.
    i. After the events of our last lesson, what song of
triumph did the prophet hear? Where was it sung?

    6. How is the bride arrayed? Rev. 19:8.
    7. Where has Jesus •now gone? Luke 19:11, 12.

per? Luke 14:15-23. What did many who were bid-
den do? Were they excused?
  11. Is it blessed to be invited to this supper? Rev.
19:9. Who will serve? Luke 12:37. What promise
will then be fulfilled? Matt. 26:27-29. Have you been
invited? - Are you going? Note 2.

did He find? Matt. 22:11. What excuse was offered?

  14. Whose savings are these? Rev. 19:9.
  15. How did the view of this glorious scene affect
the aged prophet? Verse TO, first part. Note 3.
  16. Did the angel accept worship? What work did
he say had been. given him?
  17. Flow is the "testimony of Jesus" defined? Verse
10, last part.
                               Notes.
•    r. Christ evidently is the One who speaks from the throne.
He has passed through all the experiences of the redeemed, and
met the fiercest assaults of the enemy. He is still the Son of man.
"In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to hu-
manity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal
ages He is linked with us." He still bears in His body the marks
of the crucifixion. Now He beholds with supreme joy the travail
of His soul and is satisfied. Isa. 53:n. He bids the ransomed
host to sing, and they respond with such a chorus of praise as
has never been heard in heaven before.
    2. "Soon we heard His lovely voice again, saying, 'Come,
My people, you have come out of great tribulation, and done My
will; suffered for Me; come in to supper, for I will gird Myself,
and serve you.' We shouted, 'Alleluia, glory,' and entered into
the city. And I saw a table of pure silver; it was many miles
in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the fruit of
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
24        OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes,
and many other kinds of fruit. I asked Jesus to let me eat of
the fruit. He said: 'Not now. Those who eat of the fruit of
this land, go back to earth no more. But in a little while, if
faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and
drink of the water of the fountain.' "—Early Writings, page 15.
     3. When John heard this triumphant song from all the re-
deemed host, arrayed in their glorious robes of righteousness,
and saw them seated at the marriage supper of the Lamb around
that table which is "miles in length," he was so overcome by the
sublimity and splendor of the scene that he fell at the feet
of Gabriel, who was revealing it to him, to worship him. If a
view of the. scene so affected the prophet, what will it be to be
really there?


         LESSON X.—The Return of the King.
                       SEPTEMBER 3, 1904.
                            Questions.
   I. What longing desire is in the heart of the
Saviour? John 17:24.
   2. Before He left the earth, what promise did He
make concerning His return? Why did He go away?
When will He come back? For what special purpose?
John 14:1-3.
   3. Will His appearing be visible to all? Rev. 1:7;
Matt. 24:27. Note 1.
   4. Describe the manner of His return. Acts
   5. With how much glory will the event be attended?
Luke 9:26.
   6. What view of His coming did the prophet have
on Patmos? Rev. 19:11. Note 2.
   7. Describe the King. How does He judge and
make war? Verse 12. What did He have upon His
head?
            Prayerfully consider the unentered Welds.
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                   25

   8. With what was He clothed? What is His name
called? Verse 13.
   9. What name is on His vesture? Verse 16.
Note 3.
  10. Who comes with Him? Verse 14. Note 4.
  IL With what are the nations smitten? Rev. 19:15.
  12. What terrible scene is described in Rev. 19:17,
18? See also Eze. 39:17-20. Note 5.
  13. What will be the attitude of the kings of earth
toward the King of kings when He comes? Rev.
19:19.
  14. What is done with the apostate powers of the
earth? Verse 20.
  15. Will all the wicked be slain? Verse 21; Jer.
4:23-25. Note 6.
                             Notes.
    I. By means of a partial resurrection, some of the righteous,
and some of the wicked who are dead, will be raised to witness
the Saviour's return. Some of the principal actors in His cruci-
fixion will be brought forth to witness His triumphant return.
The Saviour in the hour of His humiliation told the wicked
Caiaphas that he would be one of this number. Matt. 26:64.
    "All who have died in faith under the Third Angel's Mes-
sage come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant
of peace with those who have kept His law."—Great Controversy.
    2. Note the similarity of the figure used to describe the
coming of the Saviour, and that used in chapter 6:2, to represent
the Gospel as it went forth in its purity, "conquering and to con-
quer." The Author of the Gospel now rides forth as a conqueror,
to put down the rule of that temporary monarch, sin, that for a
time ruled in His kingdom, and to gather His loyal subjects to
Himself.
    3. It would be no partiCular exaltation to be simply the King
over the wicked kings of the earth. But just as Adam would
have been the king of this earth has he never sinned, so in every
loyal world there is a king. But Christ is King of kings. He
is King over all the kingdoms throughout His universal domain.
   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
26        OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

    4. Picture in your mind, if you are able, the glory of that
hour when a hundred millions, and thousands of thousands more
of shining angels, cherubim and seraphim, attend the Saviour as
He comes in the forthshining of His own glory and all the glory
of His Father. It is indeed a "glorious appearing."
    5. Another "supper" is here spoken of. But note the con-
trast. At the marriage supper of the Lamb, the redeemed sit
down at a beautiful table, laden with the viands of heaven.
and served by the King of the place. But at this "supper of the
great God," kings, captains, and mighty men of earth, are them-
selves food for the vultures of heaven.
    6. Another "remnant" is here spoken of, not of the right-
eous, but of the wicked. Note the contrast between the "rem-
nant" of Israel and the "remnant" of sin. One stands victorious
on the sea of glass; the other is slain with the sword which
proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord. Two vines (John 15:1,
2; Rev. 14:18), two suppers (Rev. 19:9, 17, 18), two resurrec-
tions (Chap. 20 :4-6), and two remnants (Rev. 12:17; 19:21),
are brought to view in these studies. "Choose you this day

    17. -For whom was this lake of fire prepared? Matt.
2 5 :4-1.
   18. How complete will be their destruction? Mal.
       3-
   19. Will sin ever exist again? Rev. 22:3; Nahum
I:9, 1o.
   zo. How will the fire that consumes the wicked af-
fect the earth? 2 Peter '3:10-13.
                              Notes.
        The word here translated "bottomless pit" is in the Revised
 Version, Rotherham's Translation, Interlinear, etc., properly
 translated "abyss," meaning a place of darkness and desolation.
 A like expression is found in Gen. I :2, the Septuagint, where
 the term, "darkness was upon the face of the deep," is used to
describe the earth in its chaotic condition. It denotes the same
here.
     2. Just as the scapegoat in the typical service connected with
 the earthly sanctuary was led into the wilderness, laden with
the sins of the people 'placed . upon him by the high priest on
 the day of atonement, so, at the close of the judgment work in
the heavenly sanctuary, the sins of God's people will be placed
 by our great High Priest upon the anti-typical scapegoat, Satan.
     3. Lucifier, because of sin, was cast out of heaven. Luke
io:18. When Jesus died on the cross, Satan was again cast down
 (John 12:31), the Second Adam taking the exalted position in
the council of heaven, which the first Adam lost through trans-
gression. Now with the saints all in heaven, beyond the reach
of his temptations, his own subjects all dead, and 'every ambition
of his soul blasted, an angel seizes this fallen cherub, and binds
him in the desolated earth for a thousand years. What a strik-
ing objec- -lesson of the vanity of sin!
     4. This judgment will not be to determine who are the
righteous, for this has previously been determined, but it will
consist in apportioning the measure of punishment clue to the
lost. There will be degrees in the reward of the ldst (Matt.
to:15; II :24; Mark 6:11), for all will be rewarded according as
their works have been. This work will bring to light the hidden
things, and the justice and mercy of God will be fully seen in
all His dealings with the children of men.

"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be pre .ched in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come::
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                   29

    5. No more fitting term than "abyss," or "bottomless pit,"
could be found to describe the earth in its desolate condition.
Here will be Satan's home for a thousand years. All about him
he will see only failure and ruin.
    "Here is to be the home ,of Satan and his angels for a
thousand years. Here he will be confined, to wander tip and
down over the broken surface of the earth, and see the effects
of his rebellion against God's law. For a thousand years he
can enjoy the fruit of the curse which he has caused. Limited
alone to this earth, he will not have the privilege of ranging to
other planets, to tempt and annoy those who have not fallen."
—Early Writings, page 150.
    6. The countless millions of the wicked dead being raised
will loose Satan from his prison, and he begins his former work
of deception. He gathers them for battle, and they surround the
capital of the New Earth •in a desperate and final struggle to
capture the city. This once will the whole family of Adam, both
righteous and wicked, stand together on the earth. But what a
contrast ! We are now making decisions which will determine
where We will then stand.

    6. For what purpose was the earth made? Isa.

in the beginning? Gen. 1:26-28; Ps. 8:6-8.
    8. What kingdom will the saints take? Dan.

    9. How will the earth be purified? 2 Peter 3:10-13.

  16. Will God's throne be there? Rev. 21 :3. Note 5.
  17. Who will inherit all these things? Rev. 21:7.
  18. Who has made all these promises? Rev. 22:16.
  19. Is He able to fulfil them? Rom. 4:21, 22; Jer.
32:17.
                              Notes.

    1. Unless this world is inhabited, its creation will have been
in vain. What is true of this world is true of all the others also,
which shows, incidentally, that all the worlds are inhabited. This
world is the lost sheep of the universe. Jesus came to seek and
to save all that was lost as a result of sin. This will include a
restoration of the dominion which was lost by Adam because of
transgression, and man's restoration to his home in the new
earth.
    2. The lives of the wicked will not be prolonged in an
       "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                     31

eternal state of suffering to curse their Creator throughout end-
less ages. No such blot will remain to mar the work of God.
The marks of the crucifixion, which the Redeemer carries in His
body, will be the only reminder of sin that will remain. See
"Great Controversy," page 674.
     3. "There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appear-
ance of silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls, most
glorious to behold, which were to be inhabited by the saints,
and in which was a golden shelf.         I saw many of the saints
go into the houses, take off their glittering crowns and lay them
on the shelf, then go out into the field by the houses to do some-
thing with the earth; not as we have to do with the earth here;
no, no. A glorious light shone all about their heads, and they
were continually shouting and offering praises to God."—Early
Writings, page 14.
     4. The earth itself, the very field which Satan claims as his,
is to be not only ransomed, but exalted. Our little world, under
the curse of sin, the one dark blot in His glorious creation, will
be honored above all other worlds in the universe of God. Here,
where the Son of God tabernacled in humanity, where the King
of glory lived and suffered and died,—here, when He shall make
all things new, the tabernacle of God shall be with men, 'and
He shall dwell with them, and they shall' be His people, and God
Himself shall be with them, and be,their God.' "—Desire of Ages,
Page 26.

          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                  33

                             Notes.
     1. The city will be so resplendent with the glory of the
Lord that it will need no light of sun or moon, for the glory
of the Lord is brighter than the sun. Acts 26:12, 13. The sun
and moon will exist to lighten the earth, shining with increased
brilliancy. Isa. 30:26.
     2. There will be nations in the new earth whose rulers are
called kings. The Saviour, in answer to a question propounded by
Peter upon a certain occasion, said that when all things were
regenerated, the apostles would sit on twelve thrones, ruling
the twelve tribes, or nations, of Israel. Matt. 19:28.
     3. It is not stated that there will be no temple in the new
earth, but only that there will be none in the city. It appears,
from Rev. 7:15, that there will be a temple, located, perhaps,
outside of the city. The 144,000 only will enter this temple.
See "Early Writings," pages 14, 15.
     4. "Out of the throne came a pure river of water, and on
either side of the river was the tree of life. On one side of the
river was a trunk of a tree, and a trunk on the other side of
the river, both of pure, transparent gold. At first I thought I
saw two trees. I looked again, and saw that they were united
at the top in one tree."—Early Writings, pages 12, 13.
     5. Once more, as in chapter 19:1o, the overwhelming glory
which John beheld of Paradise restored overcame him, and, lost
in admiration of the sight, he fell down to worship the angel.
The angel again refused to accept the homage, and left on record
 the comforting assurance that he was not only the fellow servant
 with John, but all those also who keep the sayings of this
 wonderful book.

A Book for Young People

    Young people are always interested in knowing how
 successful men succeeded. They want to know how
 they used the difficulties which every person must meet
 as stepping stones to higher attainments. If these suc-
 cessful men did make mistakes, young people want to
 know how they made them, so that they may the more
 easily avoid doing likewise.
     In the recent work, "Education," by Mrs. E. G.
 White, the lives of such Bible characters as David,
 Solomon, Job, Moses, Joseph, and others are treated
 in a way that will intensely interest every young person
 desiring to make the most of his opportunities. 'There
 are also important chapters on Business Principles
 and Methods, Proper Recreation, Manual Training, and
 Physical Culture.

             BABYLON IS FALLEN !
    A startling statement indeed, and one which re-
quires an explanation. The statement is made in Rev.
14:8, and the explanation is found in this tract. It
tells what Babylon is, what her fall means, and how it
concerns us.
           Price 11/2 cents; $1.00 per hundred.

         THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES
   This is another very timely and thrilling tract on
a subject that concerns every one now living. The
writer briefly portrays the events leading up to the
time when the plagues are poured out, showing who are
to suffer this dreadful scourge of God's wrath, and
then gives an exposition of each plague, with the effect
they will have on the earth and man.
        Price 3 cents each; per hundred, $2.15.

                THE MILLENNIUM
   What is it? Where is it?       And when is it?     are
questions that are agitating, as well as confusing, many
minds. This tract clears up the obscurities by defining
the term, and producing Bible information as to where
it will take place, and when.
       Price I% cents each, or $1.00 per hundred.

           TtiE EASTERN QUESTION
   In this tract we find the solution of the great prob-
lem which centers in the "Sick Man of the East"—
Turkey. It touches briefly the prophecies concerning
the rise of this power, and portrays its final end; also
the world's crisis as connected with this omnious
event.

    SOUL-THRILLING TRACTS

         THE RETURN OF THE JEWS
    The subject treated in this tract is one that has
attracted the general attention of Bible students, but,
unfortunately, is not well understood. The writer pre-
sents the subject from the standpoint of God's promise
to Abraham, clearly showing who are the true Israel,
and when and where they will be gathered. Illustrated.
      Price 2 cents each, or $1.30 per hundred.

          HERALDS OF HIS COMING
   Is it a literal coming? Is the end really near? May
we know the time? These are a few of the questions
answered in this tract. Some of the special signs of
Christ's second coming are pointed out, emphasized by
an original chart, portraying in a vivid manner the points
dwelt upon.
     Price 114 cents each, or $1.00 per hundred.


    THE GREAT THREE-FOLD MESSAGE
   The Gospel of saving grace has been ever the same
in all ages, but special messages of warning have also
been given as telling factors in the saving work. Noah
gave a message in his day, and John the Baptist an-
other. The writer shows in this tract that a great
Three-Fold Message is to be given to the world in our
clay, warning them of the dreadful calamities cooling,
and pointing out the way of escape.

look in the world to-day, among the nations, in society,
in the church, but how few have an intelligent under-
standing of what these things mean, as well as the dis-

the signs and show their import, but gives a message of
hope and comfort to God's people.

      MARSHALLING OF THE NATIONS
   Have you noted the movements of the great nations
of to-day and been impressed that these movements
must sooner or later effect the whole world? Have
you divined that the grasping after territory must
finally culminate in the last great battle, where, the
Scriptures tell us, "the kings of the earth and of the
whole world" are gathered? This phamphlet treats
the subject in a way that will leave no room for con-
jecture. You should read it and circulate it every-
where at this opportune- time. 44 pages.

              MODERN MYSTERIES
   A phamphlet of rare merit, treating the subjects
