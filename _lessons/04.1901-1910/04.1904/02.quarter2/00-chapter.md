OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION
                 FOR SENIOR CLASSES



               Second Quarter, 1904


    Note:—These lessons are not to be a book study, but an
outline study of the leading prophecies in the book. They will
be but a survey of a book which we have been especially ex-
horted to study earnestly and prayerfully in order that we
may understand the past history of the people of God and the
closing work under the Third Angel's Message of the four-
teenth chapter, which gives the special burden and key-note
of the Gospel message for our time.

                             Notes.
    I. "On account of the desolate character of this island,
it was used, under the Roman Empire, as a place of banish-
ment, which accounts for the exile of John thither. The
banishment of the apostle took place about the year 94, as is
generally supposed, under the Emperor Domitian; and from
this fact the date assigned to the writing of the Revelation
is A. D. 95 or 96."—Thoughts on Revelation)
    2. The blessing promised to those who read and hear
comes only as the third condition is fulfilled, by the keeping
of the things written. We are not studying merely to learn
interesting facts regarding the past fulfilment of prophecy.
These are all essential in the proper understanding of the
book, but the study will be of lasting value only as we seek
God for grace to learn how to keep in our own lives the
lessons of the past and the warnings and counsels, all written
for us. The "sayings of the prophecy of this book" are things
to be daily kept by thoie who would be prepared for the
coming of Christ. Rev. 22:7.
    3. "The seven churches." Under the names of the seven
churches in Asia, the Holy Spirit has delineated seven differ-
ent stages of the Christian church, which appear in succes-
sion, extending from the apostolic days to the coming of the
Lord and the consummation of all things. In other words,
these messages to the seven churches constitute a connected
prophecy of the church of Christ on earth, during seven
periods of time, covering the entire history of the church
from the first to the second advent. The messages to all
the churches therefore come to us who live in the last days.

  i. What are the names of the seven churches to
whom this book of Revelation is dedicated? Rev. It11.
Note I.
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

       "It is impossible to mark by exact date the definite beginning and ending of each division or church.
They blended into each other, telescoped each other so to speak, and the characteristics of each and all continue
in some measure to the end. In general, it may be. said that Ephesus included the closing part of the apostolic
age; Smyrna, the time of the pagan persecutions; Pergamos, from the days of Constantine to the sixth century;
Thyatira, the greater part of the long period of the Dark Ages; Sardis (beginning with Reformation times),
Philadelphia (with Advent-message days, about 1840-44), Laodicea (especially after 1844), all represent last-day

  19. What picture does Inspiration set over against
these descriptions of times of trial? Rev. 7:13-17.
                             Notes.
     1. The number seven is used repeatedly throughout the
book, evidently to denote fulness and completion. So just
seven churches represent the complete history.
     2. The word "Ephesus" means "desirable." The church
in this period—in the days of apostolic labor—had enjoyed the
doctrine of Christ in its purity; also the benefits and blessings
of the Holy Spirit received.
    "3. The first love, the warmth of affection experienced
when the Saviour was first received and the hope of the
message first dawned upon the mind, had faded out some-
what in process of years, under cares and trials. "Lord, is
     "i
it I?„,
             first love must be renewed by coming to Jesus for
the forgiveness of all sin, the full surrender of the heart, and
then, constrained by the love of Jesus for others, the new con-
vert, though perhaps old professor, will have a new experi-
ence to tell, a new song to sing, even praise unto God. Then
missionary work of all kinds will be not a duty alone, but a
joy; yet still a duty to which the believer must sternly hold
himself against all the tendency of the flesh to become care-
less. Just here was the failure of the early church.
     5. The sect of Nicolaitanes was one of the earliest of the

•parties that sprang tip within the church, undermining the
 truth by mysticism and fanciful teaching. Under profession
 of a higher philosophy of God and a more spiritual under-
 standing of the doctrines of Christ, they brought heathen no-
 tions and moral corruptions into the church.
       6. This and other references show plainly that the Eden
 that once was on earth has been transplanted to heaven.
       7. .:"Smyrna' signifies 'myrrh,' fit appellation for the
 church of God while passing through the fiery furnace of per-
 secution and proving herself a 'sweet-smelling savor' unto Him."
 — houghts on Revelation.
       8. "Which was dead and is alive." This is an assurance
 that One who has gone down into Satan's prison-house, con-
  quered death, and brought the key away with Him, was
  qualified to bear a message of hope and comfort to the church
 in that age when many were to seal their testimony with their
  blood. )
       9. In these times of pagan persecution, the issue was
  practically the same as we must again face—the Christian
  principle of religious liberty as opposed to the Roman prin-
  ciple of governmental regulation of religion. The Roman law
  was: "No man shall have for himself particular gods of his
  cwn; no man shall worship by himself any new or foreign
  gods, unless they are recognized by the public laws." The
  prophecy speaks of "ten days." The last and severest per-
  secution of this period was a sustained effort to suppress
  Christianity, lasting ten years. Ten clays. prophetic time—a
  clay for a year—would be ten years, literal time "It was not
  till A. D. 311," says Lecky, "ten years after the first measure
  against the Christians, that the Eastern persecution ceased.
  Galerius, the arch-enemy of the Christians, was struck down
  by a fearful disease." He suspended his edict and besought
   Christians to pray for his recovery.

                      APRIL 16, 1904.

                         Questions.

    i. To what period were we brought in the last les-
son?—To the days when, under the patronage of Con-
stantine and the great of earth, the apostate wing of
the church and the world joined hands and the Roman

  12. What threat is uttered against the apostate
power? Verses 21-23.
  13. How does the Lord encourage His own, but
erring, church in days of apostasy? Verses 24, 25. See
Isa. 42 :3, 4.
  14. What promise is made to the faithful under op-
pression? Verses 26, 27. Note 8.
  15. What pledge of victory has the believer? Verse
28. Note 9.
  16. With what call does the message close? Verse
29.
                         Notes.
    1. "Pergamos" means height or elevation. The so-called
conversion of the Emperor Constantine took place in A. D.
323. The same power which had been used to persecute and
put to death millions of the Christians was now turned in
their favor. Thus a flood of worldliness and pagan doctrines
was brought into the church.
    2. The description suggests the need of discipline by the
hewing of the Word of God. Rev. 1:16; Heb. 4:12.
    3. "Where Satan's seat is." It was following the supposed
conversion of Constantine that the flood-gates of error were
opened, and every form of false doctrine was brought in.
Constantine was nothing but a heathen to the day of his
death. His so-called conversion was wholly an affair of politi-
cal policy. Nearly every false doctrine in the Roman Church
to-day, and very many still retained in Protestant churches,
came direct from paganism, and were brought into ,the
church at that time. Truly it was where Satan's seat was.F7
    4. The apostate Balaam having failed by direct attack to
bring a curse upon* Israel, counseled Balak to seduce them
into sin .and so indirectly accomplish the end. Num. 31:16.
Here the church that had withstood the pagan persecutions
was weakened by popularity, and the compromise with worldly
principles, evil and falsehood springing up within. It is still
the greatest danger of the church.
   5. "Thyatira" means "sweet savor of labor," or "sacrifice
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
12         OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

  of contrition," appropriately suggesting the torn and bleeding
 church of Christ in the dark days of papal rule.) This period
  of—the church may be said to begin about A. D. 538, the date-
, marking.the political supremacy of the Papacy, anclintroduOng
  another distinct era in church history, namely, the 1260 years
  (538 to 1798)of Dan. 7:25.
       6: The feet of burnished brass (see Rev. 1:15) are evi-
  dence that Jesus still walks the fiery furnace of trial with His
  loved ones.
       7. "Jezebel is a figurative. name, alluding to Ahab's wife,
  who slew the prophets of the Lord, led her husband into
  idolatry, and fed the prophets of Baal at her own table. A
  more striking figure could not have been used to denote the
  papal abominations. See 1 Kings, chapters 18, 19, and 21.
  It is very evident from history, as well as from this verse,
  that the church of Christ did suffer some of the papal monks
  to preach and teach among them. See the 'History of the
  Waldenses.' "—William Miller's Lectures.
       8. The smiting of the nations (Ps. 2:8, 9) is performed by
  Christ, but associated with Him in the final judgment are all
  the saints. Ps. 149:5-9. During the thousand years they sit
  with Christ in judgment upon the wicked.
       9. In that darkest hour of the church the Lord gives the
  assurance of the coming dawn. See Luke 1:78; Rev. 22:16;
  2 Peter r:19. The light shed abroad in the believing sinner's
   heart by the Holy Spirit, Christ's representative, is assurance
   of the dawn of eternal day to those who "hold fast."

Iej       OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE EEVELAtION

                             Notes.
     I. The full prophetic period in which the Papacy was to
wear out the saints reached to 1798. But for the elect's sake,
those days were shortened. Matt. 24:22. The Reformation•
partially broke the power of the Papacy and brought the
reign of wholesale persecution to an end. By.successive reform
movements the Protestant churches of Europe and America
were developed. Thus, as we approach 1798, a new era, the
fifth, develops in the history of the church—the era of the
Protestant reformed churches.
     0. "Sardis" means "song of joy," or "that which remains:"
"I will put upon you none other burden," was the promise
made at the close of the preceding period of the church.
Rev. 2:24. For nearly eighteen centuries the church had
felt the hand of persecution laid heavily upon her, and many
millions had fallen in death. At the close of the Thyatira
church she was never again to pass through like scenes.
This is truly cause for rejoicing.
 N   3,T hose who have started in reform and ceased to grow
must fake fresh hold of principles already learned and go on
unto fuller knowledge and experience in the truth. The fatal
weakness in the reformed churches Was the tendency to stand
still where the first reformers left them. Growth is the law
of spiritual life. See Prov. 4:18; John 12 :35.
     4. We are now in our study approaching the time of the
cleansing of the sanctuary—the final blotting out of sins, be-
ginning in 1844. Hence the promise to the overcomer directs
attention to the final work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary,
the opening of the judgment hour. The proclamation of this
grand event, in the years just preceding 1844, constituted the
world-wide Advent movement which was to mark the next
stage in the development of the church.
     5:"Philadelphia means "brotherly love." All the story of
the early Advent movement leading up to the autumn of 1844,
at which time the Advent people expected to meet their Lord,
shows that believers were bound together in ties of fellowship
and love like to that which reigns in heaven, which they ex-
pected soon to enter. Coming out from various churches and
the world, they were made one by the "blessed hope."

                "Blest be the tie that binds
                  Our hearts in Christian love;
" This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations,• and then shall the end come."
         OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVE;'_,ATION

                The fellowship of kindred minds
                  Is like to that above."

     Now, with the ministry in the heavenly sanctuary almost
finished and the coming of the Lord at the very door, all
hearts must again let in the love of heaven, which will make
the true believers one and fit them to live. with the angels.
See-the last rounds in Peter's ladder. 2-Peter -1:77-hr"
     6. The time approaches for Christ to take the throne and
kingdom as son of David. Luke 1:32, 33. He gives assurance
that none may frustrate His final work for us in the heavenly
sanctuary. .
      7. The specific Philadelphia period of the church hr-ings,
us to the autumn of 1844, when the long period of the 2,300
days ended, and the work of judgment was opened in the,1
 most holy of the heavenly sanctuary. "I was shown tha(t
. . . the time for the commandments of God to shine out;
with all their importance, and for God's people to be tried
on the Sabbath truth, was when the door was opened in the
most holy place in the heavenly sanctuary, where the ark is,
 in which is contained the Ten Commandments. This door was
 not opened until the mediation of Jesus was finished in the
 holy place of the sanctuary in 1844. Then Jesus rose up and
 shut the door of the -holy place, and opened the door into
 the most holy, and passed within the second veil, where He
 now stands by the ark, and where the faith of Israel now
 reaches. I saw that Jesus had shut the door of the holy
 place, and no man can open it; and that He had opened the
 door into the most holy, and no man can shut it (Rev. 3:7, 8);
 and that since Jesus has opened the door into the most holy
 place, which contains the ark, the commandments have been
 shining out to God's people, and they are being tested on the
  Sabbath question."—Early Writings.

                 Laodicea.

                          APRIL 30, IS04.

                             Questions.

    I. What church of Asia is used to represent the very
last stage of Christ's church on earth? Rev. 3:14.
Note I.
    2. Through what experience must believers in the
last generation pass? Verses To, II; 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.
Rev. 12:17. Note 2.
    3. What is the promise to the overcomer in the
message to Philadelphia? Rev. 3:12.
    4. Against what tendencies must the latter-day be-
lievers guard? Matt. 24:12; 2 Tim. 3: 1-5.
    5. How is the speaker to the Laodiceans described?
Rev. 3:14. Note 3.
    6. What reproof is sadly given? Verses 15, 16.
    7. What makes the condition more deplorable?
Verse 17, first part.—Satisfaction in a profession of
the truth.
    8. What condition does this high and correct pro-
fession cover? Verse 17, last part.
    9. What counsel is given? Verse 18. What is the
gold? James 2:5; Eph. 2:7, 8. What the raiment?
Isa. 61:1o. What the anointing? Isa. 61:1.
   10. How shall this experience come?—By the sur-
render to the love of Jesus as the needy, common sin-
ners that we are. I Tim. I :t5; I John i : 8, 9.
     The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
         OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                17

   1. What encouragement is in the reproof itself?
Rev. 3:19.
  12. Must the sinner search far to find the Saviour?
Verse zo, first part.
  13. What is the needy soul to do?—Only to hear,
open the heart's door; no longer hold it•shut. Verse
zo; John 14:23.
         "Yes, I'll open this proud heart's door,
           Yes, I'll let Him in.
         Gladly I'll welcome Him evermore;
           0, yes, I'll let Him in.
         Blessed Saviour, abide with me,
         Cares and trials will lighter be;
         I am safe if I'm only with Thee,
           O blessed Lord, come in."

  14. What does Christ long to do? Rev. 3:20, last
part. Note 4.
  15. What is' the final promise and exhortation?
Verses 21, 22.
  Note that all the promises and warnings and lessons
of the messages to the seven churches come to thoSe
in the last days, with the solemn call to hear what the
Spirit saith unto the churches. Truly last-day pro-
fessors and unbelievers are left without excuse. "What
could have been clone more to My vineyard, that I
have not done in it?" Isa. 5:4.

                           Notes.
    1. Laodicea signifies a "judging of the people." From
1844 to the close of probation is the hour of God's judgment.
After this work of judging the people, the Lord will come.
The message to the world in this judgment hour is the three-
fold message of Rev. 14:6-12, the commandments of God, and

       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich n.5.,
IS        OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION


the faith of Jesus, which has brought out this Seventh-day
Adventist people.
     2. It is evident that the last two periods of the church—
Philadelphia and Laodicea—cover one and the same genera-
tion. The rise of the Advent movement and the special mes-
sage of preparation for the end was a signal that the opening
years of the closing generation had been reached, to whom
was due Godls, final warning. Believers who came in during
the Philadelphian experience, such as -live to the coming of the
Lord, pass through the Laodicean period. The final trials
and experiences of, the last-day church are therefore described
in the message to Philadelphia, while the special perils to the
waiting church in the last generation are pointed out in the
Laodicean message. The time of the Laodicean message is
fine of drowsiness and peril, and the burden of the message is
to escape from the Laodicean condition.
     3. The title "Amen" suggests the final Word to the churches,
the faithful witness that can not spare; for now the church
must be made clean and pure to meet the Lord. It must re-
turn to the first lo.ve and first works, to the primitive purity
of the first stage of Ephesus, and maintain constantly to the
end that blessed experience enjoyed in the brief stage of the
Philadelphia church, in which believers, joined in fellowship,
waited for the appearing of the Saviour. Eph. 5:27; Rev.
1 4:5.
     4. He will take our sin and give His righteousness. 2
Cor. 5:21.. He longs to share our trials and share with us
His triumphs.

    3. What assurance is given us by the rainbow about
the throne? Isa. 54:9, Io. Note 3.
     4. Whom did the prophet next see round about the
throne? Verse 4. Who are these? Rev. 5:9 (last.
part), Io. Note 4.
     5.. Further describe the view of the throne presented
in the vision. Chap. 4:57-9. Instead of "beasts" the
Revised Version has "living creatures."
     6. What song of praise is uttered by the elders?
Verses io, 11.
     7. What did John see in the hand of the One upon
the throne? What challenge was uttered by the angel?
What was the response? Chap. 5:1-3.
     8: How did this affect the prophet? What as-
 surance was given? Verses 4, 5.
     9. Who then appeared to the prophet's vision?
 What did the Saviour do? Verses 6, 7. Note 5.
  • 1o. What song of praise was then heard in heaven?
 Verses 8-12.
      I. In prophetic anticipation unto what grand chorus
 did this song of praise swell?—In. vision the prophet
 was carried to the final triumph, when all the universe
 is cleansed from sin through the sacrifice of the Lamb
 of God. Verse 13.
    12. Where will all the saved have begun to learn the
 song? Ps. 40:1-3.
                           Notes.

     i. These visions of heaven show how real and tangible
is that place. Mysticism would make heaven but a state or
condition; but heaven is a real place. Spiritual beings in

 bodily form dwell there and go to and fro. Men in redeemed
 flesh, who once lived on earth, as Enoch and - Moses and
 Elijah, and our Lord and Saviour, in whose hands of flesh may
 he seen the prints of the nails, serve and dwell in heaven.
There is the tree of life and the garden of Eden, trees that
once rooted in the very soil of this earth as do those which
we see abbut us. Let none be robbed of the hope of heaven
by the theosophical mysticism which is sweeping the world
 to-day.
     2. Throughout the Scriptures the Lord represents Him-
self as one before whose face and bodily presence the re-
deemed sinner in immortal flesh may one day come. The
fact that God is Spirit in no way suggests the spiritualistic
idea of an all-pervading personality or influence with no
special place where His bodily presence may be approached
by spiritual beings. Here is a view of the throne of heaven
wholly in accord with scenes presented in Holy Writ: "I saw
a throne, and on it sat the Father and the Son. I gazed on
Jesus' countenance and admired His lovely person. The
 Father's person I could not behold, for a cloud of glorious
light covered Him. I asked Jesus if His Father had a form
like Himself. He said He had, but I could not behold it, for,
said He, if you should once behold the glory of His person,
you would cease to exist."—Early Writings, p. 45.
     3. "In heaven the semblance of a rainbow encircles the
throne, and overarches the head of Christ. The prophet says,
'As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of
rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about [the
throne]. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of
Jehovah.' The Revelator declares, 'Behold, a throne was set in
heaven, and One sat on the throne. . . . There was a rain-
bow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.'
When man by his great wickedness invites the divine judg-
ments, the Saviour, interceding with the Father in his behalf,
points to the bow in the clouds, to the rainbow around the
throne and above His own head, as a token of the mercy of
God toward the repentant sinner. With the assurances given
to Noah concerning the flood, God Himself has linked one
of the most precious promises of His grace. . . . Isa.
54:9, io."—Patriarchs and P. rophets, P. 107.
     4. These elders are plainly redeemed men, who once lived
on earth. Many sleeping saints arose with Christ (Matt. 27:
52, 53), and as He ascended on high He led a multitude of
captives (Eph. 4:8, margin), first-fruits and pledges of His

victory over the grave and of the coming resurrection of all the
righteous dead. In Solomon's temple note that the priests
served in courses of twenty-four. i Chron. 24:3, 4.
    5. By His death and His victory over sin, Jesus had
demonstrated His power to make manifest to the sons of men
the mystery of the salvation of God, and as head of the church
redeemed, it was His to reveal to the prophet events of the
future which He desired His servants to understand.




            LESSON V11.—The Seven Seals.

                         MAy 14, 1904.

      General Note. — In the vision of the seven churches we
 studied the spiritual history of the church of Christ as de-
 veloped in seven successive eras, or periods, from apostolic
 days to the end of time. The seven, seals 'naturally suggest
 a line of prophecy covering the same,\ per'iods; bringing out
 additional phases of history. The series of the seven churches
  gives a view of the church of Christ in the midst of apostasy
  and through the experiences of the latter days. This series
  of the seven seals gives a view of the falling away, and the
  history of the apostate church in alliance with the world,
.-through these same periods to the long years of papal su-
  premacy. While the sixth in the series of the seven churches
  brings us to the Advent movement of 1846-44, and to the
  generation that is to see the coming of the Lord, the sixth
  seal in this series now to be studied, by an abrupt change
  from symbolic to literal prophecy, deals with the signs of the
  second advent and the scenes of, the end. Thus there is a
  distinct parallel in the idea of the advent in the sixth stage
  of each series, while in each the s'venth touches eternity.
                         . Questions.
    I. What was to be revealed to John in this vision?
 Rev. 4:1, last part.
    2. How were the successive scenes of history to be
 unfolded to the view? Chap. 5:2.
         The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
22       OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

   3. Describe the opening of the first seal. What was
seen? What did the rider do? Chap. 6:1, 2. Note 1.
What is represented by the scene?
   4. Describe the opening of the second seal. What
was seen?—The work of the red horse. What is rep-
resented by the symbol? Verses 3, 4. Note 2.
   5. What was seen as the third seal was opened?
What words were heard? What stage of history is
covered by the third seal? Verses 5, 6. Note 3.
   6. As worldliness and apostasy are specially rising
up again in the last falling away, what is our danger?
2 Tim. 3:1-5; Luke 21 :34-36.
   7. What came with the opening of the fouth seal?
What fearful work was done? What special era in his-
tory answers to this description? Rev. 6:7, 8. Note 4.
   8. What was seen with the opening of the fifth seal?
What cry came forth? What did the prophet see ac-
complished? Verses 9-11. Note 5.
   9. Having been brought in the history to the last
days, with what events does the sixth seal open?
Verses 12, 13. The "great" earthquake of Lisbon oc-
cured in 1755.
  10. What does Christ say of these same signs? Matt.
24:29, 30.
   11. What is the word to our generation? Matt.
24 :32-35.
                            Notes.

     i. The rider on the white horse, going forth to conquer. •
fitly symbolizes the apostolic church going forth in the con-

                         our field.
          OUTLINE STUf1IES . Iet THE REVELATIol\f               23

 quering power of, the Gospel in its purity. See Acts 8:4;
 Col. 1:2, 3. Compare Rev. 2:2, 3, the message to the apostolic
 church in the prophecy of the seven churches. In the study
 of the messages to the seven churches we found that, while
 the principles involved in each message have lessons for all
 time, the specifications applied particularly to distinct and suc-
 cessive eras. So„ while the symbolism of each of these' seals
 teaches lessons applicable in all time, it will be seen that they,
 too, have a specific application to the same successive eras in
 history covered by the prophecy of the seven churches.
      2. The symbols of the second seal fitly represent the fall-
 ing away of the great body of the church from primitive purity
 after apostolic days. "Errors began to arise, worldliness
 came in. The ecclesiastical power sought the alliance of the
 secular. Troubles and commotions were the result." See the
 reference to the apostate professors in this second era of the
 church, in the message to the loyal ones in Rev. 2:9. World-
 liness and compromise and dependence on fleshly power must
 ever work the same. Note that the principles involved in each
 stage of the great controversy are living issues for all time.
      3. In the third era of the church, say from Constantine's
 day; A. D. 32.g; to the full establishment ofi,ther Papacy,-.A.- D.
-538;* we found in the message to the third, or Pergamos,
 church, that the believers were in great peril because of
  Satan's very seat being in their midst. The church of the
 apostasy had fully joined the world. Black is the fit symbol
  of this stage. See Matt. 6:23. As worldliness and commer-
  cialism came in, the oil and wine of the Spirit's grace leaked
  out./ 7
      4. Compare with the description of the apostate influences,
  under which the loyal believers suffered in the fourth, or
 Thyatira, stage of the seven churches. Rev. 2:18-2o. The
  apostate church ,EAT--D-. 538 and onward through the long
  period of -its supremacy-)4 is there described as the persecuting
  Jezebel, and the teachings as the doctrine of Satan. In this,
  fourth seal, the symbolism scarcely needs interpretation, so
  vividly does it picture the dark days of papal. rule. "Hell"
  or "hades" (R. V.),I the grave. See Dan.                 -
       5. The-fifth, or t - Sardis. period in the series of seven
  churches-covered .the church of the Reformation, the Protes-
  tant.erarapproaching the-time of the , rise of the special Advent
  movement:, Here the fifth seal plainly suggests the. blood of
  the martyrs and of the faithful of past ages crying out to God
" This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
   for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
 24       OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

 to end the long reign of apostasy and sin. Compare Gen.
4:1o; Heb. 11:4. When great Babylon is dealt with, in her will
 be found the blood of all that have been slain upon the earth;
 for the principles of apostasy have been the same in all ages.
 Rev. 18:24. Compare Matt. 23:34, 35.

                     Seals.

                         MAY. 21, 1904.

                           Questions.
    1. What great event follows the falling of the stars,
as witnessed by the prophet under the sixth seal?
Rev. 6:13, 14. Compare Matt. 24:29, last part.
    2. How will that day come upon the unprepared?
Verses 15-17.
    3. In view of the stupendous issue before this gen-
eration, what message does God send? See Isa. 4o: 3,
To; Rev. 14:6, 7, 12.
    4. What will be the condition among the nations
while this message is being carried? Rev.       :18; Joel
3:9, II, 14.
    5. How are the nations restrained from utterly des-
troying one another? Rev. 7:1. Note i.
   6. For what special purpose are the winds of strife
restrained? Verses 2, 3.
    7. What is the sign or seal of the living God?
Ezek. 20:20; Ex. 20:8-1i. Note 2.
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
                will be at some future period."
         OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                  25

    8. What follows the closing of the sealing message
under the sixth seal? Rev. 8:i; Matt. 25:31. Note 3.
     9. What scene of triumph did John then behold?
Rev. 7:9, 10.
   10. What question was raised and answered for the
benefit of those who meet temptation and trial? Verses
1 3, 14-
     1. What glorious picture is set before us who must
serve a little longer here? Verses 15-17.
   12. What special incentive to service have we in
present-day conditions?—While gusty winds of strife
blow here and there, still God in mercy restrains the
coming universal strife in order that the sealing mes-
sage of Sabbath and Advent reform may be carried
by us to all the world. Work not clone in times of
peace must be done in times of war and hardship.
Now, just now, is the time to work.
                              Notes.
    i. Winds are used as symbolic of war and strife. Dan.
7:2; Jer. 23:35-33.
    2. Creative power is the distinguishing feature of the
living God. Acts 14:15. See Rom. 4          for proof that sign
and seal have the same meaning.
    3. The silence in heaven at the opening of the seventh
seal shows that this seal covers the actual appearing of Christ
in the clouds of heaven as He comes with all the angels to
gather His saints. Ministry in heaven ceases, and the scene
of activity among the heavenly beings is transferred to the
earth for a little time, until the hosts of angels and the re-
deemed, led by their Captain and Saviour, return to the city
of God. Half an hour, prophetic time, would be about seven
days. In a description of this scene in "Early Writings" we are
told: "We all entered the cloud together, and were seven days
ascending to the sea of glass."—P. 12.

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."

28       OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

                             Notes.

    1. The seven trumpets deal with the wars of nations; the
first four with the downfall of the western division of the
Roman Empire. The division of Rome, as prophesied by
Daniel, was to be brought about amidst war and tumult.
The four attacks that really shattered the Western Empire are
here covered.
     2. As though to reassure the saints who were to witness
the coming calamities of war, the Lord shows how surely the
prayers of the saints on earth came up before His throne.
"The incense, ascending with the_prayers of Israel, represents
the merits and intercession of Christ."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 353• This picture must ever comfort believers who
will pass through the last struggle of the nations, when war
and tumult is to fill the earth. Verse 5 seems to pass to
the close of the heavenly ministry and the final desolation of
the earth.
    3. "Hail and fire mingled with blood" suggests war from
the north, with fire and sword. The Goths fell upon Rome
from the icy north like a hailstorm, A. D. 395-419, particularly
under Alaric. Compare these significant phrases from the
historian Gibbon's account with the language of the prophet:
"They [the Goths] deserted their farms at the first sound of
the trumpet." "Armies . . . issuing from the frozen
regions of the north." "The consuming flames of war spread
from the banks of the Rhine over the greater part of seventeen
provinces of Gaul." "His [the poet Claudian] trees, his old
contemporary trees, must blaze in the conflagration of the
whole country." The text says, "The third part of trees."
The phrase, "the third part," often repeated in this series,
evidently has reference to the division of the empire into three
parts, effected in Constantine's day,—the eastern, with Con-
stantinople the capital: the western, including Britain, Gaul
(France), and Spain; and the central division, having the city
of Rome as capital.
     4. The next crushing attack was from the burning regions
of the south, by the Vandals, A. D. 428-476. The sea is the
scene of conflict. Under Genseric, "Monarch of the sea,"
naval attacks were made upon the empire, aptly described in
the symbol of the burning mountain cast into the sea. Twice
he burned the entire Roman fleet. Carthage, in northern
Africa, was his capital. "He beheld," says Gibbon, "the final
extinction of the Empire of the West."

       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich as.
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                  29


     5. Invasion of the Huns under Atilla, whose forces struck
most heavily in the regions in which the main river systems
of the empire have their fountain head. His career in Western
Rome was brief, as a blazing meteor, A. D. 455-453. Atilla
gloried in the titles, -The Scourge of God," "The Terror
of the World," and bitter as wormwood was the cup of af-
fliction pressed to the lips of the inhabitants of the desolated
regions.
    6. "In the political firmament of the ancient world, while
under the reign of imperial Rome, the emperorship, the con-
sulate, and the senate shone like the sun, the moon, and the
stars."---Keith. After the conquest of Italy (A. D. 476),
Odoacer, king of the Heruli, abolished the office and title of
emperor in Western Rome, and in the course of history soon
following, the consulship (in 545) and senate (542) were also

set aside, "till Rome was without an emperor, a consul, or a
senate." The original Roman Empire had been divided.
The ancient seat of empire, the city of Rome, was henceforth
to enthorne a pope instead of a Cesar. In coming up he had
schemed the overthrow of three of the ten new nations, the
I-Ternli. Vandals, and Ostrogoths, and in A. D. 538 the politi-
:Vine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
30          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

cal supremacy of the Papacy was established, with seven na-
tions in the territory of Western Rome, represented in the
present-day nations of western Europe. Constantinople was
the sole imperial city. And in the events of the next two
trumpets the scene is transferred to the East.

boding of doom to the remaining, or Eastern, empire
of Rome is implied in the name given this organized
force? Verse I1, last part. See margin, "a destroyer."

    7. What definite prophetic period is here assigned
to this power? Verse io, last part. What literal time?

to this power? Verse 15. "An hour" (one-twenty-
fourth of a prophetic day, or literal year)= 15 days
literal time; "a day"-1 year; "a month"= 30 years;
"a year" =36o years; total 391 years and 15 days, time

trumpet on August II, 1840? Rev. 1i:14.

                             Notes.

     1. The very next century after the events growing out of
the fourth trumpet, the rise of Mohammedanism began to
prepare the forces that brought ruin upon Eastern Rome.
Mohammed was recognized as a prophet and entered Medina as
prince in the year 622. In the next ten years he gathered
nearly all 'Arabia to his standard, and following his death (in
632), the 'fanatical warriors were ready to burst forth from the
Arabian deserts.
     2. The word translated "bottomless pit" means a waste or
desert region. How graphically the figures of speech describe
the swarming forth of the Mohammedan forces, like clouds
of locusts from the desert of Arabia, darkening the sky.
    3. When Abubeker, who succeeded Mohammed, sent forth
his followers against Syria, he issued the command: "Let not
your victory be stained with the blood_ of women and children.
Destroy no palm trees nor burn any fields of corn. Cut down
no fruit trees." He said they would find certain ones living
retired lives in the service of God who were to be let alone
and not harmed. But of those with "shaven crowns," of "the
       The needs of the cause of God are world wide.

synagogue of Satan," he said, "be sure you cleave their skulls
and give them no quarter till they either turn Mohammedan
or pay tribute."—Gibbon's Decline and Fall of Rome, chap. 51,
par. ro.
    4. Othman founded the empire which was used as the
agency for the overthrow of the Eastern Empire of Rome.
His name gave to this empire its title, Ottoman or Turkish
Empire. From his time the fanatical Moslem forces were
thrown directly against the Eastern Empire to destroy it. "It
was on the 27th day of July, 1299 of the Christian era, that
Othman first invaded the territory of Nicomedia; and the sin-
gufar accuracy of the date seems to disclose some foresight of
the rapid and destructive growth of the monster."—Gibbon,
chap. 64, par. 14.
    5. One hundred and fifty years from July 27, 1299, the date
the preservation of which the historian regarded as significant
(though he little knew the prophetic significance of it), brings
us to July 27, 1449. Through all the 15o years the Moslem
forces had harrassed and destroyed, until, in 1449, the emperor
succeeding to the throne of Constantinople took the office only
by permission of the Turkish sultan, who thus, says Gibbon,
"announced his supremacy, and the approaching downfall of
the Eastern Empire."
    6. The Mohammedan government was composed at that
time of the four great provinces, or sultanies, of Bagdad, Da-
mascus, Iconium, and Aleppo. All the Moslem forces were
now to be let loose upon the Eastern Empire for its final
destruction.
    7. Gibbon tells of the "myriads of Turkish horse" en-
gaged. The discovery of gunpowder and its adaptation to war
in firearms, which the Turks made use of in the siege of
Constantinople for the first time in history (the Greek inventor
having deserted to their side), answers exactly to the view the
prophet had of battle attended by puffs of smoke and blazing
brimstone.
    8. By accepting intervention from the powers, prescribing
a settlement with its own vassal, Egypt—which had revolted
and seemed about to establish its independence—the Turkish
Government acknowledged its dependence upon the great
powers. A report from Constantinople, published in the
London morning Chronicle, Sept. 18, 1840, states that an ulti-

matum was officially placed in the hands of Mohemet Ali, of
Egypt, so completing the arrangement of the powers, on the
nth day of August, 1840, and the Turkish sultan's independence
was gone, inasmuch as it was the powers and not the sultan
that were responsible to maintain the terms of settlement.
Since then he has been helped to stand by the intervention
and the jealousies of the powers, and the Eastern Question has
constituted a perpetual menace to the peace of the world.
The Advent Movement was well under way at this time, and
in 1838, Josiah Litch, an associate of William Miller, had pub-
lished the announcement that some event marking the close of
Turkish supremacy was to be looked for on August II, 1840.
Hearts were stirred to new energy in preaching the advent
warning by this fulfilment of prophecy before then- very eyes.

         OUTLINE STUDIES IN THt kEVELATIoN                 35

   4. When did these events take place irc heaven
(Dan. 8:14)?—At the close of the 2,30o years, in 1844.
(See Lessons Four and Five for account of the 1844
Advent Movement.)
   5. As the sounding df the sixth trumpet closed,
what view was given the prophet? Rev. io:t. Note 1.
   6. What did the angel have in his hand? What was
his attitude? Verse 2. Note 2.
   7. What ,was the first solemn burden of the mes-
sage represented by the angel? Verse 6. Note 3.
    8. What book dealing with prophetic time and the
latter days was especially opened to the world in the
Advent Movement of this period?—The book of Daniel.
   9. What command had been given Daniel regard-
ing the book of his prophecy? Dan. 12:4.
  10. In the vision of Revelation-10, what indicates the
opening of Daniel's book of prophecy? Verses 2 (last
part), 8. Note 4.
    1. What disappointment came to those who first
raised the cry of the ending of prophetic time?—They
fully expected the Lord to come in 1844, and the time
passed and no coming One appeared.
   12. What view in John?s vision foreshadowed this
bitter experience in the Advent Movement? Verses 9,
To; also verse 1, the cloud suggesting obscurity.
  13. What view of truth had been obscured to their
eyes?—They thought the cleansing of the sanctuary,
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
- for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
36       OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

at the Close of the 2,30o years of Dan. 8:14, to be
Christ's second coming to cleanse the earth by fire,
whereas it was the opening of His final ministry in the
heavenly sanctuary.
  14. Instead of the year 1844 marking the close of
the Gospel message to men, what new commission was
given to John as representing the church? Verse 11.
  15. What was to come in the days of the sounding
of the seventh trumpet, beginning in 1844? Verse 7.
  16. What is the mystery of God now being finished?
Eph. 3:3-9; Col. 1:26-28. Note 5.

                            Notes.
     I. The preaching of the Gospel is committed to men and
not to angels. 2 Cor. 5:19. Yet in the symbolism of Revela-
tion angels are repeatedly used to represent evident activifies
in the church on earth in the preaching of Gospel messages
to men. And there is something more than symbolism in this
representation, as angels join as unseen helpers in the work
of the church for the world. Heb. 1:14. Wherever the serv-
ant of God on earth goes with the message, with him will an-
gels go, and it may well be that to a mighty angel is com-
mitted the general oversight of this or that special movement;
for the view we get of heaven shows order and system in the
angelic hosts.
    2. The attitude indicates the world-wide proclamation of
his message by land and sea.
    3. The time of the end had come, and the thoughts of men
were to be directed to the second coming .of Christ. The
moment was at hand when the last _sands of time were to run
out from the last hour-glass of definite prophetic time. No
longer would prophetic time-periods point the way in history
toward the approaching end. The longest time-period in proph-
ecy, the 2,30o days, or years, of Dan. 8:14 (reaching from the
commandment to restore Jerusalem, 547 B. C., to 1844), was
now to close. The event was signalized by the great Advent

                         our field.
         OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                   37
proclamation sounded by land and sea to all the world in the
years just preceding 1844.
    4. The book of Daniel is the only prophetic book giving
the specific time of the cleansing of the sanctuary, the finish-
ing work of Christ's ministry. It is the only book that was
declared shut and sealed to the time of the end. The words
in Revelation io indicate a book that had been shut, which
then was to be opened. The great Advent Movement was
based on the opening of the prophecies, particularly of Daniel,
to the understanding of men, for the time was at hand. The
preaching of these prophecies stirred the world in the 1844
times.
     5. The mystery of God is the Gospel. When its work is
finished and Christ closes His ministry for sin, it' is evident
that all who will be saved at His coming will have allowed
grace to finish its work in the heart. To the believer living
at the close of probation, the finishing of the mystery means -
a preparing of the soul for translation to heaven,—the life
to be pure, clean, unselfish, holy, every evil disposition over-
come.
              "Then, 0 my Lord, prepare
                My soul for that grand day.
              0, wash me in Thy precious blood,
                And take my sins away."




LESSON X IL—The Measuring of the Temple and the
               Two Witnesses. '

                         JUNE   18, 1904.


                            Questions.

   I. After the bitter disappointment in 1844, what
 commission was criven the church? Rev.
 Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
38       OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

     2. From that time what solemn work has been going
 forward in heaven? Dan. 8:14; Rev. 14:6; 10:7.
     3. To what place is the faith of Israel directed in
 this hour of God's judgment? Heb. 8:1, 2; Rev II:19,
 first part; 3:8.
     4. What, then, must be a special aim of the Gospel
 message in this time?,—To call attention to the work
 going forward in the temple of God and to the means
 of grace by which to meet the standard, or measure,
. of the judgment.
     5. What view in John's vision shows that this was
 the very message assigned the church after 1844?
 Rev. to:II and it:I, together.
     6. What is the standard of measurement in the
 temple and service of God? Rev. 1:19, second clause;
  Eccl. 12:13, 14; John 12:48; Rev. 14: 12. Note 1.
     7. What was to be left out in measuring? What
 would the nations do? What period of time is men-
 tioned? Is it previously referred to in prophecy?
  Rev. II :2. Note 2.
     8. Was God to be left without witness in those
  days? Verse 3.
     9. Who are these witnesses? Verse 4. Note 3.
    1o. What power have the witnesses to maintain their
  testimony? Verses 5, 6. Note 4.
    11. What experience came to these witnesses as the
  long prophetic period drew to a close? Verse 7.
    12. -Where is this said to take place? Verse 8.

       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
         OUTLINE STUDIES IN TILE REVELATION                 39

  13. What was seen in fulfilment of this prophecy?—
The infidel attack upon the Bible in the French Revo-
lution. Note 5.
  14. What was the attitude of other peoples?
Verse 9.
   15. Why did infidelity hate the Word of God and
rejoice at silencing it? Verse 10. Compare 1 Kings
22:8.
   16. Were the two witnesses permanently silenced?
Verse 11. Note 6.
   17. What followed this infidel effort to overthrow the
two witnesses? Verses II (last part), 12, 13. Note 7.
   18. What lesson is there for us in these historical
 efforts, first of papal and then of infidel powers, to
suppress the Word of God? Matt. 24:33-35; Isa. 4o:
8-1o; Rev. 12:11.

                             Notes.

     I. The standard of measurement that must be met by
those who would worship in the heavenly temple is the stand-
ard of the temple itself—eternal righteousness and truth. It is
summed up in Christ, who is the truth, and the mystery of the
Gospel is to bring the members of the church "unto the meas-
ure of the stature of the fulness of Christ." His measure is
the measure of the perfect law of God, which is in his heart.
Ps. 40:7, 8. Heaven itself is measured by this standard, hence
those who are to enter there must also meet it, not unaided
and alone, but hid in Christ.
     a.. The Gentiles (nations, R. V.) could not enter the inner
court of the earthly temple. The nations are of this world,
 not of the world to come, with which this measuring work
 is dealing. Not all the powers of earth can help a man t-
 meet the standard. Rom. 8:7, 8. The introduction of earthly
 powers, treading down the truth of God, here leads to refer-

           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
40        OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

ence to that forty-two months or 1,260 days (literal years) of
papal rule, spoken of in Dan. 7:25. This historic period began
in 538 and ended 1798.
     3. The figure is borrowed from Zechariah 4, where, in verse
6, the olive trees and the candlesticks are explained to be "the
Word of the Lord." Also Ps. 119:105; John 5:39. Through
all the Dark Ages, the Scriptures, the Old and the New Testa-
ments, testified for God. Because of this the enemy sought
to burn the Word and keep it from the people. And all
through these dark days God found men and women ready
to hold forth the Word at the peril of life itself.
    4. Not all the opposition to the Scripture could put it
out of the world. God maintained His own Word. When He
speaks judgments and warnings, none can turn aside the word.
See Rev. 22:18, 19. In facing Bible truth men are not dealing
with a common book, to be lightly accepted or rejected.
    5. In the days of papal supremacy the Bible was kept in
obscurity, as in sackcloth. But those days were shortened,
and the light was shining out from the Word. "According to
the words of the prophet, then, a little before the year 1798,
some power of Satanic origin and character would rise to
make war upon the Bible. And in the land where the testi-
mony of God's two witnesses should thus be silenced, there
would be manifest the atheism of the Pharaoh ["Who is Jeho-
vah, that I should obey His voice?"], and the licentiousness of
Sodom."—Great Controversy, p. 268. It was fulfilled in the
formal repudiation of God and the Bible by revolutionary
France in 1793. Bibles were burned and every sacred insti-
tution turned to mockery. Afresh they crucified the Lord in
seeking to blot out His truth.
    6. Frightened by the fearful scenes that followed the de-
cree suppressing the Bible in 1793, the assembly revoked the
decree just three and a half years later.
     7. The lesson taught by the bloody scenes of revolution
startled men. From that time dates the Modern era of Bible
circulation. Soon came the Bible societies and the Protes-
tant missionary movement, putting the Bible into all the leading
languages of earth, and exalting and glorifying it before the
eyes of all. The shock, as of an earthquake, shattered France,
one of the ten kingdoms (the Franks) of divided Rome. The

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."

marginal reading in verse 13, "names," or titles of men, sug-
gests the titles of nobility that were abolished in the French
Revolution.




  LESSON XI11.—Events of the Seventh Trumpet.

                         JUNE 25, 1904.


    Note. — In Rev. to and 11:1-13, the scene is slightly changed
to give the prophet a view of special events associated with
the times under review in the series of the seven trumpets.
Rev. 11:14 again resumes the series of trumpets and the fate
of nations.

                            Questions.

    I. To what specific date are we brought in the
sixth trumpet?—August II, 1840. See Lesson Io.
   2. What is said of. the time of the next trumpet?
Rev. II:14.
   3. When did the seventh trumpet begin to sound?
          Give the evidence.—Rev. 1o:7 shows that
Christ was to take up the final phase of His ministry
as the seventh trumpet began to sound. The begin-
ning of this final ministry, the cleansing of the sanc-
tuary, is fixed by the prophetic period of Dan. 8: 14,
ending in 1844.
    4. As the trumpet sounded, what was heard? What
did the voices declare? Rev. 11:13. Note 1.
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                     already to harvest."
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION

    5. What -prophecy will then be fulfilled? Dan.
7:27.
    6. Before that time shall come, what takes place in
the heavenly ministry? Dan. 7:26, 9-11.
    7. What reference to the opening of the judgment
is there in the record concerning the seventh trumpet?
Rev. 1i:19. Note 2.
    8. With whom does the judgment work begin?
Verse 18.
    9. When the judgment has passed upon the living,
what will have been accomplished? Rev. 10:7.
   10. What was to be the condition of the nations in
this time? Verse 18 (see also Luke 21:25, 26; Joel 3:
9-11, 14-17). Do we see these conditions to-day?
    i. What is the Lord to do to the warring nations?
Verse 18, last part. When? 2 Thess.
   12. When did Christ receive the kingdom?—At the
close of the judgment work. Dan. 7:13, 14. -NAThere
will it be bestowed? Ps. 2:6-8.
   13. What shout will then ring through heaven? Rev.
11:15-17.
   14. In what office will He come the second time?
Rev. 19:11-16; Matt. 13:41.
   15. What will He then do for His children? Rev.
11:18; 22:12.
  16. What assurance have we now? Rev. 3:Io, II; 2
Tim. I:12.
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
          OUTLINE STUDIES IN THE REVELATION                    43

                              Notes.
     I. Before entering upon details of events to come under
the sounding of the seventh trumpet, the prophet's view is
first of all directed to the triumph when Christ's ministry for
sin is finished.
     2. The study of the sanctuary question shows that the in-
vestigative judgment that precedes the coming of the Lord is
the cleansing of the sanctuary, the finishing of Christ's ministry
in the second apartment of the heavenly temple. The opening
of this apartment, where the ark of the testament is, and the
opening of the judgment, are one and the same events.

                         watchword.
        AN OLD FRIEND RETURNED




W
         HEN a dear friend returns after a long absence,
          how gladly we welcome him! What satisfaction
          his very presence brings! Perhaps he has
          helped us over some hard place, or encouraged
us in some trial—has in fact proven himself "a friend
indeed."

     Just as gladly do the Sabbath-school officers and teach-
ers welcome the return of the Sabbath-school Worker. Its
familiar face brings encouragement to all. It was a help in
the past, and we have missed it so sadly during its absence
that it now seems doubly welcome.
      We are not disappointed on a closer acquaintance,
either, for although smaller in size than before, it still has
just the helpful suggestions, the reports from other schools,
the instruction for teachers and officers, which we all need.
Its "Helps on the Sabbath-school Lessons" for each week
and for every division of the school are more valuable than
ever, and contain just the information for which every earn-
est teacher feels the need.

     The price, too, is so low that all can now afford to have
it-35 cents per year to individual addresses, or 25 cents a
copy where two or more copies are sent to one name and
address.

    You will surely need the Worker for 1904.

                                 —IN—

                THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES

FROM   the pen of Prof. G. W. Rine, who has for years been a
  student of the subject, we shall soon present the following articles
under the general heading:—

       The Industrial Conflict in the Light of Revelation

(1) Work a Duty and a Blessing; (2) Wealth and the Obligation It Im-
poses; (3) The Demon of Avarice; (z) Monopoly, Its Nature and His-
tory; (5) Present-Day Monopoly; (6) Phenomenal Increase of Wealth
in the End of the Age; (7) Congestion of Wealth versus Diffusion of
Knowledge; (8) Prevalence and Duration of Poverty; (9) "Lovers of
Pleasures;" (to) Lawlessness of Labor; (t r) What Will the Harvest Be?
(r2) How the Problem Will Be Solved; (13) "They Shall Not Build and
Another Inhabit."
     The above are not to be considered as exact titles, but as indicat-
ing the general scope of the subject.
     We know that these will be intensely interesting. The paper for
this period of time ought to receive a large number of short-term sub-
scriptions.
    Another writer, Elder F. D. Starr, who has read the Bible through
more than a score of times, besides giving it much special study, has
read it in Greek, German, French; and the New Testament in Latin
and Hollandish, will furnish a series of articles on the books of the
Bible, one on each book.
    These will be a great help to old and young in getting a more
general knowledge of the wonderful Book.
     These are only a few of the good things. It is always thoroughly
alive and interesting, filled with timely matter that you and your
friends and neighbors ought to read.

Some Interesting Pamphlets

MATTHEW TWENTY-FOUR
  The question "What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the
  end of the world?" was not only in the minds of the disciples as
  they sat overlooking Jerusalem on that day so long ago, but
  was, and is, the one great question which interests all. The Sa-
  viour's answer, as recorded in the twenty-fourth chapter of Mat-
  thew, is therefore of interest to every individual. Its exposition,
  as given in the work entitled "Matthew Twenty-four," is com-
  plete, thorough, and readable. Bound in paper covers. Price roc.

MARSHALING OF THE NATIONS
  A pamphlet of 44 pages, dealing with the movements of the great
  nations of to day, showing how a few great powers are rapidly
  gaining control of the whole world. There is a meaning in all
  this that concerns every one, and the writer brings forth light
  from the divine Word for our consideration and profit. There are
  several instructive maps, showing the partitioning of the world as
  it is being made. Price ro cents each.
