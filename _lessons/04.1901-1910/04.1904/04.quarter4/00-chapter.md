      AN OPINION

     "Uncle Ben's Cobblestones" beautifully de-
monstrates in one brief, unique little volume, how
the "common things" of life may become more
useful than even acres of *diamonds; for after all
is said and done, it is the ability to use a thing
that makes it of real worth to us. Uncle Ben's
whole purpose seems to point to "wealth of
character" and real "soul culture."
     There is a ray of sunshine streaming through-
out the entire volume. At the same time there is
a staid sobriety of good cheer that never once
touches the fickle so prevalent in books written
for the children of our day. Observation and
application are two of the greatest features in
character-building. Uncle Ben seems to know
what he is talking about along these lines.
These two lessons are taught on every page in the
book. No child can escape their meaning. And
with these lessons there is a moral fragrance that
can not fail to please every true parent. The
spirit of the book is good for the older children.
It makes one feel as though he would like to live
a century, do good, and grow old gracefully.

 Great Threefold Gospel Message.
                 FOR SENIOR CLASSES.


                 Fourth Quarter, 1904.

   General Note.—These studies are not intended to be ex-
haustive of the subjects considered. The design, rather, is
to present in simple form a study of some of the great funda-
mental truths of the message; to review some of the truths
which have called out this people. This we believe will be
a great blessing to our youth, as well as to those who have
been longer in the way. The Bible is full of these rich truths.
So let none rest satisfied with a bare study of the texts pre-
sented in the lessons. Explore the great mine of truth from
week to week and gather for your using its priceless gems.
   "Study to show thyself approved unto God."—Paul.


           LESSON I.—The Christian's Hope.

   1. "Enoch was troubled in regard to the dead. It seemed
to him that the righteous and the wicked would go to the
dust together, and that would be their end. He could not
clearly see the life of the lust beyond the grave. In pro-
phetic vision he was instructed in regard to the Son of

God, who was to die man's sacrifice, and was shown the
coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven, attended by the
angelic host, to give life to the righteous dead, and ransom
them from their graves."—Spirit of Propn,ecy, Vol. 1, pages
61, 62.
    2. The Lord is making changes in character now. "He
is effecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with all
his triumphant boasting, and all his confederacy of evil
united against God and the law of His government, stands
viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries
and delusions." The change in our bodies will take place
when Jesus comes.

                     turn.

   8. What will some be saying? Verse 3.

  10. To what have they given heed? 2 Peter 1:16-21.
  11. What message will be given announcing the corn-
ing of Christ? Joel 2:1; 2 Peter 3 :3, 4. Note 1.
  12. What signs point to this event? Luke 21:7, 25, 26.
  13. What are those who see these signs to know?
Verse 31.
  14. What class of people will these warnings and signs
develop? What will they exclaim when they see the
Lord coming? Isa. 25:9.
  15. What sad words will fall from the lips of the lost?
Rev. 6:15-17.
  16. What exhortation is given to those who see the day

                              Note.
   The prophecy foretelling the forerunner of Christ was
given seven centuries before the coming of Christ. Isa. 40:3.
It was not fulfilled till the time came; then John appeared
on the scene in fulfilment of the divine prediction. So also
in the last days. When the Saviour is about to come the
second time the Lord will raise up a people who will fulfil
His word. The fact that some are said to scoff at the com-
ing of the Lord is evidence that the subject will be agitated
in the last days. Those who oppose it are called "scoffers."

                 TOPICAL STUDIES ON THE

                            Notes.
   1. Miracles will be wrought by these false Christs as a
proof of their divine mission. As the final, almost overmas-
tering delusion, Satan himself will appear personally, as a
being of dazzling brightness, working miracles, and claiming
to be the Son of God. Those only who understand the man-
ner of Christ's coming will be able to withstand this decep
tion. But to those who believe the Word the delusion is
clearly unmasked, for Satan can not counterfeit the manner
of the Saviour's return, nor bring to pass the stupendous
events with which it is attended.
   2. How blessed the thought that it is the "Lord Himself,"
a personal being, who comes. The One with the wounded
hands, and the pierced side,—"Himself," and not another.
   3. In addition to those living when the Lord comes, some
of the dead, both righteous and wicked, will be raised to
witness His return. Those who did the most to heap upon
Him shame when He was on earth as a man, will come
forth from the tomb to see that face which they have de-
spised shining as the sun. Some, also, of God's faithful chil-
dren who have faithfully warned the world of His return,
and fallen asleep waiting for Him, will be raised to see
Him come in glory.

    1. What question did the disciples ask the Saviour
upon a certain occasion? Matt. 24:3.
    2. Will signs of the end be seen in the heavens? Joel
2 :30, 31; Luke 21:25-27.
    3. By what convulsion of nature are these signs intro-
duced? Rev. 6:12-14. Note 1.
    4. What sign is to appear in the sun? After what is
it to be seen? Matt. 24 :29.
       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.

 Verses 34-36; Matt. 24 :42-44.
                             N otes.
   1. This is doubtless the great earthquake of Nov. 1, 1755,
known as the "Lisbon earthquake." It extended over a tract
of land of 4,000,000 of square miles. Europe, Africa, America,
the West Indies, and as far north as Greenland felt its
effects. Mountains were shaken to their foundations, and
90,000 persons are said to have perished in Lisbon alone.
One writer says: "The terror of the people was beyond de-
scription. Nobody wept; it was beyond tears."
    2. The tribulation here mentioned is that of the Dark Ages
caused by the papal supremacy. It began in A. D. 538, when
the decree of Emperor Justinian went into effect, which
made the pope the head of the church and the corrector of
heretics, and ended at the end of the prophetic period of 1260
years (Dan. 7:25) in A. D. 1798. The days ended in 1798;
the persecution, because of the Reformation, was shortened
about twenty years. This sign was to be in those days, but
after the persecution.
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
10               TOPICAL STUDIES ON THE

    3. Webster's Dictionary, edition 1869, says: "The Dark
Day, May 19, 1780.—So called on account of a remarkable
darkness on that day extending over all New England. . . .
The true cause of this remarkable phenomenon is not known."
    "The dark day in northern America was one of those
wonderful phenomena of nature which will always be read
with interest, but which philosophy is at a loss to explain."
—Herschel.
    "The 19th of May, in the year 1780, I well remember. I
was then in my sixteenth year. The morning was clear and
pleasant, but somewhere about eight o'clock, my father came
into the house and said there was an uncommon appearance
in the sun. There were not any clouds, but the air was thick,
having a smoky appearance, and the sun shone with a pale
and yellowish hue, but kept growing darker and darker,
until it was hid from sight. At noon we lit a candle, but it
did not give light as in the night, and my father could not
see to read with two candles."—Milo Bostwick, Camden, N.
J., March 3, 1848.
    4. "At eight o'clock in the evening the darkness was so
impenetrably thick as to render, traveling positively imprac-
ticable, and, although the moon rose nearly full about nine
o'clock, yet it did not give light enough to enable a person
to distinguish between the heavens and the earth."—Great
Events of the Greatest Century, page 44.
    "A great part of the following night also (May 19, 1780)
was singularly dark. The moon, though in the full, gave
no light, as in our text."—Sermon by Rev. Elam Potter, May
28, 1780.
    5. "But the most sublime phenomenon of shooting stars,
of which the world has furnished any record, was witnessed
through the United States on the morning of the 13th of
November, 1833. The entire extent of this astonishing exhi-
bition has not been precisely ascertained, but it covered no
inconsiderable portion of the earth's surface. . . . The
first appearance was that of fireworks of the most imposing
grandeur, covering the entire vault of heaven with myriads
of fire-balls, resembling sky-rockets. Their coruscations were
bright, gleaming, and incessant, and they fell thick as the
flakes in the early snows of December. To the splendors of
this celestial exhibition the most brilliant sky-rocket and fire-
works of art bear less relation than the twinkling of the most
tiny star to the broad glare of the sun. The whole heavens
seemed in motion, and suggested, to some, the awful grandeur
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."

of the image employed in the Apocalypse, upon the opening
of the sixth seal, when the stars of heaven fell unto the
earth, even as a fig tree easteth her untimely figs, when she
is shaken of a mighty wind.' "—Burritt's Geography of the
Heavens, page 163, edition 1854.
   "Soon our eyes were drawn to the east, for a small black
cloud had appeared, about half as large as a man's hand,
which we all knew was the sign of the Son of Man."—Early
Writings, page 11.


            LESSON V.—Signs on the Earth.

Verses 7-9.
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are whit('

Luke 21 :11 ; Mark 13 :8. Note 1.
  11. Is the definite day for the coming of the Lord

  lb. What assurance have we at this time? Verses

                            Notes.

    I. Space will not permit us to give an array of facts show-
ing how all these predictions of the Word are being fulfilled.
Their fulfilment is written everywhere. The accumulated
evidence all around us would fill volumes. See, in the in-
creasing armies and navies and war spirit of the nations;
the destructive conflagrations; devastations wrought by floods,
and ruin wrought by tempest and cyclone; ruin by earthquake
and volcanic eruption; pestilence and famine; in the unpar-
alleled accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few, and the
corresponding oppression of the poor, a fulfilment of the
Word. Violence, as in the days of Noah, fills the earth, and
the victims of intemperance, of mobs, strikes, murder, and
suicide, move on in mournful procession, by the tens of thou-
sands, to the tomb, as a reminder that the end is coming.
The increase is appalling. All around us, in a thousand
forms, we see the startling fulfilment of what the Lord has
said. Meditate upon it. Study what you see, and let the
voice of God, announcing through all these things the ruin
of the world, and the everlasting end of sin and sorrow, speak
to your soul.
     2. The Lord has placed signs in the heavens, on the earth,
 in the sea, in society, among tne nations, and in the hearts
of men—in every place possible—and tells us that when

       "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
          GREAT THREEFOLD GOSPEL MESSAGE.                  13

we see the things fulfilled which He has foretold, He is near,
even at the door; that the last generation of men is on the
earth. Then He bids us watch and pray.



           LESSON VI.—Last,-day Conditions.
                       NOVEMBER 5, 1904.
  General Nole.—The word ." millennium " is from two Latin
words, mille, thousand, and annum, year, and means a thou-
sand years. It is frequently interpreted to mean a thousand
years before the coming of Christ, when sin will cease to
exist and righteousness will fill the earth. If this were true,
the coming of Jesus would be indefinitely delayed, and the
world could • sleep on. That there will be no such period
prior to the advent of our Lord, the Scriptures abundantly
show. Let the object of the study of last-day conditions be
especially to note that the "peace and safety" cry, together
with the condition of the earth, are signs of the end, and
that the Lord is soon coming.
                          Questions.
   1. What will some be heard proclaiming in the last
days? What comes suddenly? 1 Thess. 5:3; Jer. 6 :14.
   2. What is the spiritual trend of the world? 2 Tim.
3:12, 13; 1 Tim. 4:1.
   3. What is to be preached in all the world before the
coming of the Lord? For what purpose? What comes.
next? Matt. 24:14. Note 1.
   4. How long will the wheat and the tares grow to-
gether? Matt. 13:24-30. What is represented by the
wheat?    The tares? What is the harvest? Verses
3S, 39.
   5. How great will be the working of Satan in the
earth? 2 Thess. 2:8-12.

of the earth in the last days? Matt. 24:37-39. Why did
the people not know in Noah's day that the flood was
coming?

                               Note.
   1. Many will hear the proclamation of the end and coming
destruction of the world, as it is sounded among the nations,
and be impressed to flee from the coming storm. On the
other hand, the "peace and safety cry," combined with the
prevailing iniquity and vanity of the world, will be drawing
them to perdition.
    It is not stated that the Gospel will convert all the world.
It never has in the past. It takes out of the nations a people
for the Lord. The Lord gives all an opportunity to accept
of salvation. The choice is left with them.
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

  16. What glorious scene in the new earth is pictured
before us? Rev. 21 :1-5 ; Isa. 35 :5-10.
  17. How is the home of each one described? Tsa. 65 :
17, 21, 22.
  IS. In view of these things, what exhortation is given
us? 2 Peter 3:14.
                           Notes.
   1. Satan was bidding for the soul of the world's Redeemer,
and, when other efforts to overcome Him had failed, he
offered Him as a bribe the greatest thing he had to give,
viz., the dominion of the earth usurped from man. It was
this Jesus came to restore to man, not by bowing to Satan,
but by conquering him through death.
   2. Through disobedience man lost his innocence and purity,
his life, and his Eden home. All this Jesus came to seek
and to restore to the obedient.
   3. Stephen established before his accusers the resurrec-
tion of the dead, by showing that God made a promise to
Abraham which was not fulfilled while he lived, and he must,
therefore, be raised from the dead to receive its fulfilment.
God's Word is sure. Even death can not hinder its fulfil-
ment.
   4. The reward of obedience is eternal life. Rom. 6:23.
This reward will not be spent in some region "beyond the
bounds of time and space," but the Lord has provided a real
home in the regenerated earth in which His people will enjoy
the bliss of eternal life.

   15. What is the character of God's law? Rom. 7:12.
   16. Where does all opposition to its claims find its
 origin? Rom. 8:7.
   17. What will be the standard of moral rectitude in
 the judgment? James 2:8-12.
    18. What gracious promise is made to those who have
 broken its precepts? 1 John 1:8, 9.
                           Notes.
    1. The Lord did not hand down His law to man through
 inspiration the same as He did other portions of His Word.
   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
                TOPICAL STUDIES ON THE

He came down from the throne in flaming fire, and earth-
quake power, and wrote it Himself on the imperishable
stone.
    2. "In the holiest I saw an ark; on the top and sides of
it was purest gold. . . . In the ark was the golden pot
of manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of stone
which folded together like a book. Jesus opened them, and
I saw the ten commandments written on them with the
finger of God. On one table was four, and on the other six.
The four on the first table shone brighter than the other six.
But the fourth, the Sabbath commandment, shone above them
all; for the Sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of
God's holy name. The holy Sabbath looked glorious—a halo
of glory was all around it."—Early Writings, page 26.
    3. God's kingdom includes more than this speck of a
world. It takes in every world on high, and every created
intelligence, both angels and men. Within this universal
kingdom there is but one King and one law, the law which
is in• the heavenly sanctuary, a copy of which was given to
Moses to place in the ark.
    4. The law, being an expression of the everlasting right-
eousness of God's character, is as enduring as -the very ex-
istence of its Author. The law can not justify us, for we
have all transgressed its precepts. By looking into it we
see ourselves sinners, lost, and in need of a Saviour. It thus
points us to Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the
sin of the world.
    5. Sin being the transgression of law, sin can there-
fore exist only where there is law. This shows clearly that
the law was in existence prior to the introduction of sin
into the world. Sin came because of its transgression. And
the fact that sin could exist in any planet, as well as this
one, shows the claims of the law to be universal.
    6. "Christ was not only the Leader of the Hebrews in the
wilderness—the Angel in whom was the name of Jehovah,
and who, veiled in the cloudy pillar, went before the host—
but it was He who gave the law to Israel. Amid the awful
glory of Sinai, Christ declared, in the hearing of all the
people, the ten precepts of His Father's law. It was He who
gave to Moses the law engraved upon the tables of stone."
"He who proclaimed the law from Sinai, and delivered to
Moses the precepts of the ritual law, is the same that spoke
the sermon on The mount."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
366.

    :LESSON 1X.-2'he institution of the Sabbath.

                  _NOVEMBER 26, 1904.
                        Questions.
    1. For whom was the Sabbath made? Mark 2 :27, 28.
    2. When was the Sabbath made? Gen. 2 :2, 3.
    3. Was the Sabbath known and observed before the
giving of the law on Sinai? Ex. 16 :4, 5, 23-30. Note 2.
    4. Of what is it a memorial? Ps. 111:4. The Jew-
ish translation of this text, by Rabbi Leeser, reads: "He
bath made a memorial for His wonderful works."
    5. Through whom were all things created? Col. 1:
16; Heb. 1:1, 2; John 1:1-3.
    6. Since Christ-was the agent in creation, who rested,
blessed, and sanctified the seventh day? Note 1.
    7. What steps were necessary to make the seventh
day the Sabbath? Do these reasons still exist? Will
they remain facts forever? Then how long will the
seventh remain the Lord's holy rest day?
    8. What commandment enjoining the observance of
the Sabbath was spoken from Sinai? Which day is the
Sabbath? What reason is given for its observance? Ex.
20 :8-11.
    9, Who spoke this precept from the mount? Neh.
9:11-14. See Lesson 8.
   10. Of what is the Sabbath a sign? Eze. 20 :12, 20.
   11. If God's people had been faithful in observing the
 Sabbath, how long would Jerusalem have stood? Jer.
17:24, 25. How long then did the Lord intend that the
 Sabbath should be kept?
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
20               TOPICAL. STUDIES ON TIII✓

  12. How long will it continue to be a sign - between
God and His people? Ex. 31:16, 17.
  13. Will the holy Sabbath be kept in the new earth?
Isa. 66 :22, 23. Note 3.
                            Notes.
   1. Christ, being the Creator, He, of course, made the Sab-
bath, and gave it to man as a sign of His power. He is
truly its Lord. Note that He blessed and sanctified the sev-
enth day after He had rested. The first seventh day had
then passed into eternity, so it could not have been this that
the Lord commanded us to observe, but- it was the seventh
day for all time to come that He placed His blessing upon,
and bade us keep holy in memory of Him.
   2. The fact that the weekly cycle was known before Sinai
(Gen. 8:10, 12; 29:27, 28) is clear evidence of the observance
of the Sabbath, as there is nothing in nature which indi-
cates a weekly cycle.
   3. The Sabbath was instituted in Eden, before the foot-
print of sin was seen in the universe. Like the marriage
institution, it comes to us as a relic from the home of purity
of the father of the race. When the curse is removed, and
the earth is made new, the redeemed will observe the Sab-
bath throughout eternity in honor of their Redeemer.

bath when He was on the earth? Luke 4:16; Mark 1 :21;
6:2. Note that this was His "custom."
   2. Should Christians follow His example? 1 Peter
2:21; 1 John 2:6.
   3. If Jesus were on -the earth to-day, what day would
He observe as the Sabbath? Heb.'13 :8.
        "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.

   14. What Tule did Jesus give regulating the observance
 of the Sabbath? What work is permissible? Matt.
12:10-12.
    15. From what should we refrain on the Sabbath?
 What blessing is promised to those who keep the Sabbath?
 Isa. 58:13, 14.
 We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                           our field.
22               TOPICAL STUDIES ON THE

                             Notes.
    1. Jerusalem was destroyed in A. D. 70. So, for nearly
forty years, they were to pray that they might not have to
flee from their homes upon the Sabbath day. That this was
not because of a fear, as some claim, that the gates of the
city would be closed on the Sabbath, is seen from the fact
that all Judea is spoken of. Matt. 24:16. It was because
the Sabbath was holy.
    2. This would have been a good opportunity for Paul to
have instructed these Gentile converts concerning the change
of the Sabbath had such a change been made. That nothing
was said concerning the matter, or any service held till the
next Sabbath, shows that no change of the Sabbath had been
made at this time. "We must go to later than apostolic
times for the establishment of Sunday observance."—Chris-
tian at Work, 188k.
   3. Upon this occasion they met for worship by the river-
side, which shows that they did not meet in the synagogues
on the Sabbath simply because the Jews met upon that day.
Note that in all these texts the Spirit of God calls that day
upon which they met the Sabbath day.



       LESSON XL—The First Day of the Week.
                    DECEMBER 10, 1904.
   General Note.—The first day of the week is mentioned
but eight times in the New Testament. Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:
1, 2, 9; Luke 24:1; John 20:1, 19; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:1, 2.
Six of these references refer to the same first day when
Jesus rose from the dead. In not a single instance is it called
by any sacred title whatsoever. Only that it puts forth such
pretentious claims, an investigation as to its sacredness
would be no more called for than for any other of the six
working days. Baptism, and not the observance of the first
day of the week, is the divinely ordained memorial of the
resurrection. Rom. 6:3-5.
                          Questions.
    1. Where is the first day of the week first referred-to
in the Scriptures? What work did the Lord perform
upon this day? Gen. 1:3-5.
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
         GREAT THREEFOLD GOSPEL MESSAGE.                 23

    2. How is this day designated in Eze. 46 :1? Note 1.
    3. When the first day of the week comes to us, where
is the Sabbath of the Lord? Mark 16:1, 2.
    4. On which clay of the week did Jesus rise from the
dead? To whom did He first appear? Matt. 28 :1;
Mark 16:9.
    5. What did Mary do? How did the disciples receive
her report? Mark 16:10, 11; Luke 24: 10, 11.
    6. To whom did He appear later in the day?. How
was their statement concerning having seen Him received?
Mark 16:12, 13.
    7. To whom did He appear in the evening? For what
did He reprove them? Verse 14.
    8. Could the disciples have been commemorating an
event they did not believe had occurred?
    9. What other recorded instances have we where the
Saviour met with His disciples before His ascension?
John 20:26; 21:2-14; Acts 1:4-11. Note 2.
   10. What record is given by Luke of a meeting upon the
first day of the week at Troas? Acts 20:7. Who
 preached on this occasion?
   11. What time of the day was it? Verse S. What
 miracle was performed? Verses 9, 10. Note 3.
   12. While Paul was holding this farewell meeting with
 the brethren, what were those who were with him doing?
 Verse 13.
   13. What did Paul do in the morning? Verses •13, 14.
 Note 4.
   14. Where is the only mention Paul makes of the first
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                     already to harvest."
24              TOPICAL STUDIES ON THE


day of the week in his epistles? 1 Cor. 16:1, 2. Note 5.
What exhortation is given concerning the day?
  15. What has the Saviour assured us will be rooted up?
.Matt. 15:13.
                            Notes.

    1. There being but six days in the week aside from the
holy Sabbath, the first day of - the week is here called a
"working day" by the Spirit of the Lord.
    2. Neither of these instances could have been on the first
day of the week, unless it was the meeting at the sea of
Tiberias. The Saviour met with His disciples on other days
-besides the first day, and we have no record that He, at any
time, intimated any change in the Sabbath.
    3. As the day begins at the going down of the sun (Lev.
23:32; Mark 1:32), this meeting, being on the dark part of
the day, must have been on what we now call Saturday night.
They had been here for seven days, and doubtless had met
with them on the Sabbath. Nothing is said concerning this
being the Sabbath. "Conybeare and Howson" says: "It
was the evening which succeeded the Jewish Sabbath." Spe-
cial mention is doubtless made of the meeting on account
of the fact that it was a farewell meeting of the apostle with
the church (verse 38), and to record the miracle of raising
Eutychus to life.
    4. Paul started Sunday morning to walk across the coun-
try, nearly twenty miles, to Assos, where he had arranged
to meet those who were traveling with him, and who had
sailed the ship around the peninsula. "And strength and
peace were surely sought and obtained by the apostle from
 the Redeemer, as he pursued his lonely road that Sunday
afternoon in spring, among the oak woods and the streams
of Ida."—Conybeare and Howson
    5. This was not a public gathering, but a work to he done
at home, as many excellent translations of the text show.
The Syriac reads, "Let every one of you lay aside and pre-
serve at home." Greenfield, in his lexicon, translates the
 Greek term, "With one's self, i. e., at home." Two Latin ver-
sions, the Vulgate and that of Castellio, render it "apud se.
 with one's self, at home.



"Pray ye Therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send

      LESSON XIL—Who Changed the Sabbath?

                   DECEMBER 17, 1904.
                         Questions.
   1. Against what antichristian power did the apostle
Paul warn the church? 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.
    2. What will this power which seeks to exalt itself
against God attempt to do with His law? Dan.. 7 :25.
    3. What change has the Papacy thought to make in the
law? Note 1.
    4. How was this change introduced into the church?
Note 2.
    5. Does history attest the fulfilment of this prophecy
concerning the change of the Sabbath? Note 3.
    6. Did the Papacy really change the law of God?
Note 4.
    7. How early did error manifest itself in the church?
2 Tim. 2:1-3; 2 Peter 2:1-3. Note 5.
    8. What did Jesus say regarding tradition? Matt.
15 :13.
    9. What admonition from the Lord is given us for
this time? Jer. 6:16.
  10. What blessing is pronounced upon those who return
to the ancient paths? Isa. 58 :13, 14.
  11. What are those called who will do this? Rev.
12 :17 ; 14:12.
  12. What is our only safeguard from error? Acts
20:32; Isa. 8:20.
                           Notes.
   1. The Catholic Church has sought to change the Sabbath
of the fourth commandment through the Papacy. In other
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."
26               TOPICAL STUDIES ON THE

changes there is no claim to intentionally alter these pre-
cepts, but with the Sabbath it is different. They openly
admit that they have deliberately thought to change the
law. They say this:—
  "Quee.,—What warrant have you for keeping the Sunday,
preferable to the ancient Sabbath, which was the Saturday?
  "Ans. We have for it the authority of the Catholic Church
and apostolical tradition."—Catholic Christian Instructed, page
202.
  "Ques.Have you any other way of proving that the
church has the power to institute festivals of precept?
  "Ans.—Had she not the power she could not have done
that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she
could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the
first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the
seventh day; a change for which there is no scriptural
authority."—Doctrinal Catechism, page 174.
    The following is a copy of the law of God as it appears
in a standard Catholic catechism:—
      The Law of God as Changed by the Papacy.
   -I. I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt not have strange
gods before Me.
   "2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain.
       Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.
        Honor thy father and thy mother.
        Thou shalt not kill.
       Thou shalt not commit adultery.
        Thou shalt not steal.
   "8. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
       Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.
  "10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods."
                             —Butler's Doctrinal Catechism.
   2. Dr. Scott, the noted commentator, says: "The change
from the seventh to the first appears to have been gradually
and silently introduced, by example rather than by express
precept."—Comment on Acts 20:7.
   This expresses the truth concerning the change of the
Sabbath. "Gradually" and "silently" the church fell into the
custom of observing this heathen festival day, till, in the
days of Constantine, A. D. 321, the first command for the
observance of Sunday was given.
   3. "It was Constantine the Great who first made a law for
the proper observance of Sunday."—Encyclopedia Britanntca.

   "The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was al-
ways only a human ordinance, and it was far from the in-
tentions of the apostles to establish a divine command in this
respect; far from them, and from the early apostolic church,
to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday."— Meander's
Church. History, translated by Rose, page 186.
    "We hear less than we used to about the apostolic origin
of the present Sunday observance, and for the reason that
while the Sabbath and Sabbath rest are woven into the warp
and woof of Scripture, it is now seen, as it is admitted, that
we must go to later than apostolic times for the establish-
ment of Sunday observance."—Chnstlan at Work, 1884.
    4. The Papacy can, ana did actually, blaspheme God's holy
name and His tabernacle, and put to death millions of His
faithful subjects; but he can only "think" to change His
law. The Revised Version reads, "the law," and the Douay
version, "Think himself able to change times and laws."
He can, of course, no more alter a jot or title of God's law
than he can abolish its Author.
    5. "In the interval between the days of the apostles and
the conversion of Constantine, the Christian commonwealth
changed its aspect. The bishop of Rome—a personage un-
known to the writers of the New Testament—meanwhile rose
into prominence, and at length took precedence of all other
churchmen. Rites and ceremonies, of which neither Paul or
Peter ever heard, crept silently into use, and then claimed the
rank of divine institutions."— Killen's Ancient Church, preface.




            LESSON XIIL—The Seal of God.

                    DECEMBER 24, 1904.
                           Questions.
    1. What last-day work takes place in the earth? Rev.
7 :1-3.

    4. In connection with what is the seal of the living
God found? Isa. 8:16.
    5. What other words are used synonymous with seal?
Rom. 4:11; Eze. 9:4.
    6. For what is a seal used? What must it contain?
Esther 3:12; 1 Kings 21:8. Note 2.
    7. Which commandment of the law contains the seal
of God? Ex. 20:8-11. Note 3.
    8. Where is the Sabbath called a seal, or a sign? Ex.
31:13, 17; Eze. 20 :12, 20.
    9. Who alone receive the seal of the Lord? Eze. 9 :1.
What immediately follows? Verses 5, 6. Who are
spared?
  10. For what ,is the "remnant" church especially dis-
tinguished? Rev. 12:17; 14:12. Note 4.
   11. When is salvation nigh at hand? Luke 21:28, 31.
  12. At this time what exhortation is given concerning
the Sabbath? Isa.. 56:1, 2; 58: 12-14.
  13. What counterfeit seal will be urged upon God's
people at this time? Rev. 13 :16, 17. What warning is
given? Chap. 14:9-12.
   14. What should be our daily prayer? Ps. 119:33, 34.
                              Notes.
    1. The fact that those who are sealed are next seen on
Mount Zion, redeemed from "among men," shows that the
sealing work takes place just before the end.
    2. A seal is that which gives authenticity to all legal docu-
ments, and must contain three specifications: (1) The name
of the law-making power; (2) the authority for making the
law; (3) the territory over which the law-making power has
 jurisdiction.
    3. While other of the commandments contain the name of
God, they do not define who He is. There are "gods many
"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                           watchword.
          GREAT THREEFOLD GOSPEL MESSAGE.                  29

and lords many," the true God being defined by the fact that
He created the heavens and the earth. Jer. 10:10-12. The
fourth 'commandment contains the seal complete: (1) Name,
God; (2) authority, Creator; (3) territory, heavens and earth.
   4. The observance of the fourth commandment, or Sab-
bath, is the only thing in connection with the observance of
the law which distinguishes a person at this time as a com-
mandment keeper. This shows that the remnant church will
be engaged in a Sabbath reform.

                             Notes.
    1. "I was shown that the parable of the talents has not
been fully understood. This important lesson was given to
the disciples for the benefit of Christians living in the last
days. And these talents do not represent merely the ability
to preach and instruct from the Word of God. The parable
applies to the temporal means which God has intrusted to
His people. Those to whom the five and the two talents
were given traded and doubled that which was committed
to their trust. God requires those who have possessions here
to put their money out to usury for Him—to put it into the
cause to spread the truth. . . . I saw that some of God's
professed people are like the man who hid his talent in the
earth. They keep their possessions from doing good in the
cause of God."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol 1. ivtge,, 197,198
    2. In Eden the test before man was whether he would

recognize God's ownership, and let that alone which the
Lord claimed as His. Man has a second probation, and the
test is still the same. Of all that is in the earth, the Creator
has made man the steward, but reserves one-tenth as His,
not because He needs the money, for He could make the
stones gold, but to see if man will recognize His owner-
ship, and return to Him that which He. has reserved.
   2. "Let the neglected tithes be brought in. Let the new
year open upon you as men honest in their deal with God.
Let those that have withheld their tithes send them in before
the year 1896 [1904 now] shall close, that they may be right
with God, and never, never again run any risk of being
cursed of God. . . . To the obedient He will give rich
blessings; to the transgressor, a curse."—Special Testimony.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
     In this issue of Life and Health is begun a most im-
portant series of articles by the Editor, entitled "A
Celebrated Centenarian," being the first of a series of
Studies from the Livzs of Health Seekers.
     Those who have read in this issue the interesting
sketch of Cornaro, and the lessons to be learned from his
experience, will surely desire to read the other articles
in this series.
     While each article will be complete in itself, the
whole series will contain a large amount of most helpful
suggestions made especially practical by the experience
of some noted health seeker.
     We are now able to announce the following articles
in these important studies, and others are in preparation:—
     No Meat or Stimulants, but Abundant Proteid—How a
famous athlete and author won his victories and increased
his intellectual efficiency.
     Health by Hunger—Dr. Dewey and the fasting cure.
     Health by Chewing, or Nature's Food Filter—Horace
Fletcher's discovery of a sixth sense.        •
     A Starchless Menu; Bread the Staff of Death—Dr. Dens-
more's milk and fruit dietary.
     The Strenuous Life, or Strength by Hard Work—President
Roosevelt's practical physical culture.
     We may learn much from the experiences of these
representative health reformers, and while avoiding their
extreme positions, may, through the helpful suggestions
of Dr. Heald, benefit by their experiments.
     Subscription price, so cents a year. Single copy, 5
cents. Send in your subscription at once and secure the
whole of this interesting and valuable series.
     The circulation of Life and Health is increasing rapidly.
We printed more than three times as many of the July
and August numbers as the June subscription list called
for. Both the July and August numbers were sold out
early. We are printing five times as many of the Sep-
tember number as the June list called for, and we hope to
see a still larger increase for next month.
