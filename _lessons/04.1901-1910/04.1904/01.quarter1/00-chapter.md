               THE PROPHECIES OP DANIEL                       5•

 16. Repeat first sentence of Dan. z :28. Then for
whose special benefit was this prophecy given.
                        Notes.
    1. The special providence of God is seen in giving the
dream; in causing it to make such an impression upon the
king's mind that he could not forget that he had had a remark-
able dream; in thus exposing the fraud of the so-called wise
men of Babylon; in causing the king to overlook the wisest
man •in all Babylon, when he summoned the wise men to make
known the dream; in causing the king to grant Daniel time
(verse so), which he had refused to do for the others; in thus
bringing the king to acknowledge the true God (verse 47); in
thus promoting Daniel to an exalted place in the kingdom, for
the further accomplishment of the divine purpose.
    2. The mighty empire that followed Grecia was Rome.
Gibbon, the historian, adopts the very symbolism of the proph-
ecy to describe the character of this crushing power as the
successor of the earlier universal kingdom, speaking thus:
"The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in battle,
always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the
Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean; and the
images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to repre-
sent the nations or their kings, were successively broken by
the iron monarchy of Rome." Later in its history the strength
as of iron was weakened, and after the division into lesser
kingdoms, the empire was indeed "partly strong and partly
brittle," as the marginal reading puts it.
    3. It is well known that, by intermarriage, the royal houses
of Europe are more or less closely related; but by none of
these matrimonial alliances have ruling houses been able to
reunite the divided empire, which is to remain divided until
the stone smites the image.


  LESSON 11.—The History of Nations Foretold.
                  JANUARY 9, 1904.
                      Questions.
   i. When did Daniel have the vision recorded in this
chapter? Repeat Dan. 7:i. Note 1.
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
6            THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL

this verse?
    3. In prophecy what do winds symbolize? Isa.
21 :1, 2.; Jer. 25 :32, 33.
    4. What are symbolized by the sea or waters? Isa.
8 :7 ; Rev. 17 :15 ; Isa. 17 :12, 13 ; Jer. 51 :42.
    5. What did Daniel behold, as the result of strife and
commotion among the nations and peoples of earth?

    7. Repeat verse 4. What was this first kingdom?
Note 2.
    8. How does the lion compare with the other beasts
of prey? Prov. 3o :3o. How does Babylon compare
with other nations? Isa. 13:19. What other charac-
teristic of Babylon was symbolized by "eagle's wings"?
Deut. 28 49 ; 2 Sam. I :23. What change did the
prOphet see come over this symbol? What change in
the kingdom of Babylon was thus indicated? Jer.
51 :3o; Isa. 21 :3, 4. Note 3...
    9. Repeat verse 5. What two kingdoms united in
the conquest and overthrow of Babylon? Isa. 21 :2.
(Elam is but another name for Persia.) What was
symbolized by the bear raising itself up on one side?
See marginal reading, verse 5. Note 4. What by the
three ribs in the mouth of the bear? Note 5.
   DD. Repeat verse 6. What special characteristic does
the leopard possess? What, then, would be symbolized
by four wings added to this swift-footed beast? Note
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
              THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL                        7

6. What is symbolized by the four heads upon the
leopard? Note 7.
    1. Repeat verse 7. What is symbolized by this
fourth beast? Verses 23 and 24, first part. Here, as
in the second chapter, the symbol designates Rome, the
mighty power that followed Grecia. Note 8.
  12. Repeat verse 8. Concerning what did Daniel
specially desire further information? Verses 19, 20.
What information did he receive? Verse 24.
  13. What did Daniel behold on the part of the power
symbolized by this little horn? Verse 21.
   14. How long was the oppression of this power to
be felt by the saints? Verse 22.
   15. Then what will certainly follow the kingdoms
represented by these four beasts? Verses 26, 27.
                            Notes.
    1. Belshazzar reigned conjointly with his father, Nabo-
nadius, during the last three years of the Babylonian Empire,
and it was at the close of this three years' reign when, as the
sacred historian records, "in that night was Belshazzar the
king of the Chaldeans slain, and Darius the Median took the
kingdom." Dan. 5.30, 31. This being true, and that kingdom
coming to its end in B. C. 538, it follows that this vision must
have been about B. C. 541.
    2. Inasmuch as in this vision four universal kingdoms span
the history from Daniel's day to the end, just as in the dream
of Daniel 2, the first beast here brought to view must symbolize
the same power that was represented by the head of gold in the
great image,—Babylon.
    3. The kingdom of Babylon, as noticed in this prophecy,
continued less than seventy years. More than half of that
time the kingdom was ruled by Nebuchadnezzar. It was during
his reign that the kingdom made all of its mighty conquests.
His successors, each in turn, became less bold and aggressive,
until the weak and pusillanimous Belshazzar, who possessed
none of the brave and noble. qualities of Nebuchadnezzar.
        The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
8              TEig PROPHECIES OF DANIEL

     4. The marginal reading of verse 5 says, "raised up one
dominion." Darius, the Mede, and Cyrus, the Persian, were
associated together in the conquest and overthrow of Babylon.
As an act of courtesy on the part of Cyrus, the rulership of the
newly-formed kingdom was given to his uncle, Darius. But
in a short time the Persian became the ruling element in the
kingdom. Thus the dual kingdom represented by the bear is
said to have exalted one branch above the other.
     5. The bear is a bloodthirsty animal, and that bloodthirsty
disposition of the Medes and Persians is supposed to have been
further stimulated by the overthrow of the three provinces of
Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt.
     6. The two wings added to the lion fitly represented the
rapidity of the conquests of that empire under Nebuchadnezzar.
Upon this leopard beast are not only wings, which are unnatural
to a beast, but also an unnatural number of wings. This most
fittingly represents the unparalleled rapidity and celerity of
the movements of the Grecians under the reign of the intrepid
Alexander the Great, who, after conquering • the then known
world, died at the age of thirty-two years.
     7. The four heads of this beast undoubtedly symbolize the
four divisions of Alexander's kingdom among his four leading
generals about twenty years after his death.
     8. In the breaking up of the Roman dominion by the incur-
sion of tribes from the northward, ten kingdoms were established
upon the ruins within the boundaries of the old empire.



      LESSON                   Papacy and Its Work.
                      JANUARY 16, 1904.
                          Questions.
  I. Repeat Dan. 7:24. What was to arise after the
ten horns on the fourth beast, in this line of prophecy?
How was this power to compare with the first ten?—
They were political powers ; this, then, to be diverse,
must be religious. What religious power, claiming
sovereignty, arose in the territory of the Roman Empire?
—The papacy. What was this little horn first to subdue?
       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
              THE PROPHECIES OP DANIEL

Tell what three kingdoms, out of the ten, were subdued.
—The Heruli, Vandals, Ostrogoths. See Note I.
  2. What attitude was this power to assume toward
the Most High? Repeat Dan. 7:25. Tell how the
papacy has fulfilled this specification. See Note 2.
How were the saints of the Most High to be treated
by this power? What blasphemous attempt was to be
made by this power against the law of God? What
New Testament description do we 'have of this same
power? 2 Thess. 2 :4.
  3. What apparent change in the law of God is ac-
knowledged by nearly the whole Christian world?—
The substitution of the first day for the seventh as the
day of the Sabbath.
  4. Was there to be a limit to the time that the little
horn power would have dominion over the saints, times,
and laws of the Most High? Dan. 7:25, last clause.
Note 3.
  5. Give historical dates and facts, marking the begin-
ning and the termination of the temporal supremacy of
the papacy. Note 4.
  6. Repeat Dan. 7:26. How long will it be before
this power will be consumed? Compare 2 Thess. 2:8.
  7. How will the fate of this fourth beast differ from
that of the three which preceded it? Verses II, 12.
Note 5.
  8. Who will then appear upon the scene as the right-
ful ruler of the kingdom which for a time had been
usurped by. Satan? Verse 27.
" This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
I0             THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL

                              Notes.
    1. Following the Council of Nicea, called by Constantine
in A. D. 325, the Arian powers were uncompromisingly opposed
to the claims of supremacy put forth by the bishop of Rome.
The Heruli, in Italy, were the greatest foe of the papacy. 'The
pope's successor could not be chosen without their consent.
In A. D. 490" Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths,
desiring more territory, obtained a commission from Zeno,
emperor of the East, and a friend of the pope, to take possession
of Italy. After a three years' war, the Herulian kingdom in
Italy was overthron, Thus the first of the three opposing
powers to the establishment of the papal supremacy was
"plucked up by the roots," in the year 493. Yet the Ostro-
goths were also Arian, and still the bishop of Rome was in a
measure restrained, while the Vandals in Africa defied the
power of Rome. Next the Vandals fell before a conquering
army sent by Justinian, emperor of the East (534), and later
the Ostrogothic power was forever broken in Italy (538).
Thus was the way prepared for the exaltation of the Roman
bishopric.
    2. The papacy has indeed spoken great words against the
Most High, by assuming titles- and prerogatives which belong
only to God. The following are samples of many quotations
that might be given.:—
     "The most holy and most happy, who is the arbiter of
heaven and the Lord of the earth, the successor of St. Peter,
the anointed of the Lord, the master of the universe, the
father of kings, the light of the world."—Titles assumed by
Pope Martin V, in despatches to his ambassador to Constan-
tinople.
    "The pope is all in all, and above all, so that God Himself
and the pope, the vicar of God, are but one consistory."—
Hostiensis Cap. etc.
    "Given in 'Rome from our palace, the Toth of February.
1817, the XIV jurisdiction of the most holy pontiff and father
in Christ, and Lord our God the pope, Leo XII," etc.—Conclu-
sion of Dr. Giustianni's ordination letter.
     3. In Hebrew usage a time means a year. (See Dan.
It :13, margin.) The period given would therefore be a "time"
(I year), "times" (plural, 2 years), and a dividing, or half a
time (1/2 year), all together, 31/2 years. In the reckoning of
Bible times, 360 days to the year, the period would be 1260
davq. We are dealing with symbolic prophecy, however, in
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."
               THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL.                     II

which one day, stands for a year (see Num. 14:34; Eze. 4:6),
so that the duration of the prophetic period would be 1260 years.
     4. The last of the opposing Arian powers was plucked up
in 538, when' the Roman papacy was free to assert its sover-
eignty. Just 126o years from this date bring us to 1798, in
 which year the French troops took the pope prisoner, and for
a time it appeared as though the papacy had received a death
blow.
     5. When Babylon, Media-Persia, and Grecia came to the
 end of their existence as empires, the people who composed
 those kingdoms passed down and became merged into the suc-
 cessive kingdoms. Thus "they had their dominion taken away;
 yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time." But
 when the fourth beast shall be "slain, and his body destroyed,
 and given to the burning flame," then shall "the kingdoms of
.this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ,
 and He shall reign forever and ever."

peat the comparative greatness of the powers represented
by the ram, the goat, and the little horn. In what direc-,
tions were the conquests of the little horn power?
    9. What characteristic is given of this little horn
power by which it may be identified? Verse 25.
   10. What power, in the person of its rulers, stood up
against "the Prince of princes," Jesus Christ?—Rome.
Acts 4.27•
   11. What subject is introduced in this vision, in addi-
tion to the ram, he goat, and little horn? Verse 14.

              THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL                      13

ceive? Verse 16. _ Who, then gave to Daniel the inter-
pretation of the ram, the he goat, and the little horn?
  14. What does Daniel say of his understanding of the
vision? Verse 27. What part of the vision had not
been fully explained to him? What is the vision of the
2,300 days called? See margin of verse 14. What
assurance did Gabriel give Daniel concerning "the vision
of the evening and the morning"? Verse 26.
  15. Had Gabriel then fully completed his commission,
to make Daniel understand the vision? Why did he not
do so in chapter 8? See verse 27, first clause. What
would Daniel therefore confidently expect?—Another
visit from Gabriel.
                          Notes.
    1. This vision having been given to Daniel in the third year
of the reign of Belshazzar, that being the year when Babylon
was overthrown, it must have been about B. C. 538.
    2. Prophets in heavenly vision are often taken to places
where the scenes opened up to them are to occur, so that they
are living amid the very events predicted by them, even though
those events may be thousands of years in the future.
     3. The two horns on the ram symbolize the union of the
two nations, the Medes and Persians. The higher coming up
last signifies the fact that in a few years the Persian became
the leading element in the kingdom.
     4. It is a fact noted in history that Alexander died in a
drunken debauch, at the age of thirty-two years, and at a time
when his kingdom was in the very height of its glory and great-
ness. Thus the kingdom represented by this horn was broken
"when he was strong."
     5. While Alexander lived he made no provision as to who
would succeed him in his kingdom. About twenty years after
his death it was divided among his four strongest generals.
The student should note carefully the following division of
Alexander's kingdom, as it will have an important bearing upon
the events . studied in a future lesson in this series. Lysima-
chus had that portion lying to the north of Palestine, including
Thrace, Bithynia, and some smaller provinces of Asia Minor.
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
14            THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL

Ptolemy took that portion to the south, including Egypt, Libya,
Arabia, and Palestine. Seleucus took the east,—Syria and all
the country to the river Indus. Cassander had Macedon an ,'
Greece, lying to the west. Carefully note these divisions, as
given in "Great Empires of the Bible."

     1. Beginning in the autumn B. C. 457, to what date
  do the 483 years reach?—To the baptism or anointing
  of Messiah the Prince, in the autumn of A. D. 27.
  Mark :To, marginal date.
  Proof: To 456. years before Christ (B. C. 457, autumn)

          Total, 490 years
    15. Did the gospel cease to go to the Jews exclusively

  " The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                         watchword.
i6             THE PROPHECIES OF:DANIEL

   16. Beginning in the autumn of B. C. 457, when must
the whole period of 2,30o years terminate?—The autumn
of 1844.
Proof      To 4.56k, years before Christ (B. C. 457, autumn)
       Add 18433/4 years after Christ, (A. D. 1844, autumn)
      Total, 2300 years
  17. What event was looked for in the autumn of 1844?
-Students of prophecy looked for the second advent at
that date, when they saw that the prophetic period would
be fulfilled.
  18. What two events had they confused?—The
cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary and the destruction
of the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ.
(Future lessons will explain.)
                              Notes.
     1. Since the vision of chapter 8 was in the last year of
Belshazzar, and the prayer of the ninth chapter in the first
year of Darius, who took the throne on the death of Belshazzar,
the time between the chapters need not have been more than a
few months, or even weeks.
    2. Since it takes the commandments of Cyrus (B. C: 536—
Ezra I), of Darius (B. C. 519—Ezra 6), and of Artaxerxes
(B. C. 457—Ezra 7) to constitute "the commandment to restore
and build Jerusalem," it is apparent that we must date from
the last one, since the "commandment" was not complete until
Artaxerxes' decree was issued.
    3. In the midst of this last seven-year period, or week, just
three and a half years from the autumn of A. D. 27, when
Jesus was anointed the Christ at His baptism, He was crucified
(the spring of A. D. 31), thus causing the sacrifices to cease.




        The needs of the cause of God are world wide.

LESSON VI.—The Sanctuary and Its Cleansing—in
                  Type.
                      FEBRUARY 6, 1904.

                          Questions.
     T. Repeat Dan. 8:14. What line of reasoning upon
tl.is text led to the conclusion that the second coming
of Christ would take place in the autumn of A: D. 1844?
Note T.
    2. What does Dan. 8 :r4 say, would take place at the
end of the 2,300 days?
     3. Repeat Heb. 8:1, 2, also 9:24. What literal sanc-
tuary Was in existence in A. D. 1844?
     4. Repeat Heb. 9 :23.- Could' a sanctuary in heaven
need cleansing? Note 2.
     5. Study Lev. 16 :2. What instruction was given
to Aaron concerning his entering the most holy place
of the typical sanctuary?
     6. Repeat Heb. 9:6, 7. By whom alone, and how
often, was the most holy place to be entered?
     7. Study carefully Lev. 16:5, 7-10. What was to
 be taken from the congregation of the children of Israel?
 Where, and before whom, were these two goats, pre-
 sented?, How was,a selection made between these two
 goats? For whom were these goats thus severally set
 apart? What was done with the goat upon which the
 lot fell to be the Lord's? For what purpose was the
 scapegoat reserved? •
     8. Study verses 15, 16. What was then done with
 the Lord's goat? Where was the blood brought? Upon
   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
        3
 8            THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL

what was the blood sprinkled? What was thus made
on behalf of Israel?
    9. Repeat verse 19. What was thus done to the
:.:Inctuary? From what was it cleansed? Was this
cleansing of the sanctuary, then, from physical or from
moral uncleanness? How had the sins of Israel been
transferred to the sanctuary, and how were they removed
once every year by this ceremony?
   Io. Repeat verses 21, 22. After the sins of Israel
had been borne • from the sanctuary, in the person of
the high priest, what did he do with them? What was
then done with the live goat? What was the principal
difference between the death of these two goats? Note 3.
   11. What is the difference between the death of Christ
and the death that Satan will experience?
   12. Repeat Phil. 3:1o. What did the apostle desire to
be made "conformable" unto? What choice is left for
you and me to make? Note 4.
                            Notes.
    I. This text states that at the end of the 2,300 days, "then
shall the sanctuary be cleansed." When the believers in the
great advent message found that those days were to end in
1844 A. D., they reasoned that the earth was the sanctuary;
that its cleansing would be by fire, at the second coming of
Christ; therefore Christ must come on the tenth day of the
seventh month, in that year. They overlooked the fact that
nowhere in the Bible is the earth spoken of, or referred to, as
the sanctuary. They overlooked the fact, also, that the only
sanctuary in existence in A. D. 1844 was the one in heaven,
where our Great- High Priest ministers.
    2. By a careful study of the yearly rounds of service in
that sanctuary built by Moses, with its two holy places, which
were "figures of the true," the great truth is revealed that the
sins of all who repent and turn to God are transferred to
the heavenly sanctuary, and that the cleansing of that sanc-
        The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
               THE PROPHECIES OF' DANIEL                       29

tuary will be the removal of those sins, when the blotting-out
time comes. See Acts 3 :19, 20.
    3. The slaying of the Lord's goat represented a voluntary
death TO sin. The goat for Azazel, that was sent away to
"bear upon him all the iniquity of the children of Israel,"
represented an involuntary death IN sin.
    4. The same choice that was left to Christ, after He had
"taken man's place, with all of its risks and liabilities," to die
a voluntary death to sin, or suffer an involuntary death in sin,
is also left for us to make. "The wages of sin is death."
The old man must die. Either he will be "crucified with
Christ," or perish in the lake of fire with Azazel.



LESSON V11.—The Sanctuary and Its Cleansing—in
                            Antitype.
                       FEBRUARY 13, 1904.

                            Questions.
    I. Outline as- fully as you can the ceremony of the
 cleansing of the typical sanctuary, as studied in last
 week's lesson.
    2. Of what was each year's round of service in that
 earthly sanctuary a complete type? Heb. 8:4, 5. Note I.
    3. Repeat Heb. 9:25, 26. How often will those
 services which in the type were performed once every
'year be performed in the antitype?
    4. What was the last solemn act performed in each
 year's round of service in the type?
    5. What consequence followed indifference on the
 part of any person on that solemn day of atonement?
 Lev. 23 :28, 29.
    6. Then what decision must have been reached before
 that cutting off could take place?
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
20            THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL

    7. What solemn event, then, was typifie 1 each year
by the ceremony which was performed on the day of
atonement? •      .
    8. Repeat Acts 17:3x. Has the time for such an
event been appointed? What assurance has been given
that the judgment will take place?
    9. Repeat Heb. 9 :24. Of what were the two holy
places in the typical sanctuary, figures? Then how
many apartments or holy places are there in the heavenly
sanctuary?
   ro. What portion of the year did the priests minister
in the first or holy place? How long in the second or
most holy?
   Ir. How many chief men ministered in connection
with the high priest in the typical service? i Chron.
24 :4.
  12. Study Rev. 4:1-4. Where did John see a door
opened? What description is given of One who sat
upon a throne? Who alone can answer to this descrip-
tion? What was seen round about the throne? Who
were sitting upon these four and twenty seats? With
what were they clothed? What is this "white raiment"?
Rev. 19:8. To what company, then, must these four
and twenty elders belong? Note 2. Who, then, will
take part in the work of the judgment, as representatives
or humanity? Note 3.
  13. What in the antitype answers to the cutting off
of those who, in the typical service, did not afflict their
souls on the day of atonement? See Rev. 3 :15.
  14. Repeat Acts 3 :19. What in the antitype answers
      " There shall be delay no longer"--our confidence.
               THE PROPHECIES OP DANIEL                         21

to the removal of sins once every year from the typical
sanctuary? Repeat Acts 3:19.
 • 15. What will be the last solemn act of our Great
High Priest, as He closes His priestly work?—He will
bear the sins of believers out of the sanctuary.
   16. When Christ bears the sins of the overcomers
 from the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary,
 upon whom will He place them? Note 4.
                               Notes.
      i. Each year's round of services in the earthly sanctuary
was a complete type of the entire priesthood of our Saviour.
     2. It is evident that these "four and twenty elders" seated
upon thrones, and those associated with them, are persons who
have been redeemed from this earth. It is that company who
"came out of their graves after His resurrection." Matt.
27 :50-53. It is that multitude of captives (Eph. 4:8, margin)
that Jesus led up to heaven with Him when He ascended.
      3. It is a glorious thought that, when "God shall judge
 the world, by that Man whom He bath ordained," the One to
 whom all judgment has been committed will be "the Man
 Christ Jesus," One who has suffered, as a man, all the weak-
 nesses and temptations of humanity, and therefore is fitted to
 be a merciful and faithful High Priest. Not only so, but asso-
 ciated with that "Man Christ Jesus" is a multitude of those
 who have been redeemed by His blood. Oh, how much better
 that your sins and mine be "opened beforehand" to the scrutiny
 of that human-heavenly tribunal, while the precious blood of
  the Man of Calvary is efficacious in blotting them from the
  books of God's remembrance, than to have them "follow after"
  and meet us at a time when they will be opened to the gaze
  of the whole universe.
       4. When our High Priest, in His own person, bears our
  sins from the sanctuary, those sins will then be rolled back
   upon the head of the antitypical scapegoat, the originator of sin.




  We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                           our field.

           LESSON VI11.—The Judgment.
                     FEBRUARY 20, 1904.

                          Questions.
    I. Repeat Acts 17:31. What does this text say has
been appointed?
    2. In the days of the apostles was this event past,
present, or future? Acts 24:25.
    3. What work have we found to be synonymous
with the judgment?—The cleansing of the sanctuary.
    4. Repeat Dan. 8:14. When did the angel tell
Daniel that event would begin? b.
    5. When did the 2,30o days end?
    6. Since A. D. 1844, then, what has been the message
of "present truth"? Rev. 14:7. See also Dan. 7:9, 11.
    7. Repeat Ps. 9 :7, -8. For what has God prepared
His throne? .Whom does this text say will be judged?
    8. To whom has the Father committed the work of
judgment? Johfi 5 :22. Why? Verse 27.
    9. Repeat 2 Cor. 5:1o. How many of us will be
brought into the judgment? What reward Will each
one receive?
   to, Repeat Rom. 14:10-13. What questions does the
apostle ask? What reason is given why we should not
judge one another? To whom must every knee bow,
and tongue confess? Of whom will each one be called
to give account? In view of this, what should we not
do any more?
    1. Study 2 Peter 2:4, 9. Who besides man are
reserved to judgment? See also Jude 6.
          Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
                    Pk01311ECMS        DANIEL,             23

   12. Repeat Eccl. 3 :17. Will the judgment occupy
time?
   13. Repeat i Cor. 4 :5. What are 'those doing who
jt dge one another now? When will be the time for
judgment? Note I. What will then be brought to
light? What will every man then have?
   14. Repeat 2 Tim. 4:i. When does this text say the
living and the dead will be judged?
   15. Repeat Rev.     :18. how many events are here
  sociated with the judgment?
   16. What did Christ command His followers to preach
unto the people? Acts to :41, 42.
   17. According to what will men be judged? Rom.
2:16.
  18. Repeat Eccl. 12:13, 14. What is the conclusion
of the whole matter? What is declared to be the whole
duty of man? What will God bring into judgment?
                       Notes.
      1. God "hath committed all judgment unto the Son." He
 has also "appointed a day in the which He will judge the world
 in righteousness, by that Man whom He bath• Ordained." There-
 fore he who judges another has climbed up into the seat of
 God, thus saying' that he is God. That is nothing short of
.the papacy, the man of sin. He not only assumes the preroga-
 tives of God, but is meting out judgment before the time.
 "Let us not therefore judge one another any more."




" Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are while
                     already to harvest."

         LESSON IX.—The Eastern Question.
                     FEBRUARY 27, 1904.

were to stand up against Egypt, the, king of the south?

 foretold in this verse? Note 11.
    13. Verse 22. What note does the prophecy in this
 verse make of the death of Tiberius Caesar? Who else
 was to be cut off during the period of the reign of
 Tiberius?
                            Notes.
    1. Cyrus died in the year B. C. 529, and was succeeded
by his son, Cambyses, who reigned seven years. Cambyses
was succeeded by Smerdis, an impostor, who reigned but eight
months, being succeeded in B. C. 521 by Darius Hystaspes.
Darius Hystaspes reigned thirty-six years, and was succeeded
by Xerxes in the year 485 B. C. Xerxes, by his strength and
through his riches, did stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
He collected the most numerous army ever marshaled for war,
estimated by careful historians to have numbered 2,641,610
fighting men, with an equal number of attendants, making a
total of 5,283,220. This army was seven days and seven nights
crossing the Dardanelles, on two immense bridges of boats built
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
26                    PROPTI#CIIS OF DANIRL

  for the purpose. Xerxes was the last of the Persian monarchs
  who invaded Grecia; therefore the prophecy takes no note of
  his eight successors, but passes, as we shall see, in the third
  verse, to the empire of Grecia.
        2. Truly it may bw said of Alexander the Great that he did
 according to his will. His entire reign was one of unparalleled
 conquest, and at the age of thirty-two years he is said to have
  conquered the whole of the then known world, and to have
' wept because there was not another world to conquer.
        3. Within twenty years of Alexander's death it is said that
  there was not one of his posterity left, and his kingdom' was
  divided toward the four winds, between his four leading gener-
  als. See the territorial boundaries of these four divisions, as
 outlined in Note 5, Lesson 4.
        4. In B. C. 281, Lysimachus was slain in battle, and Seleu-
 cus annexed all of his dominion; and as Lysimachus had pre-
  viously conquered the territory assigned to Cassander, this
 left Seleucus ruler of three of the four portions of the original
  di'vision of Alexander's kingdom.
        5. The successive rulers of that territory of the north,
  which fell under the dominion of Seleucus, are referred to in
  this prophecy as "the king of the north," while Egypt is called
 "the king of the south."
        6. Verses 6-14 refer to the frequent wars and intriguing
  between Syria, the king of the north, and Egypt, the king of
 the south. History supplies the details for' all these specifica-
  tions of the prophecy.
        7. "And in those times [about B. C. 203] there shall many
  I Antiochus Magnus, king of Syria; Philip, king of Macedon
 and many of the provinces which had revolted from Egypt]
 stand up against the king of the south [Egypt] ; also the rob-
    ers [breakers] of thy people [Rome] shall exalt themselves
 b[rear her head arnong the nations of earth] to establish the
 vision [destined to exert a mielty influence among the nations
 of earth in fulfilment of the prophecy till the end of time] ;
 but they shall fall [be broken up into many kingdoms, -and
 finally be "destroyed and given to the burning flame." Dan.
7 :Id."
        8. In B. C. 63, Pompey, the Roman general, demolished
 the walls of Jerusalem, transferred several cities from the
  jurisdiction of Judea to that of Coel-Syria, and imposed tribute
 upon the Jews. Thus -was Jerusalem placed by conquest in the
 hands of that power which was to hold "the glorious land" in
 its - iron grasp till it had utterly consumed it.

     9. Verse s9..—"Then he [Julius Cxsar] shall turn his face
toward the fort of his own land [Rome] ; but he shall stumble •
and fall [assassinated by Brutus and Cassius and other con-
spirators, B. C. 44], and not be found."
      so. Verse 20.—"Then shall stand up [reign] in his [Julius
Caesar's] estate a raiser of taxes [Augustus Caesar. see Luke
2:1] in the glory of the kingdom [the "Augustan Age," an
expression commonly used . to denote the golden age of Roman
history] ; but within few days he shall be 'destroyed, neither
in anger, nor in battle." Eighteen years after the taxing brought
to view, seeming but a "few days" to the distant view of the
prophet, Augustus Caesar died peacefully in his own bed at
Nola, whither he had gone to seek repose and health, A. D.
5 4, .in the seventy-sixth year of his age.
      is. Verse 21.—"And in his [Augustus Caesar's] estate shall
stand up [reign] a vile person [Tiberius Caesar], to whom they
[the people of Rome] shall not give the honor of the king-
dom; but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom
by flatteries."
      It was through the flatteries of his mother, Livia, that
Tiberius reached the throne. But the citizens of Rome never
gave to him the respect and "honor of the kingdom," due to
an upright and faithful sovereign.
     "Augustus rested his last hopes on Tiberius. It is almost
superfluous to enumerate the unworthy successors of Augustus.
Their unparalleled vices, and the splendid theater upon which
they were acted, have saved them from oblivion. The dark,
unrelenting Tiberius, the furious Caligula, the feeble Claudius,
the profligate and cruel Nero, the beastly Vitellius, and the
timid, inhuman Domitian, are condemned to everlasting infamy.
Rome groaned beneath an unremitting tyranny, which exter-
minated the ancient families of the republic, and was fatal to
almost every virtue and every talent that arose in that unhappy
period. Under the reign of these monsters the slavery of the
Romans was accompanied with peculiar circumstances."—Gibbon.

                           , Notes.
    1. In the year 161 B. C., the Jews were being continually
attacked by the Syrians, with whose forces they were unable
to cope. Being informed that the Romans were always ready
to support weak nations against the oppression of kings, whose
power gave them umbrage, it was thought necessary to make
an alliance with that people. Ambassadors sent to Rome for
this purpose were well received by the senate, and a decree was
passed, by which the Jews were declared friends and allies of
the Romans, and a defensive league was made with them..
     At this time the Romans, who were still a small people,
were rapidly coming to the front, working deceitfully, or with
cunning, as the word implies, and by rapid strides they arose
to the height of their power. Thus Rome became strong with
a small people.
     2. Verse 24.—"Ile [Rome] shall enter peacefully even upon
the fattest places of the province.; and he shall do that which
his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers [receive
large acquisitions of territory through peaceful means, by leg-•
acy of other kings] ; he shall scatter among them the prey,
and spoil, and riches ; yea, and he shall forecast his devices
against [from] the strongholds [from the fortress of the seven-
hilled city], even for a time."
     "Even for a time." This, doubtless, is a prophetic time,
 which should be computed as follows: A time, I year, or 36o
days; each day for a year gives 36o years, during which, accord-
 ing to this prediction, the empire was to be governed from the
city of Rome. The next verse introduces the battle of Actium,
 which was fought between Egypt and Rome, in the year B. C.
31. Exactly 36o years from that date Constantine moved the
 seat of the Roman Empire to Constantinople, A. D. 33o.
     3. Verse 29.—"At the time appointed [A. D. 33o, see last
        The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
30             THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL

clause of verse 24] he [Rome] shall return, and come toward
the south ; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter."
The triumphs of former days were not repeated. The removal
of the seat of government from Rome to Constantinople, under
Constantine the Great, in A. D. 33o, is recognized as the signal
of the downfall of the Roman Empire.
    4. Verse 31.—"And forces shall stand on his part, and they
shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take
away the continual ["burnt-offering" supplied], and they shall
set up the abomination that maketh desolate."—American Re-
vision. The papacy was fully established in the year 538, the
beginning of the 5260 years of papal supremacy.
    5. Verse 34.—"Now when they [the people of God] shall
fall, they shall be holpen with a little help [fulfilled by the
influence of the great Reformation]."
    6. Verse 36.—Evidently a new power is here introduced,
and it must be an atheistical power, in the fullest sense of that
term, inasmuch as it was to regard neither the God of heaven
nor any God ; and this development is to be met about the
year 1798, which period is referred to as the time of the end.
    "France is the only nation in the world concerning which
the authentic record survives that as a nation she lifted her
hand in open rebellion against the Author of the universe.
France stands apart in the world's history as the single state
which, by the decree of her legislative assembly, pronounced
that there was no God, and of which the entire population of
the • capital, and a vast majority elsewhere, women as well as
men, danced and sang with joy in accepting the announcement."
—Quotation from Blackwood's Magazine.
    "The world for the first time heard an assembly of men,
born and educated in civilization, and assuming the right to
govern one of the finest of the European nations, uplift their
united voice to deny the most solemn truth which man's soul
receives, and renounce unanimously the belief and worship of
Deity."—Scott's Napoleon.
    "At this juncture all religious worship was prohibited,
except that of liberty and the country. The gold and silver
plate of the churches was seized upon and desecrated. The
churches were closed. The bells were broken and cast into
cannon. The Bible was publicly burned. The sacramental ves-
sels were paraded through the streets on an ass, in token of
contempt. The weekly rest was abolished, and death was de-
clared, in conspicuous letters posted over their burial places,
to be an eternal sleep."—U. Smith, in Thoughts on Daniel.

       7. "One of the ceremonies of this insane time stands un-
  rivaled for absurdity combined with impiety. The doors of the
  convention were thrown open to a band of musicians, preceded
  by whom the members cf the municipal body entered in solemn
  procession, singing a hymn in praise of liberty, and escorting,
  as the object of their future worship, a veiled female, whom
  they termed the Goddess of Reason. . . . To this person,

  THE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF FRANCE REN-
  DERED PUBLIC HOMAGE."—Scott's Napoleon.
       8. Prior to the French Revolution, the landed property of
  France was owned by a few landlords in immense estates, the
  laws being such that these estates could not be divided or sold.
  During that frightful period of revolution, when no law was
  recognized, these estates were confiscated, divided up, and sold
  for the benefit of the public exchequer.
       "The confiscation of two-thirds of the landed property
. the kingdom, which arose from the decrees of the Convention
  against the emigrants, clergy, and persons convicted at the
  Revolutionary Tribunal, . . . placed funds worth above
  £700,000,000 sterling at the disposal of the government."—Ali-

years to July 27, 1299, would bring us to what date?—

                             Notes.
     t. On the 5th of March, 1798, Bonaparte received the de-
cree of the French Directory relative to the expedition against
Egypt. He left Paris May 3, and set sail from Toulon on
the 19th, with a large naval armament, consisting of 500 sail,
carrying 40,000 soldiers and 10,00o sailors. July 5, Alexandria
was taken and fortified. On September of this same year, the
sultan of Turkey declared war against France. Thus the king
of the north (Turkey) came against him (France) in the same
year that the king of the south (Egypt) "pushed," and all at
the time called for in the prophecy,—the time of the end. On
the 18th of March, 1799, the siege of Acre was begun. After
the seige had been kept up sixty days, it was raised, and Na-
poleon sounded, for the first time in his career, the note of
 retreat, and on the 21st of May commenced to retrace his steps
 to Egypt. Turkey (the king of the north) came off the victor
in that struggle, driving the French back into Egypt. Thus the
 king of the north (Turkey) "overflowed and passed over."
     2. The French, after the siege of Acre, abandoned all that
 they had gained in the land of Judea, which is called in the
 prophecy "the glorious land," and it fell back into the hands
 of the Turks, under whose domination it still remains. Dr.
 Adam Clarke remarks concerning the countries of Edom, Moab.
 and Ammon, lying outside the limits of Palestine: "These and
 other Arabians they [the Turks] have never been able to sub-
 clue. They still occupy the deserts, and receive a yearly pension
          • Prayerfully consider Me unenfered fields.
34             THE PROPHECIES OP DANIEL

 of forty thousand _crowns of gold from the Ottoman emperors
 to permit the caravans with the pilgrims from Mecca to have
a free passage."
     3. Egypt, desiring to escape from Turkish rule, preferred
 to be under the domination of the French. But the tide of
 events turned otherwise. The English, as the ally of the Turks,
 determined to wrest Egypt from the French. After a series
of battles, in which the French were worsted by the combined
 forces of the English and the Turks, the whole of the French
army was shut up in Cairo and Alexandria. Cairo capitulated
June 27, i8o1, and Alexandria on September 2. Four weeks
 later (October I), the preliminaries of peace were signed at
London.
     4. It is a remarkable fact that in the year 1825, twenty-
 eight years before the Crimean War broke out, Dr. Adani
Clarke, in commenting upon the fulfilment of this very proph-
ecy, wrote the following comment : "This part of the prophecy
is allowed to be yet unfulfilled. If the Turkish power be under-
stood, as in the preceding verses, it may mean that the Persians
on the east and the Russians on the north will at some time
greatly embarrass the Ottoman government."
     Just twenty-eight years after Dr. Clarke penned this sug-
gestion, the world was amazed to see Turkey, a government
which had long been regarded as "the sick man of the east,"
declare war against her powerful neighbor, Russia. Thus
Turkey fulfilled the specifications of this part. of the prophecy,
which describes her as going "forth with great fury."
     5. As Dr. Clarke said of the 44th verse in 1825, we can
now say of this 45th verse,—it is yet unfulfilled. All except
the closing verse of this remarkable chapter has now been .
wrought out in history. We must look to Turkey to fulfil
the movement predicted in this verse.
     6. The expression, "none shall help him," clearly implies
that he has previously been helped by other powers. In the
war with France (1798-1801), England and Russia assisted
the sultan. In the war between Turkey and Egypt (1838-184o),
England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia. intervened in behalf of
Turkey. In the Crimean War (1853-1856), England, France,
and Sardinia supported the Turks. In the Russo-Turkish War
of 1877-78, the great powers of Europe interfered to arrest the
progress of Russia.
     7. Since the death of Mohammed, A. D. 622, his followers,
the -wild hordes of barbarians, were under no general' civil gov-

ernment. Gibbon refers to them as "this shipwreck of nations."
The first king who organized those tribes into a government
was Osman, afterward called Othman. The rise and progress
of Mohammedanism is the subject of a prophecy recorded in
the ninth chapter of the Revelation. The first incursions of
these hoi'des is described in verses 1-3. The beginning of
Othman's reign is noted in the firth verse, *here it is stated that
"they had a king over them." From this point the Ottoman
Empire began to fulfil its , mission as one of the scourges of
the corrupt Roman Empire—the destroyer of the Greek or
eastern portion of it, ruled from Constantinople.
     8. Gibbon says : It was on the twenty-seventh day of July,
in the year twelve hundred and ninety-nine of the Christian
era, that Othman first invaded the territory of Nicomedia; and
the singular accuracy of the date seems to disclose some fore-
sight of the rapid and destructive growth of the monster."—
Chapter LXIV, par. 14.
     9. The time allotted for the Mohammedan conquest was
given as "five months," and a further period of "an hour, a day,
and a month, and a year" was allotted to its supremacy. This
being prophetic time, must be reckoned in the following manner,
from the initial date as given by Gibbon:—
Date given by Gibbon                                  July 27, 1299
'Five months," 150 days—I50 literal years              July 27, 1449
"An hour," 24th part of a day-15 literal days..Aug. 11, 1449
"A day"—i literal year                               Aug. II, 5450

"A year," 36o days-36o literal years                  Aug. II, 5840
     Io. In the year 1838, two years prior to the above date,
 Josiah Litch, one of the Advent believers, of Boston, Mass..
 published the statement, based upon the above calculation, that
 the Ottoman supremacy would cease on the 11th day of August,
1840. Being challenged as to how much he would venture on
 the prediction, he said, "I will stake my belief in the inspiration
 of the old Book [meaning the Bible] that the event will trans-
 pire on that day."
      is. It is a remarkable historical fact that the ultimatum
 drawn up by the great powers (England, Austria, Prussia, and
 Russia), dictating terms of settlement with the pasha of Egypt,
 with whom the Porte was then at war, was submitted to th-
 Turkish Government for acceptance, and by the sultan's agents
 was placed in the hands of the opposing ruler, ON THE 11TH
 DAY OF AUGUST, 5840. By the acceptance of this ulti-
 matum, the independence of the Ottoman power came to an
  end, and it has since existed only on sufferance of the powers.

                     MARCH 19, 1904.

    1. Repeat Luke 21 :25, 26. - In the signs 'given by
our Saviour, where were distress and perplexity to be
seen? What was to cause men's hearts to fail them for
fear?
    2. What power has for the past fifty years caused
more unrest and uneasiness among the great European
nations than all other questions combined? Note 1.
    3. Of what sublime events will the driving of the
Turk from the soil of Europe be the signal? Note 2.
    4. Repeat Dan. 12:1, 2. What does the term to
"stand up," as used in this prophecy, mean? Who is
Michael? Compare I Thess. 4:16, Jude 9, and John
5:25, 28. How great a time of trouble is to follow the
standing up of Michael? What will God's people then
experience? How many will thus be delivered?

session was promised to Christ? What disposition is
He to make of the heathen nations when they are given
to Him?
  1o. Study Dan. 2:34, 35, 44. Does the promise in
the second psalm harmonize with the prophecy of this
chapter?                •
    1. Dan. 7:14, 27. Does it harmonize with the
prophecy of Daniel 7 also?
                              Notes.
     I. Lord Salisbury, prinie minister of Great Britain, in a
speech delivered Nov. 9, 1895, uttered the following words :—
    "Turkey is in that remarkable condition that it has now
stood for half a century, mainly because the great powers of
the world have resolved that for the peace of Christendom it
is necessary that the Ottoman Empire should stand. They
came to that conclusion nearly half a century ago. I do not
think they have altered it now."
     2. It must be clear to every careful reader that the driving
of the Turk from the soil of Europe will be the fulfilment o'
the closing verse of the eleventh chapter of Daniel's prophecy.
 What makes this line of prophecy of momentous interest to
 every one now living is the fact that the downfall of the
 Turkish Empire will be the signal of the most sublime events
 that the world has ever witnessed. The prophecy closes with
 the first two verses of chapter 12.

 be raised up? Of what are winds a symbol? What
 will be the result of that world-wide conflict?
                              Notes.
     i. It seems evident that the preparatory work of the sixth
plague,—the gathering of the kings of the East, in readiness
for the opening of the battle of Armageddon,—is a movement
that takes place before the seven last plagues begin to fall.
In other words, this movement on the part of the kings of the
East will be a sign that probation is about to close, and the
          Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
               THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL                      39

plagues about to fall, also that the battle of Armageddon is
about to begin. See "Early Writings," • Supplement to Experi-
ence and Views, par. 3.
     2. The civilized nations have a combined military strength
of eighty millions, awaiting the crisis. Napoleon Bonaparte,
while a prisoner on the island of St. Helena, 1815-21, made
the following statement :—
     "In the course of a few years, Russia will have Constan-
tinople, part of Turkey, and all of Greece. This I hold to be
as certain as if it had already taken place. All the cajolery
and flattery that Alexander practised upon me was to gain
my consent to effect that object. I would not give it, foreseeing
that the equilibrium of Europe would be destroyed. Once
mistress of Constantinople, Russia gets all the commerce of the
Mediterranean, becomes a naval power, and then God knows
what may happen."
     The following is from a Turkish editor, of a paper called
the Valeit:
     "We shall do our utmost to keep England's support; but
at last, if we do not succeed in it, then it is very easy to know
 what we have to do. When Europe will not look at us, then
 we shall lay aside all the European customs which we have
 adopted, and enter on our old way; from the boy of thirteen
 to the old man of seventy-five, every one of us will be armed,
 and we shall defend by- the will of God, and by the daring
 of the old days, the country we have held for five hundred
 years. And if the issue should come to this, as Islamism is
 not confined to Turkey, then we wilb blend all the different
 Moslem races into one; the Moslems of India, of Central Asia,
 of the Caucasus, of Africa, and of Algeria will come forward,
 and we shall again take measures which we once adopted for
 the conquest of Jerusalem. We shall send proclamations every-
 where, and declare a general war against Christendom. . . .
 Then it will not be possible to subjugate 120,000,000 Moslems
 by go,000sioo soldiers. If the Moslems all over the world rise
 to defend their sacred religion, and if the treasure accumulated
 every year at Mecca is disposed of for the protection of tb
 Mohammedan faith, then the scenes of ancient European wars.
 where the Moslems were both victorious and destructive, will
 be repeated, and the progress and civilization of centuries will
 be destroyed."

EDUCATION

  ings that can be experienced, for they give the highest type of
  joy in this life and impart a fitness for the joy of a wider service
  and the "higher course" in the school of the hereafter. Looking
  at the subject of Education from these standpoints, every one is
  interested in it, and so they will be in this book when it is shown
  to them. 321 pages, cloth, $1.25. (See cut in ist page adver-
  tisement.)

  blessings pronounced upon the disciples and the multitude—and

  and the binding all unite in making this volume a real "gem,"
  as it has so often been called by its many readers. 218 pages,
  cloth, price 6o cents.

  Brim full of experiences of what the power of God, through His
  Holy Spirit, has done for men, women, and children in every
  walk of life. Truly, as one reader said of it, "the book is alive."

            The Next Six Months

      Under date of December 16, 1903, the Signs of the
 Times issued an immense edition on the subject of Capital
and Labor.
      No one number, or two, however, could adequately dis-
cuss the great questions raised between Capital and Labor,
involving, as they do, the very question of government
itself.
      During the next six months the
              SIGNS OF THE TIMES
will illumine this subject as it has never been before. Here
are three series of articles:—
      I. "THE INDUSTRIAL PROBLEM: THE UNSETTLED
   STRIFE BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL." A dis-
   cussion of fundamental principles, present conditions, inev-
   itably logical outcome, and the light of prophecy. From ten
   to twenty articles.
      2. "THE HISTORY OF GOVERNMENT." Eleven
   articles by Alonzo T. Jones, a study of every phase of gov-
   ernment and its outcome, from ancient Babylon to the
   present. A valuable study, having a direct bearing upon
   present issues.
      3. A continuation of the STUDIES ON THE REVE-
   LATION.
     These things ought to give the Signs of the Times
a circulation of roo,o0o weekly.
            Price one year, $1.50; Six months, 75 cents
   Clubs of five or more copies to one name and address, one
