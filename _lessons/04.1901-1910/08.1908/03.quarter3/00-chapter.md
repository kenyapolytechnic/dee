      HERE are millions in China, Japan,

       the Bread of Life which God has
given Christians to dispense to the hungry.
Christ has purchased us that we might be

wise, and to the unwise." Rom. 1' : 14.

Book of Nehemiah
                    Senior Division

               Third Quarter, July 1, 1908



                     General Notes
    The book of Nehemiah was anciently connected with the book
of Ezra, being a continuation of the account of the return of
the exiles from Babylon and the restoration of Jerusalem. Ezra
restored the temple and began a spiritual reform; Nehemiah
built .the walls; and together they joined in a second_ spiritual
reformation.
    This book is the last of the historical records of the Old
Testament. At this time it appears that Ezra the scribe gath-
ered together all the books which now comprise the Old Testament
(except Malachi) and compiled the Scriptures, dividing them into
three parts, first, The Law; secondly, The Prophets; and thirdly.
the Hagiographa,        e., the holy writings. To these divisions
our Saviour apparently made reference when He said, "These
are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with
you, that all things might be fulfilled, which are written in the
law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning
Me."
    The life of Nehemiah is a worthy example. He gladly left
a position bringing both honor and wealth for one of arduous
toil and persistent opposition, because the cause of God needed
him. He was a skilful organizer, and a zealous worker; a man
4          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
of great integrity, and sound faith; who could neither be
frightened by the threats of the enemies of the Lord nor seduced
by their flatteries. He relieved the oppressed, but punished
the oppressor.
    A proper study of this book will help us to stand for the
same reforms at this time,—a separation from the world, a
strict observance of the true Sabbath, the conscientious payment
of our tithes and offerings, a tender care for the poor and dis-
tressed,—and give us courage in the face of our enemies to be
fearless of their threats but fearful of their blandishments.

                            Notes.

    1: Shushan, the capital of Elam, was a very ancient city. It
is mentioned in the inscriptions of Asshur-bani-pal as captured
by him, about B. c. 650, and a plan of the city is given. It
passed into the hands of the Babylonians at the division of the
Assyrian Empire between Nabopolassar of Babylon and Cyaxares
of Media. In the third year of Belshazzar Daniel was at Shu-
shan "on the king's business." when he beheld "the vision
of the ram and the he-goat," Dan. 8: 1, 2, 27.. The conquest
of Babylon by Cyrus transferred Shushan to the Persians, and
it became the capital and chief residence of the Ackemenian
kings, being cooler than Babylon and more central than Ecbatana
and Persepolis, their summer resorts. Darius Hystaspes founded
at Shushan the grand palace referred to in Esther as occupied
by his son and successor Xerxes, Esther 1: 2, 5. Nehemiah was at
Shushan when he received from Jerusalem the intelligence that
led him to seek leave from Artaxerxes to rebuild the walls of the
holy city. Neh. 1: 1-28. As Susa, Shushan is often mentioned
by classic authors as the Persian capital, the province of Elam
being called Susis or Susiana, and also Cissia. The city retained
its eminence till the Macedonian conquest, when Alexander found
there treasure worth £12,000,000. After this period Susa de-
clined and Babylon increased. It was taken by Antigonus, B. c.
315.—" Dictionary of the Bible," Published by American Tract
Society. Article " Shushan.'
    2. Hanani was the brother of Nehemiah. Neh. 7: 2.
6          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   3. It will be noticed that each of these godly men counted
himself as being guilty of the sins that brought upon Israel the
great calamity. Their attitude is very different from that of
those who think they have not sinned. Daniel and Nehemiah were
both men of God, and beloved of the Lord.
   4. One special point in Nehemiah's prayer was that God
would hear the petition of those who fear His name, and would
prosper his undertaking and giant him 'mercy in the sight of
the king. He recognized the fact that many others were praying.
and he believed that God would hear their prayers.'




     LESSON 11.—Preparation for a Great Work.
                       JULY 11, 1908.
                          Questions.
   1. How much time elapsed between Nehemiah's hear—
ing of the situation at Jerusalem. and his. 'conversation
with - the king upon the matter?. 'Compare Neh. 1: 1, 2
with Neh. 2: 1 and Zech. 7: 1. Note 1. .
   2. What was Nehemiah's usual, appearance in the
king's presence? Neh.. 2: 1.
   3. What reason did the king suggest for his sad •
countenance, and how did it affect Nehemiah'? Verse 2.
Note 2.
   4. What response did Nehemiah make? Verse 3.
   5. Give the king's reply. Verse 4.
   6. What did Nehemiah do before . he answered the
king? Verse 4. Note 3.
   7. What request did Nehemiah make? Verse 5.
   8. What is there in the king's reply that shows how
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

he was regarded by both the king and queen? Verse 6:
Compare P.rov. 22: 11.
    9. What further request did Nehemiah make? Verses
7, 8.
   10. Who influenced the king to grant the request?
Verse 8; last clause.
   11. Who accompanied Nehemiah when he delivered
the king's letter to the governors? Verse 9.
   12. What troubled Sanballat and Tobiah? Verse 10.
   13. In what way did Nehemiah acquaint himself with
the extent of the city's ruins before he began any work?
Verses 11-13.
   14. In what condition did he find the city? Verses
13-15.
   15.' Who were still unacquainted with the object of
 Nehemiah's visit to the city? Verse 16.
                            Notes.
    .1. The year- of Artaxerxes' reign did not coincide with the
sacred year of the Jews, but commenced in the sacred year between
the months Nisan and Chislev; eonsequently the interval between
OhiSlev of Artaxerxes' twentieth year and Nisan of the same
year is to be determined by counting forward from Chislev of
the sacred year- of the Jews to the Nisan of the following sacred
year.               •
    2. One who acted as cup-bearer to the king was expected
always to be cheerful. He had it in his power to take the life
of the king; and if he looked unhappy the king might suspect
some plot and he be killed; for this reason Nehemiah was "sore
afraid" when the king noticed his sad countenance.
     3—"In the sight of men the self-sufficient worker may seem
to be moving the world, but in the sight of God, the humble
wrestler moves heaven. The hosts of God are interested in the
humble, praying man, who dares not make a move without first
coming in prayer int:3 the presence of God to counsel with the
Omnipotent."—Mrs. E. G. White in "Review and Herald," July
4, 1893.

                               Notes.
    1. Nehemiah did not consider his commission as governor of
Jerusalem as his greatest authority for building. When ques-
tioned by the Samaritans, he frankly told them that he trusted in
a higher power than earthly kings for help to carry forward the
work.
     2. Some built "over against" their own houses. In this is a
lesson for those who can not leave their homes to labor in the
Lord's work. There is always something to do by their own
homes.
    3. There was but one class mentioned that did not engage
in the work of rebuilding. This was the Nobles of the Tekoites.
All others including the priests, rulers, goldsmiths, apothecaries,
and merchants, entered heartily into the work of building the
wall. This was the first thing to be done, and it was that which
many years before their enemies had accused them of undertaking.
Ezra 4: 12, 13. Under Nehemiah the work was accomplished.
     4. Jerusalem had been laid in ruins, because "they mocked
the messengers of God, and despised His words, and misused His
prophets, until the wrath of the Lord- arose' against His people,
till there was no remedy. Therefore He brought upon them the
king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword
in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon
young man or maiden, old man or him that stooped for age;
He gave them all into' his hand.   '      And all the vessels of
the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of
the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king and of his
princes, all these he brought to Babylon. And they burnt the
house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt
all the palaces thereof. And them that had escaped from the
sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants
to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
to fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until
the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay
desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil three score and ten years."
2 Chron. 36: 16-21.
     The Lord through the prophet Daniel had foretold that "the
street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times."
Dan. 9: 25. Some of the experiences passed through in fulfil-
ment of this prophecy are studied in these lessons.
    Now, as in the days of Nehemiah, the true people of the Lord
are entrusted with a, special and an important work. A real city
is not to be rebuilt and a real wall restored, but a spiritual restor-
ation is to be accomplished. The foundation of many generations
10         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
is to be raised up, and the breach made by apostasy in the law
of Jehovah is to be restored. The rubbish of error must be
removed, and. the truths of God's word restored to the people.
The Sabbath of the Lord, long hidden beneath the traditions
of men, is to be restored to its proper place in the Demlogue.
In "troublous times" the law of God is to be reared up to
stand as a wall of defense for the people of God in the last days.
No work ever accomplished called for greater earnestness, zeal,
and consecration than this.




          LESSON IV.—Difficulties Overcome.
                        JULY 25, 1908.
                           Questions.
   1. Did the work of rebuilding Jerusalem stop because
of opposition? Why did it go forward under these
adverse circumstances? Neh. 4: 6. Note 1.
   2. When the enemies of the -Jews heard that the
walls were being built, how did they feel about it?
Verse 7.
   3. What did they do? Verse 8. Note. 2.
   4. What course did Nehemiah and the Jews pursue?
Verse 9. Note 3.
   5. What difficulties did Judah see in the way?
Verse 10.
   6. From what standpoint did he look that he saw

   7. What was the enemy doing? Neh. 6: 19. Com-
pare Prov. 26: 20. Note 4.
   8. What plan was laid? Neh. 4:11'
   9. What message was sent to Israel ten tithes 4 Verse
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    11

12. (According to the Revised Version the message
was, "Ye must return unto us.")
   10. What precaution did Nehemiah take? Verse 13.
   11. With what words did he encourage them to go
forward with the work? Verse 14.
   12. How many kept at the work?, Verse 15.
   13. How were Nehemiah's servants employed? Verse
16.
   14. Describe the way in which the builders worked.
Verses 17, 18.
   15. How should the builders in God's work be
equipped if they would not be driven from the work by
 the enemy '1 2 Cor.. 10 : 4-6; Eph. 6: 12-18.
   16. What plans were laid for united resistance against
 the enemy? Neh. 4:19, 20.
   17. How Fong did they labor each day? Verse 21.
   18. How was their zeal further shown? Verses 22,
23. Note 5.
                              Notes.
    1. When God's people "have a mind to work" and go for-
 ward trusting in the Lord, the work of God always prospers.
    2. At every advance step in the work of God, Satan has been
 alarmed. He sees divine agencies at work preparing the way,
 and he raises up his agents to prevent the accomplishment of the
 work if possible. The same opposition shown at the building of
 the walls of Jerusalem will always be seen in connection with the
 work of God. The same spirit of animosity manifested by the Am-
 monites, the Horonites, and the Arabians will always appear when
 God's work is going forward. These three nationalities were rep-
 resented in Jerusalem, under the names of Sanballat, Tobiah, and
 Geshem.
     3.. In Neh., 4: 8, 9, is revealed the reason why we often meet
 with such miserable defeats after great victories. When the
 enemy sees a great victory gained, he becomes angry and gathers
 his forces to hinder the work. If we always do as Nehemiah did,
12          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

pray and watch day and night, we shall escape the snares of
Satan and go from victory to victory.
    4. Judah thought the laborers were overworked and were weak,
and there was much rubbish. The reason for this was that he
was in communication with the enemy and not true to God and
His work. One who is compromising to-day with the enemies of
God's work, thus betraying it, will see difficulties in the way and
will hinder rather than hasten the Lord's work.
    5. God has, regard for the man or woman who in a time of
crisis will sacrifice every comfort and even life itself to carry
forward the work of the Lord. "The life that will be preserved
is the life that is freely given in service to God and man."




               LESSON V.—New Difficulties.
                       AUGUST 1, 1908.
                           Questions.

regarding? Lev. 25: 35-37; Ex.. 22 : 25-27. Note 1.
    9. How long did Nehemiah continue to act as. gov-
ernor? Neh. 5 14.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    13
  10. How did his course compare with that of former
governors? Verse 15.

regard for the people and the work? Verses 17-19.
  13. How are such sacrifices regarded by the Lord?
Heb. 6: 10 ; Phil. 4 : 16-18. Note 3.
  14. What encouraging promises are made to those
who give freely? Luke 6: 38; 2 Cor. 9: 6; :Prov. 11: 25.
Note 4.
  15. What warning is given against withholding?
Prov. 11 : 24; 13 : 7.
                             Notes.
    1. -Miry on money, or on anything used to relieve the unfortu-
nate and the oppressed, seems to have been strictly forbidden in
the word of God. Ps. 15: 5. Under certain other conditions,
however, they were permitted to take usury. Dent. 23: 19, 20.
We will do well to prayerfully study the principles involved, for
it is no doubt as applicable to us to-day as to' Israel anciently.
    "In the view given me in Rochester, N. Y., Dec. 25, 1865,
I was shown that the subject of taking usury should be considered
by Sabbath-keepers. Wealthy . men have no right to take in-
terest from their poor brethren, but they may receive usury from
unbelievers."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1, page 534.
     2. Although Nehemiah held the high position of governor,
and no doubt had many opportunities to enrich himself if he so
desired, yet he did not do so. He continued to work on the wall,
and to set before all a splendid example of sacrifice. His ex-
ample contains a lesson which is well worthy of study at this
 time. No people should be more willing to sacrifice than those
upon whom the end of the world has come.
     3. The Lord is not unmindful of the little sacrifices made
 in behalf of His servants who are carrying burdens in His work.
 The giving of a cup of cold water is. not -forgotten. Matt.
10: 42. It is the little things in life which settle our destiny.
 With this thought in mind, read Matt. 25: 34-46.
14         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   4. "Whenever God's people, in any period of the world,
have cheerfully and willingly carried out His plan in systematic
benevolence and in gifts and offerings, they have realized the
standing promise that prosperity should attend all their labors
just in proportion as they obeyed his requirements. When they
acknowledged the claims of God, and complied with His require-
ments, honoring Him with their substance, their barns were filled
with plenty. But when they robbed God in tithes and offerings,
they were made to realize that they were not only robbing Him
but themselves; for He limited His blessings to them, just in pro-
portion as they limited their offerings to Him. "—" Testimonies
for the Om-eh," Vol. 8, page 395.

nobles of Judah? Verses 17-19. Note 2.
                               Notes.
    1. It was a time of greater peril to the work when the adver-
saries tried to make friendly overtures than when they were openly
fighting against it.
    2. The nobles of Judah had mingled with the company of
Tobiah until they could not discern spiritual things. History
repeats itself, and "Those who have step by step yielded to
worldly demands, and conformed to worldly customs, will not
find it a hard matter to yield to the powers that be, rather than
subject themselves to derision, insult, threatened imprisonment.
and death. The contest is between the commandments of God
and the commandments of men. In this time, the gold will be
separated from the dross in the church. True godliness will be
clearly distinguished from the appearance and tinsel of it. Many
a star that we have admired for its brilliancy, will then go out
in darkness.—" Testimonies for the Church," Vol. 5, page 8.1.

salem? Neb. 8: 1.
  14. How long since Ezra had gone up to j erusalem?
Compare Ezra 7: 7, 8 with Neh. 2: 1.
                            Notes.

    1. The Urim and Thummim gave the direct mind of the Lord
in the matter, and therefore was higher authority than the gov-
ernor. Ex. 28: 30; Nuni. 27: 21; 1 Sn,m. 28: 6. Read chapter
30 in "Patriarchs and Prophets."
    "At the right and left of the breastplate were two large
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    17.
stones of great brilliancy. These were known as the Urim and
Thummim. By them the will of God was made known through
the high priest. When questions were brought for decision be-
fore the Lord, a halo of light encircling the precious stone at
the right was a token of the divine consent or approval, while a
cloud shadowing the stone at the left was an evidence of denial
or disapprobation."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 351.
   2. The Jews were engaged in a steady-work of reform, and the
whole plan of their enemies was to divert them from their work.
First they sought to frighten the Jews, and when they would
not be frightened, efforts were made to arrange a conference with
them, reporting things that were not true. This conference was
sought under the pretense of friendship, but war was in the
heartg of their enemies continually.




      LESSON VI11.—The Reading of the Law.
                      AUGUST 22, 1908.

  10. At the close of the reading what special instruction

  11. How did they show their thankfulness for an un-
derstanding of the word? Verse 12.
  12. For what purpose did the people assemble the
second day? Verse 13.
  13: What instruction did they find? Verses 14, 15.
  14. What did the people do? Verses 16, 17.
  15. How often was the law read during the feast?
Verse 18.
  16. Of what was the Feast of Tabernacles a type?
Note 2.
                             Notes.

    1. The marginal reading of this verse in. the Revised Version
is as follows: "And they read in the book, in the law of .God,
with an interpretation; and they gave the sense, and caused them
to understand." Owing to a difference in language it was neces-
sary that some one should interpret the reading to the people
so that they might understand it. This verse has no special
reference to the excellence of the reading in the ordinary sense.
    2. "The Feast of Tabernacles was not only commemorative, but
typical. It not only pointed back to the wilderness sojourn,
but as the feast of harvest, it celebrated the ingathering of the
fruits of the earth, and pointed forward to the great day of
final ingathering, when the Lord of the harvest shall send forth
His reapers to gather the tares together in bundles for the fire,
and to gather the wheat into His garner., . . . The people
of Israel praised God at the Feast of Tabernacles, as they called
to mind His mercy in their deliverance from the bondage of
Egypt, and His tender care for them during their pilgrim life
in the wilderness. They rejoiced also in the consciousness of
pardon and acceptance, through the service of the day of atone-
ment, just ended. But when the ransomed of the Lord shall
have been safely gathered into the heavenly Canaan,—forever
delivered from the bondage of the curse, under which 'the whole
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    19
creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,'—
they will rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Christ's
great work of atonement for men will then have been completed,
and their sins will have been forever blotted out."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," pages 541, 542.
    "Well would it be for the people of God at the present time
to have a Feast of Tabernacles—a joyous commemoration of the
blessings of God to them. As the children of Israel celebrated
the deliverance that God had wrought for their fathers, and
His miraculous preservation of them during their journeyings
from Egypt, so should we, gratefully call to mind the various
ways He has devised for bringing us out from the world, and
from the darkness of error, into the precious light of His grace
and truth."---"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages .540, 541.

newed their consecration to the Lord? Neh. 10 : 1.

of the regular offerings of the sanctuary? Neh. 10:
32, 33.
    6. How was the wood to keep the altar-fires burn-
ing provided year by year? Verse 34.
    7. Where were the first-fruits brought? Verses

of the temple? Neh. 8 : 3; 9 : 3.
                             Notes.
   1. There are many things here worthy of study. A syste-
matic arrangement was made to supply all the expenses con-
nected with the temple service. The tithe was sacredly kept
for the use for which God designed it.
   2. It is evident that the people 'so thoroughly studied the law
and the worship of the sanctuary arranged by David and Sol-
omon that they were familiar with every feature that God had
ordained. It was one of the most thorough reforms of which
we have any Bible record. It fitly illustrates what will finally
be accomplished under the third angel's message.



         LESSON XI.—Dedication of the Wall.

     9.' Why were the Ammonites and Moabiteg, excluded
from the house of God? . Verse 2. Note 1.

and offerings were stored? Verse 4.

stuff? Neh. 13 : 8.

    20. What provision was made for a proper and careful
 distribution of the tithe? Verse 13.
                            Notes.
  1. The Ammonites and Moabites were not excluded from the
congregation simply because they belonged to those nations, but
because of their evil character. Tobiah retained the character
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 of his ancestors who did evil in the sight of the Lord. Deut 23:
3, 4; but Ruth, the Moabitess,_ who loved the Lord and chose His
 service, was the honored great grandmother of David and is
 reckoned in the genealogy of Christ. Ruth 4: 10, 13; 17.
     2. After the wall was dedicated and the various reforms in
 the temple service introduced, it seems that Nehemiah fulfilled
 his promise to the king and queen and returned to Babylon. Neh.
2: 6. How long he remained in Babylon is not recorded.
     3. "The work of God, which should be going forward with
 tenfold its present strength and efficiency, is kept back, like a
 spring season held by the chilling blast of winter, because some
 of God's professed people are appropriating to themselves the
 means that should be dedicated to His service. Because Christ's
 self-sacrificing love is not interwoven in the life practises, the
'church is weak where it should be strong. By its own course it
 has put out its light, and robbed millions of the Gospel of
Christ."--"Review and Herald," Oct. 13, 1896.
    "Let the church appoint pastors or elders who are devoted
to the Lord Jesus, and let these men see that officers are chosen
who will attend faithfully to the work of gathering in the tithe.
If the pastors show that they are not fitted for their charge,
if they fail to set before the church the importance of returning
to God His own, if they do not see to it that the officers under
them are faithful, and that the tithe is brought in, they are in
peril. They are neglecting a matter which involves a blessing
or a curse to the church. They should be relieved of their re-
sponsibility, and other men should be tested and tried.—"Review
and Herald," Dec. 1, 1896.

ing the Sabbath? Matt. 24 : 20.
    10. What charge of breaking the Sabbath was brought
1- iy the Pharisees against the disciples upon a certain

 Iccasion? Matt. 12 : 1, 2.

 for the Sabbath to close that we may attend to business?
 Amos 8:4-7.
     15. What did Nehemiah say to those who came on the
 Sabbath to sell their wares? With what result? Neh.
13: 20-22.
26         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                            Note.
    "God requires that His holy day be as sacredly kept now
as in the time of Israel. The command given to the Hebrews
should be regarded by all Christians as an injunction from
Jehovah to them. The day before the Sabbath should be made
a day of preparation, that everything may be in readiness for
its sacred hours. In 'no case should our own business be allowed
to encroach upon holy time. God has directed that the sick
and suffering be cared for; the labor required to make them •
comfortable is a work of mercy, and no violation of the Sab-
bath; but all unnecessary work should be avoided. Many care-
lessly put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little things
that might have been done on the day of preparation. This
should not be. Work that is neglected until the beginning• of
the Sabbath should remain undone until it is past. This course
might help the memory of these thoughtless ones, and make
them careful to do their own work on the six working days. "

    12. In prayer what request did Jesus make for His

    13. What does God call those who have friendship
 with the world? James 4: 4.

                             Notes.

     1. "It is a dangerous thing to form a worldly alliance.
 Satan well knows that the hour that witnesses the marriage of .
 many young men and women closes the history of their religious
 experience and usefulness. They are lost to Christ. They may
 for a time make an effort to live a Christian life; but all their
 strivings are made against a steady influence in the opposite
 direction. Once it was a privilege and a joy to them to
 speak of their faith and hope • but they become unwilling to
 mention the subject, knowing tat the one with whom they have
 linked their destiny takes no interest in it. As the result, faith
 in the precious truth dies out of the heart, and Satan insidiously
 weaves about them a web of skepticism."
     "Spiritual declension commences the moment the vow is
 made at the altar; religious fervor is dampened, and one strong-
 hold after another is , broken down, until both stand side by
28         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

side under the black banner of Satan. Even in the festivities
of the wedding, the spirit of the world triumphs against con-
science, faith, and truth. In the new home the hour of prayer
is not respected. The bride and bridegfoom have chosen each
other, and dismissed Jesus. "—" Testimonies for the Church,"
Vol. 4, pages 504, 505.
   "Hundreds have sacrificed Christ and Heaven in consequence
of marrying unconverted persons. Can it be that the love and
fellowship of Christ are of so little value to them that they
prefer the companionship of poor mortals? Is Heaven so little
esteemed that they are willing to risk its enjoyments for one
who has no love for the precious Saviour? "—Ib., page 507.
   2. " Then my eyes were taken from the glory, and I was
pointed to the remnant on the earth. Said the angel to them,
`Will ye shun the seven last plagues? Will ye go to glory, and
enjoy all that God has prepared for those that love Him, and
are willing to suffer for His sake? If so, ye must die that ye
may live. Get ready, get ready, get ready. Ye must have a
greater preparation than ye now have, for the day of the
Lord eometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the
land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
Sacrifice all to God. Lay all upon His altar,—self, property,
and all, a living sacrifice. It will take all to enter glory. Lay
up for yourselves treasure in Heaven, where no thief can ap-
proach,. or rust corrupt. Ye must be partakers of Christ 's suf-
ferings here, if ye would be partakers with Him of His glory
hereafter.' "—"Early Writings," pages 56, 57.

The Signs of the Times

 Is a paper devoted to the exposition of prophecy and the presenta-
tion of the Gospel. The events that are passing in the world to-day
were clearly and in plain language foretold by the prophets cen-
turies ago. The wars, the unprecedented amassing of wealth, the
conflicts of the laboring classes, the vices and crimes, and all the
rest of the marked conditions of these times are among the things
 presented by the prophetic pen. It is most intensely interesting to
study these prophecies. The Lord knew in the centuries of the dis-
tant past that these days would be full of perplexing and fore.
boding problems that would fill the minds of men with inexpressible
dread. And so He caused His prophets to write these things out in
those long-gone years, so that we might the more readily have con-
 fidence in Him and His inspired Word. The SIGNS OF THE
 TINES is devoted to the presentation of these intensely interesting
themes, and to the promulgation of the Gospel that reveals the
Christ of God, the Saviour that bids every one come to Him, that
they may escape from all the evil and soul distress of this world of
sorrow and despair.
      The SIGNS OF THE TIMES contains sixteen pages and
is published weekly. It is neatly and appropriately illustrated,
and its general matter, and especially the Home Department, is
such that it is enjoyed by the children around the fireside, as well
as by the older enquirer after Bible truth.
