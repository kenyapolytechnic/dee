    1. How has the Lord ever forewarned people of im-
pending events ? Amos 3 : 6, 7. Give illustrations of this
principle.
    2. What sure. guide have we as to the times and the
seasons ? 2 Peter 1: 19.
    3. Before what great tribunal must every life come
in review? Eccl. 12 : 13, 14.
    4. In what way did Paul speak of the time of this
event ? • Acts 17 : 31 ; 24 : 25.

           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     3
    7. What line of prophecy establishes the time of this
investigative judgment? Dan. 8: 14; 9: 24, 25. Note 2.
  • 8. What view was given Daniel of the judgment
scene in heaven? Dan. 7 : 9, 10.
    9. What did the prophet behold of the work of
apostasy on earth while the judgment was sitting in
heaven? Verses 11, 21, 22.
  10. What view was given John of the work of God '
on earth during this time of judgment in heaven? Rev.
14 : 6, 7. Who only is to be feared and exalted?
  11. What other messages are joined with the proc-
lamation of the judgment hour? Verses 8-11.
  12. What are the characteristics of the believers de-
veloped by these messages ? Verse 12.
  13. What movement is fulfilling this prophecy before

  14. What event of all events follows the carrying of
these messages to the world? Verses 14-16.
  15. How only may we hope to stand in this searching
day of God's judgment ? Phil. 3: 8-11; 1 John 4 : 17.
  16. What assurances are given us in 1 John 2: 1 and
Heb. 7 : 25?
                             Notes.
    1. Inasmuch as the righteous dead are raised and the right-
eous living translated in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
at the second coming of Christ, it is evident that the judgment
to determine who is worthy - of life must precede the second
advent.
    2. As shown in last quarter's studies, the day of atonement,
or cleansing of the sanctuary, in the tabernacle service, was the
last of the yearly round of ministration. It was a day of judg-
ment in the camp of Israel, and whatsoever soul did not find
pardon in that day was cut off. Lev. 23:27-29. So the anti-
typical day of atonement, the time of the closing ministry of
4          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
our High Priest in heaven, is the hour of the investigative judg-
ment. The beginning of this closing work of judgment is at
the close of the prophetic period of Dan. 8:14. This period of
2300 prophetic days, or literal years, was to reach from the
going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem
to the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary. That commandment
went forth in the year B. C. 457, and ended in the year 1844.
Then began the solemn work of the investigative judgment.

   13. What worship does it require? Same verse.
   14. What wonders does it perform? Verse 13; 16: 13,
14. Compare with 1 Kings 18 : 22-24 and 'Matt. 24 :
23, 24.
   15. In the midst of these terrible deceptions, what will
be our only safety? Isa. 8.: 19, 20; 2 Peter 1: 19. Note 7.
                              Notes.
     1. "The line of prophecy in which these symbols are found,
begins with Revelation 12, with the dragon that sought to destroy
Christ at His birth. The dragon is said to be Satan; he it was
that moved upon Herod to put the Saviour to death. But the
chief agent of Satan in making war upon Christ and His people
during the first centuries of the Christian era, was the Roman
empire, in which paganism was the prevailing religion. Thus
while the dragon, primarily, represents Satan, it is, in a secondary
sense, a symbol of pagan Rome."—"Great Controversy," page
438.
     2. "In chapter 13 is described another beast, 'like unto a
leopard,' to which the dragon gave 'his power, and his seat, and
great authority.' This symbol, as most Protestants have believed,
represents the papacy, which succeeded to the power and seat
and authority once possessed by the ancient Roman empire.
. . . This prophecy which is nearly identical with the descrip-
6           bABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 tion of the little horn of Daniel 7, unquestionably points to the
 papacy. "—Id., page 439.
    3. The fulfilment of this prophecy is well described by Car-
dinal Gibbons in his work, " The Faith of Our Fathers," pages
164-166. He says: "Constantine gave to the Roman Church
munificent donations of money and real estate, which were aug-
 mented by additional grants contributed by subsequent emperors.
Hence the patrimony of the Roman pontiffs soon became very
considerable. . . . An event occurred in the reign of Con-
stantine which paved the way for the partial jurisdiction which
the Roman pontiffs commenced to enjoy over Rome, and which
they continued to exercise till they obtained full sovereignty in
 the days of King Pepin of France. In the year 327, the Emperor
Constantine transferred the seat of empire from Rome to Con-
stantinople, the present capital of Turkey."
    4. "The forty and two months are the same as the 'time and
times and the dividing of time,' three years and a half, or 1260
 days, of Daniel 7—the -• timeng  uriwhich the papal power was
to oppress God's people. This period began with the establishment
of the papacy, A. D. 538, and terminated in 1798. At that time,
when the papacy was abolished and the pope made captive by
the French 'army, the papal power received its deadly wound, and
the prediction was fulfilled, 'He that lea deth into captivity shall
go into captivity.' "—Great Controversy," page 439.
    5. "Both the appearance of this beast and the manner of
its rise indicate that the nation which it represents is unlike those
presented under the preceding symbols. . . , The application
of the symbol admits of no question. One nation, and only one,
meets the specifications of this prophecy; it points unmistakably
to the United States of America. . . . The lamblike horns
indicate youth, innocence, and gentleness, fitly representing the
character of the United States when presented to the prophet as
`coming up' in 1798. The Christian exiles who first fled to
America sought an asylum from royal oppression and priestly
intolerance, and they determined to establish a government upon
the broad foundation of civil and religious liberty. The Declaration
of Independence sets forth the great truth that 'all men are
created equal,' and endowed with the inalienable right to `life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.' And the constitution guaran-
tees to the people the right of self-government, providing that rep-
resentatives elected by popular vote shall enact and administer the
laws. Freedom of religious faith was also granted, every man be-
ing permitted to worship God according to the dictates of his con-
science. Republicanism and Protestantism became the fundamental
principles of the nation. These principles are the secret of its
            SAlltATIT-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    7
power and prosperity. The oppression and down-trodden through-
out Christendom have turned to this land with interest and hope.
Millions have sought its shores, and the United States has risen
to a place among the most powerful nations of the earth."
—Id., page 441.
   6. "The larnblike horns and the dragon voice of the symbol
point to a striking contradiction between the professions and the
practise of - the nation thus represented. The 'speaking' of the
nation is the action of its legislative and judicial authorities.
By such action it will give the life to those liberal and peace-
ful principles which it has put forth as' the foundation of its
policy. The prediction that it will speak 'as a dragon,' and ex-
ercise 'all the power of the first beast,' plainly foretells a devel-
opment of the spirit of intolerance and persecution that was
manifested by the nations represented by the dragon and the
leopard-like beast."—Id. page 442.
   7. " As America, the land of religious liberty, shall unite with
the papacy in forcing the conscience and compelling men to
honor the false sabbath, the people of every country on the -
globe will be led to follow her example." "Foreign nations will
follow the example of the United States. Though she leads out,
yet the same crisis will come upon our people in all parts of the
world."—"Testimonies for the Church," No. 7, pages 18, 395.

    6. What does the Lord say concerning false worship ?

  12. Where will the victorious ones stand at last? Rev.
14:1-5; 15:2.
  13. How is their blessed condition described? Rev.
7: 13-17. Note 5.
  14. What is this new song which they will sing? Rev.
15:3, 4.
                             Notes.
    1. The beast obtained its power from the dragon, or Satan,
through pagan Rome. Upon one occasion Satan offered his pos-
session and authority to Christ upon condition that He would bow
down and worship him. The prophet saw the dragon, or Satan,
give his seat, or authority, to the beast. No doubt the beast paid
the price placed upon it by Satan. To worship this eccle-
siastical image is in reality to turn away from Jehovah by dis-
obeying His precepts, and render obedience to that evil power
through whom sin was brought into the world. There could not
be a more complete apostasy than is here set forth.
    2. The test will come to every soul, now as it ever has in
the past, upon the point of obedience. All will be called upon
to decide whether they will obey God and receive from Him the
reward of faithfulness, or obey the decrees of apostasy.and suf-
fer at last the penalty of disobedience.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         9
     3. "Fearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought.
.The powers of earth, uniting to war against the commandments
 of God, will decree that all, 'both small and great, rich and poor,
 free and bond,' shall conform to the customs of the church by
 the observance of the false sabbath. All who refuse compliance
 will be visited with civil penalties, and it will finally be declared
 that they are deserving of death. On the other hand, the law of
 God enjoining the Creator's rest-day demands obedience, and
 threatens wrath against all who transgress its precepts.
     "With the issue thus clearly brought before him, whoever shall
 trample upon God's law to obey a human enactment, receives
 the mark of the beast; he accepts the sign of allegiance to the
 power which he chooses to obey instead of God. The warning from
 Heaven is, 'If any man worship the beast and his image, and
 receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
 drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out
 without mixture into the cup of. His indignation.' "—"Great
 Controversy," page 604.
     4. " The season of distress and anguish before us will re-
 quire a faith that can endure weariness, delay, and hunger—a
 faith that will not faint, though Severely tried. The period of
 probation is granted to all to prepare for that time. Jacob
 prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His vic-
 tory is an evidence of the power of importunate prayer. All who
 will lay hold of God's promises, as he did, and be as earnest
 and persevering as he was, will succeed as he succeeded. Those
 who are unwilling to deny self, to agonize before God, to pray
 long and earnestly for His blessing, will not obtain it. Wrestling
 with God—how few know what it is! How few have ever had
 their souls drawn out after God with intensity of desire until
 every power is on the stretch. When waves of despair which no
 language can express sweep over the suppliant, how few cling
 with unyielding faith to the promises of God! "—Id., page 621.
     5. "As we were traveling along, we met a company who were
 also gazing at the glories of the place. I noticed red as a border
 on their garments; their crowns were brilliant; their robes were
 pure white. As we greeted them, I asked Jesus who they were.
 He said they were martyrs that had been slain for Him. With
  them was an innumerable company of little ones; they had a
  hem of red on their garments also. Mount Zion was just before
  us, and on the mount was a glorious temple, and about it were
 seven other mountains, on which grew roses and lilies. And I
 saw the little ones climb, or, if they chose, use their little wings
 and fly to the top of the mountains and pluck the never-fading
  flowers. There were all kinds of trees around the temple to
10     ' SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
beautify the place; the box, the pine, the fir, the oil, the myrtle,
the pomegranate, and the fig-tree bowed down with the weight
of its timely figs—these made the place all over glorious. And
as we were about to enter the holy temple, Jesus raised His lovely
voice and said, 'Only the 144,000 enter this place,' and we shouted,
 Alleluia.' "—Early Writings," page 41.


          LESSQN TV.—The Mark of the Beast.

age does the third angel's message warn the world?
Rev. 14 : 9-12.
     2. What is the significance of the word "mark"?
Compare Rom. 4: 11; Eze. 20 : 12, 20; Rev. 7: 2-4; Eze.

    3. To what extent will the spirit of self-exaltation be
seen in the papacy ? 2 Thess. 2: 3, 4. Compare Isa.
14 : 12-14.
    4. To what will this self-exaltation lead? Dan. 7 :
25. Note 2.
    5. To what extent will the image of the beast go in
its efforts to enforce the mark of the beast? Rev. 13:
15-17. Note 3.
    6. Who only will refuse this badge of disloyalty?
Rev. 13 : 8; 17 : 8. Note 4.
    7. How does the Lord regard obedience? 1 Sam.
15 : 22. How disobedieuce? Verse 23.

1-11.
   12. In the final crisis with the beast and his image,
what great deliverance will come to .the faithful? Rev.
14 : 1-5.
   13. What• song of victory will be sung ? Rev. 15 :
3, 4.
                             Notes.
    1. Jehovah has a sign, or seal. This sign, or seal, is found
in His law, and is the seventh-day Sabbath which He blessed
and gave to man in Eden. The observance of this day marks
those who keep it as servants of God.
     That power which sits "in the temple of God, showing him-
self that he is God," also has a seal, or mark, 'the observance
of which will designate those who keep it as servants of an
apostate spiritual kingdom.
     2. The power foreshadowed in this scripture is the beast power
of Revelation 13, known in history as the Roman, or papal, church.
The evil principles which lie at the foundation of this great ec-
clesiastical hierarchy are but an outgrowth of that spirit of self-
exaltation which originated in the heart of Lueifer, and through
sin has been planted in the human heart.
     The highest form of worship is obedience. To direct wor-
ship from the true God to itself, th,e papacy has dared to tamper
with the law of God. In the church catechisms the second com-
mandment has been omitted, and the tenth divided to make good
the number ten. Concerning the change of the Sabbath, eminent
writers speak as follows:
     "In the interval between the days of the apostles and the
conversion of Constantine, the Christian commonwealth changed
 its aspect. The bishop f Rome—a personage unknown to the
 writers of the New Testament—meanwhile rose into prominence,
12          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

and at length took precedence of all other churchmen. Rites
and ceremonies of which neither Paul nor Peter ever heard,
crept silently into use, and then claimed the rank of divine insti-
tutions."—Preface to Killen's " Ancient Church."
    "We hear less than we used to about the apostolic origin of
the present Sunday observance, and for the reason that while
the Sabbath and Sunday rest are woven into the warp and woof
of Scripture, it is now seen, as it is admitted, that we must go to
later than apostolic times for the establishment of Sunday ob-
servance."—Christian at Work, 1844.
    "The change from the seventh to the first; appears to have
been gradually and silently introduced, by example rather than by
express precept."—Scott, Comment on Acts 20:7.
    "Unquestionably the first law, either ecclesiastical or civil,
by which the sabbatical observance of that day [Sunday] is
known to have been ordained, is the edict of Constantine, A. D.
321."—"Chambers' Encyclopedia."
    "The council of Laodicea first settled the observance of the
Lord's day [meaning Sunday], and prohibited the keeping of
the Jewish Sabbath under an anathema."—"Dissertation on the
Lord's Day," pages 33, 34.
    This change is admitted by reliable Catholic writers them-
selves, and is set forth as a mark of the church's power. Note
the following: •
    "In reply to a letter of Oct. 28, 1895, to Cardinal Gibbons
asking if the church claimed the change of the Sabbath as her
mark, the folloWing was received: 'Of course the Catholic Church
claims that the change was her act. . . . And the act is
a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious
matters. [Signed] H. F. Thomas, Chancellor for the Cardinal.' "
    "Question.—Have you any other way of proving that the
church has power to institute festivals of precept,"
    "Answer.—Had she not such power, she could not have done
that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could
not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of
the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a
change for which there is no Scriptural authority."—"Doctrinal
Catechism," page 174.
    The Sunday institution, therefore, stands forth as a mark
of the beast.
    3. "The 'time of trouble such as never was,' is soon to open
upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do not now
possess, and which many are too indolent to obtain. It is often
the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality;
but this is not true of the crisis before us. The most vivid
            SABBATT3-SOEtOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  13
presentation can not reach the magnitude of the ordeal. In that
time of trial, every soul must stand for himself before God.
Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the land, 'as I live, saith
the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they
shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.' "
—"Great Controversy," page 622.
    4. "As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed
faith in the third angel's message, but have not been sanctified
through obedience to the truth, abandon their position, and join
the ranks of the opposition. By uniting with the world and
partaking of its spirit, they have come to view matters in nearly
the same light; and when the test is brought, they are prepared
to choose the easy, popular side. Men of talent and pleasing
address, who once rejoiced in the truth, employ their powers to
deceive and mislead souls. They become the most bitter enemies
of their former brethren. When Sabbath-keepers are brought
before courts to answer for their faith, these apostates are the
most efficient agents of Satan to misrepresent and accuse them,
and by false reports and insinuations to stir up the rulers against
them."—Id., page 608.

nant church? Zeph. 2: 1-3; Rev. 3 : 14-21.
                              Notes.
    1. The sealing work here brought to view occurs after the
signs in the sun, moon, and stars which appear as heralds•of the
coming of Christ, and before the rolling together of the heavens
as a scroll. Chronologically, therefore, this work must take place
in the very time in which we live, and constitute a work now
being carried forward in the earth.
    2. The 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7, have the seal of
the living God. The same company is mentioned in Revelation 14.
Here they are said to have the Father's name written in their
foreheads. Evidently the seal of the living God and the Father's
name in these texts mean the same thing.
    3. The work brought to view in Ezekiel 9 is without doubt
prophetic of the sealing work of Revelation 7. The mark, or seal,
is placed in the forehead. It should be noted that to receive the
seal of God as here set forth, means much more than merely to
assent to a theological truth, and outwardly to obey the same.
Only those are sealed that "sigh and that cry for all the
abominations that be done in the midst thereof." This indicates
a deep personal experience, such as can only be wrought by the
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    15

power of the Holy Spirit in the human heart. This should lead
us in the study of this subject to deep personal self-examination,
and renewed consecration.
    4. The use of the seal authenticating documents of impor-
tance dates from ancient times'. Webster defines a seal as follows:
"An instrument, or device; as an engraved metallic plate or stone,
sometimes set in a ring, used for making an impression upon some
tenacious substance, as wax or. wafer, when attached to a parch-
ment or paper, either in attestation of the genuineness of the in-
struments and the deliberation with which it is executed, or to
foster it." See Esther 3:12; 1 Kings 21:8, for Scripture in-
stances of its use.
    5. It is clear from this Gospel prophecy that the law of God
has a seal. A true seal defines who the lawmaking power is, his
right to rule, and the territory over which his dominion extends.
The seal of God's law will, therefore, set forth its Author in the
clearest manner possible.
    6. The Lord calls the Sabbath a sign, or seal. The Sabbath
as the seal of the law is incorporated in the bosom of His law.
The law of God being an expression of the eternal and ever-
lasting righteousness of its Author, and all the commandments
being righteousness, the seal of the law becomes a seal of right-
eousness. In the fourth commandment we have, the name of the
Lawmaker, Jehovah; His title, Creator; and the extent of His
dominion, heaven and earth. This distinguishes the Author of the
Decalogue from all false gods, and sets Him forth as a rightful
lawgiver, and one who is able to save from sin.
    7. The seal of the law is the holy Sabbath, which is the
seventh day, and which God blessed and gave to man in the be-
ginning. The Holy Spirit is the agent by whom the entire law,
including the Sabbath, is written or impressed on our hearts.
2 Cor. 3: 2, 3. Only those who are regenerated and born again
through the Holy Spirit can receive the seal of God in the
forehead.

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    17

exhortations are given in view of the second coming of
Christ ?
                             Notes.
    "One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed
in the Bible is that of Christ's second coming to complete the
great work of fedemption. To God's pilgrim people 'so long left
to sojourn in the 'region and shadow of death,' a precious
joy-inspiring hope is given in the promise of His appearing, who
is the Resurrection and the Life, to 'bring home again His ban-
ished.' The doctrine of the second advent is the very key-note of
the Sacred Scriptures. From the clay when the first pair turned
their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited
the coming of the promised One to break the destroyer's power and
bring them again to the lost Paradise. Holy men of old looked
forward to the advent of the Messiah in glory as the consumma-
tion of their hope. . . .
    "The coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope
of His true followers. The Saviour 's parting promise upon Olivet,
that He would come again, lighted up the future for His dis-
ciples, filling their hearts with joy and hope that sorrow could
not quench, nor trials dim. Amid suffering and persecution,
  the appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ'
was the 'blessed hope.' . . . On rocky Patmos the beloved
disciple hears the promise, Surely, I come quickly,' and his long-
ing response voices the prayer of the church in all her pil-
grimage, 'Even so, come, Lord Jesus.' "—" Great Controversy,"
 pages 299-302.

Matt. 24:48, 49.
  14. What are God's people exhorted to do in this time?
Rom. 13 : 11-14; Luke 12 : 35-40.
                            Notes.

    1. "in those days, after that tribulation." The papal tribu-
lation here mentioned ended in 1798. The persecution, by means
of the influence of the Reformation, ended about 1773. `ilinine-
diately after the tribulation of those days," or May 19, 1780,
the sun was darkened. The sign in the moon occurred the fol-
lowing night; and Nov. 13, 1833, the stars fell from heaven. The
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   19

following historical extracts show the fulfilment of these words
of the Saviour.
                          The Dark Day.
    " DARK DAY, THE.—May 19, 1780; so called on account of a
remarkable darkness on that day, extending over all New England.
In some places persons could not see to read common print in the
open air for several hours together. Birds sang their evening
song, disappeared, and became silent; fowls went to roost; cattle
sought the barn-yard; and candles were lighted in the houses.
The obscuration began about ten o'clock in the morning, and con-
tinued until the middle of the next night, but with differences
of degree and duration in different places. For several days
previous, the wind had been variable, but chiefly from the south-
west and the northeast. The true causes of this remarkable
phenomenon are not known."—" Webster 's Unabridged Diction-
ary," edition of 1884, page 1604.
    " The cocks crew as at daybreak, and everything bore the ap-
pearance and gloom of night. The alarm produced by this un-
usual aspect of the, heavens was very great."—Portsmouth Journal,
May 20, 1843.
                           The Moon.
   "The moon shall not give her light." The following state-
ments show how completely this prediction was fulfilled the night
following the day of the. sun's darkening:
   " The darkness of the following evening was probably as
gross as has ever been obierved since the Almighty fiat gave
birth to light. I could not help conceiving at the time that if
every luminous body in the universe had been shrouded in im-
penetrable darkness, or struck out of existence, the darkness
could not have been more complete. A sheet of white paper held
within a few inches of the eyes, was equally invisible with the
blackest velvet."—Mr. Tenney, of Exeter, N. H., quoted by Mr.
Gage to the "Historical Society of Connecticut."
   "But especially I mention that wonderful darkness on the
19th of May, 1780. Then, as in our text, the sun was darkened;
such a darkness as probably was never known before since the
crucifixion of our Lord. . . . A great part of the follow-
ing night, also, was singularly dark. The moon, though in the
full, gave no light."—From a manuscript sermon by Bev. Elam
Potter, delivered May 28, 1780.
    "My father and mother, who were pious, thought the day of
judgment was near. They sat up that night, during the latter
part of which they said the darkness disappeared, and then
20          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON" QUARTERLY

the sky seemed as usual, but the moon, which was at its full, had
the appearance of blood."—Milo Bostwick.
                              The Stars.
    "Extensive and magnificent showers of shooting stars have
been known to occur at various places in modern, times; but
the most universal and wonderful which has ever been recorded,
is that of the 13th of November, 1833, the whole firmament, over
all the United States, being then, for hours, in fiery commotion.
No celestial phenomenon has ever occurred in this country, since
its first settlement, which was viewed with such intense admira-
tion by one class in the community, or with such dread and alarm
by another. . . . During the three hours of its continuance,
the day of judgment was believed to be only waiting for sunrise."
 —"Oil?' First Century," by B. M. Devens, page 3,29.
    2. A definite message, announcing the coming of the King
and the immediate establishment of the eternal kingdom spoken
of by seers, and looked for by God's people through all ages,
 constitutes one of the surest signs of the end of the world. Just
such a message as this is now being carried to all parts of the
world, and the end is near.
    3. In addition to an increase in the knowledge of the proph-
 ecies as indicated in the text, we may note the increase in general
 knowledge as described in the following extract:
    " To appreciate them [the wonders of this age] let us briefly
contrast the conditions to-day with those of a hundred years
ago. This is no easy task, for the comparison not only involves
 the experiences of two generations, but it is like the juxtaposition
 of a star with the noonday sun, whose superior brilliancy obliter-
ates the lesser light. . . .
     "As we make the backward run of one hundred years, we
 have passed by many mile-stones of progress. Let us see if we
can count some of them as they disappear behind us. We quickly
 lose the telephone, phonograph, and graphophone. We no longer
see the cable-cars or electric railways. The electric lights have
 gone out. The telegraph disappears. The sewing-machine,
 reaper, and thrasher have passed away, and so also have all india-
 rubber goods. We no longer see any photographs, photoengravings,
 photolithographs, or snap-shot cameras. The wonderful oetuple web
 perfecting printing-press, printing, pasting, cutting, folding, and
 counting newspapers at the rate of 96,000 per hour, or 1,600 per
 minute, shrinks at the beginning of the century into an insignifi-
 cant prototype. We lose all planing and wood-working machinery,
 and with it the endless variety of sashes, doors, blinds, and furni-
 ture in unlimited variety. There are no gas engines, no passenger-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        21
elevators, no asphalt pavement, no steam fire-engine, no triple-ex-
pansion steam engine, no Giffard injector, no celluloid articles, no
barbed-wire fences, no time-locks for safes, no self-binding harvest-
ers, no oil or gas wells, no ice machines or cold storage. We lose
air-engines, stem-winding watches, cash-registers and cash-carriers,
the great suspension bridges and tunnels, the Suez Canal, iron-
frame buildings, monitors and heavy ironclads, revolvers, torpedos,
magazine guns and Gatling guns, linotype machines, all prac-
tical typewriters, all Pasteurizing, knowledge of microbes or dis-
ease germs, and sanitary plumbing, water-gas, soda-water foun-
tains, air-brakes, coal-tar dyes and medicines, nitro-glycerine,
dynamite and guncotton, dynamo-electric machines, aluminum
ware, electric locomotives, Bessemer steel with its wonderful
developments, ocean cables, enameled ironware. Welsbach gas-
burners, electric storage batteries, the cigarette machine, hydraulic
dredges, the roller mills, middlings purifiers and patent-process
flour, tin-can machines, car couplings, compressed-air drills,' sleep-
ing-cars, the .dynamite gun, the McKay shoe machine, the circular
knitting-machine, the Jacquard loom, wood pulp for papers, fire
alarms, the use of anesthetics in surgery, oleomargarine, street-
sweepers, Artesian wells, friction matches, steam hammers, electro-
plating, nail machines; false teeth, artificial limbs and eyes, the
spectroscope, the kinetoseope or moving pictures, acetylene gas,
X-ray apparatus, horseless carriages, and—but enough! the reader
exclaims, and, indeed, it is not pleasant to contemplate the loss."

teenth Century."




LESSON V1.11.—The Nature of Man—Life in Christ.

dition, what was done in order to prevent him from
living forever in sin ? Gen. 3 : 22-24.
    4. What was brought into the world by this act of
disobedience ? Rom. 5 : 12.
    5. What is plainly stated to be the result of sin ?
James 1: 15; Eze. 18 : 20.
    6. What has been abolished by Jesus Christ? 2 Tim.
1: 10. What has been brought to light through the Gos-
pel? Same verse.
    7. For what purpose did Jesus saythat He had come ?
John 10 : 10.
    8. What belongs to the Son in common with the Fa-
ther ? John 5 : 26.
    9. In the gift of His Son to the world, what pro-
vision did God make for all the world ? John 3 : 16.
  10. What do those receive who accept the gift of the

fuse this gift? Same verses.
  11. How is this gift received? John 1: 12.
  12. What, then, is obtained by believing on Christ ?
John 20:30, 31.
  13. What will be the consequence of rejecting the
Gospel of Christ ? 2 Thess: 1: 6-9.
  14. How complete will be this destruction ? Mal. 4: 1.
  15. In what brief statement is the teaching of the
Scriptures on this subject expressed? Rom. 6 : 23.
                              Note.
    The purpose of this lesson is to present in a simple manner the
plain statements of the Scriptures concerning the nature of man,
and to make it clear that he is wholly dependent upon the gift of
Christ for life. Sin means death, but Christ is "our life." He
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      23
who does not believe on Christ will perish. "Unless a reader had
been warned beforehand that every man's soul, being destined by
its nature to last forever, and not to die—(being immortal)—he
must therefore not put upon the terms of Christ's discourses any
meaning which will contradict that doctrine of natural immor-
tality,—he would not have dreamed of imposing such a figurative
sense upon them, or of making life eternal stand for happiness,
or perishing stand for endless misery. It is altogether due to for-
eign and unusual considerations if readers have learned to take
such words in an unnatural sense. For life signifies life, and to
live forever signifies to live forever, and to perish signifies not
to live forever, but to lose organized and conscious being. That
is the first and natural meaning of the words."
    Views, not warranted by any proper interpretation of the
Scriptures concerning the nature of man and his condition in
death, not only furnish the foundation for Spiritualism in its many
forms, but also constitute the very backbone of heathenism, and
make unnecessary the general judgment, the resurrection, and the
second coining of Christ. When this far-reaching error has been
corrected, by presenting the truth as it is in Jesus, the fundamental
truth of the Gospel of .Christ has been set forth.



    LESSON IX.—The Nature of Man.—Immortality
                         through Christ.
                      FEBRUARY 29, 1908.
                             Questions.

ROm. 2: 6, 7.
   11. To whom alone does immortality belong? 1 Tim.
1 : 17; John 5 : 26; 1. Tim. 6:13-16.
   12. When will immortality be bestowed? 1 Cor. 15:
51-53.
   13. What will then be swallowed up ? Verses 54, 55.
   14. Through whom is this wonderful victory over
death gained? Verse 57.
   15. Through what agency are life and immortality
brought to light? 2 Tim. 1 : 9, 10.
                             Notes.
    The purpose of this lesson, as compared with the preceding
oue, is to bring forward the teaching of the Scriptures concerning
immortality. There is a distinction to be made between eternal
life and being immortal. He who receives Christ by faith thereby
lays hold upon "that eternal life, which was with the Father,
and was manifested unto us," and so Jesus said, "He that be-
lieveth on Me bath everlasting life" (John 6:47); but that which
is thus acquired by faith is retained only by faith, and may bE
lost by a lapse of faith. After immortality has been put on ai
the second coming of Christ, the eternity of being is fully assured
            SAI313ATH-SCHOOL LRSSON QUARTERLY                   25
This was the purpose in view in the gift of Christ to take upon
Himself humanity.
    "The result of being driven out from the tree of life to Adam
was not merely unhappiness or misery, but death—returning to
dust; hence it is necessary to understand the work of Christ to be
to confer immortality. If mankind already possessed, through
the divine constitution, the attribute of everlasting life, in the
most essential part of their nature, an ever-during soul, it can
not be admitted that in the proper sense of the terms Christ `gives
eternal life,' to the saved. His title as the Life of men must be
understood as applicable to Him only in a vague, metaphorical
sense, as the giver of grace and happiness. But this would. not
correspond to the breadth and depth of Scripture language respect-
ing redemption. `He Himself is our life.' And the body no less
than the soul is said to be saved by Him. Rom. 8:23."—"Life
in Christ," by Edward White.
    It was the evident intention of Jesus "to teach a doctrine that
humbles man in the dust of death, and restricts the everlasting
life to twice-born and believing souls,—a doctrine which rep-
resents the first Adam as 'a man of earth,' and the second Man
as a 'life-giving spirit.' "

21 : 1.

2 Peter 3 : 13 ; Isa. 60 : 21.
                             Notes.
   1. The word here translated "bottomless pit" signifies an
abyss. It is a place or condition of darkness and desolation. It
means a place of chaos, such as the earth was when darkness
was upon the face of the deep, before God cleated light.
    2. The language of this text is very clear and emphatic.
''All that do wickedly," God says, shall in that day which is to
burn "as an oven" be burned up. Anything can not be said
to be burned up so long as it is still burning. God proposes to
burn up sin, and in destroying that He must burn up those who
cling to sin—those who fail to choose Jesus Christ. It should be
observed that this destruction is so complete that Inspiration
says there is neither "root [Satan] nor branch [sinners] left
of sin. In "Early Writings," page 154 we read: "Satan and
his angels suffered long. Satan bore not only the weight and
punishment of his own sins, but also of. the sins of the redeemed
host, which had been placed upon him; and he must also suffer for
the ruin of souls he had caused. Then I saw that Satan and all
the wicked host were consumed, and the justice of God was sat-
isfied. . . . Said the angel, 'Satan is the root, his children are
the branches. They are now consumed root and branch. They
have died an everlasting death. They are never to have a resur-
rection, and God will have a clean universe.' "

   15. How real will be our homes there? Isa. 65 : 21,
22. Note 2.
   .16. What will be the character of the people who dwell
there? Matt. 5: 5; Ps. 37: 11; Rev. 2: 7.
                             Notes.
   1. "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first
heaven and the first earth were passed away." The fire that con-
sumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every trace of the curse is
30          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
swept away. No eternally burning hell will keep before the ran-
somed the fearful consequences of sin.
   "One reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will ever bear
the marks of His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon His
side, His hands and feet, are the only traces of the. cruel work
that sin has wrought. Says the prophet, beholding Christ in His
glory, 'He had bright beams coming out of His side, and there
was the hiding of His power.' That pierced side whence flowed
the crimson stream that reconciled man to God,—there is the
Saviour's glory, there the hiding of His power. 'Mighty to save,'
through the sacrifice of redemption, He was therefore strong to
execute justice upon them that despised God's mercy. And the
tokens of His humiliation are His highest honor; through the
eternal ages the wounds of Calvary will show forth His praise,
and declare His power."—"Great Controversy," pages 673, 674.
    2. "In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called a
country. There the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to fountains
of living waters. The tree of life yields its fruit every month,
and the leaves of the tree are for the service of the nations.
There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal and beside them
waving trees east their shadows upon the paths prepared for
the ransomed of the Lord. There the wide-spreading plains swell
into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God rear their lofty
summits. On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams,
God's people, so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home."
—Id., page 675.

                             Notes.
    1. One writer has described this city as follows: "A city
never built with hands, nor hoary with the years of time; a city
whose inhabitants no census has numbered; a city through whose
streets rushes no tide of business, nor black-robed hearse creeps
slowly with its burden to the tomb; a city without griefs or
graves, without sin or sorrows, without births or burials, without
marriages or mournings; a city which glories in having Jesus
for its King, angels for its guards, saints for citizens; whose
walls are salvation, and whose gates are praise."
    2. "As the ransomed ones are welcomed to the city of God,
there rings out upon the air an exultant cry of adoration. The
two Adams are about to meet. The Son of God is standing with
outstretched arms to receive the father of our race—the being
whom He created, who sinned against his Maker, and for whose
32          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

sin the marks of the crucifixion are borne upon the Saviour's form.
As Adam discerns the prints of the cruel nails, he does not fall
upon the bosom of his Lord, but in humiliation casts himself at
His feet, crying, 'Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain!'
Tenderly the Saviour lifts him up, and bids him look once more
upon the Eden home from which he has so long been exiled. . . .
    "Transported with joy, he beholds the trees that were once
his delight—the very trees whose fruit he himself had gathered
in the days of his innocence and joy. He sees the vines that his
own hands have trained, the very flowers that he once loved to
care for. His mind grasps the reality of the scene; he com-
prehends that this is indeed Eden restored, more lovely now than
when he was banished from it. The Saviour leads him to the
tree of life, and plucks the glorious fruit, and bids him eat. He
looks about him, and beholds a multitude of his family redeemed,
standing in the Paradise of God. Then he casts his glittering
crown at the feet of Jesus, and falling upon His breast, embraces
the Redeemer. He touches the golden harp, and the vaults of
heaven echo the triumphant song, 'Worthy, worthy, worthy is
the Lamb that was slain, and lives again!' The family of Adam
take up the strain, and cast their crowns at the Saviour's feet
as they bow before. Him in adoration." —"Great Controversy,"
pages 647, 648.
    3. "Long have we waited for our Saviour's return. But
none the less sure is the promise. Soon we shall be in our prom-
ised home. There Jesus will lead us beside. the -living stream,
flowing from the throne of God, and will explain to us the dark
providences through which on this earth He brought us in order
to perfect our characters. There we shall behold with undimmed
vision the beauties of Eden restored. Casting at the feet of the
Redeemer the crowns that He has placed on our heads, and touch-
ing our golden harps, we shall fill all heaven with praise to Him
that sitteth on the throne."—Mrs. E. G. White
