     Does not this picture of Bengali Sabbath-keepers appeal to our Sabbath-school students?
There are millions of souls in every land waiting for the truth. Think of them—over 400.000,000
in China; over 300,000,000 in India; over 150,000,000 in Africa; and 150,000,000 more elsewhere

 LESSON I.—The Election by Grace. Eph. 1:1-6.

                  OCTOBER 3, 1908.
                      Questions.
   1. To whom is this epistle addressed? From what
view-point does the author write? By what is he an
apostle? Eph. 1:1.
   2. What is God's will concerning each, of us?
1 Thess. 4: 3.
   3. How is this sanctification wrought in us?• Heb.
13: 20, 21; Phil. 2:13.
   4. Repeat the apostle's salutation. From what
source does this grace and peace come to us? Eph. 1: 2,
   5. How abundantly does the Lord desire to supply
us with grace and peace? 2 Peter 1: 2, 3.
4          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    6. How may this peace become a personal experience?
Rom. 5 : 1 ; 15 :13.
    7. What is the effect of this experience in the heart?
Isa. 32 : 17.
    8. What measure of spiritual blessings have already
been bestowed upon us? Eph.
    9. How abundantly has He proniised to supply our
needs? Phil. 4 : 19 ; Ps. 84 : 11.
   10. What choice has God made for -Us? When was
this choice made? Eph. 1: 4.
   11. What assurance is given us that this choice will
some day be realized by His people? Eph. 5 : 25-27.
  12. Unto what have we been predestinated? Accord-
ing to whose will? Through whom? Eph. 1: 5.
  13. Through what act on our part does this predes-
tination, or election, become a personal experience?
2 Thess. 2 : 13 ; 1 Peter 1: 2. Note 1.
  14. Through whom only are we accepted as children?
Eph. 1: 6. Note 2.
                              Notes.
    1. To predestinate, or foreordain, means to mark out, define
or determine beforehand. God has the one standard character
of holiness, the one ever all-glorious Example, His Son Christ
Jesus, reflecting always all the fulness of the light of His right-
eousness. God also in the beginning chose characters for His
heritage, each character righteous in the righteousness of God,
yet having its own individuality, manifesting one or more of
the many beauties of Him in whom all fulness dwells, even as
each color in the rainbow reveals some of the special beauties of
the light. God chose these characters before the foundation of
the world. The names of those characters were written in the
Lamb's book of life. Rev. 13:8. He has called, and is calling,
to those characters, and His blessing is sufficient for every soul
to meet the call and attain the character to which he is called.

    2. "The word that was - spoken to Jesus at the Jordan, "This
is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,' embraces human-
ity. God spoke to Jesus as our representative. With all our
sins and weaknesses, we are not cast aside as worthless. 'He
bath made us accepted in the Beloved.' The glory that rested
upon Christ is a pledge of the love of God for us. . . . His
love has encircled the earth, and reaches the highest heaven.
The light which fell from the open portals upon the head of
our Saviour will fall upon us as we pray for help to resist temp-
tation. The voice which spoke to Jesus says to every believing
soul, 'This is My beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.' "
 —"Desire of Ages," page 113.

Verse 23.
                             Notes.

    1. "The word 'power,' as used in our English version, is
represented in the Greek Testament by several distinct words.
One of these is kratos, or its' collateral form, which signifies
strength, or the manifestation of physical force. The two chief
forms, however, are exousia and dunamis. The first of these
indicates authority as exercised or conferred by a ruler, and
seems to intimate official privilege or prerogative; thus: 'All
power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth; "to them gave
He power to become the sons of God;' and Christ gave to His
disciples 'power over unclean spirits, and to heal all manner
of sickness.' Their official prerogatives and their miraculous en-
dowments are in all cases expressed by the word exousia, though
in a few cases dunamis is joined with it. Ministerial power is
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        7

everywhere -expressed by the word dunamis, as in St. Luke:
 Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with
power from on high.' "—Simpson's "Lectures on Preaching,"
page 199.
    2. "If we endeavor to analyze the elements of this power in
itself, I think we shall fail. It is spiritual and invisible. All
we can do is to trace the circumstances under which this power
is given, and the results which flow from it. Indeed, power is
in its nature indescribable. It is known simply by its results.
Gravitation, that greatest of all material powers, ceaselessly ac-
tive, everywhere potent, is wholly beyond our research, or even
our conception. Where are those cords, stronger, than steel,
which bind the planets to their centers'? Where are those unseen
ties that, like a universal net-work, envelop every atom in the
air, and make it fall to the earth, and not merely to the earth,
but in a direct line toward the center of the earth, though it be
thousands of miles away, and can never be reached'? It seems
an emblem of God, filling all space,, operating through all matter.
If the dream of astronomers be true, that not only secondaries
surround their planets, and planets their suns, but that suns
revolve around the center of immense systems, and all these
centers through the immensity of space move around one great
center, who can even conceive the magnitude of a force that can
thus operate through infinite space with precisely the same law
of attraction for vast worlds and for infinitesimal atoms/ It
is a force never seen, and yet it operates alike in the sunshine
and in the dark. It is never heard, and yet it sends its myriads
of worlds singing and shining on their way. He who made that
power by the word of His Spirit gives that Spirit to work in
us and through us. Nor is it the only exhibition of power.
Consider the chemical affinity that draws together the acids and
the alkalies. With what constant and unseen power does it
operate! Think of that magnetic power which makes the steel
filings, though in a mass of dust and rubbish, and clippings of
tin and brass, leave them all and fly up and kiss the magnet.
It touches that pivoted needle, and lives and treasure are secure
Upon the stormy ocean in the darkest night by its unerring guid-
ance. The winds blow ever so fiercely, the cold comes ever so
freezingly, the waves roll ever so ,furiously, and the vessel pitches
and sinks as though it would be submerged; and yet that strange
influence, unseen, unheeded, unfelt even by the most sensitive
nerves, holds the needle in its place. Who can tell what is power/
We see. it in its effects, we measure it in its results. So with
spiritual power. We can not tell whence it cometh, or whither
8          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

it goeth; ' but it breathes upon the human spirit—the stormy
passions subside; falsehood, fraud, lust, and avarice disappear;
and truth, purity, meekness, and love reign supreme in the soul.
It is a transmutation beyond what the philosopher sought in the
fabled stone whose touch would transmute into gold. It is a new
creation from the breath of Him who created all worlds and
breathed into all spirits. Spiritual power is not beauty of pres-
ence nor dignity of form. It is not learning, nor rhetoric, nor
logic, nor oratory; but it can use these for its one great end.
It can burn and shine in the highest periods of the most eloquent
speaker, and it can thrill in the accents of the unlettered man.
It can invest the words that drop from the mother's lips, and it
can wing the lispings of the little child. It can use all there is
of a human being, and of his acquirements, for the glory of God
and for the advancement of His church."—Id., pages 202404.
. 3. "Satan can not hold the dead in his grasp when the Soii
of God bids them live. He can not hold in 'spiritual death one
soul who in faith receives Christ's word of power. God is say-
ing to all who are dead in sin, 'Awake, thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead.' That word is eternal life. As the word
of God which bade the first man live still gives us life; as
Christ's word, 'Young man, I say unto thee, Arise,' gave life
to the youth of Nain, so that word, Arise from the dead,'
is life to the soul that receives it. . . . It is all offered
to us in His word.. If we receive the word we have the deliver-
ance."—"Desire of Ages," page 320. •



     LESSON 111.—Out of Darkness into Light.
                 Eph. 2: 1-13.

                     OCTOBER 17, 1908.

                           Questions.

    2. From what are those alienated 'who are dead in
trespasses and sins? Eph. 4 : 18.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      9•
    3. According to what did we then walk? Accord-
ing to whom? In whom does this evil spirit especially
work? Eph. 2 : 2.
    4. How many of us formerly had our conversation
(citizenship) among the children of disobedience? What
desires were then followed? What were we then by
nature? Verse 3.
    5. What has God's mercy accomplished for us?
What moved the Lord in our behalf? When did He
act? By what are we saved? Verses 4, 5.
    6. With whom are we made alive? Where are we
made to sit? Verse 6.
    7. What is to be revealed? When? Through whom?
Verse 7. Note 1.
    8. By what are we saved? Through what? From
whom does this salvation not come? Through whom
does it come? Verses 8, 9. Note 2.
    9. Whose workmanship are we? Unto what have
we been created? What has God ordained? Verse 10.
Compare 2 Cor. 5: 17.
   10. How are we exhorted to walk? Col. 1: 9, 10.
   11. What were these believers once? What were they
called? Eph. 2 : 11.
   12. What was their condition at that time? Verse 12.
   13. Through whom are those having no hope brought

                             Notes.
   1. The redeemed saints alone will possess the requisite quali-
fication for acting the part of messengers or heralds in making
known the story of Redemption to the principalities and powers
10         SABBATH-SCHOOL , LESSON QUARTERLY

in all the heavenly places—unfallen worlds. Being themselves the
monuments of grace, having on the blood-washed garments of
salvation, and bearing in their very persons the marks of the
grace of God, having learned by experience the wondrous depths
of redeeming love and grace, they will be able to speak of salva-
tion and make known "the exceeding riches of His grace," as
neither sinless angels nor unfallen beings can do.
    2. Jesus when on earth said, "The Son can do nothing of
Himself." This expresses man's condition without God. He
is helpless. He has no strength. By nature be is carnal, sold
under sin. His resolutions to do good are like ropes of sand:
The good we will to do is left undone, and the things we hate
we do. But through faith there is help for every tempted soul.
    "Jesus says, 'What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,
                                                   .' There is a
believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them
condition to this promise—that we pray according to the will of
God. But it is the will of God to cleanse us from sin, to make
us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life. So we may
ask for these blessings and believe that we receive them, and thank
God that we have received them. It is our privilege to go to
Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law without shame
or remorse. There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit.'
    "Henceforth you are not your own; you are bought with a
price. 'Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver
and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ, as of
a lamb without blemish and without spot.' Through this simple
act of believing God, the Holy Spirit has begotten a new life
in your heart. You are now as a child born into the family of
God, and He loves you as He loves His Son. "—"Steps to Christ,"
 pages 62, 63.


     LESSON IV.—The At-one-ment. Eph. 2: 14-18.
                      OCTOBER 24, 1908.

                           Questions.

   1. What does Christ become to the believer? What
has been broken down? Eph. 2 : 14. Note 1.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY • 11

   2. What was abolished in His flesh? Why has Christ
done this? What did He thus make? Verse 15.
Note 2.
   3. What was necessary on the part of Christ to
accomplish this object? Philp : 5-8. Note 3.
    4. Whose flesh did He take? Heb. 2 : 14.
    5. In how many things was He tempted? Heb. 4: 15.
    6. Why was 'He made like His brethren? Heb. 2: 17.
    7. What invitation is therefore given to His "breth-
ren"? Heb. 4 : 16.
    8. Who thus became reconciled to God? Through
what means? Eph. 2 : 16. Note 4.
    9. To whom did He preach peace? Verse 17.
  10. Through Him what do all classes have? Verse
18 ; Rom. 10 : 11-13.
  11. How is this union of Christ and the repentant
sinner expressed in the opening sentence of the Lord's
Prayer? Matt. 6 : 9. Note 5.
                            Notes.
   1. Christ not only gave Himself for us, but He gave Himself
to us. He became one of us. In order for His name to be
"Jesus"—Saviour, He must be "Immanuel"—God with us.
   2. The minding of the flesh is enmity against God. It is not
possible for those in the flesh to please God. Sin is that which
separates us from God, whether Jew or Gentile. Jesus abolished
sin by becoming sin and dying to sin. By faith we accept His
crucifixion for ours, and His life of righteousness for our life
of sin.
   3. "Into the world where Satan claimed dominion God per-
mitted His Son to come, a helpless babe, subject to the weakness
of humanity. He permitted Him to meet life's peril in common
with every human soul, to fight the battle as every child of hu-
manity must fight it, at the risk of failure and eternal loss."
 —"Desire of Ages," page 49.
12         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   "Many claim that it was impossible for Christ to be over-
come by temptation. Then He could not have been placed in
Adam's position; He could not have gained the victory that
Adam failed to gain. If we have in any sense a more trying
conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to succor us.
But our Saviour took humanity, with all its liabilities. He took
the nature of man, with the possibility of yielding to temptation." '
—Id., page 117.
    4. "It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separa-
tion between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely
united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our
nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that
is never to be broken."—Id., page 25.
    5. "Through the eternal ages He [Christ] is linked with
us. 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.'
He gave Him not only to bear our sins and to die as our sac-
rifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His
immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son
to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human
nature. . . . In Christ the family of earth and the family
of heaven arc bound together."—Id., page 25.

ship takes place? What are we no longer? Eph. 19.
   2. Under what other figure is this change of rela-
tionship noticed in the Bible? Rom. 7: 4.

this wnrld? Note 1.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  13
    4. How is this change of name and family relation-
ship beautifully expressed by the prophet? Hosea

    5. Upon what foundation does this new household
rest? Eph. 2:20; 1 Cor. 3:11.
    6. Who is the chief corner-stone? Isa. 28: 16; Ps.
118:22.
    7. What kind or a stone is He declared to be?
1 Peter 2:4.
    8. What material composes this temple? 1 Peter
2: 5; Zech. 6:15. Note 2.
    9. What is the process by which this building is to
become "an holy temple in the Lord"? Eph. 2:21.
   10.- Who serves as Master-builder? Where was -He
to grow up? Zech. 6: 12, 13.
   11. What was He to bear? What counsel is between
the. Father and the Son? Upon whose throne was
Christ to sit and rule during His priesthood? Zech.
6: 13; Heb. 10: 12, 13.
  .12. How long must He remain upon the throne of
His Father? 1 Cor. 15: 24-26.
   13. For what purpose are we builded together? Eph.
2:22. Note 3.
                            Notes.

   1. The children of two families are recognized in the Bible
as "children of Belial" (Judges 20:13), "children of transgres-
sion" (Isa. 57:4), "children of the Lord" (Dent. 14:1), "chil-
dren of wrath" (Eph. 2:3), "sons of God" (1 John 3:1) •'
"children of iniquity," of "disobedience" '.(2 Sam. 3:34; Eph.
2:2), and "obedient children" (1 Peter 1:14; Rom. 15:18);
"children of darkness" .(Eph. 5:8), and "children of light"
-14           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 (1 Thess. 5:5) ; "children of the wicked one" (Matt. 13:38),
and "children of God" (Luke 20:36; Rom. 8:16); "children of
this world" (Luke 16:8), and "children of the kingdom"
 (Matt. 8:12); "children of the flesh" (Rom. 9:8), and ' , chil-
dren of the promise" (Gal. 4:28). Of the unbelieving Jews,
Christ said, "Ye are of your father, the devil" (John 8:44);
but, praise God, the children of evil may through Jesus Christ
become the sons and daughters of God (2 Cor. 6:14-18; John
1:12).
    2. In the building of Solomon's temple every stone was
prepared for its place in the building before it was brought to
the place, so that beautiful temple came together without the
sound of an ax or hammer upon it. The living stones for this
living temple, taken from the rough quarry of sin, are hewed,
squared, fitted, and polished, each for its particular place in the
temple of the Lord. Unlike the stones of Solomon's temple,
which had to be conveyed to the spot, of these living stones it is
said, "They that are afar off shall come and build in the temple
of the Lord." See Zech. 6:12, 13.
    3. "Christ has made every provision that His church shall be
a transformed body, illumined with the Light of the world, pos-
sessing the glory of Immanuel. It is His purpose that every
Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual atmosphere of light
and peace. He desires that we shall reveal His own joy in our
lives."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 419.




       LESSON VI.—The Mystery of the Gospel.
            •     Eph. 3: 1-13.

                              Notes.

    1. Paul as a steward of God was entrusted with the Gospel
of the grace of God. This he was to dispense to the people.
    2. The Gospel was made known to the apostle Paul by 'reve-
lation." We may understand in theory the sublime themes of
the Gospel, but when we yield wholly to God His Spirit will re-
veal to the soul the great and profound truths of His word.
    3. Jesus died that the universe of intelligent beings might
have a full and true knowledge of God in all the glorious per-
fection of His character. But it would have been in vain that
Christ died on Calvary, so far as the inhabitants of other worlds
are concerned, if the story of the Cross should never be pub-
lished or made known among them. And this is to be "made
known by ["through," A.R.V.] the church." The redeemed are
to be the mediums through whom the wonderful and manifold
wisdom of God is to be made known.
    4. "Christ is acquainted with all that is misunderstood and
misrepresented by men. His children can afford to wait in calm
patience and trust, no matter how much maligned and despised;
for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, and those
who honor God shall be honored by Him in the presence of men
and angels. .
    "In every age, God's chosen messengers have been reviled
and persecuted; yet through their very affliction, the knowledge
of God has been spread abroad. Every disciple of Christ is to
step into the ranks, and carry forward the same work, knowing
that its foes- can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
God means that truth shall be brought to the front, and become
a subject of examination and discussion, even through the con-
tempt placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated;
every controversy, every reproach, every effort to restrict liberty
of conscience, is God's means of awakening minds that otherwise
might slumber."—"Mount of Blessing," pages 50, 51.

LESSON V11.—An Inspired Prayer. Eph. 3:14-21.

                       Questions.

    1. What feelings inspired the heart of the apostle

    3. What is the measure of spiritual blessing desired

apostle desire that they might be strengthened?
Verse 16.
    4. How much strength has the Christian a right to
claim by faith? Col. 1 : 11.

this prayer, desire that we should comprehend? Why
does He desire us to know the love of God? What does
He say of this love? Verses 18, 19.

    8. What does Christ declare of Himself 7 Rev. 1:
8, 11. Compare Col. 1: 17, 18.
    9. What is the measure of His ability to answer

18         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY,

  10. What description of praise is offered to God? Can
you join in the response? Eph. 3 : 21. Note 2.
  11. What universal chorus of praise did the revelator
hear? Rev. 5 : 13 ; 19 : 1, 6, 7.
                              Notes.

    1. Verses 2 to 13 of chapter three are really parenthetical.
In this lesson the apostle directly resumes the subject which be
introduced in verse 1.
    2. "But the plan of Redemption had a yet broader and deeper
purpose than the salvation of man. It was not for this alone
that Christ came to the earth; it was not merely that the inhabi-
tants of this little world might regard the law of God as it should
he regarded; but it was to vindicate the character of God before
the universe. To this result of His great sacrifice—its influence
upon the intelligences of other worlds, as well as upon man—the
Saviour looked forward when just before His crucifixion He said:
`Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
will draw all men unto Me.' "
    "Christ undertook to redeem man and to rescue the world
from the grasp of Satan. The great controversy begun in heaven
was to be decided in the very world, on the very same field, that
Satan claimed as his. It was the marvel of all the universe that
Christ should humble Himself to save fallen man. That He who
had passed from star to star, from world to world, superintending
all, by His providence supplying the needs of every order of
being in His vast creation—that He should consent to leave His
glory and take upon Himself human nature was a mystery which
the sinless intelligences of other worlds desired to understand.
When Christ came to our world in the form of humanity, all
were intensely interested in following Him as He traversed, step
by step, the blood-stained path from the manger to Calvary.
Heaven marked the insult and mockery that He received, and
knew that it was at Satan's instigation. They marked the work
of counter-agencies going forward; Satan constantly pressing
darkness, sorrow, and suffering upon the race, and Christ counter-
acting it. They watched the battle between light and darkness
as it waxed stronger. And as Christ in His expiring agony upon
the cross cried out, 'It is finished!' a shout of triumph rang
through every world, and through heaven itself. The great con-
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     19

 test that had been so long • in progress in this world was now
 decided, and Christ was Conqueror. His death had answered the
question whether the Father and the Son had sufficient love for
man to exercise self-denial and a spirit of sacrifice. Satan had
revealed his true character as a liar and a murderer. It was seen
that the very same spirit with which he had ruled the children
of men who were under his power, he would have manifested if
permitted to control the intelligences of heaven. With one voice
the loyal universe united in extolling the divine administration."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 74 to 76.
    "All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study
of God's redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their
tireless flight to worlds afar—worlds that thrilled with sorrow at
the spectacle of human woe, and rang with the songs of gladness
at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With unutterable delight the
children of earth enter into the,joy and the wisdom of unfallen
beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and understanding
gained through ages upon ages in contemplation of God's handi-
work. With undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of Crea-
tion—suns and stars and systdms, all in their appointed order cir-
cling the throne of Deity. Upon all things, from the least to the
greatest, the Creator's name is written, and in all are the riches
of His power displayed."—"Great Controversy," pages 677, 678.




     LESSON 17111.—The Unity of the Church.
                 Eph. 4: 1-13. .

norant concerning spiritual gifts? 1 Cor. 1.: 6-8.
                             Notes.
   1. As a convict in a Roman prison, the apostle penned the
glorious Gospel message contained in this wonderful epistle. As
a prisoner upon the lonely, barren Isle of Patmosi the beloved
apostle, wrapped in the vision of God's glory, was permitted to
kand down to us the glorious panoramic view contained in the
book of Revelation. Thus the efforts of men, inspired by the
spirit of the dragon, to hinder the work of the Gospel, have been
so overruled that they have turned out gloriously to the further-
ance of God's work. Surely, as the apostle states it, "We can
do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    21
   2. The margin of this verse reads, " or a multitude of cap-
tives." In Matt. 27:52, 53 we are told that when Jesus arose
from the dead, the "graves were opened; and many bodies of
the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after
His resurrection, and went into the ,holy city, and appeared unto
many." In Rev. 4:4, 10, 11; 5:8-10, some of this same com-
pany are seen. The "multitude of captives," therefore, are those
who were resurrected when Jesus came forth from the grave.
They ascended with Him as trophies of His victory.

                              Notes.

   1. Note the "wherefore" in verse 25. If the "old man with
his deeds" has been put off, and the "new man" has been put
on, then the fruits of godliness will surely follow.
   2. " The difficulties we have to encounter may be very much
lessened by that meekness which hides itself in Christ. If we
possess the humility of our Master, we shall rise above the slights,
the rebuffs, the annoyances to which we are daily exposed, and
they will cease to cast a gloom over the spirit. The highest
evidence of nobility in a Christian is self-control."—"Desire of
Ages," page 801.

 FOREIGN MISSION SEMINARY

           ND this gospel of the kingdom shall
            be preached in all the world for a
            witness unto all nations; and then
   shall the end come."
      Realizing that the fulfilment of this proph-
   ecy rests to a great extent in the hands of
   those devoted workers who leave home,
   friends, and native land to carry the gospel,
   the General Conference Council at Gland,
   Switzerland, decided to make the College at
   Washington, D. C., a Special Training School
   for missionaries. To this end the Washing-
   ton Foreign Mission Seminary is now estab-
   lished at Takoma Park with the definite pur-
   pose of giving volunteer missionaries a spe-
   cial preparation for their difficult fields. All
   phases of mission life are given due attention.
   The geographical, physical, moral, and relig-
   ious conditions under which the missionary
   will be placed are carefully studied with ref-
   erence to each individual. For detailed in-
   formation address H. R. Salisbury, Pres.
   Foreign Mission Seminary, Takoma Park,
   Washington, D. C.

THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR
THIS splendid little paper occupies the same place in
        relation to our young people that the Review holds
with the older ones.
(Ji It is becoming more and more evident that the burden
of the work in giving the message is to rest on the young
people of this denomination.
q How necessary, then, that they should have the best of
instruction and guidance in their preparation for the work.
q The Instructor is designed to fill this place and should
be found in the home of every sabbath-keeper.
q Eight pages, published weekly.

        OT one family of English-speaking Sev-
         enth-day Adventists in the world can
         afford to miss the weekly visit of this
         our church paper.
   How can we keep in touch with the rapid
march of the message through every kindred,
nation, tongue, and people unless we have the
weekly reports from our workers "on the firing-
line"?             •
   It means much now to "keep pace with the
message." One has to run, at times, so rapid
is the development of our work in foreign
fields.
   The "good old Review" not only keeps us
posted on the progress of the work, but it
contains in every issue articles wonderfully
instructive and helpful in the upbuilding of a
perfect Christian character.
   Twenty-four pages, weekly.
