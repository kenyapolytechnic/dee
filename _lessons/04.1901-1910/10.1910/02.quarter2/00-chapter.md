Recommendations on Sabbath-School Work Passed by the
    General Conference, May 13 to June 6, 1909.

    1. Whereas, The Sabbath School Worker is a molding factor
in our Sabbath-schools, and it is the medium whereby Sabbath-
school laborers are kept in touch with progressive methods; there-
fore,
    We _Recommend, That earnest efforts be made to place this
journal in the hands of every officer and teacher in our Sabbath-
schools.
              Sabbath-School Home Department.
    2. Whereas, The Home Department of the Sabbath-school has
been established to meet the needs of our people who are isolated
from those of like precious faith, as well as those whom circum-
stances prevent from attending the local school; therefore,
    We Recommend:
    (a) That the conference workers be urged to cooperate with
our secretaries by strengthening this work by securing the names
and addresses of all isolated Sabbath-keepers within their ter-
ritory, that they may be brought in touch with the progress of
the message.
    (b) That we urge the carrying forward of this work more
fully in our local schools, thus bringing the vitalizing power of
the Sabbath-school lessons to the whole denomination:
           Sabbath-School Offerings to Missions.
    3. Whereas, Our Sabbath-schools need the blessed inspiration
of a real burden for mission fields, while opportunities to spread
the message in foreign lands are multiplying faster than their
means; therefore,
    We _Recommend, That our Sabbath-schools give all their do-
nations to missions, providing for their expenses in some other
way; and, further,
    We Recommend, That each conference pay the entire expenses
of the Sabbath-school departmental work without drawing upon
the Sabbath-school offerings given by the schools for missions.

LIFE OF CHRIST
LESSON I.—The Prodigal Son; The Unjust Steward.
                        APRIL 2, 1910.

    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 15:11 to 16:18.
    LESSON HELPS: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 198-211,
366-375; Sabbath School Worker.
    PLACE: Jesus was doubtless in Perea, the country east of the
Jordan, when He gave the people much of the instruction covered
in this series of lessons. The so-called "Perean ministry" is
probably covered by Mark 10; Matt. 19:1 to 21:1; and Luke
9:51 to 19:28. During this time "He steadfastly set His face
to go to Jerusalem" (Luke 9:51), but He came to the "coasts
of Judea beyond Jordan" (Matt. 19:1; Mark 10:1). "A. con-
siderable part of the closing months of Christ's ministry was spent
in Perea, the province on 'the farther side of Jordan' from Judea.
Here the multitude thronged His steps, as in His early ministry in
Galilee, and much of His former teaching was repeated."—"De-
sire of Ages," page 488.

                               Notes.
     1. According to Jewish law, the elder son would receive a
'double and the younger a single portion of the father's
 property at his death. Deut. 21:17. "The latter then desired
 that his father, anticipating the division, should give him the
 equivalent of his portion in money, an arrangement in virtue of
 which the entire domain, on the father's death, would come to
 the elder."— Godet.
     Unappreciative of his father's love, and restive under home
 discipline, he ungratefully requests his inheritance. What is the
 spiritual significance? "It is the expression of man's desire
 to be independent of God, to be a god to himself (Gen. 3:5),
 and to lay out his life according to his own will and for his own
 pleasure. It is man growing weary of living upon God and
 upon His fulness, and desiring to take the ordering of his life
 into his own hands, and believing that he can be a fountain of
 blessedness to himself. All the subsequent sins of the younger
 son are included in this one, as in their germ,— are but the
 unfolding of this the sin of sins."— Trench.
     2. The boasted freedom of sin soon becomes abject slavery.
 The promises of sin vanish like the marvelous pictures on a
 soap-bubble. Following the fulness of sin comes the famine
 of soul. A life of sin is a wasted life: "Whatever the ap-
 pearance may be, every life centered in self is squandered. Who-
 ever attempts to live apart from God, is wasting his substance.
 He is squandering the precious years, squandering the powers of
 mind and heart and soul, and working to make himself bankrupt
 for eternity."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 200, 201.
     3. The one who goes away from God is not in his right mind.
 The prodigal "came to himself," he came to see his serious mis-
  take, and that his father's plan for him was best. He resolved
  to return. How the devil fights the making of this first reso-
 lution! The downward road is strewn with failures to resolve
 in the strength of the Lord, and broken resolutions.
      4. The great sin of the younger son was scorn of his father's
  love. The elder brother was actuated by the same spirit, though
  manifested in a different way. He vas self-righteous and was
  working -for the benefits that would accrue to him. He ' misin-
8           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

terpreted his father's love, and was hard-hearted toward his
brother. The father does not give him merited rebuke, but
tenderly pleads with him, to show him his error.
    5. "If Christians were as sagacious and persevering in using
wealth to promote their welfare in the next world, as worldly
men are in using it to promote their interests here, the kingdom
of God would be more flourishing than it is. . . . It should
be noticed that the steward provides for his future by means of
goods which are not his own, but are merely entrusted to his care.
The wealth out of which the Christian lays up treasure in heaven,
is in like manner not his own, but is held in trust."—"Interna-
tional Critical Commentary," pages 380, 381.
    6. " 'Make to yourselves friends by means f of the mammon
of unrighteousness,' Christ says, 'that when it shall fail, they
may receive you into the eternal tabernacles' [R. V.]. God and
Christ and angels are all ministering to the afflicted, the suffer-
ing, and the sinful. Give yourself to God for this work, use His
gifts for this purpose, and you enter into partnership with
heavenly beings. Your heart will throb in sympathy with theirs..
You will be assimilated to them in character. To you these
dwellers in the eternal tabernacles will not be strangers. When
earthly things shall have passed away, the watchers at heaven's
gates will bid you welcome."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
page 373.
    And these gifts may be "of money, of knowledge, of strength,
or opportunities, which to many have and to all may so easily
become that 'of unrighteousness.' "

                 FORGIVE-NESS AND FAITH.
    10. Against what grievous mistake were the dis-
ciples warned? Luke 17: 1, 2. Note 7.
    11. What should be our attitude toward others at

6: 1; Matt. 6:14, 15.
    12. What instruction was given concerning faith?.
Luke 17 : 5, 6; Matt. 17 : 20.
    13. How did the Lord illustrate the way in which
we should regard our service for Him? Luke 17 : 7-10.
                          Notes.
   1. "Of the three terms in common use among the Jews to
express the future state of blessedness-(1) the Garden of Eden,
or Paradise; (2) the Throne of Glory; (3) the Bosom of Abra-
10          SASS/MI-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

ham — this was the most widely popular. It rested on the idea
of a great feast, in which Abraham was the host. To lie in his
bosom, as St. John in that of our Lord (John 13:23), was to
be there as the most favored guest. And this was the position
which was assigned to the beggar, obviously not merely as a
compensation for the 'evil things' he had endured on earth, but
as the crown of the faith and patience with which he had borne
them."—Plumptre.
    2. The "good things" the rich man had chosen as his were
the pleasures of sense, casting aside all responsibility for his
fellow men.
    3. "In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Christ shows
that in this life men decide their eternal destiny. During proba-
tionary time the grace of God is offered to every soul. But if
men waste their opportunities in self-pleasing, they cut them-
selves off from everlasting life. No after-probation will be granted
them. By their own choice they have fixed an impassable gulf
between them and their God."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
page 260.
    4. There is in this request an implied claim that he had not
been fully warned of the results of his course of life.
    5. "And what may be called the epilogue of this parable con-
tains a lesson more solemn still; namely, that the means of grace
which God's mercy accords to every living soul are ample for
its enlightenment and deliverance; that if these be neglected,
no miracle will be wrought to startle the absorbed soul from its
worldly interests."— Farrar's "Life of Christ," chapter 44.
    6. Great care should be exercised not to strain the interpre-
tation of the parables by endeavoring to make some application
to every detail. "In this parable Christ was meeting the people
on their own ground. The doctrine of a conscious state of ex-
istence between death and the resurrection was held by many of
those who were listening to Christ's words. The Saviour knew
of their ideas, and He framed His parable so as to inculcate im-
portant truths through these preconceived opinions. He held up
before His hearers a mirror wherein they might see themselves in
their true relation to God. He used the prevailing opinion to
convey the idea He wished to make prominent to all,— that no
man is valued for his possessions; for all he has belongs to him
only as lent by the Lord. A misuse of these gifts will place him
below the poorest and most afflicted man who loves God and
trusts in Him."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 265.
    7. "Cause one of these little ones to stumble." R.V. Not
only are we responsible for the salvation or loss of our own souls,
but ..for the influence we exert on others. "Let us remember
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   11
that a Christlike life is the most powerful argument that can
be advanced in favor of Christianity, and that a cheap Christian
character works more harm in the world than the character of a
worldling."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 01.

   17. After this, where did Jesus go? Verse 54.
                               Notes.
   1. " 'Are there not twelve hours in the day?' I am under the
guidance of My Father; as long as I do His will, My life is
safe. My twelve hours of day are not yet ended. I have entered
upon the last remnant of My day; but while any of this remains,
I am safe."—"Desire of Ages," page 527.
    2. "In Christ is life, original, unborrowed, underived. 'He
that hath the Son hath life.' The divinity of Christ is the be-
liever's assurance of eternal life. 'He that believeth in Me,'
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      13
said Jesus, 'though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever
liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?'
Christ here looks forward to the time of His second coming.
Then the righteous dead shall be raised incorruptible, and the
living righteous shall be translated to heaven without seeing death.
The miracle which Christ was about to perform, in raising Lazarus
from the dead, would represent the resurrection of all the righteous
dead. By His word and His works He declared Himself the
Author of the resurrection. He who Himself was soon to die
upon the cross, stood with the keys of death, a conqueror of
the grave, and asserted His right and power to give eternal life."
"Desire of Ages," page M:8...530
     3. Jesus' heart was touched with sympathy for the sorrowing
sisters. He also wept for the unbelieving Jews, some of whom
 even then were casting reflections upon His claims. Verse 37.
 Yet it was not merely on account of the present circumstances
 that He wept. "The weight of the grief of ages was upon Him.
 He saw the terrible effects of the transgression of God's law.
 He saw that in the history of the world, beginning with the death
 of Abel, the conflict between good and evil had been unceasing.
 Looking down the years to come, He saw the suffering and sorrow,
 tears and death, that were to be the lot of men. His heart was
 pierced with the pain of the human family of all ages and in
 all lands. The woes of the sinful race were heavy upon His
 soul, and the fountain of His tears was broken up as He longed
 to relieve all their distress."—"Desire of Ages," page 584.
     4. "In declaring that one man should die for the nation,
 Caiaphas indicated that he had some knowledge of the prophecies,
 although it was very limited. But John, in his account of this
 scene, takes up the prophecy, and shows its broad and deep sig-
  nificance. . . . On the lips of Caiaphas this most precious
  truth was turned into a lie. The policy he advocated was based
  on a principle borrowed from heathenism. Among the heathen,
  the dim consciousness that one was to die for the human race,
  had led to the offering of human sacrifices. So Caiaphas proposed
  by the sacrifice of Jesus to save'the guilty nation, not from trans-
  gression, but in transgression, that they might continue in sin.
  And by his reasoning he thought to silence the remonstrances of
  those who might dare to say that as yet nothing worthy of death
  had been found in Jesus."—"Desire of Ages," page 540.

     18. With what solemn question does our Lord close

                               Notes.
   1. The Jews were looking for a temporal kingdom to be set
up. But Jesus declared to them that "the kingdom of God eometh
not with outward show" (margin) ; that the beginning of it
was in the individual heart, and they should not look for its
coming in the manifestations of earthly power. He said, "My
kingdom is not of this world; " but the world-loving Jews and
a world-loving chureh to-day would have it so. "To-day iu the
religious world there are multitudes who, as they believe, are
working for the establishment of the kingdom of Christ as an
earthly and temporal dominion. They desire to make our Lord
the ruler of the kingdoms of this world, the ruler in its courts and
camps, its legislative halls, its palaces and market-places. They
expect Him to rule through legal enactments, enforced by human
authority. Since Christ is not now here in person, they them-
selves will undertake to act in His stead, to execute the laws of
His kingdom."—"Destire of Ages," page 509.
16         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. How slow is the comprehension of the human spirit! Blinded
by preconceived opinion and Jewish prejudices, not even Jesus'
disciples fully appreciated His character and mission. After
the wonderful events of Christ's death, resurrection, and ascen-
sion, and after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, they realized
what a wonderful privilege had been theirs, and they longed for
His personal presence again.
    3. Just as in His great prophecy, recorded in Matthew 24,
Jesus seems here to blend the two great crises, the destruction
of Jerusalem and His second coming. Compare Matt. 24:17;
Mark 13:15.
    "Remember Lot's wife." When Lot and his family were
escaping from the doomed city, the solemn command was given to
hasten, for the fiery storm would be delayed but little longer.
But one of the fugitives ventured to cast a look backward to
the doomed city, and she became a monument of God's judgment.
If Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the angel's
warning, but had earnestly fled toward the mountains, without
one word of pleading or remonstrance, his wife also would have
made her escape. The influence of his example would have saved
her from the sin that sealed her doom. But his hesitancy and
delay caused her to lightly regard the divine warning. While
her body was upon the plain, her heart clung to Sodom, and she
perished with it. She rebelled against God because His judg-
ments involved her possessions and her children in the ruin.
Although so greatly favored in being called out from the wicked
city, she felt that she was severely dealt with, because the wealth
that it had taken years to accumulate must be left to destruc-
tion. Instead of thankfully accepting deliverance, she presump-
tuously looked back to desire the life of those who had rejected
the divine warning. Her sin showed her to be unworthy of life,
for the preservation of which she felt so little gratitude."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 161, 162.
    4. The judge is a very striking character. He is worse than
a hypocrite. He is godless, and does not even care for public
opinion. The helpless widow was seeking for justice. The word
translated "avenge" means "to vindicate one's right," "to
protect or defend one from another."
    5. The setting chosen for this parable is a very strong one.
God is not compared to the unjust judge, but contrasted with
him. If this hard-hearted, wicked judge, who cared only for
himself, would grant the request of the widow because of her
perseverance, how much more will God our Father, who is holy,
and who is pleased with the importunity of His children, answer
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     17
when they call upon Him. Again, the widow was probably a
stranger to the judge, had no promises from him, and could have
access to him only at stated times, and then against his will;
while God's elect are His beloved children in whom He delights.
They have many precious promises from Him, and are urgently
requested to come to Him at all times.
    6. " (1) Not because God is unwilling to bestow good things,
or must be overpersuaded; for He is more ready to give than
we are to ask. (2) It is to cherish and cultivate our faith, bring-
ing us into closer relations to God. (3) It is to make us fit to
receive, to intensify our desire and appreciation of the things
God would bestow."— Pelottbet's Notes.
    "Give me these links -- (1) Sense of need; (2) Desire to
get; (3) Belief that God has it in store; (4) Belief that though
 He withholds a while, He loves to be asked; and (5) Belief that
asking will obtain — give me these links, and the chain will
 reach from earth to heaven, bringing heaven all down to me, or

17. Note 8.
                             Notes.
   1. Standing was an ordinary attitude; but the word used to
describe the Pharisee's position "differs from that used to des-
ignate the publican's standing, and gives a very different im-
pression. It means that he stationed lthnself, struck an attitude,
ostentatiously."— Vincent. How different the poor publican, who,
feeling himself unworthy to mingle with other worshipers or
approach near the altar, "stood afar off" with bowed head and
downcast eyes.
            "One nearer to the altar trod,
              The other to the altar's God."
    2. It was not really a prayer in the sense of a petition or
thanksgiving to God. It was communing "with himself," and
boasting in the name of thanksgiving. " The nearer we come to
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     19

Jesus, and the more clearly we discern the purity of His character,
the more clearly we shall discern the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
and the less we shall feel like exalting ourselves. Those whom
heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to parade their own
goodness."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 160.
    3. He who measures himself by others is living by a low
standard. Yet how natural it is to do it. H. Clay Trumbull
says: "Even of those who admit that they are not righteous,
most feel sure that they are not the worst men in the world; and
they are glad of it. Men who will lie, boast that they do not
steal. Men who will lie and steal, are glad that they are not
drunkards. Men who are liars, thieves, and drunkards, take com-
fort in the thought that they have never been licentious. Men who
know that they have broken every commandment of the moral
law, thank God that they are not hypocrites and make no pre-
tense to decency. Some men sit in their pews at church and
congratulate themselves on their superiority to their neighbors,
while others find their chief satisfaction in reading in the morn-
ing papers of 'another good man gone wrong.' The echo of
the Pharisee's prayer fills the air to-day; and it is a• very rare
thing to find a person anywhere who does not think ho is better
than most men, if not better than all."
    4. " The religion of the Pharisee does not touch the soul.
He is not seeking Godlikeness of character, a heart filled with
love and mercy. He is satisfied with a religion that has to
do only with the outward life. His righteousness is his own,—
the fruit of his own works, and judged by a human standard."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," page 151.
    5. "Overwhelmed with a sense of guilt, he stood as if alone
in God 's presence. His only desire was for pardon and peace,
his only plea was the mercy of God."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
page 152.
    6. Each got what he wanted,— the Pharisee the notice and
praise of men, the publican the forgiveness of God.
    7. " There is nothing so offensive to God, or so dangerous to
the human soul, as pride and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is
the most hopeless, the most incurable."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," page 154.
    8. A shepherd, when asked the secret of his success in raising
such a fine flock of sheep, said, " I take care of the lambs.'
How many to-day, like the disciples, say, in actions if not in
words, that the work of God is too important to stop to give
attention to the children. Children are hindered (1) by a lack
of interest in religious things and proper religious instruction
ea the part of the parents in the home; (2) by neglect of their
20          SA BEA H      001, LESSON QUARTERLY
religious education• (3) by conduct of the church services with
little or no regard' to the lambs of the flock, thus making the
church distasteful to them; (4) by criticism of the church and
Christian workers in their presence; (5) by discouraging children
from becoming Christians when young.

                               Notes.
     1. "Not a rebuke, nor a denial that Christ was good, but an
 attempt to lead the young man upward in his seeking to the only
 ideal of good, and only source of good. The young man used
 the common title of respect for a teacher; but Christ would ask
 him whether he looks upon Him merely as any other teacher; or
 does he recognize Him as a divine teacher,— the only one who
 is truly good; the 'good Master' who knows all things, and whose
 teaching is eternally true. "—Peloubet'.s Notes. See also "Desire
 of Ages," page 518.
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     2. "What he lacked was earth's poverty and heaven's riches,
 a heart fully set on following Christ; and this could only come
 to him through willing surrender of all. And so this was to
 him alike the means, the test, and the need. To him it was
 this; to us it may be something quite other. Yet each of us has a
 lack — something quite deep down in our hearts which we may
 never yet have known, and which we must know and give up
 if we would follow Christ. And without forsaking, there can be
 no following. This is the law of the kingdom — and it is such
 because we are sinners, because sin is not only the'loss of the
 good, but the possession of something else in its place."—"Eder-
 sheim: Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page .341.
     3. The exalted position and the possessions of this young man
"were exerting a subtle influence for evil upon his character,"
 which if cherished would supplant God in his affections. He
 discerned the issue. He wanted eternal life, yet he wanted his
 property and position more. He was unwilling to trust to God's
direction; for withholding anything from God, shows that we
 do not really trust Him. Note how the young man Saul met and
settled this same question. Phil. 3:6-9.
    4. A hundredfold in value in the blessings received. "Even
the young ruler would have received an hundredfold. Now his
name is unknown, his influence unfelt. In a few years his pos-
sessions were ravaged by the Roman legions, while the disciples
introduced a new and blessed kingdom on earth, whose influence
is widening all down the ages. And in this he might have had
a part, rejoicing in the triumph, and filled with immortal joy;
and in the world to come life everlasting — the eternal life the
young ruler wanted so much, but refused to accept"— Peloubet's
Notes.
    5. ''Instruction has been given me that there is a withholding
of the tithe that should be faithfully brought into the Lord's
treasury for the support of ministers and missionaries who are
opening the Scriptures to the people, and working from house
to house. The work of evangelizing the world has been greatly
hindered by personal selfishness. . . . Money is needed in
order that the work done all over the world may be carried
forward. Thousands upon thousands are perishing in sin, and
a lack of means is hindering the proclamation of the truth that
is to be carried to all nations and kindreds and tongues and
people. There are men ready to go forth as the Lord's mes-
sengers, but because of a lack of means in the treasury they can
not be sent to the places where the people are begging for some
one to come and teach them the truth."—"Testimonies for the
Char*" volume 9, page 62.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      23

    "The Lord desires His people to be thoughtful and caretaking.
He desires them to practise economy in everything. If the workers
in the mission fields could have the means that is used in expensive
furnishings and in personal adornment, the triumphs of the cross
of Christ would be greatly extended."—" Testimonies for the
Church," volime 9, page 54.
    "Let there be systematic giving on the part of all. Some
may be unable to give a large sum, but all can lay aside each
week something for the Master. Let the children act their part.
Let parents teach their children to save their pennies to give to
the Lord. The gospel ministry is to be supported by self-denial
and sacrifice. Through the self-denying efforts of God's people
others will be brought into the faith, and these in turn will help
to increase the offerings made for the carrying forward of the
Lord's work. "—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 55.
     6. "In the parable the first laborers agreed to work for a
stipulated sum, and they received the amount specified, nothing
 more. Those later hired believed the master's promise, 'What-
soever is right, that shall ye receive.' They showed confidence in
 him by asking no question in regard to wages. They trusted to
 his justice and equity. They were rewarded, not according to
 the amount of their labor, but according to the generosity of his
 purpose.":—"Christ's Object Lessons,' page 397.

                             Notes.
  1. Since the time of His rejection in Galilee, Jesus has been
walking as it were in the shadow of the cross. During this time
He endeavored to give the twelve a true understanding of the
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    25
nature of His work on earth, and to prepare them for the great
crisis. See Matt. 16:21; 17:22, 23. The instruction given at
this time is more in detail than any given' before.
    2. The disciples knew well the dangers that threatened Jesus.
On this account they had objected to His going to Judea at the
time of the sickness of Lazarus, and at that time the Sanhedrin
had again determined unon His death. Now His face is turned
steadily toward Jerusalem again. Knowing these things, and
thinking of a temporal kingdom and the twelve thrones which had
recently been promised them, the apostles must have been very
much troubled and confused in their minds.
    3. "Our Lord means that such dignities as His disciples de-
sired would not, and could not, be conferred in a capricious
way by a mere act of the sovereign's pleasure. There could be
no scope, in such high matters, for personal favoritism. It was
in vain, therefore. for any to attempt to steal a march on their
fellow servants. What they asked has been divinely prepared for
those who are most worthy, those who have done most, and in
heart and will sacrificed most, and suffered most. In the kingdom
of heaven there is no chance of the highest posts and dignities
being conferred on incompetent or inferior servants. The high-
est in excellence will be the highest in honor. It is for such,
whether they be apostles, or ordinary preachers, or humble Sab-
bath-school teachers, whether they be crowned monarchs, or the
lowliest of menials. that the highest places have been prepared
by the Father in His all-embracing purpose and plan."— Pelou-
bet's Notes.
    4, ''The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who
on earth has drank most deeply of the snirit of His self-sacri-
ficing love."—"Desire of Ages," page 549. Here the spirit of
the world and the spirit of Christ are clearly contrasted. The
development of the Papacy, and nearly all the evils that have come
into God's church, have been a result of disregarding this
principle, the desire to be honored and to rule rather than to
serve.
       "I asked the angel why there was no more faith and power
in Israel. Said he, 'Ye let go of the arm of the Lord too soon.
Press your petitions to the tVone, and bold on by strong faith.
The promises are sure. Believe ye receive the things ye ask for,
and ye shall have them.' I was then pointed to Elijah. He was
sublect, to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly. His
 faith endured the trial. Seven times he prayed before the Lord,
and at last the cloud was seen. I saw that we had doubted the
sure promises, and wounded the Saviour by our lack of faith.
Said the angel, 'Gird the armor about thee, and above all take
26           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the shield of faith; for that will guard the heart, the very life,
from the fiery darts of the wicked.' If the enemy can lead the
desponding to take their eyes off from Jesus, and look to them-
selves, and dwell upon their own unworthiness, instead of dwelling
upon the worthiness of Jesus, His love, His merits, and His great
mercy, he will get away their shield of faith, and gain his object;
and they will be exposed to his fiery temptations. The weak
should therefore look to Jesus, and believe in Him; they then
exercise faith."—"Early Writings," pages 62, 63, old edition;
page 73, new edition.

    14. What did Jesus say of Mary's act? John 12 :
7, 8 ; Matt. 26: 10-13. Note 6.
                             Notes.
    1. The taxes imposed on subject nations by Rome were farmed
out to wealthy men who would pay a definite sum for the privi-
lege of collecting them. These men would sub-contract the work
to tax-gatherers in the same way. The system was productive
of a great deal of dishonesty and extortion. It is probable that
Zaccheus had the contract to collect the customs at Jericho, and
had tax-collectors, or publicans, working under him.
    2. "Sycamore-tree. The Egyptian fig; a tree like the mul-
berry in appearance, size, and foliage, but belonging, generically,
to the fig-trees. It grows to a great size and height"— Curry.
    3. ''When the rich young ruler had turned away from Jesus,
the disciples had marveled at their Master's saying, 'How hard ,
is it for them that trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.'
They had exclaimed one to another, 'Who then can be saved`r
Now they had a demonstration of the truth of Christ's words,
 The things which are impossible with men are possible with
God.' They saw how, through the grace of God, a rich man could
enter the kingdom."—"Desire of Ages," page 555.
The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed
and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the
    4. "No repentance is genuine that does not work reformation.
28           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
                        •
character and controls the conduct. Holiness is wholeness for
God; it is the entire surrender of heart and life to the indwelling
of the principles of heaven."—"Desire of Ages," page 555.
    "Every converted soul will, like Zaccheus, signalize the en-
trance of Christ into his heart by an abandonment of the unright-
eous practises that have marked his life. Like the chief publican,
he will give proof of his sincerity by making restitution."—"De—
sire of Ages," page 556.
    5. "The Christian in his business life is to represent to the
world the manner in which our Lord would conduct business en-
terprises. In every transaction he is to make it manifest that God
is his teacher. 'Holiness unto the Lord,' is to be written upon
day-books and ledgers, on deeds, receipts, and bills of exchange.
Those 'who profess to be followers of Christ, and who deal in an
unrighteous manner, are bearing false witness against the char-
acter of a holy, just, and merciful God."—"Desire of Ages,"
page 556.
    6. "Christ values acts of heartfelt courtesy. When any one
did Him a favor, with heavenly politeness He blessed the actor.
He did not refuse the simplest flower plucked by the hand of a
child, and offered to Him in love. He accepted the offerings of
children, and blessed the givers, inscribing their names in. the
Book of Life. . . . The desire that Mary had to do this serv-
ice for her Lord was of more value to Christ than all the
precious ointment in the world, because it expressed her apprecia-
tion of the world's Redeemer. It was the love of Christ that con-
strained her. The matchless excellence of the character of Christ
filled her soul. That ointment was a symbol of the heart of the
giver. It was the outward demonstration of a love fed by heav-
enly streams until it overflowed."—"Desire of Ages," page 564.
    We may learn a lesson from Mary in expressing our love to
those who need sympathy and help.

             "How oft we, careless, wait till life's
                Sweet opportunities are past,
              And break our 'alabaster box.
                Of ointment' at the very last!

                Who walks with us life's common ways,
              Watching our eyes for look of love,
                And hungering for a word of praise!"

of our father David that cometh in the name of the Lord,"
"Peace in heaven and glory in the highest," "Hosanna in the
highest."
    2. ''Never before in His earthly life had Jesus permitted such
a demonstration. He clearly foresaw the result. It would bring
Him to the cross. But it was His purpose thus Publicly to pre-
sent Himself as the Redeemer. He desired to call attention to
the sacrifice that was to crown His mission to a fallen world.
While the people were assembling at Jerusalem to celebrate the
Passover, He, the antitypical Lamb, by a voluntary act set Him-
self apart as an oblation. It would be needful for His church
in all succeeding ages to make His death for the sins of the
world a subject of deep thought and study. Every fact con-
nected with it should be verified beyond a doubt. It was neces-
sary, then, that the eyes of all people should now be directed to
Him; the events whieh preceded His great sacrifice must be such as
to call attention to the sacrifice itself. After such a demonstration
as that attending His entry into Jerusalem, all eyes would follow
His rapid progress to the final scene."—"Desire of Agcz,"
pose 571.

    3. "That might have seemed the proudest moment in the life
of Jesus, the moment when the homage of man was most spon-
taneous and most real; but in truth it was one of the saddest.
The enthusiasm only deepened His solitude, made it more awful
to His spirit, while throwing upon the coming events a more tragic
coloring. Their praise was pain; for what they praised was
the idol of their own imaginations, not the Christ who was
coming to suffer and die. In the midst of their joy He rode
possessed of the vivid consciousness that the discovery of the
truth would change their jubilant cry of welcome into the de-
lirious shout of passion and revenge. So, as they swept round
the shoulder of the hill, and the city burst upon His view, turreted,
temple-crowned, lying white and radiant in the glorious sunlight,
hallowed by a thousand sacred memories, darkened by a thousand
sins, the pathos of the place and the moment, the then and
the to be, the ideal and the actual, the men and the city as they
seemed and as they were, was more than His heart could bear,
and He wept, saying, 'If thou hadst known, at least in this thy
day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are
hid from thine eyes."!--"Fairbairn: Studies in the Life of
Christ," pages 231, 232.
    4. "Again the piercing look of Jesus swept over the dese-
crated court of the temple. All eyes were turned toward Him.
Priest and ruler, Pharisee and Gentile, looked with astonishment
and awe upon Him who stood before them with the majesty of
heaven's King. Divinity flashed through humanity, investing
Christ with a dignity and glory He had never manifested before.
 Those standing nearest Him drew as far away as the crowd would
permit. Except for a few of His disciples, the Saviour stood
alone. Every sound was hushed. The deep silence seemed un-
bearable. Christ spoke with a power that swayed the people like
 a mighty tempest: 'It is written, My house shall be called the
 house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.' His
 voice sounded like a trumpet through the temple. The dis-
 pleasure of His countenance seemed like consuming fire. With
 authority He commanded, 'Take these things hence.' "—"Desire
 of Ages," pages 590, 591.
     5. "As Jesus in the temple [when twelve years old] solved
 the mysteries which priests and rulers had not discerned, so in
 the closing work of this earth, children who have been rightly
 educated will in their simplicity speak words which will be an
 astonishment to men who now talk of 'higher education.' As the
 children sang in the temple courts, 'Hosanna! Blessed is He that
 cometh in the name of the Lord,' so in these last days, children's
32          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
voices will be raised to give the last message of warning to a
perishing world."—"Testimonies 'for the Church," volume 6,

                                Notes.
    1. "It was not the season for ripe figs, except in certain
localities; and on the highlands about Jerusalem it might truly
be said, 'The time of figs was not yet.' But in the orchard to
which Jesus came, one tree appeared to be in advance of all the
others. It was already covered with leaves. It is the nature of
the fig-tree that before the leaves open, the growing fruit appears.
Therefore this tree in full leaf gave promise of well-developed
fruit. But its appearance was deceptive. Upon searching its
branches, from the lowest bough to the topmost twig, Jesus
found 'nothing but leaves.' It was a mass of pretentious foliage,
nothing more."—"Desire of Ages," page 581.
    2. ''The cursing of the fig-tree was an acted parable. That
barren tree, flaunting its pretentious foliage in the very face
of Christ, was a symbol of the Jewish nation. The Saviour de-
sired to make plain to His disciples the cause and the certainty
of Israel's doom. For this purpose He invested the tree with
moral qualities, and made it the expositor of divine truth. The
Jews stood forth distinct from all other nations, professing al-
legiance to God. They had been specially favored by Him, and
they laid claim to righteousness above every other people. But
they were corrupted by the love of the world and the greed of
gain. They boasted of their knowledge, but they were ignorant of
the requirements of God, and were full of hypocrisy. Like the
barren tree, they spread their pretentious branches aloft, luxuriant
in appearance, and beautiful to the eye, but they yielded 'nothing
but leaves.' The Jewish religion, with its magnificant temple, its
sacred altars, its mitered priests and impressive ceremonies, was
indeed fair in outward appearance, but humility, love, and benevo-
 lence were lacking. . . . Had they [Israel] kept the law of
God, they would have done the same unselfish work that Christ
 did. But love to God and man was eclipsed by pride and self-
sufficiency. They brought ruin upon themselves by refusing to
 minister to others. The treasures of truth which God had com-
 mitted to them, they did not give to the world. In the barren
 tree they might read both their sin and its punishment."—"De-
 sire of Ages," page 582, 583.
34          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERL'r

    3. This was the last great day of Jesus' teaching, a mem-
orable day indeed in His life. Here "the young Galilean bear-
ing no earthly honor or royal badge" met "the Jewish authori-
ties arrayed in all the pomp of official costume." There was
prolonged controversy over puzzling questions designed to bring
Him into popular disfavor. Hour by hour He successfully met
their attack, and carrying the war into their own territory, "He
silenced them, but their hearts would not yield." Then letting
loose the storm of His righteous indignation upon them, "He
exposed their hypocritical practises in sentences that fel like
strokes of lightning, and made them a scorn and laughing-stock,
not only to the hearers then, but to all the world since."— Stalker.
It was a last mighty effort to show them their inward selves and
lead them to repent, and to place the truth clearly before their
followers. On the light side of the picture is the self-sacrificing
widow to whom Jesus called attention, and the request to see
Jesus by certain Greeks (proselytes to the Jewish religion) in
whom He saw a pledge of the results of an ingathering from the
Gentile world.
    4. "Scribes, priests, and rulers were all silenced. Baffled and
disappointed, they stood with lowering brows, not daring to press
further questions upon Christ. By their cowardice and indecision
they had in a great measure forfeited the respect of the people,
who now stood by, amused to see these proud, self-righteous men
defeated. . . . Many of those who had anxiously awaited the
result of tin questioning of Jesus, were finally to become His
disciples, first drawn toward Him12 y His words on that eventful
day. . . . Many of those who witnessed the words and deeds
of Jesus in the temple, from that time enshrined Him in their
hearts as a prophet of God. But as the popular feeling turned
in His favor, the hatred of the priests toward Jesus increased.
The wisdom by which He escaped the snares set for His feet,
being a new evidence of His divinity, added fuel to their wrath."

                        Questions.
                     THE TWO SONS.

28-30.

    11. What two things does Isaiah declare Christ to

    12. To whom is He the sure foundation? 1 Peter
2 : 6, 7. Note 5.
    13. To whom is He a rock of offense? Verses. 7, 8.
    14. What only kept the enraged rulers from seizing
Christ? Matt. 21: 45, 46.
                            Notes.
    1. The first son was commended not because of his wicked
reply, but because be repented. So the publicans, like Matthew
and Zaceheus, who forsook their sins and followed Christ, would
be saved; while the religious leaders,. who, depending on their
position and self-righteousness, rejected the blessed light, would
be lost.
    2. "This alludes to the Eastern custom, that if an owner was
not to be found, and the occupier pays the taxes for six years,
lie can claim the property. The owner, in this case, was in a
far country, and bad sent servant after servant, but had not
enforced his rights. When the legal heir appeared, they were
alarmed for their tenure, and hoped that by killing him, unless
his father came in person, the estate would become absolutely
their own. "— Canon Tristram. -gee Bohn 33.18.
    3. " In the parable the householder represented God, the vine-
yard the Jewish nation, and the hedge the divine law which was
their protection. The tower was a symbol of the temple. . .
As the husbandmen had killed the servants whom the master
sent to them for fruit, so the Jews had put to death the prophets
whom God sent to call them to repentance. Messenger after
messenger had been slain. . . . In the beloved son whom the
lord of the vineyard finally sent to his disobedient servants, and
whom they seized and slew, the priests and rulers saw a distinct
picture of Jesus and His impending fate. Already they were
planning to slay Him whom the Father had sent to them as a
last appeal. In the retribution inflicted upon the ungrateful
husbandmen was portrayed the doom of those who should put
Christ to death."—"Desire of Ages," pages 596, 597.
   4. The illustration is drawn from one of the stones prepared
at the quarry for Solomon's temple, for which the builders at
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    37
first found no place, being unacquainted with the head architect's
plans, but which was later found to be the chief corner-stone on
which the two walls met and were bonded together.
    5. " A sure foundation.' The entire world may lay upon
it their burdens and griefs; it can endure them all. With perfect
safety they may build upon it. Christ is a tried stone.' Those
who trust in Him, He never disappoints. He has borne every
test. He has endured the pressure of Adam's guilt, and the
guilt of his posterity, and' has come off more than conqueror
of the powers of evil. He has borne the burdens cast upon Him
by every repenting sinner. In Christ the guilty heart has found
relief. He is the sure foundation. All who make Him their
dependence, rest in perfect security. . . . To those who
believe, Christ is the sure foundation. These are they who fall
upon the Rock and are broken. Submission to Christ and faith
in Him are here represented. To fall upon the Rock and be
broken is to give up our self-righteousness, and to go to Christ
with the humility of a child, repenting of our transgressions,
and believing in His forgiving love. And so also it is by faith
and obedience that we build on Christ as our foundation."—

   15. What was the effect of Jesus' answer, upon His
questioners? Matt. 22 : 22.
                               Notes.
    1. "It is still customary in the East not only to give an in•
vitation some time beforehand, but to send round servants at
the proper time to inform the invited guests that all things are
ready."— Kit10. This invitation was given to the Jewish people
by Christ and His apostles.
    2. After the work of Christ was completed, still another ear-
nest effort was made for the Jewish people; but as a nation they
spurned the Gospel message.
    3. This evidently refers to the terrible retribution which came
upon Jerusalem and the Jewish people in A. n. 70. The lesson,
too, is for all time.
    4. " The third call to the feast represents the giving of the
Gospel to the Gentiles."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 309.
Good and bad ar•e invited. None are so good that they do not
need Christ, and none too bad to be received.
    5. "When the king came in to view the guests, the real char-
acter of all was revealed. For every guest at the feast there
had been provided a wedding-garment. This garment was a gift
from the king. By wearing it the guests showed their respect
for the giver of the feast. But one man was clothed in his
common citizen-dress. He had refused to make the preparation
required by the king. The garment provided for him at great
cost he disdained to wear. Thus he insulted his lord. To the
king's demand, 'How earnest thou in hither not having a wed-
ding-garment?' he could answer nothing. He was self-con-
demned."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 309.
    6. "Only the covering which Christ Himself has provided,
can make us meet to appear in God's presence. This covering, the
robe of His own righteousness, Christ will put upon every re-
penting, believing soul.       counsel thee,' He says, `to buy of
Me . . . white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and
that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.' "—"Christ's
Object Lessons," page 311.
     7. "The spies had expected Jesus to answer their question
directly, in one way or the other. If He should say, It is unlawful
 to give tribute to Caesar, He would be reported to the Roman
authorities and arrested for inciting rebellion. But in ease He
should pronounce it lawful to pay the tribute, they designed to
accuse Him to the people as opposing the law of God. Now they
 felt themselves baffled and defeated. Their plans were disar-
40         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
ranged. The summary manner in which their question had been
settled left them nothing further to say."—"Desire of Ages,"
page 602.
    In spite of their failure, it was declared a few days later at
His trial that He forbade giving tribute to Ceesar. Luke 23:2.

   1. The Sadducees were a religious party of the Jews. They
rejected all tradition, held to so strenuously by the Pharisees,
placing their chief reliance on the law, or writings of Moses.
They refused to accept doctrines that could not he traced to
Moses, hence their question at this time and Jesus' proof from
the Pentateuch. They were extremely materialistic and skeptical.
Though their numbers were small, the high priest and many mem-
bers of the Sanhedrin were Sadducees at this time. They were
the "higher critics" of their time.
    2. "The Sadducees had flattered themselves that they of all
men adhered most strictly to the Scriptures. But Jesus showed
that they had not known their true meaning. That knowledge
must be brought home to the heart by the enlightenment of the
Holy Spirit. Their ignorance of the Scriptures and the power of
God He declared to be the cause of their confusion of faith and

 darkness of mind. They were seeking to bring the mysteries
 of God within the compass of their finite reasoning. Christ called
 upon them to open their minds to those sacred truths that would
 broaden and strengthen the understanding. Thousands become
 infidels because their finite minds can not comprehend the mys-
 teries of God. They can not explain the wonderful exhibition of
 divine power in His providences, therefore they reject the evi-
 dences of such power, attributing them to natural agencies which
 they can comprehend still less. The only key to the mysteries
that surround us is to acknowledge in them all, the presence and
 power of God."—"Desire of Ages," page 605.
     3. Isaac and Jacob were not then alive, but in God's purpose
they were. "God counts the things that are not, as though they
were. He sees the end from the beginning, and beholds the result
of His work as though it were now accomplished. The precious
dead, from Adam down to the last saint who dies, will hear the
voice of the Son of God, and will come forth from the grave to
immortal life. God will be their God, and they shall be His
people. There will be a close and tender relationship between
God and the risen saints. This condition, which is anticipated in
His purpose, He beholds as if it were already existing. The
dead live unto Him."—"Desire of Ages," page 606.
     4. " The Pharisees had exalted the first four commandments,
which point out the duty of man to his Maker, as of far greater
consequence than the other six, which define man's duty to his
fellow man. As the result they greatly failed of practical god-
liness. Jesus had shown the people their great deficiency, and had
taught the necessity of good works, declaring that the tree is
known by its fruits. For this reason He had been charged with
exalting the last six commandments above the first four."—
"Desire of Ages," page 606.
   5. "When God has His rightful place on the throne of the
heart, the right place will be given to our neighbor. We shall love
him as ourselves. And only as we love God supremely is it
possible to love our neighbor impartially."—"Desire of Ages,"
page 607.

THE YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR
T  HIS splendid little paper occupies the same place in
     relation to our young people that the Review holds
with the older ones.
111 It is becoming more and more evident that the burden
of the work in giving the message is to rest on the young
people of this denomination.
g How necessary, then, that they should have the best of
instruction and guidance in their preparation for the work.
111 The Instructor is designed to fill this place and should
be found in the home of every sabbath-keeper.

        mitt of ages
   " rrHE DESIRE OF AGES" is a large volume of 866
            7x10-inch pages, the keynote of which is the great
            truth that " God was in Christ reconciling the
     world unto Himself."
          Christ said, "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw7all
     men unto Me." The working out of this purpose is
     traced through the life of Christ on earth. It is shown
     how Christ, as man's representative, endured the temp-
     tations by which man is overcome, and conquered in his
     behalf ; and that man, becoming partaker of the divine
     nature, is enabled to overcome as Christ overcame.
     God in Christ, and Christ in His followers, can with-
     stand all the power of Satan. And as Christ came to
     reveal the love of God, so His followers are to reveal the
      love of Christ.
          From another standpoint this volume is a study of
      the life of Christ and His disciples. It is

A Grand Book, and
Can Not Be Praised Too Highly

         Its illustrations alone cost over six thousand dollars,
     and are strikingly beautiful.
