         Sabbath-School Lessons on the

LIFE OF CHRIST
    NOTE.- In the lessons for this quarter we shall study the
closing scenes in Jesus' public ministry. Every act of Christ
during this time, and especially His words to His disciples, con-
tain lessons of deep significance to us who live in the last days
of the gospel work upon the earth. Therefore each lesson should be
studied very carefully. Jesus tore away the mask that the scribes
and Pharisees used in hiding their deformities of character. He
was well aware of what the result would be in thus bringing the
truth to bear upon these hidden sins. "Satan's attacks against
the advocates of the truth will wax more bitter and determined
to the very close of time. As in Christ's day the chief priests and
rulers stirred up the people against Him, so to-clay the religious
leaders will excite bitterness and prejudice against the truth for
this time. The people will be led to acts of violence and oppo-
sition which they would never have thought of had they not been
imbued with the animosity of professed Christians against the
truth."—" Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 09. Let
 us learn of Christ, by studying His methods and words during the
last days of His ministry, that we may he prepared to meet the
issues before us.

                             Notes
   1. Before entering upon the woes pronounced upon the Phari-
sees, a brief review of their characteristics may be in place.
    " The Pharisees were the most numerous and wealthy sect of
the Jews. . . . Their leading tenets were the following: that the
world was governed by fate, or by a fixed decree of God; that the
souls of men were immortal, and were either eternally happy or
miserable beyond the grave; that the dead would be raised; that
there were angels, good and bad. . . . Some of the laws of Moses
they maintained very strictly. In addition to the written laws,
they held to a multitude which they maintained had come down
from Moses by tradition. These they felt themselves as much
bound to observe as the written law. Under the influence of these
laws they washed themselves before meals with great scrupulonS-
ness; they fasted twice a week — on Thursday, when they sup-
posed Moses ascended Mount Sinai, and on Monday, when he
descended. . . . They were in general a corrupt, hypocritical,
office-seeking, haughty class of men."—Barnes's Notes, volume
1, pages 50, 51.
   2. Christ took the place of a servant. Greatness in the esti-
mate of heaven consists in the service rendered others. Greatness
as viewed among men consists in being served. Christ here lays
8            SARBATIT-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

clown the eternal principle that must govern every subject of His
kingdom — that of true humility manifested in helpful service
for others. He who is constantly lifting self into prominence, is
not following in the footsteps of his lowly Master. Luke 9:48.
     3. Christ did not lessen man's obligation to faithfully pay tithe,
even upon the little profits of the garden (Luke 16:10) ; but He
wanted all to see how it is possible to neglect the great principles
of judgment, mercy, and faith, in stickling for little things.
Neither tithe-paying nor the weightier matters are to be left
undone. "Every church-member should feel under obligation to
consecrate his tithe to God. None are to follow the sight of their
eyes, or the inclination of their selfish hearts, and thus rob God.
. . . The requirement is, 'Honor the Lord with thy substance.'
The tendency to covetousness must be constantly restraim1, else
it will eat into the hearts of men and women, and they will run
greedily after gain."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 5,
page 481.
     4. Christ makes it plain to all the people that He is not to be
associated in their minds in any way with the wicked practises
of the Pharisees. They had sinned against great light. Jesus
was about to leave them forever. He gave them to understand that
unless they repented of their sins, they could have no share in
the kingdom of God.
     5. "Divine pity marked the countenance of the Son of God
as He cast one lingering look upon the temple and then upon His
hearers. In a voice choked by deep anguish of heart and bitter
tears He exclaimed, `0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the
prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often
would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gath-
ereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! ' This is
the separation struggle. In the lamentation of Christ the very
heart of God is pouring itself forth. It is the mysterious farewell
of the long-suffering love of the Deity."—"Desire of Ages," page
620.

  16. What important instruction did He give regard-
ing our life? Verses 24-26. Note 5.
  17. In view of His soon leaving them, what admoni-
tion did Jesus give the disciples? Verses 35, 36.
                                 Notes
    1. Let it be noticed that Jesus saw all the gifts, and compre-
hended their value as money was at that time counted. He be-
held the ''much" cast in by the "many" who were "rich." He
also saw the little cast in by the poor. He saw infinitely more than
all this. He accurately balanced the gift with the circumstances
of the giver. The value in His sight was not altogether measured
by the amount cast in. Jesus looked into the hearts of the givers,
and beheld the motive prompting the gift. This "how" the
givers gave above all else made the offering either of little value
or precious in the eyes of the Master. The many rich cast
in a little of their surplus. The destitute widow put in "out of
her deficiency, all as much as she had . . . the whole of .her
living."— Rotherham.
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                           11

    2. ""-tneamrites: The word translated mite denotes a small
coin made of brass — the smallest in use among the Jews. -The
precise       - can- not -be- easily- estimated. —It - was- much-less - than
any coin- we - have, -as- the farthing- was less- than- an -English-far,
Mug.-- It was in value about three mills and a half, or one third of
a cent. "— Barnes motes,
    3. "Many of the rich brought large sums, which they pre-
sented with great ostentation. Jesus looked upon them sadly,
but made no comment on their liberal offerings. Piesently His
countenance lighted as He saw a poor widow approach hesitatingly,
as though fearful of being observed. As the rich and haughty
swept by, to deposit their offerings, she shrank back as if hardly
daring to venture farther. And yet she longed to do something,
little though it might be, for the cause she loved. She looked
at the gift in her hand. It was very small in comparison with
the gifts of those around her, yet it was her all. Watching her
opportunity, she hurriedly threw in her two mites, and turned to
hasten away. But in doing this she caught the eye of Jesus, -which
fastened earnestly upon her.
    " The Saviour called His disciples to Him, and bade them mark
the widow's poverty. Then His words of commendation fell upon
her ear: 'Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
east in more than they all.' Tears of joy filled her eyes as she
felt that her act was understood and appreciated. . . . Jesus
understood her motive."—"Desire of Ages," pages 614, 615.
     4. "It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made.
Divine benevolence was 'stirred to its unfathomable depths; it
was impossible for God to give more [as was also true of the
 poor widow in our lesson]. He `so loved the world, that He gave
 His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should
not perish; but have everlasting life.' Why is our gratitude so
limited'? It is only as a ripple on the surface, compared with
 the great tide of love that flows to us from the Father."—"Tes-
 timonies for the Church," volume 9, pages 59, 60. John 3:16;
2 Cor. 9:8.
     5. "As the disciples bore the message of the Greeks to Jesus
 and awaited His answer, He seemed to be in a ,deep study, and
 answered them: 'The hour is come that the Son of Man should be
 glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat
 fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it
 bringeth forth much fruit.' The request of the Greeks to see
 Jesus brought the future before Him. . . . Jesus regarded these
 Greeks as representatives of the Gentiles at large. In them He
 discerned the first-fruits of an abundant harvest, when all nations,
 tongues, and people upon the face of the earth should hear the
12          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
glad tidings of salvation through Christ. He saw that the gath-
ering of the Gentiles was to follow His approaching death."—
"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 74, 75.
    This same principle holds good in our dedication of property
to the cause of God. We can not give it and keep it at the same
time. That which is placed upon the altar is expected to be con-
sumed. But, like the kernel of wheat, it perishes only to bring
forth an abundant harvest later. That which dies, multiplies, and
so is saved; that which is preserved, abides alone, and in the
end is lost.

Verse 14.
                               Notes
    1. God hardens the heart of no one save as the rejection of His
mercy leaves the heart ever harder. It is the attitude of the
individual to the light and truth God sends, that effects changes
upon the heart. While the gospel continues, God will seek to
draw men unto Himself. Rev. 22:17, He is no respecter of
persons. But when we refuse to walk in the light, reject the
gracious wooing of the Spirit, rebel against correction, we harden
our hearts. Thus it was with Pharaoh; thus it was with the
Jews; thus it is to-day. Heb. 3:12, 13, 15. Observe that in verse
37 reference is made to the unbelief of the Jews.
    2. "Jesus did not answer His disciples by taking up separately
the destruction of Jerusalem and the great day of His coming.
He mingled the description of these two events. Had He opened
to His disciples future events as He beheld them, they would have
been unable to endure the sight. In mercy to them He blended
the description of the two great crises, leaving the disciples to
study out the meaning for themselves. When He referred to the
destruction of Jerusalem, His prophetic words reached beyond that
event to the final conflagration in that day when the Lord shall
rise out of His place to punish the world for their iniquity, when
the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her
slain. This entire discourse was given, not for the disciples only,
but for those who should live in the last scenes of this earth's
history."—"Desire of Ages," page 6$8,
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   15
   3. " Turning to the disciples, Christ said, Take heed that no
man deceive you. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am
Christ; and shall deceive many.' Many false messiahs will ap-
pear, claiming to work miracles, and declaring that the time of
the deliverance of the Jewish nation has come. These will mis-
lead many. Christ's -words were fulfilled. Between His death
and the siege of Jerusalem many false messiahs appeared. But
this warning was given also to those who live in this age of the
world. The same deceptions practised prior to the destruction
of Jerusalem have been practised through the ages, and will be
practised again."—"Desire of Ages," page 628.

                              Notes
    1. In the first investment of Jerusalem by the Roman army,
Cestius advanced to the inner wall and pitched his camp opposite
the strong positions of the palace and the temple. "Had he im-
mediately assailed the walls in front of him, we are told he
would have had an easy victory; but, like not a few generals of be-
sieging armies, he preferred caution to dash, and so allowed the
favorable moment to pass unimproved. Josephus deplores this
delay, since, in his opinion, the capture of the city at that time
would at once have ended the war. He lays the blame on the
governor, Florus, who for his own purpose desired that the war
should be prolonged. Florus, he says, bribed a great number of
the Roman officers, and so prevented an immediate attack.
   "A large party of the people now made overtures to Cestius,
and offered to open the gates for him. Again he hesitated, until
the Zealots within discovered the plot and punished its authors by
throwing them down from the city wall. For five days the Romans
continued their desultory attacks without success. They then
assailed the northern wall of the temple, and when the Jewish
darts rained down upon them like hailstones, they put their
shields over their heads, and standing or crouching close together,
lapped one shield over the edge of another, and thus formed a
complete covering like the crust or shell of a single huge animal;
this arrangement was known as the testudo, or tortoise, and was
a regular and effective maneuver of the Roman army in carrying
on a siege.
    "And now a horrible fear ran through the city as the Roman
soldiers, under the protection of their shields, maintained their
ground, undermined the wall, and prepared to set fire to the
gate of the temple. But of this panic Cestius seemed not to be
aware, and if he heard of the existence of a large body of sym-
 pathizers within the walls, he either did not believe it or did not
care to trust his army to them. Suddenly he suspended operations,
 renounced his advantages, and withdrew from the temple wall.
 It was an act so difficult to account for that naturally it was
 ascribed to a higher power than man. Josephus regarded it as
 proving the divine anger, for he believed that if the city had been
 captured then all the subsequent horrors of the war would have
 been avoided. Others supposed that this was the opportunity
 pointed out to the' disciples by the Saviour, when they might
 escape to a place of safety and avoid all the coming woes of the
siege."—"Extile to Overthrow," pages 303, 304.
    2. "Not one Christian perished in the destruction of Jeru-
salem. Christ had given His disciples warning, and all who be-
lieved His words watched for the promised sign. .  . After the
18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Romans under Cestius had surrounded the city, they unexpectedly
abandoned the siege when everything seemed favorable for an
immediate attack. . . . Events were so overruled that neither
Jews nor Romans should hinder the flight of the Christians. Upon
the retreat of Cestius, the Jews, sallying from Jerusalem, pursued
after his retiring army, and while both forces were thus fully
engaged, the Christians had an opportunity to leave the city. At
this time the country .also had been cleared of enemies who might
have endeavored to intercept them. At the time of the siege,
the Jews were assembled at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of
Tabernacles, and thus the Christians throughout the land were
able to make their escape unmolested. Without delay they fled
to a place of safety,— the city of Pella, in the land of Perea,
beyond Jordan."— 'Great Controversy," pages 30, 31.
     3. The "days" of "great tribulation" Jesus• here speaks of
can be no other than the long period of 1260 years of papal per-
secution through which the church was to pass, when millions
of the saints of God were cruelly put to death as heretics. Dan.
7:25; Rev. 12:6, 13, 14. These days of papal supremacy began
in 538 A. D., and ended in 1798. But Jesus said the time of
persecution should be "shortened." As a result of the Reforma-
tion under Luther and his associates, Jesus' words met their
literal fulfilment in that the days of persecution were "short-
ened."
     4. The second coming of Jesus can not be counterfeited. Jesus
comes in person. -Acts 1:10, 11. He ..conielk with the glory of
 His Father. Matt._16:27-. He is accompanied by all the holy an-
gels, who come in all their glory., Rev. 8:1;-Lake-9:26. He touché`s
 not the earth, but remains in the air, sending His angels to bring
 to Him the resurrected saints and those who have been changed
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. 1 Thess. 4:16, 17; Matt.
24:31. The whole earth will be lightened by His approach, and
 every eye shall see Him. Matt. 24:27; Rev. 1:7. It will be im-
 possible for Satan to counterfeit the coming of Jesus as outlined
 in these words of Scripture. Thus none need be deceived by the
 false teaching concerning the coming of Christ. Jesus has fore-
 warned His people, so that none need be in ignorance concerning
 this important event.
     5. "Almost if not altogether alone as the most mysterious
 and as yet unexplained phenomenon of its kind in nature's diver-
 sified range, of events during the last century, stands the dark day.
 of May 19, 1780, a most unaccountable darkening of the whole
 visible heavens and atmosphere in _New England, which brought
 intense alarm and distress to multitudes of minds,. as well as dis- -
 may to the brute creation, the fowls fleeing, bewldered, to their
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QtJARTEBLY                    19
roosts, and the birds to their nests, and the cattle returning to
their stalls. Indeed, thousands of the good people of that day
became fully convinced that the end of all things terrestrial had
come; many gave up, for the time, their secular pursuits, and be-
took themselves to religious devotions."—" Our First Century,"
page 88.
    Burritt's "Geography of the Heavens," page 163, edition
1854, says of the star shower of 1833:
    "The most sublime phenomenon of shooting stars of which the
world has furnished any record, was witnessed throughout the
United States on the morning of the 13th of November, 1833.
The entire extent of this astonishing exhibition has not been pre-
cisely ascertained; but it covered no inconsiderable portion of
the earth's surface. . . . The whole heavens seemed in motion,
and suggested to some the awful grandeur of the image employed
in the Apocalypse, upon the opening of the sixth seal, when
'the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth
her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.' "

                             Notes

   1. It was not because that generation living at the time of
the Flood had not heard the warning of the coming Deluge. They
had heard it so long that it had become to them an old story.
They "knew not" because they believed not God's message.
Having cast aside God's Word as uncertain, they at last looked
upon Noah's work as a delusion, and the Flood came to them as
a surprise. So will it be in the end of the world. -For—further
study,-see "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 95-97.
    2. ''Jesus has left us word, 'Watch ye therefore: for ye know
not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight,
or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly
he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say unto all,
Watch.' We are waiting and watching for the return of the
Master, who is to bring the morning, lest coming suddenly He
find us sleeping. What time is here referred to7 Not to the
revelation of Christ in the clouds of heaven to find a people
asleep. No; but to His return from His ministration in the most
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, when He lays off His
priestly attire, and clothes Himself with garments of vengeance,
and when the mandate goes forth, 'He that is unjust, let him
be unjust still; . . . and he that is holy, let him be holy still.' "
—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 2, page 190.
    3. "Probation closes; Christ's intercessions cease in heaven.
This time finally comes suddenly upon all, and those who have
neglected to purify their souls by obeying the truth, are found
sleeping. They became weary of waiting and watching; they
became indifferent in regard to the coming of their Master. . . .
While their interest was buried up in their worldly gains, the
work closed in the heavenly sanctuary, and they were unprepared.
If such had only known that the work of Christ in the heavenly
sanctuary would close so soon, how differently would they have
conducted themselves! how earnestly would they have watched!
The Master anticipating all this, gives them timely warning in
the command to watch. He distinctly states the suddenness of
His coming. He does not measure the time, lest we shall neglect
a momentary preparation, and in our indolence look ahead to the
time when we think He will come, and defer the preparation."
—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 2, page 191.
    4. "Trumbull, attending an Oriental wedding, saw the bride's
procession in the afternoon. He was told the bridegroom's pro-
cession would move out later in the evening. He watched for it
several hours, and seeing no sign thereof he went quietly to bed
in his tent. But at midnight there was a cry made, 'Behold,
the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him'— literally the
substance of his dragoman's eall."—Peloubet's Notes, 1901.
    5. "The reply is not selfish, even in the figure, for there was
not enough for us and you. To have divided the oil would have
entirely defeated the purpose of the procession." "Personal
character can not be given by one man to another. . . . There is
much, indeed, we can and ought to do for each other. But we
can not give to any one the qualities which we ourselves possess,
but in which he is deficient."—Peloubet's Notes, 1901.
    6. A modern missionary, describing a Hindu wedding, closes
by telling how when the bridegroom went into the house, the door
"was immediately shut and guarded by sepoys. I and others
expostulated with the doorkeepers, but in vain. Never was I so
struck with our Lord's beautiful parable as at this moment —
and the door was .shut."—Barnes's Notes, volume 1, page 314.
   ,In studying this parable, it will be observed that all the virgins
took lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. All had - some
oil. All waited for him. But as the bridegroom tarried longer
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   23
than they thought he would, all went to sleep. All arose at mid-
night. All trimmed their lamps. Here the separation takes place.
Only five now had oil. And only those who had oil and were
ready went in before the door was shut.

  18. What is said of the reward of those upon His
left hand? Of those upon His right? Verses 46.
                              Notes
    1. The parable of the talents is an explanation of the waiting
time between Jesus' departure and His return. The parable of
the ten virgins emphasizes the need of continual preparation for
the Master's return; this of the talents, the use of the time during
His absence. The woids, "Occupy till I come" (Luke 19:13),
show that this parable reaches, as does that of the ten virgins,
to the end of the world.
    2. " 'His goods.' His property — representing the offices,
abilities, and opportunities for doing good, which He has given
to His professed followers." "The word 'talents' here is used
to denote indefinitely a large sum, and is designed to refer to the
endowments conferred on men. We have retained in our language
the word 'talent' as referring to the abilities or gifts of men."
—Barnes's Notes, volume 1, page 318.
    3. "It needs no comment to show that his [the one-talent serv-
ant'sl own words, however honest and self-righteous they might
sound, admitted dereliction of his work and duty as a servant,
and entire misunderstanding as well as heart-alienation from his
master. He served him not, and he knew him not; he loved
him not, and he sympathized not with him. But, besides, his
answer was also an insult and a mendacious pretext. He had
been idle and unwilling to work for his master. If he worked, it
would be for himself. He would not incur the difficulties, the
self-denial, perhaps the reproach, connected with his master's
work. We recognize here those who, although His servants, yet,
from selfish indulgence and worldliness, will not do work for
Christ with the one talent entrusted to them — that is, even
though the responsibility and claim upon them be the smallest"—
Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 462.
    4. "Even among the heathen are those who have cherished the
spirit of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon
26          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

their ears they have befriended the missionaries, even ministering
to them at the peril of their own lives. . . . How glad will be
the heart of Infinite Love as His followers look up with surprise
and joy at His words of approval."—"Desire'of Ages," page 638.

                              Notes
     1. From this point, Jesus prepares to enter the final strug-
gle with the prince of darkness. His public ministry is ended.
His heart yearningly turns to His disciples. He is closeted, as
it were, with them, and imparts all the instruction He sees they
can bear. Much that He longs to tell them is stayed upon His
lips; for they are not ready. His hour has now come, but they
are unprepared for it.
     2. It will be observed that the Bible record lifts the veil and
reveals the principal events taking place within two circles —
that of Jesus and His little band, and that of Satan and those
closely allied with him. First we are shown the one, and then
the other.
     3. "We look with horror upon the treachery of Judas; but
his case represents a large class who file in under the banner
of Christ, yet are really His worst enemies. They worship only
self and money, and use the name of Christian as a cloak to
hide their evil deeds. They sell their integrity for money, and
their Saviour for a little worldly advantage."—"Spirit of
Prophecy," volume 3, pages 82, 83.
     4. "The request of James and John to sit on the right and
left of Christ's throne, had excited the indignation of the others.
. . . Judas was the most severe upon James and John. When
the disciples entered the supper-room, their hearts were full of
resentful feelings. Judas pressed next to Christ on the left side;
John was on the right. If there was a highest place, Judas was
determined to have it, and that place was thought to be next
to Christ. And Judas was a traitor."—"Desire of Ages," pages
643, 644.
     5. Jesus was seeking to save Judas. This general state-
ment was designed to draw from Judas a heartfelt confession
of his crime. Now was his opportunity to confess his guilt and
receive the Saviour 's pardon. As in the case of Achan, of old,
the Lord made it as easy as possible for Judas to free himself
from the snare in which he was taken, by confessing his sin.

                                  Notes
   1. "With Judas an element of antagonism was introduced
among the disciples. . . . Though recognizing the divine power
of the love of Christ, Judas did not yield to its supremacy. He
continued to cherish his own judgment and opinions, his dispo-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     31
sition to criticize and condemn. Christ's motives and movements,
often so far above his comprehension, excited doubt and disap-
proval, and his own questionings and ambitions were insinuated
to the disciples. Many of their contentions for supremacy, much
of their dissatisfaction with Christ's methods, originated with
Judas."—"Education," pages 91, 92. Matt. 18:1; Mark
9:33, 34.
    2. "Another cause of dissension had arisen. At a feast it
was customary for a servant to wash the feet of the guests,
and on this occasion preparation had been made [by Peter and
John] for the service. The pitcher, the basin, and the towel
were there, in readiness for the feet-washing; but no servant
was present, and it was the disciples' part to perform it. But
each of the disciples, yielding to wounded pride, determined not
to act the part of a servant. All manifested a stoical unconcern,
seeming unconscious that there was anything for them to do.
By their silence they refused to humble themselves. "—"Desire
of Ages," page 644.
   "Such girding was the common mark of a slave, by whom the
service of foot-washing was ordinarily performed."—Edersheim's
"Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, pages 501, 502.
   3. "So far as Judas himself was concerned, Christ's work of
love had been without avail. But not so as regards his fellow
disciples. To them it was a lesson of lifelong influence. Ever
would its example of tenderness and long-suffering mold their
intercourse with the tempted and the erring. And it had other
lessons. At the ordination of the twelve, the disciples had greatly
desired that Judas should become one of their number; and they
had counted his secession an event of much promise to the apos-
tolic band. . . . But the methods he desired to introduce into
Christ's work were based upon worldly principles and were
controlled by worldly policy." `Education," page 93.
   4. "Christ would have His disciples understand that although
He had washed their feet, this did not in the least detract from
His dignity. . . . Being so infinitely superior, He imparted
grace and significance to the service. No one was so exalted
as Christ, and yet He stooped to the humblest duty."—"Desire
of Ages," page 649.
   "Ye also ought to wash one another's feet." The Standard
Dictionary says: "Ought is used chiefly as auxiliary, expressing
obligation or fitness. To be under moral obligation to be or do;
be bound in duty or by the principles of right." Ye are bound
by duty, by an obligation, to do as I have done, to wash one
a.nother's feet. Not simply be willing to do it, but do it. And in
the doing, happiness will be found.
32          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   5. The word " servant " was often applied to a slave. Judas
regarded Jesus at the feet-washing as a slave, and it is quite
significant that he sold Him for just thirty pieces of silver — the
acknowledged price of a slave. " For thirty pieces of silver —
the price of a slave — he sold the Lord of Glory to ignominy
and death. "—"Desire of Ages," page 716.

34          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                               Notes
    1. "As they realized the full import of His words and re-
membered how true His sayings were, a sudden fear and self-
distrust seized them. They began to examine their own hearts
to ascertain if one thought against the Master found lodgment
there. With the most painful feelings, one after another inquired,
'Lord, is it IV But Judas sat silent."—"Spirit of Prophecy,"
volume 3, pages 85, 86.
    2. "John in deep distress at last inquired, 'Lord, who is itl'
And Jesus answered, 'He that dippeth his hand with Me in the
dish, the same shall betray Me. The Son of man goeth as it is
written of Him: but wo unto that man by whom the Son of
man is betrayed; it had been good for that man if he had not
been born.' The disciples had searched one another's faces
closely as they asked, 'Lord, is it        And now the silence of
Judas drew all eyes to him. Amid the confusion of questions
and expressions of astonishment, Judas had not heard the words
of Jesus in answer to John's question. But now, to escape
the scrutiny of the disciples, he asked as they had done, 'Master,
is it IV Jesus solemnly replied, 'Thou hast said.' "—"Desire
of Ages," page 654.
    3. "Though Jesus knew Judas from the beginning, He washed
his feet. And the betrayer was privileged to unite with Christ
in partaking of the sacrament. .        . This example is for us.
When we suppose one to be in error and sin, we are not to divorce
ourselves from him. .       . Christ's example forbids exclusive-
ness at the Lord's supper. It is true that open sin excludes the
guilty. This the Holy Spirit plainly teaches (1 Cor. 5:11).
But beyond this none are to pass judgment."—"Desire of Ages,"
pages 655, 656.
    4. Instead of to an earthly kingdom, Jesus directed their
minds to that time when they should be with Him again in the
kingdom of God. He also connected the important events of His
death with His second coming — a hope that was to cheer the
believer until the close of time. 1 Cor. 11:26.
    5. "In surprise and confusion at the exposure of his purpose,
Judas rose hastily to leave the room. 'Then said Jesus unto
him, That thou doest, do quickly. . . . He then having re-
ceived the sop went immediately out: and it was night.' Night
it was to the traitor as he turned away from Christ into the
outer darkness. Until this step was taken, Judas had not passed
beyond the possibility of repentance. But when he left the pres-
ence of his Lord and his fellow disciples, the final decision had
been made. He bad passed the boundary line."—"Desire of
Ages," page 654.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL SSON QUARTERLY                     35
     6. To love one another, was not 'a new precept. But never
before bad the world witnessed such rove as the love of Jesus.
The new feature of this command was "that ye love one another"
"as I have loved you." John 13:1; Rom. 5:5 r1 John 3:18, 14.
     7. "Had Jesus remained silent, in apparent ignorance of
that which was to come upon Him, an impression might have been
left on the minds of His disciples that their Master had not
divine foresight."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 87.
     8. "Over and over again, on the very verge of ruin, Peter's
words of boasting brought him nearer and still nearer to the
brink. Over and over again was given the warning, 'Thou
shalt . . . deny that thou knowest Me.' . . . When in the
judgment-hall the words of denial had been spoken; when Peter's
love and loyalty, awakened under the Saviour's glance of pity
and love and sorrow, had sent him forth to the garden where
Christ had wept and prayed; when his tears of remorse dropped
upon the sod that had been moistened with the blood-drops of
His agony,— then the Saviour's words,     have prayed for thee;
 . . . when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren,' were
a stay to his soul. Christ, though foreseeing his sin, had not
abandoned him to despair."—"Education," page 89.

did they do? Verse 31; Matt. 26 : 30. Note 7.
                              Notes
     1. "There can not be doubt that the first discourse was spoken
while at the supper table. It connects itself closely with that
statement which had caused them [the disciples] so much sorrow
and perplexity, that, whither He was going, they could not come;
. . . the two great elements in the discourse being, teaching
and comfort."—Edersheim's "Life and Times of • Jesus,
page 513.
     "The object of Christ's departure was the opposite of what
the disciples feared. It did not mean a final separation. He
was going to prepare a place for then; that He might come
again, and receive them unto Himself. While He was building
mansions for them, they were to build characters after the divine
similitude."—"Desire of Ages," page 666.
     2. "By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work
would be of a more exalted character than His, but that it
would have greater extent. He did not refer merely to miracle-
working, but to all that would take place under the working of
the Holy Spirit."—"Desire of Ages," page 664. Acts 2:1-11;
Col. 1:5, 6.
     3. The condition upon which Jesus promises to send the
Holy Spirit to any one, is that he loves Him and keeps His
commandments. The • Revised Version reads, "Ye will keep
My commandments."
     4. "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested
of the personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cum-
bered with humanity, Christ could not be in every place person-
ally. Therefore it was for their interest that He should go to
the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth.
No one could then have any advantage because of his location
38         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

or his personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour
would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to
them than if He had not ascended on high." `Desire of Ages,"
page 669.
    5. What better and more valuable legacy could Jesus bequeath
His children than His own blessed peace — that heavenly peace
which the world can neither give nor take away'I It is of more
value than gold or silver or diamonds. He said, "My peace I
give unto you." Let us take it, and be at rest in Him, amid
the troubles of life which surround us. Matt. 11:28, 29; Isa.
30:15; Phil. 4:7.
    6. " Hath nothing in Me.' There is in Me no principle or
feeling that accords with his, and nothing, therefore, by which
he can prevail."—Barnes's Notes, volume 2, page 365.
    7. "Before leaving the upper chamber, the Saviour led His
disciples in a song of praise. His voice was heard, not in the
strains of some mournful lament, but in the joyful notes of the
Passover hallel [Psalm 117]:
     " '0 praise the Lord, all ye nations;
         Praise Him, all ye people.
         For His merciful kindness is great toward us,
         And the truth of the Lord endureth forever. •
         Praise ye the Lord.' "

40          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                             Notes
    1. " The Jews had always regarded the vine as the most
 noble of plants, and a type of all that was powerful, excellent,
 and fruitful." "Jesus and the disciples were on the way to
Gethsemane. . . . The moon is shining bright, and reveals
 to Him a flourishing grape-vine. Drawing the attention of the
 disciples to it, He employs' it as a symbol."—"Desire of Ages,"
 pages 674, 675. Isa. 5:1-7.
    "What a beautiful and appropriate type does the vine af-
 ford of the mystical body of Christ. .       . Christ is not the
trunk, nor the branches, but the whole vine; they are members
of His body, of His flesh, of His bones [Co]. 2:17, 19]."—
 Peloubet's Notes.
    2. " 'He taketh away.' Because their presence injures the
other branches; and their remaining is of no benefit to them-
selves. As long as there is hope of their bearing fruit, they are
permitted to remain, and are pruned and cared for. (See Luke
13:6-9). If this is of no avail, they are taken away, by the
natural withering away of those who draw no nourishment from
the true vine. They lose their interest, and practically sever
their connection with Christ and His church."—Peloubet's Notes.
               ;— Jude-18-
    3. `That My joy:' The same kind of joy that I have, and
to be obtained in the same way. This joy is (1) the. joy of a
free activity in doing right, like the joy of motion in health,
like the song of a bird in the morning. (2) The joy of entire
consecration and submission to God. (3) The joy of doing good,
of self-denial for others. (4) The joy of perfect faith in a wise
and loving God, committing everything to His care. (5) Joy in
the conscious love of God to us, communion and friendship with
Him. (6) The joy of loving others. (7) The joy of seeing others
saved. (8) The joy of victory. (9) In the end, outward de-
lights and pleasures to correspond with the inward joy."—

                            Notes
   1. Christians pray to God to send them the Comforter — the
Holy Ghost. This is proper and right. But we may forget that
sometimes the only real comfort the Holy Ghost can administer
to us is to reveal our unconfessed and unforsaken sins. To get
these put away, is the best and most lasting comfort that He
can bestow. Isa. 57:17-21. If He thus comes as a reprover,
we must still count Him as the Comforter. But to experience
the comfort, we must immediately confess the sin to God, and
make right any wrong we may have done others. This done,
there will be no disappointment in experiencing the promised
comfort. Acts 2:37-39; Rev. 3:18, 19.
   2. "The work of the Spirit in believers. (1) Teaching (John
14:26); (2) guiding into all truth (John 16:13); (3) bearing
witness (John 15:26; Acts 5:32); (4) giving life (Rom. 8:11);
(5) bestowing the living water (John 4:14; 7:38, 39); (6)
bestowing gifts, as of teaching, tongues, etc. (1 Cor. 32:7-11);
(7) shedding the love of God abroad in them (Rom. 5:5);
(8) producing goodness and high morality (Gal. 5:22, 23; Acts
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   43
11:24) ; ( 9) bestowing power (Acts 1:8; Rom. 15:19) ; (10)
bestowing wisdom (Eph. 1:17)."—Peloubet 's Notes.
    3. Here is an exhibition of the faith of Jesus. With no
home, no earthly honor or wealth, and within a few hours of a
criminal's death, He promised His believers a share in all the
riches and glory of heaven. Being the Father's, He claimed
these treasures as His own, and if His, then ours. He had given
up all, He claimed all. 2 Cor. 8:9. If we renounce all, like
Him, we may claim all. Porn. 8:32. •
    4. Peter and the rest had avowed their allegiance in strong
terms (Matt. 26:33-35). They were now within two or three
hours of their great test. For it they were unprepared. Jesus
knew better than they the strength of the temptation awaiting
them. The Shepherd was to be smitten (Zech. 13:7), and the sheep
scattered. (See margin, John 16:32.) It will be observed that
this final stroke to the eleven came suddenly. Another similar
hour of trial awaits the remnant. But a living faith and trust
in God and His Word will pass the believer triumphant through
this final test into the city Jesus has gone to prepare for His
saints.

                         Notes
    1. It is the Son of God addressing His Father and our
Father j.(.4144i41-20... Divinity in humanity is pleading with
divinity for humanity. No other such prayer can be found upon
rccord. It is the out-breathing of divine love for God's own in
a sinful world. Ponder the prayer. Become familiar with its
words. Every sentence is full of divine meaning. Let it be-
come Jesus' prayer for yoic, Peter and James and John and
the other apostles are dead. But the prayer is still for those
who are "in the world" but "are not of the world." Hence,
it is for us (John 17:20).
    2. "When the great sacrifice had been consummated, Christ
ascended on high, refusing the adoration of angels until He
had presented the request, 'I will that they also, whom Thou
hast given Me, be with Me where I am' (John 17:24). Then
with inexpressible love and power came forth the answer from
the Father's throne, 'Let all the angels of God worship Him.'
Not a stain rested upon Jesus. His humiliation ended, His sac-
rifice completed, there was given unto Him a name that is above
every name."—"Great Controversy," page 502.
Stereopticon Slides
       On the Life of Christ
  THE Young People's Missionary Volunteer
Department has secured a well-selected list of
seventy colored stereopticon slides on the Life
of Christ. These slides will be rented to our
institutions or churches desiring to give a pro-
gram on this subject.
  An hour spent looking at these masterpieces
on the Saviour's life, and rehearsing the pre-
cious story, will do much to fix the Sabbath-
school lessons on the minds of all, especially
the children and young people.
  The department also has some illustrated
songs,—"God Be with You till We Meet
Again," one slide; "Onward, Christian Sol-
diers," one slide; "Brightly Beams Our
Father's Mercy," four slides; "Throw Out
the Life-Line," four slides; "The Ninety and
Nine," ten slides.
  Tese slides will be rented for four cents
each for four days counting from the time
they leave the office until returned, and one
cent per slide for each additional day; two
days free to points west of the Mississippi
River, and three days to points west of the
Rocky Mountains. The renter pays the ex-
press each way.

              "HOME, SWEET HOME"




OFwriter
   the homeless author of "Home, Sweet Home," one
         says, "His very homelessness voiced sweeter
and deeper the longing of every true human heart." This
longing is but a God-given desire for the "home eternal,"
and it is of that home that Elder J. N. Loughborough speaks in


       "Saints' Inheritance"
  Somehow, the reality and beauty of our future home
grows on one as he reads this little work.
