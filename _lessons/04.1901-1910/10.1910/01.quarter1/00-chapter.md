    1. The Feast of Tabernacles "was pre-eminently the feast
for foreign pilgrims" (Edersheim), and many bad come from
all parts of the world hopiiig to see Jesus, who claimed to be
the Messiah, and of whose mighty miracles they had heard.
Jesus had not attended the national gatherings since the healing
of the man at the pool of Bethesda. ("Desire of Ages," page
450.) Some of the people of Jerusalem doubtless knew of the
decision of the members of the Sanhedrin at that time to put
Him to death. So there was a general feeling of expectancy
concerning Him among those who attended this last great feast
of the year.
    2. "Letters" is literature. " To the Jews there was only
one kind of learning — that of theology; and only one road to
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      7

it — the schools of the rabbis. Their major was true, but their
minor false — and Jesus hastened to correct it. He had, indeed,
'learned,' but in a school quite other than those which alone they
recognized."—Edersheim: "The Life and Times of Jesus the
Messiah," Vol. 2, page 151.
    3. "It was a settled popular belief, and, in a sense, not quite
 unfounded, that the appearance of the Messiah would be sudden
and unexpected. He might be there, and not be known; or He
 might come, and be again hidden for a time. As they put it,
 when Messiah came no one would know whence He was; but they
all knew ' whence this One' was. And with this rough and ready
argument of a coarse realism, they, like so many among us,
 settled off-hand and once for all the great question."—Id.,
 Vol. 2, page 154.
    4. Like the suggestion of the high priest at a later time
 (John 11:49-51), the query of the Jews was prophetic. "In their
 mocking words they were picturing the mission of Christ."

                             Notes.

    1. The ceremony of pouring out the water, which commemo-
rated the smitten rock, was performed each morning during the
feast. "Few, if any, have doubted that it was with direct al-
lusion to this daily pouring out of the waters of Siloam, which
was so striking a feature of the festival, that on the last, that
great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, 'If any man
thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.' Your forefathers
thirsted in the wilderness, and I smote the rock for them, so that
the waters flowed forth. . . . Did not Isaiah tell you, when
in My name he spake, saying,        will pour water on him that is
thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour My Spirit
upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring'? . . .
And now I am here to fulfil in person all the promises that I
made by the lips of My servant Isaiah, and I gather them up and
condense them in the invitation, `If any man thirst, let him
come unto Me, and drink.' "— Hanna: "Life of Christ," page
371.
    2. "He that believeth shall not barely and alone have his
own thirst assuaged; but I in him, by My Spirit given, molding him
into My own likeness, shall turn him into a separate well-head,
 from whose depths rivers of living water shall flow forth to
visit, gladden, fructify some lesser or larger portion of the arid
waste around. Let us know and remember, then, that Jesus, the
divine Assuager of the thirst of human hearts, imparts the bless-
ing to each who comes to Him, that he may go and impart the
blessing to others."— Id., page 372.
    3. "Hardened as were their hearts, they were melted by His
words. While He was speaking in the temple court, they had
lingered near, to catch something that might be turned against
 Him. But as they listened, the purpose for which they had been
sent was forgotten. They stood as men entranced. Christ re-
 vealed Himself to their souls. They saw that which priests and
 rulers would not see,— humanity flooded with the glory of di-
vinity. They returned, so filled with this thought, so impressed
 by His words, that to the inquiry, 'Why have ye not brought
 Him?' they could only reply, 'Never man spake like this man.'
 —"Desire of Ages," page 459.
     4. The close connection between the last verse of chapter
 seven and the first verse of chapter eight is somewhat obscured
 by the division into chapters. While every man retired to the
 comforts of his own home, the Master went into the mountain
 to pray and seek strength for His work.
10          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   5. Like the Pharisees and Herodians at a later time in asking
Jesus about paying tribute to Caesar, the Pharisees by this ques-
tion meant to place Him in a dilemma. If He does not uphold
the Mosaic law, they reason, He will forfeit the respect of the
people. If He does, He will be advising a breach of the Roman
law.

                              Notes.

    1. " In the center of the Court of the Women, at the Feast of
Tabernacles, two tall stands were placed, each supporting four
large branching candelabra. After the evening sacrifice, all the
lights in these candelabra were kindled, the flame broad and
brilliant enough to illuminate the whole city, to remind the people
of the pillar of light by which their marchings through the wil-
derness were guided. And still freer and heartier than the morn-
ing jubilations which attended on the libation of the water, were
the evening ones, which accompanied the kindling of the lights."
 —Hanna: ".Life of Christ," page 373.
    2. How forcibly are we reminded that "He came unto His
 own, and His own received Him not." All through Jesus' life,
 the Father had borne witness to His Son. The visit of the wise
 men when Jesus was born, the incident at Jerusalem when He
 was twelve years old, the powerful testimony of John, Jesus'
 teaching and miraculous works, all bore unmistakable testimony
 to His divinity. Aside from this, the Father had spoken from
 heaven in testimony to His sonship.

                             Notes.

   1. God's eternal purposes will be accomplished. Ps. 33:1] ;
Isa. 46:10. Though the blighting curse of sin now rests upon
the earth and its inhabitants, it is an immutable fact in God's
purpose that sin is only a temporary intrusion and will be des-
troyed. Rev. 22:3. It is a thing of time and not of eternity. Thus
the servants of sin abide not forever. Here is the divine law
of the survival of the fittest.
    2. It was the predicted and declared purpose of .Jesus to free
from sin those who would accept Him. Isa. 42:7; Matt. 1:21;
Luke 4:18; 1 John 3:5. How slow we are to accept of the full
provisions of the Gospel. But every one who stands before the
Son of man at His coming must be wholly freed form the bondage
of sin. Rev. 14:5. See "Early Writings," page 61 old edition,
page 71 new edition.
   3. The slanderous insinuations concerning the character of
His birth (verses 19, 25), Jesus passed by apparently without
notice, endeavoring all the while to impress His hearers with
the truth of His unity with God, the unreasonableness of their
opposition to Him, and their need of regeneration.
    4. "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Be-
fore Abraham was born, I am." John 8:58, A.R.V. Jesus here
14          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

states clearly His pre-existence. He was associated with the
Father in the work of creation. Gen. 1:26. "All things were
made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that
was made." John 1:3.
    5. "Descent from Abraham was proved, not by name and
lineage, but by likeness of character. So the apostolic suc-
cession rests not upon the transmission of ecclesiastical authority,
but upon spiritual relationship. A life actuated by the apostles'
spirit, the belief and teaching of the truth they taught; this is
the true evidence of apostolic succession. This is what con-
stitutes men the successors of the first teachers of the Gospel."

    18. What is an exceptional feature of the miracle
recorded in this chapter? Note 6. ,
                              Notes.

    1. "It was generally believed by the Jews that sin is pun-
ished in this life. Every affliction was regarded as the penalty
of some wrong-doing, either of the sufferer himself or of his
parents. It is true that all suffering results from the transgres-
sion of God's law, but this truth had become perverted. Satan,
the author of sin and all its results, had led men to look upon dis-
ease and death as proceeding from God,— as punishment arbitrarily
inflicted on account of sin. Hence one upon whom some great
affliction or calamity had fallen, had the additional burden of
being regarded as a great sinner."—"Desire of Ages," pages
470, 471.
    2. "While Jesus corrected their error, He did not explain the
cause of the man's affliction, but told them what would be the
results."— Id., page 471.
    "Thus He transferred the question from intellectual ground
to that of the moral purpose which suffering might serve."—
Edersheim: "Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," Vol. f,
page 180.
    3. The wickedness of such a charge seems marvelous, yet such
is the blindness of those who have rejected light. They were very
zealous for what they conceived as the proper observance of
the Sabbath, yet were planning murder on that very day. They
had abundant ground for a charge against Him according to
their man-made laws. The making of clay, or the application
of a remedy where life or an organ was not in danger, was con-
sidered as Sabbath-breaking The application of saliva to the
eye was expressly forbidden. (Edersheim.)
    4. " Talmudic writings speak of two, or rather, we should say,
of three, kinds of excommunication,' of which the two first were
chiefly disciplinary, while the third was the real 'casting out,'
 unsynagoging," cutting oft from the congregation.' . , . The
first and lightest degree was . . . properly 'a rebuke,' an
inveighing. Ordinarily, its duration extended over seven days;
but if pronounced by the nasi, or head of the Sanhedrin, it
lasted for thirty days. . . . The second degree of Jewish
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      17
excommunication, the so-called niddui, . . . lasted for thirty
days at the least, although among Babylonians only for seven
days. At the end of that term there was 'a second admonition,'
which lasted other thirty days. If still unrepentant, the third or
real excommunication was pronounced, which was called the
cherem, or ban, and of which the duration was indefinite. Any
three persons, or even one duly authorized, could pronounce the
lowest sentence. The greater excommunication (niddui)— which,
happily, could only be pronounced in an assembly of ten — must
have been terrible, being accompanied by curses, and, at a later
period, sometimes proclaimed with the blast of the horn. . . .
Still more terrible was the final excommunication, or cherem, when
a ban of indefinite duration was laid on a man. Henceforth he
was like one dead. He was not allowed to study with others, no
intercourse was to be held with him, he was not even to be
shown the road. He might, indeed, buy the necessaries of life,
but it was forbidden to eat or drink with such an one."—Eder-
sheim: "Life and Times of Jesus," Vol. 2, pages 183, 184.
    5. "The man was made of sturdier stuff than his parents.
He was not to be overawed by their authority, or knocked down
by their assertions. . . . 'We know,' the Pharisees had said,
 that this man is a ,sinner."Whether He is a sinner,' the man
replied, `I do not know; one thing I do know, that being blind,
now I see.' Then they began again their weary and futile cross-
examination. 'What did He do to thee? How did He open thine
eyes?' But the man had had enough of this.            told you once,
and ye did not attend. Why do ye wish to hear again? Is it
possible that ye too wish to be His disciples?' Bold irony this
— to ask these stately,- ruffled, scrupulous Sanhedrists, whether
he was really to regard them as anxious and sincere inquirers about
the claims of the Nazarene Prophet! Clearly here was a man
whose presumptuous honesty would neither be bullied into sup-
pression nor corrupted into a lie. He was quite impracticable.
So, since authority, threats, blandishments, had all failed, they
broke into abuse.      hou art His uisciple: 'we are tne disciples of
Moses; of this man we know nothing." Strange,' he replies,
`that you should know nothing of a man who yet has wrought
a miracle such as not even Moses ever wrought; and we know
that neither He nar any one else could have done it, unless He
were from God.' finable to control any longer their transport of
indignation, they flung him out of the hall, and out of the
synagogue."— Farrar: "Life of Christ," chapter 41, pages
422,
    6. "If sifting the evidence for a miracle, stating every pos-
sible objection to it, discussing publicly, not centuries after-
18      • SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
wards, but at the time and on the spot, the whole details, turn-,
ing the occurrence out and in, back and forth, exhausting every
effort to shake its validity, and then finding that it has been
a veritable work above the ordinary processes of nature and be-
yond the powers of men — if such cross-examination should seem
to any one essential to his believing in the historicity of the
miracles,— in this instance it actually took place, and we have
the circumstantial record of it in this chapter.
   ''This treatment is entirely exceptional in the miracle-nar-
ratives; but on that account this single specimen has all the
greater apokigetic value. It can no more be said that the dif-
ficulties of the modern mind are wholly disregarded in the Gos-
pels. Here is precisely that argumentative handling of the
various difficulties about a miracle with which we are so familiar.
The occurrence is related. Then arise the questions upon it: Was
there really anything unusual done? How was it done? Who
was the doer of it? Was the doing of it a mark of divine com-
mission and authority? Who and what shall we conclude the
worker of it to be/ These and such as these are the questions
which every age — our own pre-eminently — has asked about the
miracles of Jesus. They are asked and answered, in this instance,
in presence of the facts themselves."— Laidtaw: "Miracles of
Our Lord," pages 289, 290.



           LESSON VI.— The Good Shepherd.
                      FEBRUARY 5, 1910.

     LESSON HELPS: "Desire of Ages," chapter 52.
                           Questions.

   1. What beautiful illustration did Jesus give of His
relation to His followers? John 10 : 1-3.
    2. How is the shepherd distinguished from the thief
and the robber? Will the true sheep follow a stranger?
Why not? Verses 4-6.
    3. In explaining, the parable, what did Jesus say of

Himself? What is said of those who came before Him?
Verses 7, 8. Note 1.

                              Notes.
   1. Not only is Jesus a door or entrance to life and safety,
but the only one. All those who at any time teach any other
way than the merits of Christ for salvation, whether they be
Jewish leaders, heathen philosophers, or professed Christian teach-
ers, are thieves and robbers; " for there is none other name under
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." See
"Desire of Ages," page 478.
20          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. " 'In Him was life.' He came that sinners under „sen-
tence of death might have life. And the life which He gives is
a more abundant life. Instead of a few short years of time,
He gives ages of eternity. But the abundance of life is not
merely in duration. The touch of God's Spirit intensifies life,
and gives it a larger meaning, with new purposes and ambitions.
Children of God have a new interest in the world of humanity
as the purchased possession of Christ. The new life must be a
fuller one, a deeper one than the old, giving birth to thoughts
more grave, feelings more deep,-- in a word, 'life more abun-
dant.' "—Dykes: "Christian World Pulpit," Pol. 14, page 177.
    3. What a precious lesson is this parable, or allegory, setting
forth so clearly the mission of Christ, and the intimate relation
existing between Him and His people. To get the force of the
iiiustration, we should understand shepherd life in the East.
    "As we sat and looked, almost spellbound, the silent hill-
sides around us were in a moment filled with life and sound.
The shepherds led their flocks forth from the gates of the city.
They were in full view, and we watched them and listened to
them with no little interest. Thousands of sheep and goats were
there, grouped in dense, confused masses. The shepherds stood
together until all came out. Then they separated, each shepherd
taking a different path, and .uttering, as he advanced, a shrill,
peculiar call. The sheep heard them. At first the masses swayed
 and moved, as if shaken by some internal convulsion; then points
struck out in the direction taken by the shepherds; these became
 longer and longer, until the confused masses were resolved into
 long, living streams, flowing after their leaders. Such a sight was
 not new to me, still it had lost none of its interest. It was,
 perhaps, one of the most vivid illustrations which human eyes
 could witness of that beautiful discourse' of our Lord recorded by
.Tohn."-- Porter, in "Bible Student's Manual," page 160.
     4. " 'Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down
 My life, that I might take it again.' That is, My Father has so
 loved you, that He even loves Me more for giving My life to
 redeem you. In becoming your substitute and surety, by sur-
 rendering My life, by taking your liabilities, your transgressions,
 I am endeared to My Father. . . . While as a member of the
 human family He was mortal, as God He was the fountain of
 life for the world. He could have withstood the advances of
 death, and refused to come under its dominion; but voluntarily
 He laid down His life, that He might bring life and immortality
 to light. He bore the sin of the world, endured its curse, yielded
 up His life as a sacrifice, that men might not eternally die."—

                              Notes.

   1. "The scenes of the past and••the future were presented to
the mint) of Jesus. He beheld Lucifer as he was first cast out from
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     23
the heavenly places. He looked forward to the scenes of His own
agony, when before all the worlds the character of the deceiver
should be unveiled. He heard the cry, 'It is finished,' announc-
ing that the redemption of the lost race was forever made certain,
that heaven was made eternally secure against the accusations,
the deceptions, the pretensions, that Satan would instigate.
   "Beyond the cross of Calvary, with its agony and shame, Jesus
looked forward to the great final day, when the prince of the
power of the air will meet his destruction in the earth so long
marred by his rebellion. Jesus beheld the work of evil forever
ended, and the peace of God filling heaven and earth."—"Desire
of Ages," page 490.
   2. The seventy returned, doubtless not all at one time, re-
joicing in their success even to the casting out of devils. They
were perhaps somewhat proud of doing what nine of Jesus' own
apostles had once failed to do. Jesus rejoiced with them, and
assured them of continual success, but warned them against self-
confidence. There was cause for greater joy than this.
   "There is a book of remembrance in the heavens, the Lamb's
Book of Life, in whieh the names of all His true and faithful
followers are written. It may be a great thing to have one's
name inscribed in large, enduring letters in the roll of those who
have done great things for Christ and for Christ's cause upon this
earth; but that earthly register does not correspond with the one
that is kept above. There are names to be found in the one that
will not be met with in the other. There are names which shine
bright in the one that appear but faintly luminous in the other.
There are names that have never been entered in the one that
beam forth with a heavenly brilliance in the other. The time comes
when over the one the waters of oblivion shall pass, and its records
be all wiped away. The time shall never come when the names
that shall at last be found written in the other shall be blotted
out."— Hanna: "The Life of Christ," page 410.
   3. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. 1' Cor. 2:14.
Those who trust in their own wisdom and prudence, can not un-
derstand God's truth.
   " The only way in which we can gain a more perfect appre-
hension of truth is by keeping the heart tender and subdued by
the Spirit of Christ. The soul must be cleansed from vanity and
pride, and vacated of all that has held it in possession, and Christ
must be enthroned within. Human science is too limited to com-
prehend the atonement. The plan of redemption is so far-reach-
ing that philosophy can not explain it. It will ever remain a
mystery that the most profound reasoning can not fathom. The
science of salvation can not be explained; but it can be known
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

by experience. Only he who sees his own sinfulness can discern
the preciousness of the Saviour."—"Desire of Ages," pages
494, 495.
    True science teaches us much of God, but can not fathom the
plan of salvation, because of its limitations. God expects us to
use our reasoning faculties; but they are limited, and must be
supplemented by revelation. Revelation is not contrary to reason,
but above it.
    4. "Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their
souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace
and quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when
Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence
there is perfect rest. The Lord says, Thou wilt keep him in per-
fect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee; because he trusteth in
Thee.' Our lives may seem a tangle; but as we commit ourselves
to the wise Master-worker, He will bring out the pattern of life
and character that will be to His own glory. And that character
which expresses the glory — character — of Christ, will be received
into the Paradise of God, A renovated race shall walk with Him
in white, for they are worthy."—"Desire of Ages," page 331.
    5. "Two pence," two denarii, about thirty-three cents, two
days' wages, or enough for several days' care.
    6. "Matters are placed on an entirely different basis from
that of Judaism. The question now is not, 'Who is my neighbor'?'
but, 'Whose neighbor am I?' The Gospel answers the question of
duty by pointing us to love. Wouldst thou know who is thy
neighbor'? Become a neighbor to all, by the utmost service thou
canst do them in their need.'!—Edersheim: "Life and Times of
Jesus the Messiah," page 239.

Note 6.
   17. What special help is promised to those who are
brought to trial for their faith in Christ? Verses
11, 12.
                              Notes.

    1. "He exposed the mere externalism of the Pharisaic law of
purification, to the utter ignoring of the higher need of inward
purity, which lay at the foundation of all."—Edersheim: "Life
and Times of Jesus the Messiah," page 211.
    2. "The three distinctions of a Pharisee were: not to make
use nor to partake of anything that had not been tithed; to ob-
serve the laws of purification; and, as a consequence of these two,
to abstain from familiar intercourse with all non-Pharisees. This
separation formed the ground of their claim to distinction. It
will be noticed that it is exactly to these three things our Lord
adverts: so that these sayings of His are not, as might seem, un-
connected, but in the strictest internal relationship. Our Lord
shows how Pharisaism, as regarded the outer, was connected with
the opposite tendency, as regarded the inner man: outward puri-
fication, with ignorance of the need of that inward purity which
consisted in God-consecration, and with the neglect of it; strict-
ness of outward tithing, with ignorance and neglect of the prin-
ciple which underlay it, viz., the acknowledgment of God's right
over mind and heart (judgment and love of God) ; while, lastly,
the Pharisaic pretense of separation, and consequent claim to dis-
tinction, issued only in pride and self-assertion. Thus, tried by
its own tests, Pharisaism terribly failed."—Id. page 212.
    3. The lawyers were the professional interpreters of the Jewish
law. As Geikie says, they sat in their chambers and schools,
creating "legal rules, endless, harassing, intolerable for the
people, but not affecting themselves, shut out as they were from
busy life."--"Life and Words of Christ," Pol. 2, page 141.
    4. By building these tombs they pretended to honor the
martyred prophets, thus gaining popularity; but their actions show
them to possess the same spirit as that which led their fathers
to kill the prophets.
    5. Hypocrisy is one of the worst forms of evil. "All shams
are hateful, but a religious sham is worst of all."— Abbott.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       27

Admitted into the life it will corrupt the whole nature, just as
it had pervaded all Pharisaism.
    " The religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God's
glory is the motive implanted by the Holy Spirit; and only the
effectual working of the Spirit can implant this motive. Only
the power of God can banish self-seeking and hypocrisy. This
change is the sign of His working. When the faith we accept
 destroys selfishness and pretense, when it leads us to seek God's
glory and not our own, we may know that it is of the right
order."—"Desire of Ages," page 409.
    6. "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that
 cometh into the world." John 1:9. " All that the Father giveth
 Me shall come to Me; and him that cometh to Me I will in no
 wise cast out." John 6:37.
    "But it is possible to drive the Spirit from us so that its plead-
ing voice can not be heard. To-day if ye will hear His voice harden
 not your hearts,' for 'the sin against the Holy Spirit is the sin
 of persistent rfusal to respond to the invitation to repent?"—
 Mrs. E. G. White, in "Review and Herald," June 29, 1897.

                              Notes.

- 1. How prone man is to trust in uncertain riches (1 Tim.
6:17), and selfishly to hoard God's gifts which were meant to be
 used to bless humanity and for the glory of God. But "to live
 for self is to perish. Covetousness, the desire of benefit for
self's sake, cuts the soul off from life. It is the spirit of Satan
 to get, to draw to self. It is the spirit of Christ to give, to sac-
 rifice self for the good of others." `Christ's Object Lessons,"
 page 259.
     It is not a sin to have worldly possessions. The Lord expects
 us to be diligent and economical in our business affairs (Rom.
12:11; Prov. 10:4; 27:23), that we may have wherewith to help
 the needy and support the Gospel. Eph. 4:28. The use we make
 of our means, in this selfish, • grasping age, is a good index to
 our Christian experience.
     2. As many prophets and kings had desired to witness the
 events connected with Jesus' first coming (Luke 10:24), so the
 prophets have spoken of and looked forward to the consummation
 of the Christian's hope (Acts 3:21) at His second coming. We
 are living in the last generation, with the light of all generations
 focused upon our pathway. To us much has been given, and of us
 much will be required.
     " The Lord measures with exactness every possibility for
 service. The unused capabilities are as much brought into ac-
 count as are these that are improved. For all that we might
 become through the right use of our talents God holds us respon-
 sible. We shall be judged according to what we ought to have
 done, but did not accomplish because we did not use our powers
 to glorify God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 363.

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      31
  13. What was the result of the Saviour 's words and
works? Verse 17. Note 3.
                              Notes.
    1. The Gospel is a Gospel of peace (Eph. 6:15), peace in the
individual heart, and peace in society as far as its principles are
received. But sin and righteousness are in deadly conflict; and
those who accept the Gospel are often, opposed by those who do
not, just as Cain was opposed to Abel "because his own works
were evil, and his brother's righteous." 1 John 3:12.
    •2. " As Jesus talked with the disciples and the multitude, He
looked forward with prophetic glance, and saw Jerusalem be-
sieged with armies. He heard the tramp of the aliens marching
against the chosen city, and saw the thousands upon thousands
perishing in the siege. Many of the Jews were, like those Gali-
leans, slain in the temple courts, in the very act of offering sacri-
fice. The calamities that had fallen upon individuals were warn-
ings from God to a nation equally guilty. 'Except ye repent,'
said Jesus, 'ye shall all likewise perish.' For a little time the day
of probation lingered for them. There was still time for them
to know the things that belonged to their peace.,"—"Christ's
Object Lessons," pages 213, 214.
     3. Edersheim makes some interesting comparisons of the nar-
rative of the three Sabbath controversies: in Jerusalem, in Galilee,
and in Perea.
     "In all, the spirit was the same. And, although the differences
between them may seem slight, they are characteristic, and mark,
as if they pointed to it with the finger, the locality and circum-
stances in which each took place. In Jerusalem there is neither
reasoning nor rebuke on the part of the Jews, but absolute per-
secution. There also the Lord enters on the higher exposition of
His actions, motives, and mission. In Galilee there is questioning
and cunning intrigue against Him on the part of the Judeans who
 dogged His steps. But while no violence can be attempted against
 Him, the people do not venture openly to take His part. But in
Perea we are confronted by the clumsy zeal of a country archi-
 synagogos (chief ruler of a synagogue), who is very angry, but
 not very wise; who admits Christ's healing power, and does not
 dare -to attack Him directly, but, instead, rebukes, not Christ, not
 even the woman who had been healed, but the people who wit-
 nessed it, at the same time telling them to come for healing on
 other days, not perceiving, in his narrow-minded bigotry, what this
 admission implied. This rustic ruler had not the cunning, nor
32          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
even the courage, of the Judean Pharisees in Galilee, whom the
Lord had formerly convicted and silenced. Enough, to show this
obscure Perean partizan of Pharisaism and the like of him their
utter folly, and that by their own admissions. And presently, not
only were His adversaries ashamed, while in Galilee they went out
and held a council against Him, but the people were not afraid,
as the Galileans had been in presence of their rulers, and openly
rejoiced in the glorious working of the Christ"— Edersheim:
"Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," pages 228, 224.

                              Notes.
    1. The Feast of Dedication was instituted by Judas Maccabeus '
in 164 B.c. in celebration of the redevotion of the temple to the
worship of Jehovah, after it had been polluted by heathen sacri-
fices by Antiochus Epiphanes. The feast began on the 25th of
the month Chisleu (November-December), and lasted eight days.
It did not require attendance at Jerusalem. It was an occasion
of much festivity.
    2. Solomon's porch was the colonnade on the east side of the
temple. See Acts 3:11; 5:12.
    3. Geikie explains this passage by the following paraphrase:
'Is it not written in your law of the rulers of Israel, the repre-
sentatives and earthly embodiments of the majesty of Jehovah,
your invisible King, 'I said, Ye are gods1' If God Himself
called them gods, to whom this utterance of His came — and you
can not deny the authority of Scripture — how can you say of
Me, whom the Father has consecrated to a far higher office than
ruler, or even prophet, to that of Messiah; and whom He has
not only thus set apart to this great office, but sent into the world,
clothed with mighty powers I have shown, and the fulness of
grace and truth you now see in Me,—that I blaspheme, because
I have said I am God's Son V '—"Life and Words of Christ,"
Vol. 2, page 808.
    4. If they could not believe the words, let them believe the
works. Recognizing the work as that of the Father, they would
come to understand that the Father worked through Him.
    5. The statement in verse 30 may refer not only to the coming
in of the Gentiles, but to the general truth that in that day
human judgment will often be reversed.
    6. "Jesus had now been for some time in Perea, in the terri-
tory of Antipas, the murderer of John. The intense unpopularity
of the crime had, doubtless, been a protection to Him; but, be-
sides the fact than Antipas personally feared the great Miracle-
worker, thinking He was perhaps the murdered Baptist, risen
from the dead, there were many other reasons why he should wish
Him fairly out of his dominions. Unwilling to appear in the
matter, he used the Pharisees, counting on their readiness to
further his end. Some of their number, therefore, came to Christ,
with the air of friends anxious for His safety, and warned Him
that it would be well for Him to leave Perea as quickly as possible,
as Herod desired to kill Him.
    "Jesus at once saw through the whole design, as a crafty plan
of Herod for His expulsion. But He was on His way to Jerusalem,
and contented Himself with showing that He gave no ground for
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    35

political suspicion, and that He quite well understood how little
friendship there was in the advice the Pharisees had given Him."
—Geikie: "Life and Words of Christ," Vol. 2, page 343.

36         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    8. What did Jesus' reference to the resurrection of
the just lead one of the guests to say? Verse 15.
    9. What further parable did Jesus put forth? What
did the servant announce? What excuses did those
make who were bidden? Verses 16-20.
    10. What further command was given the servant??

    11. What, in the parable, was the real reason for all

    12. What is taught by the bringing in of the unfor-
tunate classes? Note 4.
    13. In what way does the parable have a special
emphasis in the last days? Matt. 24: 14; Rev. 14: 6.
                             Notes.
   1. It is very probable from what follows that the man with
the dropsy was not one of the guests. He may, with oriental
freedom, have come in to look on, or he may have been placed
there by envious design.
   2. "The couches on which the guests reclined at meals were
arranged so as to form three sides of a square, the fourth being
left open to allow the servants to bring in the dishes. The
right-hand couch was reckoned the highest; and the others, the
middle and the lowest respectively, the places on each couch being
distinguished in the same way, from the fact that the guest who
reclined with his head, as it were, in the bosom of him behind,
seemed to be the lower of the two. The 'highest place' on the
highest couch was thus the 'chief place;' and human nature, the
same in all ages, inevitably made it be eagerly coveted, while, as
precedence was marked by nearness to it, there was an almost
equal anxiety to get as close to it as possible. With the vanity
and self-righteousness of a moribund caste, there was no little
scheming among the rabbis for the best position, and much
anxiety on the part of the host not to give offense; for to place
a rabbi below any one not a rabbi, or below a fellow rabbi of
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    37
lower standing, or younger, was an unpardonable affront, and
a discredit to religion itself. The intolerable pride that had made
one of their order, in the days of Alexander Janneus, seat him-
self between Alexander and his queen, on the ground that wisdom'
made its scholars sit among princes, remained unchanged. Such
petty ambition, so unworthy in. public teachers of morals and re-
ligion and so entirely in contrast with His own instructions to
His disciples, to seek no distinction but that of the deepest hu-
mility, did not fail to strike the Great Guest, who had calmly
taken the place assigned Him."— Geilcie: "Life and Words of
Christ," Vol. d, pages 319, 380.
    3. "All the excuses betray a preoccupied mind. To these in-
tended guests other interests had become all-absorbing. The in-
vitation they had pledged themselves to accept was put aside,
and the generous friend was insulted by their indifference."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," page .282.
    4. The parable was doubtless aimed at Jewish bigotry and
exclusiveness, and was meant to help His disciples gain a new
conception of the work which they must do for the Gentile
world. It is a lesson for all time. When Satan can not prevent
men from accepting Christ, He will endeavor to foster selfish
pride and build up. the feeling of caste. within the church.

this work of reclaiming the lost? Compare Heb. 1 : 14 ;
Luke 19 : 10.
                             Notes.

    1. "What hatred can that be, except the hatred of all that
stands in the way of and gainsays discipleship, whether it be
found in father or mother, in wife or child, in brother or sister,
nay, in one's own life even? It is the hatred of all that opposes
itself to the love of Christ, to the image and Spirit of Christ;
real hatred of what is really hateful, in spite of its being found
in the dearest of our fellow creatures or in our own beloved life.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    39
We must in no way seek to weaken this strong word, but only
explain it. The disciples must be prepared to forsake those the
most beloved, if Christ calls."— Lange: "Life of Christ," Vol.
2, pages 424, 425.
    The word "hate" in the text had the meaning at that time
of "love less, or hold in less esteem." See Matt. 10:37; Gen.
39:30, 31.
    2. The cost is to be counted on both sides. It costs some-
thing to be a Christian, but it costs more not to be one.
    3. This verse is translated by Rotherham as follows: "In
this way, then, every one from among you who is not bidding
adieu to all his goods, can not be My disciple."
    4. "The lost sheep knows that it is lost. It has left the
shepherd and the flock, and it can not recovcr itself. It repre-
sents those who realize that they are separated from God, and
who are in a cloud of perplexity, in humiliation, and sorely
tempted. The lost coin represents those who are lost in trespasses
and sins, but who have no sense of their condition. They are
estranged ,from God, and they know it not. Their souls are in
peril, but they are unconscious and unconcerned. In this parable
Christ teaches that even those who are indifferent to the claims
cf God, are the object of His pitying love. They are to be
sought for, that they may be brought back to God.
    "The sheep wandered away from the fold; it was lost in
 the wilderness or upon the mountains. The piece of silver was
lost in the house. It was close at hand, yet it could be recov-
ered only by diligent search."—" Christ's Object Lessons,"
 page 194.
