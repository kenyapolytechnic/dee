LIFE OF CHRIST       INTRODUCTORY NOTE
    THESE lessons conclude the series on the life of Christ. The
closing days of the life of our Lord upon earth are of special
interest. Every word is pregnant with meaning. The lessons are
worthy of earnest, prayerful study. Let the scenes described,, the
pictures drawn, stand before us in all their vivid reality. Let
us forget ourselves for the time, and in our imagination, guided
by the Spirit of God, dwell in Judea and see the chief Actor in
His closing work on earth for the children of men — from the
dark hours of Gethsemane to His death upon the cross and His
ascension to the Father — and then let the soul appreciate the
fact that all this was for us — for me.
    No parallel scriptures have been given, as the four Gospels have
been taken as the lesson scripture.
    These lessons are sent forth to our Sabbath-schools with the
prayer that the life of the Master may be transmuted into the
lives of all our people.

                           Notes
   1. Over the dark Kidron passed David in sorrow and agony
in his flight from Jerusalem a thousand years before; over the
Kidron to His awful agony for a lost world passed David's Son,
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       5
the promised Seed. Gethsemane was an inclosure at the foot of
the Mount of Olives. Here our Lord was accustomed to go with
His disciples for prayer and instruction. Little did they realize
the meaning of this last journey across the historic brook.
    2. "The sorrow that came upon Him was so overwhelming and
crushing that it pressed Him down to the earth, and penetrated
soul and body with insupportable anguish."—Daniel March,
"Night Scenes of the Bible." See Isa. 53:10, 12.
   3: The humanity of our Lord shrank from the awful agony
before Him; not the - physical suffering alone; not the mocking, the
shame, the anguish; 'but from the awful sense of sin which hid
the Father's face, and weighed upon the Son of Man like the
agony of a lost soul. No wonder He prayed that if possible the
cup be removed. God did not condemn Him for that. He does
not condemn _us when we, in human weakness, pray for deliverance
from some awful trial. God pities and loves us still; for "He
knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust." He
loved not less His Son in dark Gethsemane than on the shining
Mount of Transfiguration.              .
    4. It was only a little while before this that Peter had avowed
himself ready to go with Jesus to prison or to death-; now he could
not watch with his Lord one short hour. Have we in our experi-
ence clone better7.
    5. The angel could not lessen the load, could not take the
burden upon the Saviour's heart, could not bear the cross, though
he would willingly have done so; but he brought strengthening
grace and cheer from the Throne. Even-so with us. For our own
good there may be burdens, heavy to bear,'laid upon us, that we
may draw• needed strength from the infinite Source.
    6. "The hour is come." The long delayed hour had come,
the crisis of the world, when divinity, compassed about with the
infirmities of humanity, met its supreme test. The Saviour had
anticipated the struggle before; He had talked of it with Moses
and Elijah; He had poured out His soul in prayer during entire
night seasons concerning it; now the reality had come.
   "Yet a third time He left them to pray as before. And now
He returned victorious. After three assaults had the tempter left
Him in the wilderness; after the threefold conflict in the garden
he was vanquished. Christ came forth triumphant. No longer
did He bid His disciples watch. They might, nay, 'they should,
sleep and take rest, ere the near terrible events of His betrayal —
for, the hour had come when the Son of Man was to be betrayed
into the hands of sinners."—Edersheim's "Life ,and Times of
Jesus," volume 2, page 541.

                              Notes
   1. "As these words [" I am He"] were spoken, the angel who
had lately ministered to Jesus, moved between Him and the
mob. A divine light illuminated the Saviour's face, and a dove-like
form overshadowed Him. In the presence of this divine glory,
the murderous throng could not stand for a moment. They stag-
gered back. Priests, elders, soldiers, and eyea Judas, fell as dead
men to the ground.
,8          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    " The angel withdrew, and the light faded away. Jesus had
opportunity to escape, but He remained, calm and self-possessed.
As one glorified He stood in the midst of that hardened band, now-
prostrate and helpless at His feet. The disciples looked on, silent
with wonder and awe."—"Desire of Ages," chapter 74, page 694.
    2. In view of all that Judas bad witnessed of Christ's miracu-
lous power and ability to read hearts, it seems strange indeed that
he,should attempt thus to betray Him. His act shows the blind-
ing, hardening power of sin, and how false teachers will come up
to the very judgment bar of God and say, "Lord, Lord, have we
not prophesied in Thy name'? and in Thy name have cast out
devils' and in Thy name done many wonderful works'?" Yet
Christ had never known them. They were workers of iniquity.
Matt. 7:21-23.
    3. "This is your hour, and the power of darkness." Recall
Luke 4:13, A.R.V.: "When the devil had completed every temp-
tation, he departed from Him for a season." At that time Jesus
was in the hands of the prince of darkness to be tempted as only
the devil could tempt. Now in the close of His earthly ministry He
is again in the hands of the power of darkness. His time has
now come. Now He is " delivered up" to that awful period which
ends only with His death and resurrection.
    4. "A certain young man." The incident is related only by
Mark, whose mother lived in Jerusalem. Acts 12:12. It has
been conjectured that Mark was the "young man." "When the
soldiers had come to seek Jesus in the upper chamber of his home,
Mark, aroused from sleep, had hastily cast about him the loose
linen garment or wrapper that lay by his bedside, and followed
the armed band to see what would come of it. He now lingered
in the roar, and followed as they led away Jesus, never imagining
that they would attempt to lay bold on him, since he had not
been with the disciples nor yet in the garden. But they, perhaps
Jewish servants of the high priest, had noticed him. They at-
tempted to lay hold on him, when, disengaging himself from their
grasp, he left his upper garment in their hands, and fled. "--
Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 545.
   5. They took Him to Annas, the ex-high priest, who had been
deposed by Valerius Gratus, and Joseph (Caiaphas), son-in-law to
Annas, appointed in his stead. The Jews seemed still to recognize
Annas as rightly holding the office.

                             Notes
    1. From the haughty Annas Jesus is taken before the imperious
Caiaphas, a Sadducee, and the legal head, by permission of Rome,
of the Jewish Sanhedrin,
    2. Though Peter had forsaken Jesus and fled, he still loved
his Master. He must see Him, even to the end. .Matt. 26:58.
But he "followed Him afar off." The devil's most effective
temptations come to us when we are following "afar off." Let
there be no doubt where you stand; follow close to the Master,
and no one will ask, "Are you .this Man's disciple?"
    3. The Sanhedrin was the regular Jewish legal court, but with-
out the power to sentence to death. It was the death of Jesus,
however, which they hoped to compass. That they might discredit
Him before the Jews, they were determined to prove Him guilty
of death before the Sanhedrin. That they might have their sen-
tence executed, they desired to prove Him guilty of conspiracy
against the Roman government. "Oa that night of terror, when
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   11
all the enmity of man and the power of hell were unchained,
even the falsehood of malevolence could not lay any crime to His
charge, nor yet any accusation be brought against Him other
than the misrepresentation of His symbolic Words. What tes-
timony to Him this solitary false and ill-according witness! "—
Edersheint's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 561.
    4. To their unjust charges and false testimony our Lord did
not reply. But when the high priest in judicial capacity em-
ployed the form of legal oath, Jesus responded.
    5. "In these words Christ presented the reverse of the scene
then taking place. He, the Lord of life and glory, would be
seated at God's right hand. He would be the judge of all the
earth, and from His decision there could be no appeal."—"Desire
of Ages," chapter 75, page 707.
    6. It was those who held Jesus in custody who maltreated Him
 (See Luke 22:63), the Sanhedrin not forbidding. He was not
yet legally condemned. No sentence could be passed in the night.
The night trial was informal, and a just tribunal would have for-
bidden the abuse and maltreatment of a criminal. But the
Master bore it all silently, patiently—for us.
    7. How many times men have habits to which they think they
will never return. When Peter "followed Him afar off," he was
in the devil's domain; and it was an easy thing to become again
a rough, swearing man. We may see by this incident where grace
 found him. God wants, by His abundant grace to do for others
all that He did for Peter.

What further charges did they make? Luke 23 : 5.
                             Notes
    1. This seems to have been a formal meeting of the San-
hedrin in the morning for the passing of the legal sentence, and
approving the acts of the night previous.
    2. The confession of Judas was in effect a clear charge against
the priests and elders of bribery. Thirty pieces of silver was the
price of a slave. Ex. 21:32.
    3. The Sanhedrin had condemned Jesus for blasphemy, but
they could not put Him to death. They now wanted the death
sentence passed by the Romans.
    4. "The question which he [Pilate] addressed to them seems
to have startled and disconcerted them. Their procedure had
been private; it was of the very essence of proceedings at Roman
law that they were in public. Again, the procedure before the
sanhedrists had been in the form of a criminal investigation,
while it was of the essence of Roman procedure to enter only on
definite accusations."—Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus,"
volume 2, page 568.
     5. Pilate's reply was a reminder to the Jews that they were a
 subject nation. It must have recalled to their minds the cause of
 their condition; namely, sin. 'Yet they were condemning the One'
 who came to save them. Jesus was to be lifted up, and die upon
 the cross. This implied crucifixion, and the Romans now used
 this mode of punishment. The Jews would have stoned Him to
 death.
14         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   6. , "Pilate at this time had no thought of condemning Jesus.
He knew that the Jews had accused Him through hatred and
prejudice. He knew what his duty was. Justice demanded that
Christ should be immediately released. But Pilate dreaded the ill
will of the people. Should he refuse to give Jesus into their
hands, a tumult would be raised, and this be feared to meet."

16          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

19. What was Pilate's final decision regarding Jesus?
Luke 23: 24, 25; Matt. 27 :26.
                                Notes
    1. The Herod here mentioned was Herod Antipas, son of Herod
the Great, by Malthace, a Samaritan woman. He was own brother
to Archelaus. His tetrarchy extended over Galilee and Perea.
He was wholly unprincipled, and became worse after he slew
John the Baptist. He had come down to Jerusalem to attend
the Passover. Grotius declares that it was the custom of the
Romans to send a criminal to the ruler or judge of the district
where his crime had been committed, and Pilate seized upon this
practise as an easy way out of a troublesome duty.
    2. The enmity between Pilate and Herod may be explained
by reference to Luke 13:1. It is generally supposed that Pilate
had incurred the enmity of Herod by his jurisdiction in the slaying
of the Galileans. This he acknowledged by sending Jesus to
Herod, and Herod shows his reconciliation by sending Jesus back
to Pilate. This is neither the first nor the last time that the
agencies of evil have united to suppress or destroy the truth.
    3. This is the third time, twice by Pilate and once by Herod,
that Jesus has been pronounced guiltless. This position the Roman
governor should have steadfastly maintained. But Pilate was au
unprincipled time-server, willing to sacrifice principle to be popu-
lar. His next step was a compromise.
    4. Though one reads the story a hundred times, he longs each
time that Pilate-would prove true to his convictions and release
Jesus. But each time he fails, each time yields a little more of
truth and right, and entangles himself more securely in Satan's
web. What a lesson this ought to be to each one of us!
    5. " The Jews were accustomed to wash their hands when they
wished to show that they were innocent of a crime committed by
others. See Deut. 21:6; Ps. 26:6. Pilate, in doing this, meant
to denote that they were -guilty of His death, but that he was in-
nocent."— Barnes's Notes. -
   No Oat can lay the responsibility of his actions upon others.
Pilate could not wash his hands of the evil deed. He-himself
said-to Jesus, "I have power to crucify Thee, and I-have -power_
to release Thee."
    6. "Some thirty years later, and on that very spot, was judg-
ment, pronounced against some of the best in Jerusalem; and
among the 3,600 victims of the governor's fury, of whom not a
few were' scourged and crucified right over against the pretorium,
were- many of the noblest of the citizens of Jerusalem. A few
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   17
years more, and hundreds of crosses bore Jewish mangled bodies
within sight of Jerusalem."—Edersheim's "Life and Times of
Jesus," volume 2, page 578.

             Effort to Release Him

drink? Matt. 27 : 33, 34. Note 7.
                                Notes
     1. "Into the common hall," or the pretorium, or governor's
/house. (See margin.) The whole band, or cohort, gathered to-
 gether to mock Jesus. He had endured six trials; before Annas,
 before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin at night, before the same body
 in the morning, before Pilate, before Herod, and again before
 Pilate. At last, to appease the mob, sentence is given against
 Him. Yet after all this, Pilate puts forth one more effort to save
 the Prisoner whom he feared, and knew was innocent.
     2. Once more Pilate seeks to release Jesus. Once more he de-
 clares, "I find no fault in Him." Once more he halts, waits,
 hesitates, falters, fails.
     "'Behold the Man!' It is probable that Pilate pointed
 to the Saviour, and his object evidently was to move them to com-
 passion, and to convince them, by a sight of the Saviour Himself,
 that He was innocent. . . . The conduct of Pilate was as if he
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     19

had said, 'See! The Man whom you accuse is arrayed in a gor-
geous robe, as if a king. He has been scourged and mocked. All
this He has borne with patience. See! How calm and peaceful!
Behold His countenance! How mild! His body scourged, His
head pierced with thorns! Yet in all this He is meek and patient.
This is the Man that you accuse; and He is now brought forth,
that you may see that He is not guilty.' "— Barnes's Notes on
John, 19.
    3. "Judgment-seat. The tribunal or place of pronouncing
sentence. He came here to deliver Him, in due form of law, into
the hands of the Jews.
    "Pavement. This was an area or room of the judgment-hall
whose floor was made of small square stones of various colors.
This was common in palaces and houses of wealth and splendor.
    "Gabbatha. This word is not elsewhere used. It comes from
a word signifying to be elevated. The name given to the place
by the Hebrews was conferred from its being the place of the
tribunal; as an elevated place."— Barnes.
    4. Pilate had before this delivered Jesus to his soldiers to be .
crucified. Yet he makes one more attempt to move the Jews to
pity and release Jesus. But their heart is closed to pity, and
 they even repudiate God's rulership over them. They had re-
 jected God's Representative, and had demanded His death, and
said, "His blood be upon us and upon our children;" and finally,
 as the climax of rebellion, they repudiated Jehovah their King,
 by declaring, "We have no king but Cesar."
     5. "The name [Golgotha] can not have been derived from the
skulls which lay about, since such exposure would have been
 unlawful, and hence must have been due to the skull-like shape and
 appearance of the place. Accordingly, the name is commonly ex-
 plained as the Greek form of the Aramnan Gulgalta, or the Hebrew
 Gulgoleth, Which means a skull."—Edersheim's "Life and Times
 of Jesus," volume 2, page, 585.
     6. " 'For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall
 be done in the dry,' By the green tree, Jesus represented Him-
 self, the innocent Redeemer. God suffered His wrath against trans-
 gression to fall on His beloved Son. Jesus was to be crucified
 for the sins of men. What suffering, then, would the sinner bear
 who continued in sine All the impenitent and unbelieving would
 know a sorrow and misery that language would fail to express."
  —"Desire of Ages," chapter 78, page 743.
     "For, if Israel had put such flame to its 'green tree,' how
 terribly would the divine judgment burn among the dry wood of
 an apostate and rebellious people, that had so delivered up its
 divine King, and pronounced sentence upon itself by pronouncing
20         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
it upon Him! "—Edersheim's "Life and Times of Jesus," volume
8, page 588.
    7. "It was a merciful Jewish practise to give to those led
to execution a draught of strong wine mixed with myrrh, so as
to deaden consciousness. This charitable office was performed at
the cost of, if not by, an association of women in Jerusalem.
That draught was offered to Jesus when He reached Golgotha.
But having tasted it, and ascertained its character and object;
He would not drink it. It was like His former refusal of the
pity of the 'daughters of Jerusalem.' "—Edersheim's "Life and
Times of Jesus,' volume 2, pages 589, 590.

  17. What then is the force of the word "to-day" in
His reply to the thief? Note 2.
                              Notes
    1. "The evangelists differ in the account of this title. Mark
 (15:26) says it was The King of the Jews.' Luke (23:38),
'This is the King of the Jews.' John (19:19), 'Jesus of Nazareth,
the King of the Jews.' But the difficulty may be easily removed.
John says that the title was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
It is not at all improbable that the inscription varied in these
languages. One evangelist may have translated it from the
1-Tebrew, another from the Greek, a third from the Latin, and a
fourth may have translated one of the inscriptions a little dif-
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 ferently from another. Besides, the evangelists all agree in the
main point of the inscription; viz., that He was the King of the
Jews."— Barnes's Notes on Matthew 27.
    2. "It is left for the reader to determine whether the words
`this day' should be joined (A) with the former part of the sen-
tence, or (13) with the latter. In favor of (A) may be urged (1)
the fact that semeron, 'this day,' does not always stand first in
the clause to which it belongs (see Luke 2:11; 5:26; 22:34; Acts
20:26; 22:3; 24:21; 26:29); (2) that being essentially a demon-
strative word, it will bear any reasonable stress which may be
laid upon it, whether it be placed before or after the words which
it qualifies; (3) that it is far from meaningless if regarded as be-
longing to the opening words of asseveration (`Thou dost ask to
be remembered then; verily thou art assured now. As on this
the day of My weakness and shame, thou hast faith to ask, I this
day have authority to answer') ; (4) that the latter part of the
verse is thus left free to refer to the very matter of the suppli-
cant's request ("Thou dost ask to, be remembered when I come
in My kingdom: thou shalt be in My kingdom; shalt be with. Me
in the very Paradise of My kingdom, in the garden of the Lord
— Isa. 51:3 [Sept., paradeisos]; Eze. 36:35; compare Gen. 2:8
  Sept., paradeisos]; Gen. 3:2 [Sept., paradeisos]; Rev. 2:7 —in
that most central and blessed part of the coming kingdom, of
which thou dost believe Me to be the destined king.' "—Bother-
ham's Translation, note on Luke 23:43.

                               Notes
    1. The sixth hour mentioned by John (chapter 19:14) seems
to be Roman time, or six o'clock in the morning. John wrote his
Gospel many years later than the other evangelists. The sixth
hour of Matthew was noon. The sun was darkened; nature was
convulsed at the death of her Author. The heavens were clad
in the garb of mourning, the darkness lasting from noon until
3 P.M. It was not an eclipse of the sun, for a. total eclipse of
the sun can not last at any place above four minutes, while this
darkness lasted three hours. Hales's Chronology, volume 1, page
70, quotes from an old Roman document,.written by Aurelius Cas-
siodorius Senator, about A.D. 514, as follows: "In the consulate
of Tiberius Ccesar Augustus V and /Elias Sejanus (u. C. 784,
A.D. 31), our Lord Jesus Christ suffered on the 8th of the Calends
of April (25th of March); when there happened such an eclipse
of the sun as was never seen before nor since."
    Hales continues: "In this year, and in this day, agree also
the Council of Casarea, A.D. 196, or 198; the Alexandrian Chron-
icle, Maximus Monadeus, Nieephorus Constantinus, Cedremus,"
and approved for this year though on a different date by Euse-
bius and Epiphanius, helper, Bucher, Petavius.
    "This obscuration of the sun must have been preternatural, in
its extent, duration, and opposition of the moon, at full, to the
sun. It was observed at Heliopolis in Egypt, by Dionysius, the
areopagite, afterwards the illustrious convert of Paul at Athens,
Acts 17:34, who, in a letter to the martyr Polycarp, describes
his own and his companion, the sophist Apollophanes' astonishment
at the phenomenon, when they saw the darkness commence at the
eastern limb of the sun, and proceed to the western, till the whole
was eclipsed; and then regrade backwards, from the western to the
eastern, till his light was fully restored; which they attributed
to the miraculous passage of the moon across the sun's disk.
Apollophanes exclaimed, as if divining the cause, These, 0 good
Dionysius, are the vicissitudes of divine events! ' DionYsius an-
swered, 'Either the Deity suffers, or He sympathizes with the
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON- QUARTERLY                 •    25

 Sufferer!' And that Sufferer, according to tradition, record by
  Michael Syncellus, of Jerusalem, he declared to be 'the unknown
 God, for whose sufferings all nature was darkened and con-
  vulsed.' "—Hales's Chronology, volume 3, page 230.
-     2. These words marked the close of a period of agony, the
 climak of the Saviour's suffering. It was the sinner's Substi-
  tute, made sin for us, suffering in our stead, overwhelmed with
  the awful load of the world's iniquity. It seemed as though
  God had forever shut Himself away from the divine Sufferer;
  had forsaken Him in His last trial.
      3. Our Lord's sayings upon the cross number seven, as fel-
  lows: (1) "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
  do;," (2) "Verily, I say unto thee to-day, shalt thou be with Me
 in Paradise;" (3) "Woman, behold thy son!" "Behold thy
  mother!" (4) "My God, My God, why bast Thou forsaken Mel"
  (5) "I thirst;" (6) "It is finished;" (7) "Father, into Thy
  hands I commend My spirit."
     •4. When Jesus died, the graves were opened with the quaking
  of the earth. But those in the graves did not then arise. It was
  sin that had locked the graves of men; but Jesus died to save
  men from sin.; hence the graves were opened. But the sleepers
  did not come forth from the dead till Christ the first-fruits arose.
      5. "Sometimes there was added to the punishment of cruci-
  fixion that of breaking the bones by means of a club or hammer.
  This would not itself bring death; but the breaking of the bones.
   was always followed by a coup de grace [a finishing stroke], by
  sword, lance, at stroke, which immediately put an end to what
  remained of life. Thus the 'breaking of the. bones' was a sort of
  increase of punishment, by way of compensation for its shortening
  by the final stroke that followed."—Edersheim's "T_Afe and
  Times of Jesus," volume 2, page 613.

  18. What question perplexed them on their way?
Mark 16: 3. Note 3.
  19. What did they find when they reached the tomb?
Verse 4.
                               Notes
     1. The records of Joseph, given by the four evangelists, are in-
 dependent, and though differing in language and particulars, are
 not contradictory. He seems not to have been called to the meet-
 ings of the Sanhedrin when Jesus was tried, though he was a
 member. In a time of great need he comes forward, "boldly,"
 we are told by one evangelist, but "secretly" by -another, so as
 to stir up no violent clamor or trouble, which would have been
 particularly unseemly at such a time. He furnishes his own new
 tomb for the Master.
     2. Nicodemus at first came to Jesus by night; but it was a
 night which brought light to his soul. He next dared raise his
'voice before the Sanhedrin demanding fair treatment of Jesus.
 "both our law condemn any man before it hear him, and know
 what he doeth?" he said. Now he comes forward in this time
 of peril and utter need to identify himself with the Crucified One,
,who was lifted up.
     3. "Who shall roll us away the stone?" This was a natural,
 human question. How many times we ask it in our blindness and
 unbelief. We seek the realization of our hopes in the places of the.
  dead, and dream them locked. But when we reach them our
  doubts are solved, the stones are rolled away, our dead hopes are
 transmuted by God's power into living blessings, our sleeping friend
 into a living Saviour.

the disciples? Matt. 28 : 9, 10.
   17. When they told the disciples that they had seen

   18. While the women were going to tell the disciples,

   19. What did the Sanhedrin deliberately decide to
 do? Verses 12-14.
   20. What evil report followed their action? Verse 15.
                               Notes
   1. " He goeth before you." It is not in past traditions, how-
ever holy; it is not in past conceptions of truth, however much
they may have been blessed; it is not in dead creeds written by
men, however good; it is not in plans once successful, that our
success lies; it is in following the present living Christ in -
His work to-day, out into the great field where the need lies.
80           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    ''Tell His disciples and Peter." Poor, discouraged, repentant
Peter. He is not forgotten by his Lord. The last time he had
seen Him was after his threefold denial. Now when risen from
the dead Jesus remembers His sorrowing disciple, and fearing he
will in his despondency conclude the Master does not care for
him, He asks that Peter especially be told that He is risen from
the dead. We have the same loving, compassionate Saviour
to-day.
    2. Seeth the napkin "wrapped together in a place by itself."
God is a God of system and order — no disorder seen even in
the grave, no haste displayed in leaving the tomb. In that napkin
wrapped up and placed by itself is given the lie to the tale told
by the soldiers that while they slept the disciples stole away
His body. Had thieves disturbed the tomb they would not have
waited to place things in order.
    3. The individual characteristics of Peter and John are seen
in their visit to the tomb. Peter, rash and impetuous, went into
the tomb as soon as he reached it. John, more cautious and de-
liberate, first looked in, going in later.
    4. erftvisiting the sepulcher the disciples went to their home.
Not so with Mary. She could not go home. She had lost her
Lord, and could not rest till she bad found Him. She remains by
the sepulcher to weep. It is always to such anxious souls that the
Lord appears. While weeping her Lord appears with words of
comfort. She was the first to greet Him when risen from the dead.

What did He breathe upon them? What authority did

  18. Which of the disciples was absent when Jesus met

  19. What did Thomas say when the disciples told him
they had seen the Lord? Verse 25.
                               Notes
    1. The name "Emmaus" means "warm springs." It was a
little town about seven and one half miles from Jerusalem. Its
location is not now identified with certainty. It was doubtless in
the afternoon when the disciples left Jerusalem, for the day was
far spent when they reached Emmaus. These two disciples were
not of the twelve, but of "the rest." Luke 24:9.
     2. "But their eyes were holden," with disappointed hopes, and
sad and troubled at the perplexing tidings they bad received con-
cerning the empty tomb and the absent body. So in our perplex-
ity and trials the blessed Master is near to us, but our eyes are
often holden through unbelief, and we do not behold Him.
     3. They rehearsed the events of the last three days, the be-
trayal and trials of Jesus, their own disappointment, the visit
to the sepulcher, the half-believed story of His resurrection. Note
that of the three days in which all these things happened this
is "the third day," thus showing how elastic is the term over
which many are led into controversy. The three days so often
mentioned in connection with the Saviour's sufferings include
parts of two days and the whole of one.
     4. Jesus might have easily convinced them of His resurrec-
tion by showing them His wounded hands, or revealing His power
in some supernatural way. But He desired that their belief in
Him should rest, not on sight, or some miraculous revelation, but
on the Scriptures. In like manner He desires that we believe in
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     33
Him, not because we see some miracles performed, but on the plain
statement of the Scriptures themselves.
    5. Do we desire the Lord's presence sufficiently, to urge that
He abide with us? We often urge the coming or tarrying of a
friend. Would not Christ be oftener our companion in the com-
mon things of life if we but urged or "constrained" Him more?

                             Notes
     1.
      The record alludes to a time when this appointment was
made to meet the disciples in Galilee. It was doubtless on one
of the occasions when Jesup met with the disciples. Jesup desired
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     35
to meet with them again in the field of their early labors where
some of His mighty miracles were wrought.
    2. "The prophecy is a picture of Peter's strong, assertive
action, going impulsively where he chose, just as a few minutes
before he had girded himself and plunged through the shoal water
to Jesus' feet. But in his old age he would stretch forth his hands
in unwonted helplessness, perhaps to allow them to be fastened
to the transverse beams of a cross; and the executioner would
gird him, fastening him to the cross with cords; and he should be
carried to death against his natural will, though glad thus to
suffer for his Lord."—Peloubet's Notes on John 21.
    3. "It was probably in impatience, as if John were intruding
without warrant, that he asked, Lord, and what shall this man do?
Perhaps, however, the question arose only from a natural curiosity
to know his friend's fate, now that he knew his own. Christ
rebuked Peter by the sharp question, If I will that he tarry till
I come, what is that to thee? The rebuke was twofold. It im-
plied Peter would better concern himself with asking what he
should do than with thought about another's conduct a lesson
we all need to learn."— Id.

30, 31; 21 : 25.
                                Notes
     1. It is not likely that any among the eleven doubted. The
doubters must have been among the others who gathered at that
time, perhaps among the five hundred brethren mentioned by
Paul.
     2. Better "all authority" as in the A.R.V. The word is not
dunamis, power, but authority ( exausia), including ability, place,
rulership, right to exercise power. The word dunamis is used in
Acts 1:8. " 'All power is given unto Me.' Did you ever think
how much power there is on earth, There is the power of the
wind. Do you know of anybody who can control that'? There is
the power of the waves. Do you know of anybOdy who can master
them'? There are the powers of nature; the heaving of the tides;
the swelling of the seeds in the earth; the mighty upspringing that
clothes the fields with grass. There is the power of the clouds.
There is the power of heat in which the strongest iron that ever
was forged will melt. There is the power which pours down
floods from on high. . . . Think of the millions of glowing orbs
that flame through the skies. Think of this world rolling in its
mighty orbit. Think of the sun, sweeping on in its eternal path-
way. Think of the power that moves these things. Some people
 do not understand how the sun could be made to stand still. Well,
 if you will tell me what keeps it going, I will tell you how it was
made to stand still. All power in the universe. . . . All power
 over men; all power over devils; all power over everything.
 'All power.' You have no power over the winds, but He could
 speak to the winds and they obeyed Him. You have no power
 over the waves, but He could say, 'Peace, be still,' and there
 was a great calm. You have no power over 'all manner of
 diseases,' but when He spoke to the sick, He healed them. You
 have no power over evil spirits, but He cast out devils with His
 word. You have no power over the dead, but He called them
 from the silence of the tomb and bade them live."—H. L.
 Hastings.
      3. The instruction imparted in Luke 24:44, 45 at first glance
 appears to be given in the upperr room the day of the resurrection
 when the disciples returned from Emmaus. But James P. Cadman,
 in "Christ in the Gospel," in giving the chronological order of
  the events and words 'of Christ, gives it as His parting instruction;
 and a careful reading of the chapter to the end indicates that he
  is perhaps correct. As we have followed largely the arrangement
38          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
of Mr. Cadman in these lessons on the life of Christ, we follow
it here also, without offering any argument as to the exact order
of events. A careful study of the instruction given is the vital
thing. '
    4. Not to Bethany, but as far as to Bethany, to the brow of
Olivet, that wonderful mountain so full of rich remembrances,
and to which He will come at the close of the thousand yeah.
Zech. 14:4, 5.
    5. 0 for the same spirit now of self-renunciation, and giving
all for the Master, as was manifested in the lives of the apostles;
for the same love for the mission entrusted to us; for the same
faith; for the same devotion to the personal Christ and His soon
coming again; for the same reception of the Holy Spirit in its
fulness of power to cleanse from sin, to fit for labor, to witness
for the Master. How soon would His message for this time go
"everywhere" confirmed by the power of God. Let us believe
His Word, and believing, receive His life.

                             Notes
    1. The tree of knowledge of good and evil placed in the midst
of the Garden of Eden tested man's loyalty, as well as constantly
reminding him that his home was his only as a gift from nix
Maker. That one tree would stand as a silent witness to man that
the supreme ownership or title of the world was held by his-God,
yet so long as he proved loyal to the government of heaven, the
home was his.
    "At the very beginning of man's existence a check was placed
40          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

upon the desire for self-indulgence, the fatal passion that lay at
the foundation of Satan's fall. The tree of knowledge, which
stood near the tree of life in the midst of the garden, was to be
a test of the obedience, faith, and love of our first parents."
"While they remained true to God, Adam and his companion were
to bear rule over the earth. Unlimited control was given them
over every living thing."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages
48-50.
    2. All about us we see the results of our first parents' sin in
disregarding God's ownership and command concerning the tree
of knowledge of good and evil placed in the midst of the Garden
of Eden. The terrible crimes committed and the universal reign of
 disease and death constantly remind us of the truthfulness of
God's words to Adam as to what should result from his diso-
bedience.
    3. ''Every Christian is a steward of God, entrusted with His
goods. Remember the words, 'Moreover it is required in stewards,
that a man be found faithful.' 1 Cor. 4:2. Let us be sure that we
are not robbing God in any jots and tittles; for much is involved
in this question. All things belong to God. Man may ignore His
claims. While He bountifully bestows His blessings upon them,
they may use His gifts for their own selfish gratification, but they
will be called to give an account of their stewardship."—"Testi-
 monies," volume 9, page 246.
    "My brethren, the money that you use to buy and sell and get
gain will be a curse to you if you withhold from the Lord that
which is His. The means entrusted to you for the advancement
of the Lord's work should be used in sending the gospel to all
parts of the world."— Id., page 53.
