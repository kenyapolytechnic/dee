A STUDY OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
                FOR SENIOR CLASSES


              SECOND QUARTER, 1906


                        General Note.
    The main characteristics of this epistle, says Barnes, are
these: 1. It is full of love. The writer dwells on it; places it
in a variety of attitudes; enforces the duty of loving one
another by a great variety of considerations, and shows that
it is essential to the very nature of religion. 2. The epistle
abounds with statements on the evidences of piety, or the
characteristics of true religion. . . . A large part of the
epistle is occupied with this, and there is perhaps no portion
of the New Testament which one who is desirous of ascertain-
ing whether he himself is a true Christian could study to
more advantage. An anxious inquirer, a man who wishes
to know what true religion is, could be directed to no portion
of the New Testament where he would more readily find the
instruction that he needs, than to this portion of the writings
of the aged and experienced disciple whom Jesus loved. A
true Christian can find nowhere else a more clear statement
of the nature of his religion, and of the evidences of real
piety, than in this epistle.
                          A Suggestion.
   The portion of Scripture designated for each lesson
should be so thoroughly studied that every question can be
answered in the exact. words of the text. The questions are
framed with the purpose to make this possible. It is hoped
that the notes will be found suggestive and helpful in the
further development of the thought of the lesson. Teachers
should encourge a careful study of the ideas presented,
and, above all, should seek to make such a practical
application of the subject-matter as will be a help in per-
sonal experience.

  LESSON 1.—Walking in the Light. 1 John 1: 1-10.

   1. Verses 1-4.—Christ is the Word (John 1:1) and the
Life (John 14:6), and hence He is the Word of Life. The
life was manifested in flesh (Rom. 8:3), and can be

known to us only as an experience (John 1: 12). When our
eyes have been anointed (Rev. 3:18; 2 Kings 6:17), and our
ears wakened (Isa. 50:4) so that we can hear aright (Mark
4: 24), then we must testify (Acts 4: 20), and our words
will have effect (Acts 4:33). Fellowship with Christ is the
experience of every Christian (1 Cor. 1: 9), and this extends
to His sufferings (Phil. 3:10; 1:29), as well as to the joy
 (1 Peter 4: 13).
    2. Verses 5-7.—God is light and dwells in light (1 Tini.
6:16), and as He was in Christ (2 Cor. 5:19), so Christ in
His life (John 1: 4) was the true light (verse 9), and His
followers become light (Eph. 5:8; Matt. 5: 14) if they walk
in the light (John 8: 12), and are to shine (Isa. 60: 1) ; but
this is done by the life (Matt. 5: 16). "What is light?—It
is piety, goodness, truth, mercy, love; it is the revealing of
the truth in the character and life." We can not have fellow-
ship with light and darkness at the same time (2 Cor. 6: 14).
    3. Verses 8, 10.—God has said that we are sinners (Rom.
3:23), and so we make Him a liar by saying that we are
not sinners. But while there is no good thing in us (Rom.
7: 18), and we are poor and miserable (Rev. 3: 17), we can
boast of the Lord (Ps. 34:2; 1 Cor. 1:31), in whom there
is no unrighteousness (Ps. 92: 15), and who is made right-
eousness unto us (1 Cor. 1: 30). "He was condemned for
our sins in which He had no share, that we might be justified
by His righteousness in which we had no share." The only
way by which we may be "made free from sin" is to confess
that we are full of sin.
    "Are you in Christ?--Not if you do not acknowledge your-
selves erring, helpless, condemned sinners; not if you are
exalting and glorifying self. If there is any good in you, it
is wholly attributable to the mercy of a compassionate
Saviour." "There can be no self-exaltation, no boastful
claim to freedom from sin, on the part of those who walk in
the shadow of Calvary's cross." "And the claim to be without
sin is, in itself, evidence that he who makes this claim is
far from holy."
    4. livarNso.4:—There are some notable examples of con-
fession on record for our instruction. Daniel (Dan. 9: 3-20),
Ezra (Ezra 9: 5; 10: 1), and David (Ps. 51: 1-4) are familiar
cases. "True confession is always of a specific character, and
acknowledges particular sin." "Confession will not be
acceptable to God without sincere repentance and reforma-

tion." "Whatever the character of your sin, confess it. If
it is against God only, confess only to Him. If you have
wronged or offended others, confess also to them, and the
blessing of the Lord will rest upon you." "Sins that are not
confessed will never be forgiven."
    "Our past sins will sometimes come to mind and cast a
shadow over our faith, so that we can see nothing but merited
punishment in store for us. But at such times, while we
feel sorry for sins,, we should look to Jesus, and believe that
He has pardoned our transgressions." "If you believe the
promise—believe that you are forgiven and cleansed—God
supplies the fact: you are made whole, just as Christ gave the
paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was
healed. It is so if you believe it." But "it is not faith that
claims the favor of heaven without complying with the con-
ditions upon which mercy is to be granted. It is presump-
tion." "We are to believe that God accepts us when we
fulfil His conditions, simply because He has said that He
would."

  - 8. What is said against those professing to know Him,
in whom this proof is lacking?
     9. In whom is the love of God perfected?
   10. Of what is this the proof?
   11. What is the true standard of the daily walk of the
heli ever?
   12. Is this a new requirement of the Christian?
   13. How long since this commandment has been made
known?
   14. Although old in point of time, what is it called?
   15. In whom is it true?
   16. For what reason?
                             Notes.
   1. Verses=1•87—Christ came to save, not in sin, but from,
sin (Matt. 1: 21). He redeems from all iniquity (Titus 2: 14),
and delivers from the power of evil (Col. J.: 13); but God
remembers our witness • (Ps. 103:13, 14), and has adapted
His plan of salvation to the weakest one. "The Christian will
feel the promptings of sin, but he will maintain a constant
warfare against it. Here is where Christ's help is needed.
Human weakness becomes united to divine strength."
   "There are those who have known the pardoning love of
Christ, and who really desire to be children of God, yet
they realize that their character is imperfect, their life faulty,
and they are ready to doubt whether their hearts have been
renewed by the Holy Spirit. To such I would say, do not
draw back in despair. We shall often have to bow down and
weep at the feet of Jesus because of our shortcomings and
mistakes; but we are not to be discouraged. Even if we are
overcome by the enemy, we are not cast off, not forsaken
and rejected of God. No; Christ is at the right hand of God,
who also maketh intercession for us. Said the beloved John,
'These things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any
man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous.' And do not forget the words of Christ, 'The
Father Himself loveth you.' He desires to restore you to
Himself, to see His own purity and holiness reflected in you.
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

And if you but yield yourself to Him, He that hath begun a
good work in you will carry it forward to the day of Jesus
Christ. Pray more fervently, believe more fully. As we
come to distrust our own power, let us trust the power of
our Redeemer, and we shall praise Him who is the health of
our countenance."
    "Obedience—the service and allegiance of love—is the
true sign of discipleship," but "it is faith, and faith only, that
makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us
to render obedience."
    2. Vann-n-1.G. —"Though John in his epistles dwells so
fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to reveal the true
character of that class who claims to be sanctified while
living in transgression of the law of God." "God is love,
and His law is love," and so "the love of God has been per-
fected," or fully wrought out, in the one whose life is in
harmony with His word. We are called to holiness (1 Thess.
4: 7), which is agreement with God, and "the command, 'Be
ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
is perfect,' would never have been given if every provision
had not been made whereby we could obey the requirement,—
be as perfect in our sphere as God is in His." "It is not
Christ walking upon the sea, but His ordinary walk, that we
are called to imitate."—Luther. Love to God (Deut. 6: 5)
and love to man (Lev. 19: 18) was not a "new commandment"
in fact, but to many it was "a new commandment" in ex-
perience.

   19. Who will abide forever?
                            Notes.
    1. -Verees.8d-1.—Love for the brethren is an evidence of
conversion (1 John 3: 14), and no one can be in the light
(J-)hn 8: 12) and not have this love. Christ identifies Him-
self with His followers, and counts every service rendered
to them as if done to Him (Matt. 25:40).- There are
only two classes. All are either "in the light" or "in dark-
ness." Love is the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5: 22), by which
it is shed abroad in the heart (Rom. 5: 5). When man sinned,
"selfishness took the place of love," but "in the heart re-
newed by divine grace, love is the principle of action." God
loved us when we were sinners (Rom. 5: 8), and Christians
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                     9
must not limit this love to their brethren (Matt. 5: 44-46).
"The Spirit of Christ's self-sacrificing love is the spirit that
pervades heaven, and is the very essence of its bliss. This
is the spirit that Christ's followers will possess, the work
that they will do."
    Christians are to love one another (John 15:12,.17), which
is the fulfilling of the law (Rom. 13:10). "We should love
and respect one another, notwithstanding the faults and im-
perfections that we can not help seeing." "We are to stand
under the shadow of the cross of Calvary, humbling our
hearts, confessing our sins, and entreating the Lord to par-
don our defects      character, and strengthen our love for the
brethren."
    It is dangerous to trifle with light, for' light rejected will
bring darkness (John 12: 35), and this is the greatest dark-
ness of all (Matt. 6:23). When minds are blinded by Satan
(2 Cor. 4: 4), the people are in the deepest darkness (Isa.
60:2), and do not perceive the snares of the devil.
    2. Ners4selfF147.—Our thoughts are to be above (Col. 3:2)
where our citizenship is (Phil. 3: 20, R. V.), and our love can
not be divided (Matt. 6: 24). Enmity between Christians
and the world is of long standing (Gen. 3:15), and is really
the hope of the race. "It is the grace that Christ implants
in the soul which creates in man enmity against Satan." We
may be friends of God (John 15:15) as Abraham was (Isa.
41:8), or friend of the world; but we can not be both at the
same time (James 4: 4). "Conformity to the world will
never be the means of converting the world to Christ." The
world passes away, but character endures. The will of God
is His law (Rom. 2: 18), which is everlasting righteousness
(Ps. 119: 172, 144; Isa. 51: 6-8).


     LESSON IV.—Antichrists. 1 John 2:18-,25.
                        APRIL 28, 1906.
                           Questions.        •

                             Notes.
   1. 11,efses--4-8-4k0. Apostasy is a characteristic of the last
time (or hour, R. V.). The Saviour predicted this (Matt.
24: 11, 12), and the church had been warned of it more than
once (1 Tim. 4: 1; 2 Tim. 3: 1-5). The incarnation is the
testing truth (2 John 7), and this really means the union
of Divinity and humanity in the believer (Col. 1:27). This
experience involves the death of self (Rom. 6: 6), and giving
up all things temporal (Luke 14: 33), and many fail to endure
the test. The power of God in the church is the best agency
for relieving it of unworthy members (Isa. 52: 1), as is shown
in the early church (Acts 5:1-14). Jesus was anointed by
the Father (Acts 10:38), and so are His-followers (2 Cor.
          Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

1:21), and they are thus enabled to comprehend the things of
God (Eph. 1: 17-19), which are spiritually discerned (1 Cor.
2: 12-14).
    2. IT-epaes.z22r88.—Christ being the image of God (2 Cor.
4:4), one with the Father (John 10:30), through whom
alone the Father could be known (Matt. 11: 27), to see one
was to see the other (John 12: 45), and the denial of one
includes the rejection of the other (compare 2 Peter 2:1;
Jude 4).
    3. Versca--24-7—a5 Love to one another was the command
from the beginning (2 John 5) and this involves the new
birth (1 John 4: 7), which results in the indwelling presence
of both 'the. Father and the Son (John 14: 23). Christ is the
Life (John 11:25), and is from eternity (Micah 5:2, margin),
and so is called the eternal life (1 John I: 2), which was
promised before man fell (Titus 1: 2), and announced to
him before he was driven from the Garden of Eden (Gen.
3: 15). To believe on Christ is to receive Him (John 1: 12)
who is life (Col. 3: 4), and so believers have everlasting life
(John 3: 36). When God gave Christ to the world, He poured
out all the treasure of heaven in one gift (Col. 2: 9), and it
will be our constant stay to all eternity to learn what we
have in Christ.

 LESSON V.—Abiding in Christ. 1 John 2: 36             to 3:3.

                             Notes.
   1. 1. -orests,-34.3J. Paul warned the church of future trouble
(Acts 20:29), and this apostasy began in his day (2 Thess.
2: 7). Jude writes very strongly concerning these deceivers
(Jude 4, 10-13) who abounded before John's death (2 John 7).
The Holy Spirit, which was promised by Christ (John 16:7)
and had been poured upon them (Acts 2: 33), would teach
them the truth (John 16: 13), and would protect them from
deceivers (Acts 10:19, 20). Jesus says, "Abide in Me." These
words convey the idea of rest, stability, confidence. See the
lesson in John 15: 4-7. Such a life brings conformity to the
divine character (2 Cor. 3:18), and confidence at His coming
(Isa. 25: 9).
   2. .11efets5.4.8.—It would require the language of the In-
finite to express the love that has made it possible for us
to be called the sons of God. Faith makes us children of
God (Gal. 3: 26), and this is a present experience. The Holy
Spirit belongs to the sons of God (Gal. 4: 6), who are also
heirs (Rom. 8: 17) of the inheritance. In fact, "all things"
belong to them (1 Cor. 3: 21). The world knew not Christ
(John 1: 10) nor the Father (John 17: 25), and for this
reason (John 16: 3) will persecute true Christians (John

15: 18-20). This present life is the time for the perfect char-
acter. "If you give yourself to Him and accept Him as your
Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake
you are accounted righteous. Christ's character stands in
the place of your character, and you are accepted before God
just as if you had not sinned." The character is fixed at the
coming of Christ (Rev. 22:11), who "shall fashion anew the
body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body
of His glory" (Phil. 3: 21, R. V.), and thus shall we "appear
with Him in glory" (Col. 3: 4). So shall we be satisfied
 (Ps. 17:15). Holiness is required of those who shall see
God (Heb. 12: 14), and this privilege is promised to the
pure in heart (Matt. 5:8); but "who can say, I have made my
heart clean, I am pure from sin?" (Prov. 20:9). It is by
faith (Acts 15: 9) which works (Gal. 5: 6) in obedience
 (1 Peter 1: 22) that we are purified. "He who hath this hope
in him learns from the Scriptures that he must be a worker
together with God."

                            Notes.
   1. ;Lerses=4-6.—Unrighteousness and sin are the same
(1 John 5: 17), and both are the result of being out of har-
mony with God's law, which is righteousness (Ps. 119: 172).
"The character of God is righteousness and truth; such is the
nature of His law." The law detects sin (Rom. 3: 20), and
drives to Christ for justification (Gal. 3: 24). "A view of our
sinfulness drives us to Him who can pardon." Christ came to
take away sin and abolish death (2 Tim. 1: 10), but not the
law. "Had it been possible for the law to be changed or set
aside, then Christ need not have died to save man from the
penalty of sin." "A wrong conception of the character, the
perpetuity, and obligation of the divine law, has led to errors
in the relation to conversion and sanctification, and has re-
sulted in lowering the standard of piety in the church." "It
is only as the law of God is restored to its rightful position
that there can be a revival of primitive faith and godliness
     The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                  15
among His professed people." Christ bore the sins of the
world (-John 1: 29, margin) in the sinner's place (Gal. 3: 13);
and, although free from sin (1 Peter 2: 22), and "hating sin
with a perfect hatred, He yet gathered to His soul the sins of
the whole world." "Under the mighty impulse of His love, He
took our place in the universe, and invited the Ruler of all
things to treat Him as a representative of the human family."
"Though the guilt of sin was not His, His spirit was torn and
bruised by the transgressions of men." It was at such cost
as this that "He was manifested to take away our sins."
That vital union with Christ which imparts His nature (2
Peter 1:4) enables us to realize the fulfilment of "God's
mighty emancipation proclamation" (Rom. 6: 14).
    2. Yers'es--7-:9—Righteousness must be within before it
can be manifested in outward works. "Genuine Christlikeness
can not be manifested in the character until Christ is received
by faith and formed within the hope of glory." "The tree
that bears good fruit is a good tree and has a living root;
not that the fruit makes the tree and its fruit to be good,
but it shows that they are so."—Fausset. God condemned sin
in the flesh once (Rom. 8:3), and the "union of Divinity with
humanity in Christ was to reveal to us God's purpose to bring
men into the closest connection with Himself." "He who
lays hold upon the righteousness of Christ may become a
perfect man in Christ Jesus." "The character is revealed,
not by occasional good deeds and _occasional misdeeds, but
by the tendency of the habitual words and acts." Christ
prayed in behalf of all His disciples that the Father might
"keep them from the evil one" (R. V.) and that prayer avails
now.
               -Y246.—The cause assigned for the murder of
    3. izer-ses-
Abel is really at the root of all the injuries inflicted upon the
righteous by evil men, and was illustrated in the death of
Christ. "It was not so much because He appeared without
worldly wealth, pomp, or grandeur, .that the Jews were led
to reject Him. They saw that He possessed power which
could more than compensate for the lack, of these outward
advantages. But the purity and holiness of Christ called
 forth against Him the hatred of the ungodly. His life
of self-denial and sinless devotion was a perpetual reproof
 to a proud, sensual people. It was this that evoked enmity
 against the Son of God." "So in all ages the wicked have
 hated those who were better than themselves." "It is the

spirit that through all the ages has set up the stake and
kindled the burning pile for the diciples of Christ." The
world hated Christ (John 15: 24). and so would naturally
hate His followers. "Love is of God. The unconsecrated
heart can not originate or produce it; it is found only in the
heart where Jesus reigns."
    Christ explained the spiritual nature of the sixth command-
ment (Matt. 5: 21, 22), showing that it is "exceeding broad."
If it were the duty of the civil power to enforce the law of
God, there would not be a sufficient number of innocent per-
sons to inflict the penalty upon those who are really guilty of
murder. The spirit that leads to murder is not in harmony
with the Spirit of Christ (Luke 9: 56), and so shuts its pos-
sessor out of heaven (Rom. 8: 9).

    1. Yetgasz.U-1-8..—The Revised Version renders the first
clause of verse 16 thus: "Hereby know we love, because,"
etc. The cross of Calvary is the grandest display of love
which the universe has ever seen (John 3:16). "Jesus died
because God loved the world. The channel had to be made
whereby the love of God should be recognized by man and
flow into the sinner's heart in perfect harmony with truth
and justice." "The resources of infinite love have been ex-
hausted in devising and executing the plan of redemption for
man." It is love which draws man to God (Jer. 31: 3) and
leads him to repentance (Rom. 2: 4), and "the Lord has no
reserve power with which to influence men. He can give no
greater manifestation of His love than that which He has
given." "Oh, what a God have we! What a benefactor! 'What
claims has He upon our love! Having collected all the riches of
the universe and laid open all the resources of infinite power,
He gave all the heavenly treasure into the hancTh of Christ,
and said: 'All these are for man. Use them to convince him
that there is no love greater than Mine in earth or heaven.
His greatest happiness consists in loving me, and giving his
heart to Me, who hath loved him with an infinite love.' " "He
 who has shared• in the grace of Christ is thereby placed under
obligation to others (Rom. 1:14), and this grace is more
sacred to him than life" (Acts 20:24). "This plan of salvation
 was laid by a sacrifice, a gift" (2 Cor. 8: 9), and the same
spirit should characterize all Christians (Matt. 10: 8) as was
shown by the Macedonians (2 Cor. 8: 3-5). "Thus while our
 gifts can not recommend us to God, or earn His favor, they are
an evidence that we have received the grace of Christ. They
 are a test of the sincerity of our profession of love." "He
 tests the love of His professed followers by committing to
 their tender mercies the afflicted and bereaved ones, the poor,
 and the orphan." Deeds should accompany words in order to
 make them effective (James 2: 15, 16).
-Lift up your eyes and look on the field; for they are white
                      already to harvest."

                        - clear conscience is a good thing (2 or;
1.12)-, but God is the final judge (-114142.-2-:-1-6}, and the life
record determines the result (.11ex...-24:42.). "Believers, as
such, ask only what is in accordance Tith God's will; or if
they ask what God wills not, they bow their will to God's will,
so God grants them either their request or something better
than it."—Faussete,,,,
    God can bestow special blessings upon only those who will
use them to His glory, which is always for their good (Dent.
6:24). The obedience of faith is evidence of such a purpose.
As Christ pleased not Himself (Rom. 15: 3) but the Father
 (John 8:29), so we are to do; but this is not natural to man
(Rom. 8: 8), and is accomplished only through faith (Heb.
11: 6). Belief in Christ insures salvation (Acts 16: 31), and
is the work of God (John 6: 29). Love to man is the out-
growth of this experience. Christ dwells in genuine Chris-
tians (2 Cor. 13:5), as in Paul (Gal. 2:20), and works in us
through His power (Phil. 2: 13) to obedience (Rom. 5: 19).

    "The connection of the visible with the invisible world,
the ministration of angels of God, and the agency of evil
spirits, are plainly revealed in the Scriptures, and inseparably
interwoven with human history." "Evil spirits, in the be-
ginning created sinless, were equal in nature, power, and
glory with the holy beings that are now God's messengers.
But fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dis-
honor of God and the destruction of men." These evil spirits
work "in the children of disobedience" (Eph. 2: 2), who yield
themselves as servants (Rom. 6: 16), in marvelous ways
(Matt. 24:24), and more and more as time advances
(2 Tim. 3: 13), until fire is brought down from heaven (Rev.
13:13), "and as the crowning act in the great drama of decep-
tion Satan himself will personate Christ." "The people of God
are directed to the Scriptures as the safeguard against the
influence of false teachers and the delusive power of spirits of
darkness" (Isa. 8:20). Antichrist is to perform \his marvel-
ous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit re-
semble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish be-
tween them except by the holy Scriptures." Error is not to be
countenanced, although preached by an angel (Gal. 1: 8);
neither, because we despise the messenger (Mark            3), are
we to reject truth (John 10:37, 38). Christ was born of the
Spirit (Luke 1: 35), and dwelt in the flesh (John 1: 14), and
so He must dwell in our flesh (Eph. 3: 17), living in us (Gal.
2: 20), to give us victory (2 Cor. 2: 14) in the,conflict with un-
seen powers (Eph. 6:12). Any one who presents any other
hope of salvation is a deceiver and an antichrist (2 John 7).

len foe." "The hand of the Infinite is stretched over the
battlements of heaven to grasp your hand in its embrace.
The mighty Helper is nigh to help the most erring, the most
sinful and despairing." •God and the world, the followers of
Christ and the servants of Satan, "the Spirit of truth and the
spirit of error," are in marked contrast. All are found in one
of two classes (Matt. 12:30), and the same person can not be
found in both (Matt. 6:24).

                            Notes.
     1. irergerItti.—"Whenever the life of God is in the hearts
of - men, it will flow out to others in love and blessing." "Of
God he hath been begotten and doth know God" is Dr.
Young's rendering of the last clause of verse 7. The new birth
is a past experience, but knowing God is always a present ex-
perience. It is not only true that God loves and is a source of
love, but "God is love," and this is the essence of the whole
gospel. There can be no discord in the home, the church, or
the community when the love of God abides in all hearts.
God's love to us is not simply an abstract thing, but it was
shown in a most practical way (John 3: 16). Man lost his
life by sin (Gen. 2: 17), and Christ came to restore life (John
10: 10), which is wholly the gift of God (Rom. 6: 23). "Had
not God specially interposed, Satan and man would have en-
tered into an alliance against heaven, and, instead of cherish-
ing enmity against Satan, the whole human family would
have been united in opposition to God." "The reconciliation
of mercy and justice did not involve any compromise with sin,
or ignore any claim of justice; but, by giving to each divine
attribute its ordained place, mercy could be exercised in the
punishment of sinful, impenitent man without destroying its
clemency or forfeiting its compassionate character, and justice
could be exercised in forgiving the repenting transgressor
without violating its integrity." "Said the angel, Think ye
that the Father yielded up His beloved Son without a strug-
gle? No, no. It was even a struggle with the God of heaven,
whether to let guilty man perish, or to give His beloved Son
to die for him."
     2. V.ersea:1.244.—Men can not see God with the natural eye,
but they ought to see His character wrought out in Chris-
 tians. "Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear the
voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love
of God through His works. But if you are a true representa-
 tive of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to
 understand something of His goodness, and be won to love
 and serve Him." The Spirit is given to those who ask for
 it (Luke 11: 13), but the asking must be in the name of Jesus
 (John 16:23, 24). But to pray in the name of Jesus is some-
 thing more than a mere mention of that name at the beginning
 and ending of a prayer. It is to pray in the mind and spirit of
 Jesus, while we believe His promises, rely upon His grace,
 and work His works." The purpose of Christ in coming to this

world was to save (Luke 19: 10), not to judge (John 12: 47) ;
but rejection of His work results in condemnation (John 3:
18). The price paid was sufficient to redeem the world, but
no man is saved contrary to his own will and choice. •We
can do nothing without Him (John 15: 5), and He will do
nothing without us. Christ sends His followers on the same
errand which brought Him to the earth (John 20: 21), and has
promised His presence to them (Matt. 28:20). "As Jesus has
revealed to us the true character of the Father, so we are to
reveal Christ to a world that does not know His tender, pity-
ing love."

  13. Why is such an one inconsistent?
  14. What commandment has been given?
                             Notes.
    1. Versos 16, 16. When Peter confessed that Jesus was
the Son of God, the reply of Christ indicated that this truth
can not be discerned by the natural man (Matt. 16:16, 17),
and it is only when Christ, in whom God dwelt (2 Cor. 5:19),
is revealed in us (Gal. 1: 16) that we can confess this truth in
the sense of the Scripture. Thus the Spirit which is to testify
of Him (John 15:26)' witnesses through us to His Divinity
(1 Cor. 12: 3). The love of God can be known only by experi-
ence, as it is poured out in• the heart (Rom. 5:5). "Human
language can never explain how the love of Christ can take
possession of the soul, and lead captive every power of the
mind; but you will know it by personal experience." Since
God is love, and all love is of God, no one can be in love and
separated from God at the same time.
    2. Vorno—+^rt—The result aimed at in all God's love to us
is that we may be restored to His favor and dwell in His
presence (1 Tim. 2: 4), but this involves a testing of the char-
acter (2 Cor. 5: 10), and the Law demands perfection (James
2: 10). No righteousness of our own (Phil. 3: 9) will give
confidence in that day. Those who have "had a sense of the
righteousness of Jehovah, and felt the terror of appearing in
their guilt and uncleanness before the Searcher of hearts,"
will desire a robe of righteousnes (Isa. 61: 10) as a wedding
garment (Matt. 22: 11, 12), clean and white (Rev. 19: 8).
"None are so sinful that they can not find strength, purity,
and righteousness in Jesus who died for them. He is wait-
ing to strip them of their garments, stained and polluted with
sin, and to put upon them the white robes of righteousness."
    Our likeness to Christ must begin here. "We must perfect
a Christlike character, or we shall never enter into the king-
 dom of heaven." "The saints in heaven will first have been
saints on earth."
    3. Verse--1.8..—Although there is a certain fear (1 Peter 1:17)
 in which we are to live (Phil. 2: 12), yet "not in distrust of
 the grace of God,-but in fear that self shall gain the suprem-
acy. We are not to fear that there will be any failure on the
 part of God, but fear lest because of our own sinful inclina-
 tions any of us should seem to come short of the promise."
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
24         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

"Here is where we need to watch, to strive, to pray, that
nothing may entice us to choose another master, for we are
always free to do this."
    God has given us every reason for assurance (Heb. 6:
17, 18) that He will carry us through (Phil. 1:6) and enable
us to pass the test (Jude 24), if we believe in Him (2 Chron.
20: 20).
    4. 14eree'el-9,241--"We love, because He first loved us," is
the revised version of verse 19. We should never have known
the meaning of love, and never have exercised it toward any
one, if God had not first loved us. If we love God, whom we
have not seen (1 Peter 1: 8), then we shall surely love all the
objects of His love about us whom we can see. This love is
a proof to the world of our discipleship (John 13: 35). Love
to God and love to man are inseparably connected (Matt. 22:
37-40), and both will be manifested by the follower of Christ.
"There has been too much of a spirit to ask, 'Am I my
brother's keeper?' Said the angel, 'Yea, thou art thy brother's
keeper. Thou shouldst have a watchful care for thy brother
be interested for his welfare, and cherish a kind, loving
spirit toward him.'" While we can not fellowship those who
are the bitter enemies of Christ, we should cultivate that
spirit of meekness and love that characterized our Master,—
a love that thinketh no evil, and is not easily provoked."

   1. Verses--1-3:—The new birth is the condition of entrance
to the kingdom (John 3: 3), and it is a spiritual birth
(verse 5). Man "must have a new life from above. This
change is the new birth." To thus become children of God is
granted to believers (John 1: 12, 13) in Christ (Gal. 3: 26).
Such are children of promise (Gal. 4:28), being born of •the
word (James 1:18). Love to the brethren is a proof of conver-
sion (1 John 3:14), and obedience to God is proof of love to the
brethren, hence obedience is proof of conversion. There can
be no true love apart from obedience (John 14: 23), which is
the highest form of worship. "If our hearts are renewed in
the likeness of God, if the divine love is implanted in the soul,
will not the law of God be carried out in the life? When the
principle of love is implanted in the heart, when man is re-
newed after the image of Him that created him, the new
covenant promise is fulfilled, 'I will put My laws into their
hearts, and in their minds will I write them' (Heb. 10: 16).
And if the law is written in the heart, will it not shape the
life?" "If we abide in Christ, if the love of God dwells in
us, our purposes, our actions will be in harmony with the will
of God, as expressed in the preceipts of His holy law. God is
love and His law, "being an expression of the mind and will of
God," "the transcript of the character of God," is founded
upon love (Matt. 22: 40) and fulfilled in love (Rom. 13: 10).
His commandments "are not burdensome" (Matt. 11: 30) to
those who have been set free from the bondage of sin (John 8:
34-36), but rather a delight' (Ps. 1: 2). "The truth a bond-
age?—Yes, in one sense; it binds the willing souls in captiv-
ity to Jesus Christ."
"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                       watchword.

                 5.—The greatest victories of the world have
been gained through faith (Heb. 11: 32-34) in Christ (1 Cor.
15:57), who was an overcomer (John 16:33), and "has given
us the advantage of His victory, that we may be able to resist
the temptations of the evil one." "We gain the victory
through faith in Christ's power to save us." "This is the vic-
tory that hath overcome the world," is the reading of the
Revised Version, thus making the victory an accomplished
fact.
    "The Lord Jesus is making experiments of human hearts
through the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace.
He is effecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with
all his triumphant boasting, with all his confederacy of evil
united against God and the laws of His government, stands
viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and
delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible mystery.
The angels of God, seraphim and cherubim, the powers com-
missioned to cooperate with human agencies, look on with
astonishment and joy that fallen men, once children of wrath,
are, through the training of Christ, developing characters
after the divine similitude, to be sons and daughters of God,
to act an important part in the pleasures and occupations of
heaven." Only in him who "believeth that Jesus is the Son
of God" can such a work as this be wrought.
    3. Verser6.—Jesus came by water and by blood (John
19: 34). "In the shed blood we see the sacrificed life of
Christ, and in the water we see the Word and the Spirit of
Christ. In the blood we see the expiation made for sin, and
through the blood we get remission of sins. Then comes the
water to sanctify and to cleanse us."—Rogers.
    Blood and water are both used in the typical service (Lev.
14: 6, 8) as symbols of cleansing. So we are cleansed by the
blood (1 John 1: 7), and by water which is explained to be the
word (Eph. 5: 26, compare with John 15: 3).

                            Notes.
   1. Verses-=',71-0%.--In ancient times two or three witnesses
were required (Dent. 19:15), and this custom is continued
by our Saviour's express command (Matt. 18: 16). The Spirit
witnesses to our sonship (Rom. 8: 16), as it speaks through
the Word (Acts 28: 25; 2 Peter 1: 21), which is represented
by the water (Eze. 36: 25; John 15: 3; Eph. 5: 26), of the
efficacy of the blood of Christ ,(Heb. 9: 14). Those who bear
witness against Christ can not agree (Mark 14:55, 56), but
thele is always harmony in the truth. God can not lie (Titus
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
28         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

1:2), even when He calls things that be not as if they were
 (Rom. 4:17), because His word, when spoken, has power to
produce the thing or situation mentioned. "In His dealing
with sin God could employ only rightebusness and truth.
Satan could use what God could not—flattery and deceit."
The closing clause of the ninth verse is made clearer by the
Revised Version: "For the witness of God is this, that He
hath borne witness concerning His Son." God has borne
witness concerning His Son by audible voice (Matt. 3: 17;
17: 5) and by the works wrought through Him (John 10: 37,
38). It is a serious thing to charge God with being a liar;
but when He states a thing and we do not believe Him, that
is what we do, yet He remains the same (2 Tim. 2: 13).
Though all men deceive (Rom. 3:4), God does not (Num.
23:19).
    2. Verse -14,12.—The Lord had given the land to the
Israelites (Josh. 1: 3) as soon as He had made provision for
its conquest by them, but not in their own strength (Ps. 44:3);
so all blessings (Eph. 1: 3), even eternal life, have been be-
stowed upon us, and it only remains for us to accept them
upon the stated conditions. "Prayer is the key in the hand
of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse." "There must be a
power working from within, a new life from above, before
we can be changed from sin to holiness. That power is
Christ." "But it is the life of Jesus Christ in the soul, it is
the active principle of love imparted by the Holy Spirit, that
alone will make the soul fruitful unto good works." "Before
works we must have eternal life; but when we are born again,
and made children of God by the word of grace, then we per-
form good works."—Luther.
    3. Vefses43-14.—Those who believe "may know" these
things (Heb. 11: 1), not through faith in a creed, but by re-
ceiving Him (John 1: 12) who is the life (John 14: 6). It is
God's will that we should be saved from sin (Gal. 1: 4) ;
and be sanctified (1 Thess. 4: 3), not that we should perish
(Matt. 18: 14); and so we know that He hears the requests
of His children when they ask for these experiences. So the
Christian can wait patiently (Ps. 40: 1-3) for the Lord' to
work in His own way. "But to claim that prayer will always
be answered in the very way and for the particular thing
that we desire, is presumption." "We should be willing to
trust everything to the hand that was nailed to the cross for
us." "The prayer of the sincere heart offered in faith will be
heard in heaven. It may not be grammatical, but if the heart

is in it, it will ascend to the sanctuary, where Jesus ministers,
and He will present it to the Father, with the fragrant incense
of His own perfection, without our awkward, stammering
word, graceful and perfect through His merit, for His right-
eousness refines and ennobles it, and makes it acceptable be-
fore the Father. The Lord accepts the prayer of the sincere
heart, and will answer it out of His abundant fulness."

                            Notes.
     1. WiSusT-
              -1-6511t—It is evident from many scriptures that
 the prayers of the righteous avail in behalf of the sinner who
has not entirely cut himself off from God (Job 42:7, 8), and
this intercession brings a blessing to him who prays (verse 10).
Thus a soul is saved from death (James 5: 20). Sin ends in
death (James 1: 15) unless repentance has been granted to
life (Acts 11: 18) ; but "it is the Holy Spirit that draws men
 to Christ;" and so when this means of grace is refused, there
is no way by which the sinner may be reached. "There is
a terrible danger—a danger not sufficiently understood—in
delaying to yield to the pleading voice of God's Holy Spirit,
in choosing to live in sin; for such this delay really is."
"Every act of transgression, every neglect or rejection of the
gface of Christ, is reacting upon yourself; it is hardening
the heart, depraving the will, benumbing the understanding,
and not only making you less inclined to yield, but less ca-
pable of yielding, to the tender pleading of God's Holy Spirit."
There is a sin which is not pardoned (Matt. 12: 31, 32) here
or hereafter. "What constitutes the sin against the Holy
Ghost?—It is wilfully attributing to Satan the work of the
Holy Spirit. . . . It is through the medium of His Spirit
that God works upon the human heart; and when men wilfully
reject the Spirit, and declare it to be from Satan, they cut
off the channel by which God can communicate with them.
. . , Fora time persons who have committed this sin may
appear to he children of God; but when circumstances arise
to develop character, and show what manner of spirit they are
of, it will be found that they are on the enemy's ground,
standing under his black banner." The Lord is righteous
(Ps. 119:137), and His commandments are righteousness
(verse 172). Anything out of harmony with His character,
as expressed by His law, is unrighteousness or sin, but it is
by faith that our hearts are purified (Acts 15:9) and that we
attain to righteousness (Rom. 9:30-32) ; thus it is that
whatever is not done through faith in the merit of Christ is
sin (Rom. 14:23). Christ's petition (John 17:15) and the
statement of Scripture (2 Thess. 3:3) both show that it is
God who keeps us from "the evil one" (both texts are so
translated in the Revised Version), "but He can do nothing
for us without our cooperation." It is so arranged in the plan
of salvation that its great object can not be consummated

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                  31
 without human cooperation. "All the power is of God, and
 all the glory is to redound to God, and yet all the responsi-
 bility rests with the human agent." Satan was permitted to
 tempt Christ (Matt. 4:1), but according to the prophecy (Gen.
3:15) He did not touch any vital part. So with the Christian.
 Angels will give strength to us (Heb. 1:14), "but the ministry
 of angels will not insure us against sorrow and trial. Angels
 ministered to Jesus; but their presence did not make His life
 one of ease, nor free Him from conflict and temptation."
     2.—Vurs-e-s-1•9q1. "The whole world lieth in the evil one,"
 says the Revised Version; but Christians have been delivered
 (Col. 1:13).
     The Christian experience set forth in this epistle is a very
 positive one. Fifteen times occurs the statement "we know,"
 or "know we," or "we have known," and by other expressions
 it is clearly shown that positive knowledge concerning the
 things of God is the privilege of the Christian (1 Cor. 2:12).
 One does not need to bow down to a visible image in order to
 be an idolater (Eph. 5:5). "It is as easy to make an idol of
 false doctrines and theories as to fashion an idol of wood
 or stone. By misrepresenting the attributes of God, Satan
 leads men to conceive of him in a false character. With many,
 a philosophical idea is enthroned in the place of Jehovah;
 while the living God, as He is revealed in His work, in Christ,
 and in the works of creation, is worshiped by but few. Thou-
 sands deify nature, while they deny the God of nature. Though
 in a different form, idolatry exists in the Christian world
 to-day as verily as it existed among ancient Israel in the days
•of Elijah. The god of many professedly wise men, of philoso-
 phers, poets, politicians, journalists,—the god of polished,
 fashionable circles, of many colleges and universities, even of '
 some theological institutions,—is little better than Baal, the
 sun-god of Phoenicia."
