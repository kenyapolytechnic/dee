                              Notes.
     1. "The union of the divine and the human, manifest in
 Christ, exists also in the Bible. The truths revealed are all
 `given by inspiration of God;' yet they are expressed in the
 words of men, and are adapted to human needs. Thus it may
 be said of the Book of God, as it was of Christ, that 'the Word
 was made flesh, and dwelt among us.' And this fact, so far
 from being an argument against the Bible, should strengthen
 faith in it as the Word of God. Those who pronounce upon the
 inspiration of the Scriptures, accepting some portions as di-
 vine, while they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact
 that Christ, the divine, partook of our human nature, that He
 might reach humanity. In the work of God for man's redemp-
 tion, divinity and humanity are combined."—Testimonies for
 the Church, No. 33, pages 275, 276.
     Such, then, is God's Book. Its first line, its last line, all
 its teachings, understood or not understood, are by the same
 author; and that ought to suffice us. Whoever may have been
 the writers—whatever their circumstances, their impressions,
 their comprehension of the Book, and the measure of their
 individuality in this powerful and mysterious operation—they
 have all written faithfully and under superintendence in the
 same roll, under the guidance of one and the same Master,
 for whom a thousand years are as one day; and the result
 has been the Bible. Therefore I will not lose time in idle
 questions; I will study the book. It is the word of Moses,
 the word of Amos, the word of John, the word of Paul; but

still the thoughts expressed are God's thoughts, and the words
are God's words. "Thou, Lord, hast spoken by the mouth of
Thy servant David." "The Spirit of the Lord spake by me,"
said he, "and His word was in my tongue."—L. Gaussen on the
Inspiration of the Bible, page 31.
    2. "God hath spoken! The words of a man carry weight
according to the idea I have of his wisdom, his veracity, his
power, his love. The words of God! Oh, who can express
what they ought to be worth to us! Each word carries with
it all the life of God, all His saving power and love. . . .
The words of men have often exerted a wonderful and a
mighty influence. But the words of God—they are creative
deeds, they give what they speak. . . . Men's words appeal
to the mind or the will, the feelings or the passions. God
speaks to that which is deeper than all—to the heart, that
central depth within us whence are the issues of life. Let
us believe the mighty, quickening power God's Word will
have."—Andrew Murray.
    3. John the Baptist was "the voice of one crying in the
wilderness." When the time came for God's message for that
generation to be delivered, "the word of God came unto John
the son of Zacharias in the wilderness," and he immediately
went forth to speak that word. He openly rebuked the sin
and the formalism of his time, and sought to restore the pure
word of God in the hearts of the people. Thus he was de-
livering the message given through the prophet Isaiah, "All
flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower
of the field. . . . The grass withereth, the flower fadeth;
but the word of our God shall stand forever. . . . Behold
your God." In this closing generation a work corresponding
to the work of John the Baptist is to be carried to com-
pletion, and in this great second advent movement the Word
of God in its purity and power must be given its rightful
place. This is the fundamental thing in the Third Angel's
Message. Thus will the tabernacle of David be built again.
Acts 15: 13-17.

  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

         LESSON 11.—The Word of God.—No. 2
                     JANUARY 13, 1906.
                          Questions.
     1. Who moved upon the prophets of olden times to
speak the Word of God? 2 Peter 1: 21. Compare 1 Peter
1: 10, 11. Note 1.
     2. Who then speaks .God's Word through the mouth of
the prophets? Acts 1: 16. Compare Heb. 3: 7; 10: 15,
etc.
     3. As the Holy Spirit speaks God's Word, working in
the human instrumentality, who is really speaking?
Heb. 1 : 1 ; Hos. 12 : 10.
     4. In view of the relation which the Spirit sustains to
the Word of God, what is that Word called? Eph. 6: 17.
     5. What, however, is the usual expression by which the
Scriptures are designated? 2 Cor. 4: 2; Rom. 9: 6; Acts
19 : 20; 12:24; 13 : 44, 46; 18:11; 1 Thess. 2 : 13; 2 Tim.
2: 9, etc.
     6. Inasmuch as the Word of God is "living and active,"
what might it naturally be expected to do? Acts 12: 24;
19: 20.
     7. What did Jesus declare His words to be? John
6 : 63.
     8. What experience may be realized by the right use
of the Word of God? Ps. 119: 11; 17:4. Note 2.
     9. What material evidence have we of the creative
 power of God's Word? Ps. 33: 6, 9; 2 Peter 3: 5.
   10. How is the same power applied in, the healing of
 disease? Ps. 107: 17-20. Illustrate this by the experience
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."
6          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

of the centurion. Matt. 8: 5-13. By the experience of the
leper. Mark 1: 40-42.
   11. How did the religious teachers in the time of Christ
make the Word of God of no effect? Mark 7: 5-9.
   12. In what way is the same thing being done by the
two great branches of the professed church of Christ to-
day? Ans.—In express terms by the Roman Catholic
Church which teaches thus: "Through these two divine
streams (Holy Scripture and the tradition of the church)
are in themselves, on account of their divine origin, of
equal sacredness, and are full of revealed truths, still, of
the two, tradition is to us more clear and safe."—Catholic
Belief, page .45. By the Prostestant churches through what
is known as "Higher Criticism." As the result of its deal-
ing with the Bible, the large majority of religious teachers
of this time have ceased to regard the Holy Scriptures as
in a special sense the Word of God to man. The highest
authority acknowledged is the so-called voice within. See
Note 3.
   13. In view of this condition in the religious world what
instruction and exhortation demand most earnest attention
at the present time? 2 Tim. 3: 16 to 4: 4.
                              Notes.
   1. "A prophet, in the Bible, is a man, then, in whose mouth
God puts the words which He wishes to be heard on earth;
and it was further by allusion to the fulness of this meaning
that God said to Moses that Aaron would be his prophet unto
Pharaoh, according as He had told him: 'He shall be to thee
instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God."
Mark, in Scripture, how the prophets testify of the Spirit that
makes them speak, and of the wholly divine authority of their
word; you will even find in their language one uniform
definition of their office, and of their inspiration. They speak;
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                    7

it is, no doubt, their voice that makes itself heard; it is their
person that is agitated; it is, no doubt, their soul also that
often is moved; but their words are not only theirs; they
are, at the same time, the words of Jehovah. 'The mouth of
the Lord hath spoken;"the Lord hath spoken,' they say un-
ceasingly."—Gaussen. .
    2. The record of the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness
and of the use of the Scripture by Jesus and Satan in that
conflict furnishes an instructive example of the right and the
wrong use of the Word of God. Jesus turned to the injunction
to worship and serve only the one God as means of saving
Himself from going contrary to the will of His Father in
acknowledging the supremacy of the usurper, but Satan
quoted the Lord's promise of a watchful care over His chil-
dren as a sufficient reason for acceding to his suggestion to
tempt God. The one used the Word of God as a defense
against sin, the other as an excuse for committing sin. The
one displayed faith in the Word of God, the other showed
presumption. Read Matt. 4: 1-10, with these suggestions in
mind.
    3. The true significance of the movement in this genera-
tion which has resulted in weakening to such an alarming
extent faith in the inspiration and authority of the Bible, and
who the instigator of this movement really is, may be more
clearly understood by reading the following extract: "The
people of God are directed to the Scriptures as their safe-
guard against the influence of false teachers and the delusive
power of spirits of darkness. Satan employs every possible
device to prevent men from obtaining a knowledge of the
Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his deceptions. At every
revival of God's work, the prince of evil is aroused to more
intense activity; he is now putting forth his utmost efforts
for a final struggle against Christ and His followers. The
last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is
to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely
will the counterfeit resemble the true, that it will be impos-
sible to distinguish between them except by the Holy Scrip-
tures. By their testimony every statement and every miracle
must be tested."—Great Controversy, page 593.
    General Note.—"Has the reader ever paid a visit to the
astonishing organist, who so charmingly elicits the tourist's
tears in the Cathedral at Freiburg, as he touches one after
another his wondrous keys, and greets your ear by turns with
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
 for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
S          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

the march of warriors on the river-side, the voice of prayer
sent up from the lake during the fury of the storm, or of
thanksgiving when it is hushed to rest? All your senses are
electrified, for you seem to have seen all, and to have heard
all. Well, then, it was thus that the Lord God, mighty in
harmony, applied, as it were, the finger of His Spirit to the
stops which He had chosen for the hour of His purpose, and
for the unity of His celestial hymn. He had, from eternity,
before Him all the human stops which He required; His
Creator's eye embraces at a glance this range of keys stretch-
ing over threescore centuries; and when He would make
known to our fallen world the everlasting counsel of His
redemption, and the coming of the Son of God, He put His
left hand on Enoch, the seventh man from Adam, and His
right on John, the humble and sublime prisoner of Patmos.
The celestial anthem, seven hundred years before the Flood,
began with these words, 'Behold, the Lord cometh with ten
thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all;' but
already, in the mind of God, and in the eternal harmony of
His work, the voice of John had answered to that of Enoch,
and closed the hymn three thousand years after him with
these words, 'Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye
shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him!' Even so,
come, Lord Jesus.' And during this hymn of thirty centuries
the Spirit of God never ceased to breathe in all His mes-
sengers."—Gaussen.

           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                 9
Eph. 1: 15-17 ; Deut. 29: 29. Compare Dan. 2 : 20-22.
Note 2.
     4. What does the Lord say of Himself as compared with
other beings? Isa. 46 : 9. Compare Jer. 10 : 6.
     5. By what name has God made Himself known? Ex.
3 : 13, 14.
     6. What revelation has been made concerning the etern-
ity of the being of God? Ps. 90 : 1, 2.
     7. What is said of His understanding? Ps. 147 : 5.
     8. How is power associated with the being of God? Ps.
62 : 11.
     9. What testimony is borne concerning the omnipres-
ence of God? Ps. 139: 7-12.
   10. How is the being of God defined? John 4: 24,
Compare margin of R. V. Note 3.
   11. How is the character of God defined? 1 John 4 : 8.
   12. Mention four special manifestations of this charac-
ter. Ps. 89: 14.
   13. How is God's character manifested in His dealings
with sin? Ps. 86 : 5, 15 ; 1 John 1 : 9. Note 4.
   14. W hat revelation does God make of His character in
His ways and in His works? Ps. 145: 17.
   15. In what relation to mankind will God decide the
destiny of all? Heb. 12 :23 ; Ps. 94 : 1, 2.
                            Notes.
   1. A belief in God is fundamental in Christian experience,
and upon a right conception of God depends all that pertains
to the Christian life. We must believe both in His existence
and in His character as He has revealed Himself in His Word.
    2. "The revelation of Himself that God has given in His
Word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But
beyond this we are not to penetrate. The highest intellect
      The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
10         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

may tax itself until it is wearied out in conjectures regarding
the nature of God; but the effort will be fruitless. This
problem has not been given us to solve. No human mind
can comprehend God. Let not finite man attempt to interpret
Him. Let none indulge in speculation regarding His nature.
. . . Neither by searching the recesses of the earth, nor in
vain endeavors to penetrate the mysteries of God's being, is
wisdom found. It is found, rather, in humbly receiving the
revelation that He has been pleased to give, and in conforming
the life to His will."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. VIII,
pages 279, 280.
     3. The fact that God is spirit does not militate against
the idea that He is a real being. He is a spiritual being, but
still a real, personal being, just as a spiritual body is a real
body.
     4. In presenting the plan of salvation for man, such a
revelation is made of God as would be entirely inconsistent
with any other conception of Him than as of a personal being.
The love shown in the gift of His own Son, the justice and
the mercy, the righteousness and the holiness, are all the at-
tributes of a personal being, but could not be affirmed of an
Infinite Power, or an Intelligent Energy. God's dealing with
sin, as taught in the sanctuary and its services, testifies most
convincingly to the fact that He is a personal Being.

is not found in any other place? 1 Kings 8.: 30. Com-
pare John 20: 17 ; 2 Chron. 30: 27; Ps. 123:1. Note 1.
    2. What views have been given of this dwelling-place
of God? Eze. 1:26-28; Rev. 4: 2, 3, 9-11.
    3. What description has the prophet Isaiah given of
his view of God in His dwelling-place? Isa. 6: 1-4.
       The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                 11

    4. What relation does God sustain to all material
things? Jer. 10: 11, 13, 16 ; Eph. 3 : 9.
    5. In whose image was man created? Gen. 1: 26, 27.
Note 2.
    6. To what extent did the Son of God represent His
Father? Heb. 1: 3. Note 3.
    7. What personal relation does God sustain to what are
usually called the operations of nature? Ps. 104: 10-14,
19-24. Note 4.
    8. How intimate a relation was Moses permitted to en-
joy with God? Dent. 34: 10.
    9. How does the language of the Scriptures indicate
that God is a personal being? Gen. 6: 17; Ex. 20: 1-6.
Note the use of the personal pronoun, and find other simi-
lar passages.
   10. What revelation did Jesus make to His disciples con-
cerning the future home of the saved? John 14: 1-3.
   11. When the redeemed are settled in the new earth
where will God take up His abode? Rev. 21: 1-3.
                             Notes.
    1. In order to have any correct idea of God, we must accept
all that is revealed concerning Him in the Scriptures. The
Bible teaches the omnipresence of God, but it just as plainly
teaches that there is a dwelling-place where His personal
Presence is found, in a sense in which it is not found in any
other place. We may not be able to explain these two facts
concerning the presence of God, but by believing them both
we shall be saved from pantheistic teaching on the one hand,
and from too circumscribed conceptions of God on the other
hand. God is a personal being, with a dwelling-place, but He
is everywhere present by His Spirit.
    2. "In the creation of man was manifest the agency of a
personal God. When God had made man in His image, the
human form was perfect in all its arrangements, but it was
  The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.

without life. Then a personal, self-existing God breathed into
that form the breath of life, and man became a living, breath-
ing, intelligent being."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. VIII,
page 264.
   3. Rotherham's translation of Heb. 1: 3 reads thus: "Be-
ing an eradiated brightness of His glory, and an exact repre-
sentation of His very being," etc. Christ is declared to be
"the image of God" (2 Cor. 4: 4), as man was created "in the
image of God," and this image was never marred by sin in
the experience of Christ.
   4. "The mighty power that works through all nature and
sustains all things is not, as some men of science represent,
merely an all-pervading principle, an actuating energy. God is
a spirit; yet He is a personal being, for man was made in
His image."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. VIII, page 263.

istence of Christ affirmed? Micah 5 : 2. Note the margi-
nal reading. Compare Matt. 2: 4-6.
    2. What term is applied to Him who was born as the
son of Mary? John 7.: 14.
    3. What testimony is borne concerning the origin and
nature of the Word? John 1: 1. Note 1.

general truth expressed? 1 John 1: 1, 2.
    5. What divine names are applied directly to the Son
of God who partook of our flesh and blood? Heb. 1: 8, 10.
Note 2.
    6. What prophecy was thus fulfilled? Isa. 7 : 14.

    7. In what other prophecy is the same general idea pre-
sented? Isa. 9 : 6.
    8. In what statement did Christ Himself declare His
divine and eternal nature? John 8 : 58. Compare Ex.
3 : 13, 14. Note 3.
    9. How does the coming Saviour testify to the eternity
of His Being? Rev. 22: 12, 13. Compare Isa. 44: 6.
  10. What other declaration conveys the same general
idea? Heb. 13 : 8. Compare Ps. 90 : 1, 2.
   11. What relation does the Son of God, our Redeemer,
sustain to creation and created things? Col. 1: 12-17, R. V.
  12. Is the plan of salvation through faith in Christ of
recent origin? Eph. 3 : 11.
  13. What honor has been bestowed upon Him who was
"in the form of God" but was willing to take upon Himself
"the form of a servant"? Phil. 2 : 9-11. Read verses 5-8.
                             Notes.
   1. That "the Word" of John 1: 1 is the Son of God is
further evident from Rev. 19: 11-16. In Rev. 17: 14, it is
stated that the Lamb is "Lord of lords, and King of kings,"
and the Son of God in the flesh was pointed out by John the
Baptist as "the Lamb of God." John 1: 36.
    2. The whole of the first chapter of the epistle to the
Hebrews is occupied with the teaching of the Old Testament
Scriptures concerning the being and character of the Son of
God, who, in the second chapter, is called "Jesus," and of
whom it is declared that "in all things it behooved Him to be
made like unto His brethren." In the first chapter there are
seven quotations from the Old Testament, each one of which
testifies to the superiority of the Son. The whole chapter
should be studied in this connection.
   3. As further showing His own claim to the divine nature,
it will be profitable to consider such statements of Jesus as
are found in John 6: 48; 8: 12; 10: 11; 11: 25; 14: 6; and 15: 1.
In these declarations Jesus is simply interpreting the meaning
of the I AM of Ex. 3: 14.

           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.

   General Note.—Those who have the time to pursue this
subject further may profitably study those instances where
Christ appeared to men before His incarnation. Some of these
are Christ and Abraham (Genesis 17), Christ at Sinai, Christ
and Joshua (Joshua 5: 13-15), Christ and Gideon (Judges 6:
11-24).

        LESSON VI.—Creation and Redemption.
                FEBRUARY 10, 1906.
                        Questions.
    1. What is the first fact revealed to us in the Bible?
Gen. 1: 1.
    2. How definitely are we informed concerning the order
followed and the time occupied in the creation or forma-
tion of the earth? Read \ erses 3 to 28. Note 1.
    3. What was instituted at the close of the six days of
creative work? Gen. 2 : 1-3. Note 3.

    7. By what process is the image of God restored in
man? Ps. 51:10.
    8. What change has come to those who are in Christ?
2 Cor. 5: 17; Gal. 6: 15. Note the marginal reading of the
Revised Version in both cases.
    9. What I as been made a sign of this new experience?
Eze. 20: 12. Note 4.
  10. In what declaration are creation and redemption
associated as being simply different manifestations of the
same power. Isa. 43: 1.
      The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                 15

  11. When man has been thus recreated how will a per-
fect home be provided for him? Isa. 65 : 17; 2 Peter
3: 13; Rev. 21:1.
  12. What will still remain as the sign between God and
His redeemed people? Isa. 66: 22, 23.
                             Notes.
   1. It is certainly significant that the first chapter of the
Bible should be occupied with an account of creation, and
that the time employed in the creative work should be so
explicitly stated. The reason for this becomes clear when
we study the plan of redemption. That creation which was
pronounced "very good" was marred by sin, and there must
be a new creation. Man must be renewed "after the image
of Him that created him," and there must be new heavens
and a new earth. Redemption is thus simply the bringing
to perfection again the original creation when man was
created in the image of God.
    2. The development in this last generation of the theory
of evolution as the scientific method of creation is of much
meaning in its relation to the closing work in the plan of
redemption. "The assumption that the events of the first
week required thousands upon thousands of years, strikes
directly at the foundation of the fourth commandment. It
 represents the Creator as commanding men to observe the
week of literal days in commemoration of vast, indefinite
 periods. This is unlike His method of dealing with His
 creatures. It makes indefinite and obscure that which He
 has made very plain. It is infidelity in its most insidious,
and hence most dangerous, form."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
 page 111. This theory of evolution has now been carried into
 the sphere of religion, and has become the fundamental prin-
 ciple of the. so-called "new theology," which is based upon
 "the acceptance of evolution as the method of divine provi-
 dence in the spiritual sphere as well as in the material." By
 this system of teaching God has been transformed into an
 Infinite Force of Personal Power, and there is no place nor
 need for the atoning work of Christ, as all imperfection will
 be remedied by natural processes.
     3. Almost at the same time that the message of Sabbath
 reform began to be proclaimed, the claims of geology began

"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields,: for they are white
                     already to harvest."
16         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

to be emphasized. "Geologists claim to find evidence from
the earth itself that it is much older than the Mosaic record
teaches. . . . But apart from Bible history, geology can
prove nothing. Those who reason so confidently upon its
discoveries, have no adequate conception of the size of men,
animals, and trees before the Flood, or of the great changes
which then took place. . . . In the days of Noah, men,
animals, and trees, many times larger than now exist, were
buried, and thus preserved as an evidence to later generations
that the antediluvians perished by a flood. God designed that
the discovery of these things should establish faith in in-
spired history; but men, with their vain reasoning, fall into
the same error as did the people before the Flood,—the things
which God gave them as a benefit, they turn into a curse
by making a wrong use of them. It is one of Satan's devices
to lead the people to accept the fables of infidelity; for he
can thus obscure the law of God, in itself very plain, and
embolden men to rebel against the divine government. His
efforts are especially directed against the fourth command-
ment, because it so clearly points to the living God, the Maker
of the heavens, and the earth."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
pages 112, 113.

       LESSON V11.—The Miracles of the Bible.
               FEBRUARY 17, 1906.
                         Questions.
    1. For what purpose did Christ perform miracles, and
why are they recorded? John 20: 30, 31. Compare John
4: 48; 6: 30; 7:31. Note 1.
    2. What surprise is expressed in John 12: 37?
    3. What did Christ state as one ground for faith in
Him? John 14: 11.
    4. Why was Moses instructed to perform miracles be-
fore the children of Israel in Egypt? Ex. 4: 1. Why be-
fore Pharaoh? Ex. 9: 29. And why were these to be told
to later generations? Ex. 10 : 1, 2. Note 2.
    5. Mention some of the miracles performed in connec-
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                 17
tion with the schools of the prophets. 2 Kings 4; 5: 1-14;
6 : 1-7.
     6. What noble examples of faith, courage, and trust in
God, did the principles taught in these schools produce?
Daniel 3 and 6. Note 3.
     7. When Christ sent out the twelve and the seventy,
what power did He give them? Matt. 10 : 7, 8 ; Luke 9 : 1,
2; 10 : 1, 8, 9, 19.
     8. By whose power and through what means did Christ
perform all His miracles? Luke 11 : 20 ; Matt. 12 : 28.
Note 4.
     9. What is the record of the results produced by Christ's
first miracles? John 2 : 11; 4 : 53, 54.
   10. What signs did Christ say should follow believers?
Mark 16: 17, 18.
   11. How was this fulfilled in the days of the apostles?
Acts 5 : 12; Heb. 2: 4. In whose name were they wrought?
Acts 4: 29, 30.                                        •
   12. Does the working of miracles necessarily prove that
a man or his message is from God? Ex. 7: 10, 11; Matt.
7 : 21-23 ; 24 : 23, 24 ; 2 Thess. 2 : 9, 10 ; Rev. 13 : 13, 14;
16 : 13, 14. Note 5.
   13. Wh'at test should be applied to all cases of miracle-
working? Dent. 13 : 1-4; Isa. 8 : 20.
                             Notes.
   1. "Christ never worked a miracle except to supply a
genuine necessity, and every miracle was of a character to
lead the people to the tree of life, whose leaves are for the
healing of the nations."—Desire or Ages, page 366.
   2. Genuine, divine miracles, as brought to view in the
Bible, are extraordinary or supernatural manifestations of
divine power, to awaken an interest in divine things, and to
       The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
18         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

lead men to a knowledge of the true God, and of Jesus
Christ, whom He has sent to be the Saviour of the world.
    3. Daniel and his three Hebrew companions came from
Judea, and were of the royal line. Dan. 1: 3, 6. From 2 Kings
22: 14 and 2 Chron. 34: 22, we learn there was a college or
school of the prophets at Jerusalem shortly before the cap-
tivity. Whether Daniel and his companions actually attended
this school or not, we are not informed; but if they did not,
they and their parents were doubtless much influenced by
the principles taught in it. At any rate, the early education
of these youth taught them to believe in a God who could
work miracles. And this is the education the children and
youth need to-day.
    4. "The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place,
not in a state of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but
surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands
of thousands of holy intelligences, all waiting to do His will.
Through channels which we can not discern, He is in active
communication with every part of His dominion." "The
angels of God are ever passing from earth to heaven, and
from heaven to earth. The miracles of Christ for the afflicted
and suffering were wrought by the power of God through the
ministration of angels. And it is through Christ, by the
ministration of His heavenly messengers, that every blessing
comes from God to us."—Desire of Ages, pages 356, 143.
    5. Miracles are of two kinds, good and bad. Satan also
has power to work miracles. While he can not create, nor
give life, he has studied "the secrets of the laboratories of
nature," and by the use ,of things already created, he can,
so far as God permits, perform wonders. But the Bible calls
them "lying wonders." They are done to deceive, to lead men
into sin, and to fasten them in deception.

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."
20         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

and development? Jer. 15 : 16; Job 23: 12; John 6: 48-
58, 63.
                             Notes.
     1. "Nicodemus had come to the Lord thinking to enter
into a discussion with Him, but Jesus laid bare the founda-
tion principles of truth. He said to Nicodemus, It is not
theoretical knowledge you need, so much as spiritual regen-
eration. You need not to have your curiosity satisfied, but
to have a new heart. You must receive a new life from above
before you can appreciate heavenly things. Until this change
takes place, making all things new, it will result in no saving
good for you to discuss with Me My authority or My mission."
—Desire of Ages, page 171.
     As the Jews by virtue of their birth, nationality, and edu-
cation felt sure of a place in the kingdom of God, so many
to-day feel sure of salvation because they were brought up
Methodists, gpiscopalians, Roman Catholics, Baptists, Presby-
terians, Congregationalists, or Seventh-day Adventists. They
feel no need of a change. But this is all a delusion. If saved,
we must be "born again." We must have the new heart. We
must have the life that is from above.
     What the unconverted sinner needs is not to have the good
that is in him cultivated and developed, but to have his nature
changed, and a new life begun within him. He needs to be-
come a new creature in Christ Jesus. It is not evolution that
is needed, but creation; it is not generation, but regeneration.
     2. "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power
takes possession of the new heart. A change is wrought which
man can never accomplish for himself. It is a supernatural
work, bringing a supernatural element into the human nature.
. . . Unless we become vitally connected with God, we can
never resist the unhallowed effects of self-love and self-
indulgence, and temptation to sin. We may leave off many
bad habits for the time, we may part company with Satan;
but without a vital connection with God, through the sur-
render of ourselves to Him moment by moment, we shall be
overcome. Without a personal acquaintance with Christ, and
a continual communion, we are at the mercy of the enemy,
and shall do his bidding in the end."—Desire of Ages, pages
323, 324.
     3. "The Saviour did not meet argument with argument.
Raising His hand with solemn, quiet dignity, He pressed the
truth home with greater assurance, 'Verily, verily, I say unto
      The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                    21

thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can
not enter into the kingdom of God.' Nicodemus knew that
Christ here referred to water baptism, and the renewing of
the heart by the Spirit of God.
   "By nature the heart is evil, and 'who can bring a clean
thing out of an unclean?—Not one.' No human invention can
find a remedy for the sinning soul. 'The carnal mind is
enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of
God, neither indeed can be.' Out of the heart proceed evil
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false wit-
ness, blasphemies.' The fountain of the heart must be purified
before the streams can become pure. He who is trying to
reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law, is at-
tempting an impossibility. There is no safety for one who has
merely a legal religion, a form of godliness. The Christian's
life is not a modification or improvement of the old, but a
transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin,
and a new life altogether. This change can be brought about
only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit."—Desire of
Ages, pages 171, 172.
    4. The new birth is controlled by the will as well as the old.
While the new life comes from God, and is dependent wholly
upon God, there must be an assent of the mind, a yielding
of the will, or the change will not be wrought in the soul.
"Let this mind by in you, which was also in Christ Jesus."
Phil. 2: 5. See also Rev. 3: 20.
    5. "By faith you become Christ's, and by faith you are
to grow up in Him,—by giving and taking. You are to give
all,—your heart, your will, your service,—give yourself to Him
to obey His requirements; and you must take all,—Christ,
the fulness of all blessing, to abide in your heart, to be your
strength, your righteousness, your everlasting Helper,—to
give you power to obey. Consecrate yourself to God in the
morning; make this your first work. Let your prayer be,
`Take me, 0 Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at
Thy feet. Use me to-day in Thy service. Abide with me, and
let all my work be wrought in Thee.' This is a daily matter.
Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day. Sur-
render all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as
His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be
giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life
will be molded more and more after the life of Christ."—Steps
to Christ, pages 84, 85.

         LESSON IX.—The Obedience of Faith.
                      MARCH 3, 1906.
                         Questions.
     1. What is faith? Heb. 11: 1. The American Revised
Version reads : "Now faith is assurance of things hoped

   13. What, therefore, is inseparably connected with gen-
uine faith? Rev. 14 : 12; Rom. 3 : 31.
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."

                            Note.
   "We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for sal-
vation is the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But
obedience is the fruit of faith." "That so-called faith in
Christ which professes to release men from the obligation
of obedience to God is not faith, but presumption."—Steps to
Christ, pages 73, 74.

                  LESSON X.—Prayer.

35. Note 6.
  16. What is a good practice for taking out of our hearts
all bitterness and evil feeling toward any soul? Matt.
5: 44, last clause.
                             Notes.
   1. It is a proper thing to learn how to pray. In the schools
of the prophets "a spirit of devotion was cherished. Not
only were the students taught the duty of prayer, but they
were taught how to pray, how to approach their Creator, how
to exercise faith in Him, and how to understand and obey the
teachings of the Spirit."—Education, page v. See also "Patri-
archs and Prophets," page 596. Many fail to begin the day
right. David said the Lord should hear his voice in the
morning. Ps. 5: 3.• An appropriate and beautiful morning
prayer will be found in "Steps to Christ," page 84. See note
6, of Lesson VI11. In "Testimonies," Vol. VI, page 324, the
instruction is given in praying for the sick: "As you pray,
speak to Christ as you would a trusted and much-loved friend."
   2. What is known as the Lord's prayer is doubtless the
briefest, most comprehensive, and most perfect prayer ever
put into human language. It is indeed a model prayer, and
should be learned and studied by all. Besides its address,
adoration, and ascription of dominion, power, and glory to
the Father in heaven, its petitions cover every human need.
      The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.

Like the first verse of the Bible, the stamp of divinity is
upon it. It is beautiful in its simplicity, brevity, directness,
clearness, and comprehensiveness. There are sermons in
every expression in it. There is no other prayer like it, nor
any to be compared to it.
   3. From Elijah we may learn a lesson of both definiteness
and earnestness in prayer. He prayed earnestly, and he
prayed for a definite, particular thing; and God heard and
answered his prayer. The Lord has instructed us to "hold
convocations for prayer," asking Him to open the way for the
truth to enter the strongholds of Satan; to "solicit prayer for
the souls for whom we labor," and to "present them before the
church as subjects for their supplication;" to "select another
and still another soul" to be prayed for. And we have the
assurance given us that "there are miracles to be wrought
in genuine conversion, miracles that can not be discerned.
The greatest men of the earth are not beyond the power of a
wonder-working God."—Testimonies, Vol. VI, pages 80-82.
May not parents with unconverted children gather a sugges-
tion and encouragement from this?
   4. As we near the close of earth's history, and enter the
closing struggles of the great conflict between good and evil,
would it not be a wise thing for God's people to follow the
example set by David and Daniel, and pray three times a
clay, at evening, morning, and noon? Do not we need to
pray as much as they?
    5. "Many are zealous in religious services, while between
them and their brethren are unhappy differences which they
might reconcile. God requires them to do all in their power
to restore harmony. Until they do this, He can not accept
their services. The Christian's duty in this matter is clearly
pointed out."—Desire of Ages, pages 310, 311.
    6. In working out our salvation, much depends upon the
spirit we cherish toward others. God has promised to treat us
as we treat others. If we judge, we shall be judged. If we do
not forgive, we shall not be forgiven. "With the merciful
Thou wilt show Thyself merciful; . . . with the froward
Thou wilt show Thyself froward." Ps. 18: 25, 26, "For He shall'
have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy."
James 2: 13. It is a fact worthy of note that the only part
of the Lord's prayer upon which Christ commented after giv-
ing the prayer, is the expression, "and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors." And His comment is: "For if
ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will

 also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses,
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." Matt. 6:
14,15. This, therefore, must be a very important matter. We
 can not afford to harbor ill feelings in our hearts toward any.


            LESSON XI.—A Modern Apostasy.
                       MARCH 17, 1906.
                           Questions.
      1. What exhortation applies with special force at a time
  when iniquity abounds and the love of many is waxing
  cold? Jude 3.
      2. What prophetic description is given of the decadence
  of religion in the last days? 2 Tim. 3 : 1-5.
      3. What course will some pursue "in the latter times"?
  1 Tim. 4 : 1.
      4. What great apostasy was predicted to come before
  the second advent of Christ? 2 Thess. 2 : 3, 4.
      5. How is the same experience presented in symbolic
  prophecy? Rev. 13: 1-8.
      6. What name is given in another prophecy to this
  religio-political organization? Rev. 17 : 1-5.
      7. What led to the fall of ancient Babylon? Dan.
  5: 18-24. Read the whole chapter, and note that the ex-
  perience of Nebuchadnezzar was the threefold message of
  warning to Belshazzar.
-     8. What do the Scriptures declare concerning the fate
  of modern Babylon? Rev. 14: 8; 18 : 1-3.
      9. In what movement was an effort made to restore to
  an apostate church the pure gospel? Ans.—The great re-

formation carried on by Martin Luther and his associates
in the early part of the sixteenth century.
   10. What were the fundamental principles in this refor-
mation from popery? Ans.—"The Word of God . . .
was the palladium of the reformation."—D'Aubigne.
"This protest (of Spires) opposes two abuses of man in
matters of faith : the first is the intrusion of the civil
magistrate and the second the arbitrary authority of the
church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the
power of conscience above the magistrate; and the author-
ity of the Word of God above the visible church."—
D'Aubigne. The sole and infallible authority of the Word
of God was the primary and fundamental principle of the
Reformation."—D'Aubigne. "This powerful text (Rom.
1: 17) has a mysterious influence on the life of Luther. It
was a creative sentence both for the reformer and for the
Reformation."—D'Aubigne. Compare Acts 20 32; Matt.
22: 21; Rom. 3:28.
   11. What prophecy indicates a relapse to the principles
of popery? Rev. 13 : 11-17. Although this prophecy has
its definite application to the United States of America,
yet the influence of this movement is felt throughout the
vi hole territory of the beast from the sea mentioned in the
first part of this chapter.
   12. To what extent have the principles of Protestantism
already been discarded? Ans.—Dr. Charles A. Briggs of
Union Theological Seminary (New York) says that "the
common doctrine of the present Protestant theologians
would not be recognized by any of the Reformers."
   13. What summary has been given of the results of this

"New Theology" in contrast with old-fashioned Chris-
 tianity? Answer:
    A pantheistic god, instead of a personal God.
    A human Saviour, instead of a divine Saviour.
    Infallible scholarship, instead of an infallible Bible.
    "Modern thought," instead of a "Thus saith the Lord."
    A development of religious ideas from the human mind,
instead of a revelation from God.•
    The natural in all things, the supernatural in nothing.
    Reformation, instead of regeneration.
    Culture, instead of conversion.
    A change of environment, instead of a change of heart.
    The energy of the flesh, instead of prayer and faith.
    Interest in the secular, instead of zeal for religion.
    Nobody afraid of hell, and nobody caring much about
heaven.
    EverybOdy coming out right anyhow, and nobody on the
wrong track except those who cling to the faith once deliv-
ered to the saints.     •
    14. What message is designed to meet this apostasy and
to prepare a people for the coming of the Lord? Rev.
14: 6-12.
    15. What fundamental principles must be emphasized
in this reform movement? Isa. 40: 3-10. The same gospel
message which prepared a people for the coming of the
Lord in the days of John the Baptist. Compare Luke
3: 1-6.
                             Note.
   The nature and extent of the modern apostasy from the
original truths of Christianity may be seen from the follow-
ing summary of the teaching of one of the prominent ex-

ponents of advanced theology. This summary was made for
the Literary Digest, and printed in its issue of March 25, 1905.
It is as follows:
    "The religious consciousness of former generations was
based on divine revelation. It laid emphasis on miracles and
signs. Divinely given interpretation was held to be the real
and indispensable object of a genuine faith, so that often
enough the revealed Book became itself almost a God. This
whole conception of revelation has now disappeared from re-
ligious thought; it was a product of religious reasoning under
the form of an antique philosophy. No longer do heaven and
earth stand opposite each other as two worlds. We do not
now believe in a lower world of hell. There can no longer
be any claim to a revelation in the old sense of the word, and
the idea is not in harmony with the certain results of modern
scientific research. It is beyond doubt that the investigations
of science and of history, and the unprejudiced researches into
the character of original Christianity, which have been going
on for about seventy years without regard to dogmas and
doctrines, have made religion something entirely different
from what it had traditionally been supposed to be. It has
been found, too, that Christ is a historical person, and that
His activity and work can be plainly understood in the light
of His day and surroundings. The historical Christ, without
any signs and wonders, and without the later Christology, is
what the religious consciousness of to-day must deal with.
The deification of Christ has not stood the test of real histori-
cal investigation. Such great problems as those of creation,
providence, prayer, and its hearing, and the personality of God,
wear an entirely new aspect in the light of modern science.
The new truths must be recognized in our pulpits and become
a part of the religious instruction in the schools."
    The wide-spread and growing tendency to use the power
of the state to enforce religious observances, especially as seen
in the efforts to secure Sunday legislation and the enforcement
of Sunday laws, is one of the marked evidences of a falling
away from the true principles of Protestantism. This indi-
cates the influence of the principles of popery; and calls for
the presentation of the message of reform concerning the com-
mandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
    "As Christ alone takes away sin, we can not do so by all
our works. But good works follow redemption as surely as
fruit appears upon a living tree."—Luther,"D'Aubigne History
of the Reformation," Book 11.

ism, Theosophy, Higher Criticism, New-thoughtism, Pantheism,
Evolution, Christian Science, and other "isms" and false
sciences which destroy faith in God, in the Bible, and in
Christ as a personal and complete Saviour. The following
from the Outlook of July 15, 1905, is an evidence of this:
"There are many in these days to whom the message of the
Church is nearly meaningless. To such as these the theologi-
cal terms once in common use, such as atonement, redemp-
tion, regeneration, justification, sanctification, are as anti-
quated, artificial, empty, as the jargon of the alchemist or the
astrologer. To them even the 'story of the cross,' as it is often
told, sounds like a false appeal to the emotions, the misuse
of the narrative of a noble death in an attempt to becloud the
judgment."
    There is much significance in the following statement in
a farewell sermon delivered by a Baptist minister of Detroit,
Mich., not long ago. Giving some advice to his congregation
to guide them in the selection of his successor, he said:
"Don't get a man who doesn't believe in the Deity."         •
