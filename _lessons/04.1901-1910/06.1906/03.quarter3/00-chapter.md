                              Notes.

    1. "Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of
 Adam, signifying that she was not to control him as the head,
 nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand
 by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him.
 A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,, she
 was his second self; showing the close union and the affec-
 tionate attachment that should exist in this relation."—Pa-
 triarchs and Prophets, page 52.
     2. "Every member of the family centers in the father.
 His name, 'house-band,' is the true definition of husband. He
 is the law-maker, illustrating in his own manly bearing the
 sterner virtues, energy, integrity, honesty, arid practical useful-
 ness. The father is in one sense the priest of the houshold, lay-
 ing upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice,
 while the wife and children unite in prayer- and praise. With
 such a household Jesus will tarry, and through His quicken-
 ing influence the parents' joyful exclamations shall yet be
 heard amid more exalted scenes, saying, 'Behold I, and the
 children whom the Lord hath given me.' "—Testimonies for
 the Church, Vol. 1, page 547.
     3. "God hath assigned woman her mission; and if she,
 in' her humble way, yet to the best of her ability, makes a
 heaven of her home, faithfully and lovingly performing her
 duties to her husband and children, continually seeking to
 let a holy light shine from her useful, pule, and virtuous life

4          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
to brighten all around her, she is doing the work left her of
the Master, and will hear from His divine lips, the words,
`Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the
joy of thy Lord.' These women who are doing with ready will-
ingness .what their hands find to do, with cheerfulnes of
spirit aiding their husbands to bear their burdens, and train-
ing their children for God, are missionaries in the highest
sense. They are engaged in an important branch of the great
work to be done on earth to prepare mortals for a higher life;
and they will receive their reward."—Idem, Vol. 2, pages 465,
466.
    "Though the results of her work are not apparent, angels
of God are watching the care-worn mother, noting the burdens
she carries from day to day. Her name may never appear
upon the records of history, or receive the honor and applause
of the world, as may that of the husband and father; but it
is immortalized in the book of God. She is doing what she
can, and her position in God's sight is more exalted than that
of a king upon his throne; for she is dealing with characters,
she is fashioning minds."—Christian Temperance, page 69.
    4. "There are men in this church who feel that they should
teach the truth to others, while they are fretful, impatient,
and fault-finding in their own families. Such need that one
teach them, until they become patient, God-fearing men at
home. They need to learn the first principles of true religion.
They should seek God with earnestness of soul; for they have
been a scourge to their families, and as a desolating hail
to depress and destroy their brethren. These men do not
deserve the name of husband, 'house-band;' for they do not
bind the family together with the Christian love, sympathy,
and true dignity of a godly life and Christlike character."—
Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 4, page 612.
    5. "Marriage, a union for life, is a symbol of the union
between Christ and His church. The spirit that Christ mani-
 fests toward the church is the spirit that husband and wife
are to manifest toward each other. Neither husband nor wife
is to make a plea for rulership. The Lord has laid down the
principle that is to guide in the matter. The husband is to
cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church. And the
wife is to respect and love her husband. Both are to cultivate
the spirit of kindness, being determined never to grieve or
injure the other.
    "My brother and sister, both of you have strong will-power.
We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  5

You may make this power a great blessing or a great curse
to yourselves and to those with whom you come in contact.
Do not try to compel each other to do as you wish. You can
not do this, and retain each others love. Manifestations of
self-will destroy the peace and happiness of the home. Let
not your married life be one of contention. If you do, you
will both be unhappy. Be kind in speech and gentle in action,
giving up your own wishes. Watch well your words; for they
have a powerful influence for good or for ill. Allow no sharp-
ness to come into your voices. Bring into your united life
the fragrance of Christlikeness."—Idem, Vol. 7. pages 46, 47.

children? Prov. 29 : 15. Note 2.

of Hannah? 1 Sam. 1: 9-11, 26-28. Note 5.
                            Notes.
   1. It is a lamentable fact that many of our youth are
drifting into the world. A great question confronts this
denomination in the work of our young people. Many of the
problems in this work must be solved by the parents in the
home. No college, academy, church school, or young people's
society can ever do the work of the parents. These can all
be a help, but there must be some special cooperation on
the part of parents before the work which the Lord says
should be done for the young can be accomplished. If parents
fail to maintain government in their homes; if they fail to
surround their children with the right influence, to diligently
instruct them in the precepts of the word, to pray with and
for them, all that others may do will be largely undone in
the home. It is time that parents took this burden to heart
as never before. We can take children with us to the new
earth, and no sacrifice should be considered too great to accom-
plish this blessed result.
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
           SABBAT Ft-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7

    2. "Children who are allowed to come up to manhood or
womenhood with the will undisciplined and the passions un-
controlled, will generally in after life pursue a course which
God condemns."--Testimonies for the Church, No. 31, page 34.
    "The neglect of parents to properly discipline their children
has been a fruitful source of evil in many families. The youth
have not been restrained as they should have been. Parents
have neglected to follow the directions of the Word of God in
this matter, and the children have taken the reins of govern-
ment into their own hands. The consequence has been that
they have generally succeeded in ruling their parents, instead
of being under their authority."—Idem. Vol. 4, pages 192, 193.
    "False ideas and a foolish, misdirected affection have nur-
tured traits which have made the children unlovely and un-
happy, have embittered the lives of the parents, and have
extended their baleful influence from generation to generation.
Any child that is permitted to have his own way will dis-
honor God and bring his father and mother to shame."—
Mem: No. 32, page 81.
    3. "Eli did not manage his household according to God's
rules for family government. He followed his own judgment.
The fond father overlooked the faults and sins of his sons
in their childhood, flattering himself that after a time they
would outgrow their evil tendencies. Many are now making
a similar mistake. They think they know a better way of
training their children than that which God has given in His
Word. They foster wrong tendencies in them, urging as an
excuse, 'They are too young to be punished. Wait till they be-
come older, and can be reasoned with.' Thus wrong habits
are left to strengthen until they become second nature. The
children grow up without restraint, with traits of character
that are a lifelong curse to them, and are liable to be repro-
duced in others.
    "There is no greater curse upon households than to allow
the youth to have their own way. When parents regard every
wish of their children, and indulge them in what they know
 is not for their good, the children soon lose all respect for
their parents, all regard for the authority of God and man,
and are led captive at the will of Satan. The influence of
an ill-regulated family is widespread, and disastrous to all
society. It accumulates in a tide of evil that effects families,
communities, and governments."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
-pages 544, 54 5.
"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                       watchword.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    4. "God condemns the negligence that dallies with sin
and crime, and the insensibility that is slow to detect its
baleful presence in the families of professed Christians. He
holds parents accountable, in a great degree, for the faults and
follies of their offspring. God visited with His curse, not only
the sons of Eli, but Eli himself, and this fearful example
should be a warning to the parents of this time.
    "As I looked upon the perilous situation of our youth, and
was shown how indifferent the parents are to their welfare,
my heart was sick and faint; angels were troubled, and wept
with grief. The youth are passing into the world, and into
the hands of Satan. They are becoming less susceptible to
the sweet influences of the grace of God, bolder and more
defiant, and manifest increasing disregard of eternal inter-
ests. I saw Satan planting his banner in the households
of those who profess to be God's chosen ones; but those who
are walking in the light should be able to discern the differ-
ence between the black banner of the adversary and the
blood-stained standard of Christ."—Testimonies for the
Church, Vol. 4, page 200.
    5. "What a reward was Hannah's! and what encouragement
to faithfulness is her example! There are opportunities of
inestimable worth, interests infinitely precious, committed to
every mother. The humble round of duties which women have
come to regard as a wearisome task, should be looked upon
as a grand and noble work. It is the mother's privilege to
bless the world by her influence, and in doing this she will
bring joy to her own heart. She may make straight paths
for the feet of her children, through sunshine and shadow,
to the glorious heights above. But it is only when she seeks,
in her own life, to follow the teachings of Christ, that the
mother can hope to form the character of her children after the
divine pattern."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 538.

          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  9

instruction of his father? Prov. 13 : 1; 15 : 5.
     7. What sad evil in the home, between parents and
children, will constitute a sign of the last days? 2 Tim.
3: 1-5. Is this sign now being fulfilled?
    8. How does the Lord regard this evil thing? Prov.
20: 20; 30: 11, 17.
     9. What example of obedience to his parents is left-
the young by the Saviour? Luke 2 : 51.
  •10. What great work is to be wrought in the home
between parents . and children before the Lord comes?
Mal. 4 : 5, 6.
   11. When John the Baptist came in the spirit and power
of Elijah, what was the effect upon both parents and
children? Luke 1: 11-17.
   12. What does this indicate concerning a special work
to be wrought in the homes of God's people under the in-
fluence of the "latter rain"? Note 3.
   13. What bearing does this have upon our need of the
Holy Spirit?
                             Notes.
   1. This is the "first commandment with promise" doubt-
less for the reason that it is the first precept which we are
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a saviour.
10         SABBATII-SC 11001. LE:4S0N QUARTERLY

called upon to obey when born into the world. The first duty
a child can render is obedience to its parents.
    2. "Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect
which is due to no other person. God Himself, who has placed
upon them a responsibility for the souls committed to their
charge, has ordained that during the earlier years of life
parents shall stand in the place of God to their children.
And he who rejects the rightful authority of his parents, is
rejecting the authority of God. The fifth commandment re-
quires children not only to yield respect, submission, and
obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and
tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation,
and to succor and comfort them in old age. It also enjoins
respect for ministers and rulers, and for all others to whom
God has delegated authority."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
290.
   3. "As the children sang in the temple courts, 'Hosanna!
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,' so in
these last days; children's voices will be raised to give the
last message of warning to a perishing world. When heavenly
intelligences see that men are no longer permitted to present
the truth, the Spirit of God will come upon the children, and
they will do a work in the proclamation of the truth which
the older workers can not do, because their way will be
hedged up."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, pages 202,
203.

   1. "Young men and women, you are accountable to God for
the light that- He has given you. This light and these warn-
ings, if not heeded, will rise up in the judgment against you.
         Prayerfully consider the unentered
12         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

tour dangers have been plainly stated; you have been cautioned
and guarded on every side, hedged in with warnings. In the
house of God you have listened to the most solemn, heart-
searching truths presented by the servants of God in demon-
stration of the Spirit. What weight do these solemn appeals
have upon your hearts? What influence do they have upon
your characters? You will be held responsible for every one
of these appeals and warnings. They will rise up in the judg-
ment to condemn those who pursue a life of vanity, levity,
and pride.
    "Dear young friends, that which you sow, you will also
reap. Now is the sowing time for you. What will the har-
vest be? What are you sowing? Every word you utter, every
act you perform, is a seed which will bear good or evil fruit,
and will result in joy or sorrow to the sower. As is the seed
sown, so will be the crop. God has given you great light and
many privileges. After this light has been given, after your
dangers have been plainly presented before you, the respon-
sibility becomes yours. The manner in which you treat the
light that God gives you, will turn the scale for happiness or
woe. You are shaping your destinies for yourselves."—Testi-
moities for the Church, Vol. 3, page 363.
    2. "A little time spent in sowing your wild oats, dear
young friends, will produce a crop that will embitter your
whole life; an hour of thoughtlessness—once yielding to
temptation—may turn the whole current of your life in the
wrong direction. You can have but one youth; make that use-
ful. When once you have passed over the ground, you can
never return to rectify your mistakes. He who refuses to
connect with God, and puts himself in the way of temptation,
will surely fall. God is testing every youth."—Idem, Vol.
4, pages 622, 623.
    3. The youth who find joy and happiness in reading the
Word of God and in the hour of prayer, are constantly re-
freshed by draughts from the Fountain of Life. He will attain a
height of moral excellence and a breadth of thought of which
others can not conceive."—Idem, Vol. 4, page 624.
    "I was shown that the youth must take a higher stand,
and make the Word of God the man of their counsel and their

men and young women who are consecrated to God. The
youth, if right, could sway a mighty influence. Preachers,
or laymen advanced in years, can not have one-half the in-
fluence upon the young that the youth, devoted to God, can
have upon their associates. They ought to feel that a respon-
sibility rests upon them to do all they can to save their fel-
low mortals, even at a sacrifice to their pleasure and natural
desires."—/dem, Vol. 1, page 511.
    "Young men and young women, gather a stock of knowl-
edge. Do not wait until some human examination pronounces
you competent to work, but go out into the highways and
hedges, and begin to work for God. Use wisely the knowledge
you have. • Exercise your ability with faithfulness, gener-
ously imparting the light that God gives you."—Idem, Vol. 7,

self true to God,—under all circumstances to act as became a

where there is strength and peace, and a final rest for the
weary. He should not come to his home with a clouded brow,
but should with his presence bring sunlight into the family,
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."

and should encourage his wife to look up and believe in God.
Unitedly they can claim the promises of God, and bring His
rich blessing into the family. Unkindness, complaining, and
anger shut Jesus from the dwelling. I saw that angels of God
will flee from a houSe where there are unpleasant words,
fretfulnes and strife."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1,
page 307.
    "A house with love in it, where love is expressed in words
and looks and deeds, is a place where angels love to manifest
their presence, and hallow the scene by rays of light from
glory. There the humble household duties have a charm in
them."—Idem, Vol. 2, page 417.
    2. "Those who profess to believe the Third Angel's Message
often wound the cause of God by lightness, joking, and trifling.
 I was shown that this evil was all through our ranks.' There
should be a humbling before the Lord; the Israel of God should
rend the heart, and not the garment."—Idem, Vol. 1, page
133.
    "Jesting, joking, and worldly conversation belong to the
world. Christians who have the peace of God in their hearts.
will be cheerful and happy without indulging in lightness or
frivolity. While watching unto prayer, they will have a ser-
enity and peace which will elevate them above all super-
fluities."—Idem, *Vol. 3. page 241.                        •
     3. "Is it not a better thing to seek to make the living
happy than to leave them to walk along dreary paths without
sympathy,—unhelped, neglected, perhaps wronged,—and then
 flood their coffins with sunshine? Many a man goes down
 under the pressure of life's hardship and the weight of its
 burdens, never hearing the voice of human sympathy. What
 matters it to him, when the agony is over and he lies dead
 in the field, that friends come in throngs to lament his Sall
 and to utter his praises? May it not be that a tithe of the
 sympathy and appreciation wasted and unavailing now would
 have kept his heart bravely beating for many another year?
    "Do not, then, keep the alabaster boxes of your loVe and
 tenderness sealed up until your friends are dead. Fill their
 lives with sweetness. Speak approving, cheering words while
 their ears can hear them. The things. you mean to say when
 they are gone say before they go. The flowers you mean to
 send for their coffins send to brighten and sweeten their
 homes before they leave them."=Week Day Religion, pages
159, 160.
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                    already to harvest."

ages us to pray? James 5 : 15-18.
  15. What strong assurance is given to those who pray

                            Notes.

   1. Moses was under the instruction of his mother until
about twelve years of age. The godly instruction imparted
during these years laid the foundation for the noble and un-
paralleled career of this mighty man. It enabled him to live
amid the splendor and idolatry of the court of the Pharaohs,
and to receive the education of a statesman, yet to maintain
in his heart the pure precepts of the religion of the Most
High. What a noble example for mothers.
    2. "Then there is nothing else that so sweetens the home
life. True family worship is a fountain that brings streams
of holy influence into every, part of the household. It is a
vase of perfume that sheds fragrance over all. It softens
asperities. It quells anger. It quiets impatience. It settles
differences. It subdues evil passions. Hearts that are drawn
together at God's feet every day can not get very far apart.
The frictions of the day are forgotten when all voices mingle
in the same heavenly song. As the tender words of in-
spiration fall with their benign counsels all feeling of unkind-
ness melts away. The altar in the midst wondrously hallows
and sweetens the home fellowship. Besides, it puts new
     "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
iS         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

strength into every heart. It comforts sorrow. It is a shield
against temptation. It smooths out the wrinkles of care.
It inspires strength for burden-bearing. It quickens every
religious sentiment and keeps the fires burning on every
heart's altar."—Week Day Religion, page 79.
    3. "The hour for joyful, happy songs of praise to God and
His dear Son had come. Satan had led the heavenly choir.
He had raised the first note, then all the angelic host united
with him, and glorious strains of music had resounded through
heaven in honor of God and His dear Son. But now, instead
of strains of sweetest music, discord and angry words fall
upon the ear of the great rebel leader. Where was he? Was
it not all a horrible dream? Was he shut out of heaven? Were
the •gates of heaven never more to open and admit him?
The hour of worship draws nigh, when bright and holy angels
bow before the Father. No more will he unite in heavenly
song. No more will he bow in reverence and holy awe before
the presence of the eternal God. Could he. be again as he was
when he was pure, true, and loyal, gladly would he yield up
the claims of his authority. But he was lost, beyond redemp-
tion, tor his presumptious rebellion!"—Spirit of Prophecy,
page 28.
    4. "Morning and evening, the father, as priest of the house-
hold, should confess to God the sins committed by himself
and his children through the day. Those sins which have come
to his knowledge, and also those which are secret, of which
God's eye alone has taken cognizance, should be confessed.
This rule of action, zealously carried out by the father when
he is present or by the mother when he is absent, will result
in blessings to the family."—Testimonies for the Church,
Vol. 2, page 701.
    "The father, who is the 'house-band' of the family, will
bind his children to the throne of God by living faith. Dis-
trusting his own strength, he hangs his helpless soul on Jesus,
and takes hold of the strength of the Most High. Brethren,
pray at home, in your family, night and morning; pray earn-
estly in your closet; and while engaged in your daily labor,
lift up your soul to God in prayer. • It was thus that Enoch
walked with God."—Idem, Vol. 4, page 616.
    5. "We never need to distrust God. The just Judge re-
pulses no one who comes to Him in contrition. He has more
pleasure in His church struggling with temptation here below,
than in the imposing host of angels that surround His throne.
Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the

                             Notes.


   1. Home should be a miniature heaven. It should be the
dearest place on earth to each member of the family. That
alone which will make it what the Lord desires it should be,
is love. Nowhere are the tender, gentle, soul-winning,
heavenly graces of the Holy Spirit more fitting than in the
home circle, between husband and wife, and the children.
Without this adorning, no home is worthy the name. Let
these lessons on the fruits of the Spirit be studied with this
thought especially in mind.
    2. "Christ's act in cursing the tree which His own power
had created, stands as a warning to all churches and to all
Christians. No one can live the law of God without minister-
ing to others. But there are many who do not live out Christ's
merciful, unselfish life. Some who think themselves excellent
Christians do not understand what constitutes service for
God. They plan and study to please themselves. They act
only in reference to self. Time is of value to them only as they
can gather for themselves. In all the affairs of life this is their
object. Not for others, but for themselves, do they minister.
k.zod created them to live in a world where unselfish service
must be performed. He designed them to help their fellow-men
in every possible way. But self is so large that they can not
see anything else. They are not in touch with humanity.
Those who thus live for self are like the fig-tree, which made
every pretension, but was fruitless. They observe the forms of
worship, but without repentance or faith. In profession they
honor the law of God, but obedience is lacking. They say,
but do not. In the sentence pronounced on the fig-tree Christ
demonstrates how hateful in His eyes is this vain pretense.
He declares that the open sinner is less guilty than is he
who professes to serve God, but who bears no fruit to His
glory."—Desire of Ages, page 584.
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."

35.
    4. By what may we know that we have passed from
death unto life? 1 John 3: 14. Note 1.
    5. If the fruit of love is in the heart, what will be our
attitude toward our enemies? Matt. 5 : 44-48 ; Rom.
12 : 19-21.
     6. What exhortation seems especially applicable to the
home? Rom. 12 : 10. Compare Eph. 5 : 21-25.
     7. How is the fruit of joy emphasized? Phil 4: 4;
3 : 1.
     8. In what trying time may joy be manifest? Matt.
5 : 11, 12; Acts 5 : 41.

tion and necessity? 2 Cor. 12 : 9, 10.

  14. How is joy manifest in the soul of the believer?
Eph. 5 : 19; Col. 3 : 16.
15. How is the kingdom of God defined? Rom. 14: 17
16. For what did the apostle Paul pray? Rom. 15: 13.
Note 2.
                              Notes.

    1. Many are in perplexity as to whether they are in a
saved condition, whether or not they have passed from death
 unto life. They need not be. Here is a test by which each
can determine for himself his standing before the Lord. If
we love the brethren, not some of them simply, but all of them,
our name stands recorded in the book of life. But if hatred
fills our heart against some one, we are not written among
the living.
   2. "If we do represent Christ, we shall make His service
appear attractive, as it really is. Christians who gather up
gloom and sadness to their souls, and murmur and complain,
are giving to others a false representation of God and-the
Christian life. They give the impression that God is not
Pleased to have His children happy, and in this they bear
false witness against our Heavenly Father."—Steps to Christ,

                             Notes. •

      1. "In the heart of Christ, where reigned perfect harmony
  with God, there was perfect peace. He was never elated by
  applause, nor dejected by censure or disappointment. Amid
  the greatest opposition and the most cruel treatment, He was
  still of good courage. But many who profess to be His fol-
  lowers have an anxious, troubled heart, because they are afraid
  to trust themselves with God. They do not make a complete
  surrender to Him for they shrink from the consequences
  that such a surrender may involve. Unless they do make this
  surrender, they can not find peace. It is the love of self that
  brings unrest."—Desire of Ages, page 330.
•     2. "We can have the salvation of God in our families, but
  we must believe for it, live for it, and have a continual, abi-
  ding faith and trust in God. We must subdue a hasty temper,
  and control our words; and in this we shall gain great vic-
  tories. Unless we control our words and temper, we are slaves
  to Satan. We are in subjection to him. He leads us captive.
  All jangling and unpleasant, impatient, fretful words are an
  offering presented to his Satanic majesty. And it is a costly
  offering, more costly than any sacrifice we can make. for God;
  for it destroys the peace and happiness of whole families, de-
 stroys health, and is eventually the cause of forfeiting an
  eternal life of happiness."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol.
  1, page 310.

His glory when He comes to impart rich blessings."—Testi-
monies for the Church, No. 31, page 211.
   2. "The• difficulties we have to encounter may be very
much lessened by that meekness which hides itself in Christ.
If we possess the humility of our Master, we shall rise above
the slights, the rebuffs, the annoyances to which we are daily
exposed, and they will cease to cast a gloom over. the spirit.
The highest evidence of nobility in a Christian is self-control."

Revised Version of Rom. 12: 1.
                           Notes.

    1. For the word "temperance" given in the Authorized•
Version, the Revised Versions have "self-control." See such
texts as Gal. 5:23; Acts 24: 25; 1 Cor. 9: 25. etc. This gives
the correct idea. True temperance means to exercise self-
control in all things.
    2. "There is real common sense in•health reform. People
can not all eat the same things. Some articles of food that
are wholesome and palatable to one person, may be hurtful to
another. Some can not use milk, while others can subsist upon
it. For some dried beans and peas are wholesome, while others
can not digest them. Some stomachs have become so sensi-
tive that they can not make use of the coarser kind of graham
flour. So it is impossible to make an unvarying rule by which
to regulate every one's dietetic habits. Narrow ideas, an
overstraining of small points, have been a great injury to
the cause of hygiene."—Christ:an Temperance, page 57.

   3. Temperance, sometimes called physical righteousness,
is a fruit of the      Spirit, and in its truest sense can be ac-
quired only by the operation of the Spirit of God on the
intemperate passions of the natural heart. It should be
studied, and practiced, from the Christian rather than the
pagan standpoint. Various forms of correct living are mani-
fest among heathen nations and have been for centuries, but
those who have practiced them are pagan still. Men of the
world adopt temperate habits that their minds may be clear
to drive sharp bargains and manipulate transactions to their
own advantage, and operate schemes to plunder the people.
Others practice proper habits bf eating and drinking to
develop muscle in order to win in some physical contest.
Temperance from the Christian standpoint is far different
from these. It is a thing of the heart, a fruit of righteous-
ness, a purification of the soul from unclean passions through
faith. Its object is the attainment of a pure and holy life,
which is wrought only by the operation of the Spirit of God.

                           Notes.
   1. "Every injustice or grievance reacts and leaves a stain
and a wound. All the cruelties and persecutions that human
hate could inflict would not leave one trace of real harm upon
us, but every feeling of resentment admitted into our hearts,
every angry word uttered, will leave a stain. Forbearance
thus becomes a perfect shield which protects us from all the
cruelties and wrongs of life."—Week Day Religion, page 201.
     "There shall be delay no longer"---our confidence.
30         SABBATH-SOHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. "It is a majestic power, this power of keeping silent.
Great is the conqueror who leads armies to victories. Mighty
is the strength that captures a city. But he is greater who can
rule his own spirit. There are men who can command armies.
but can not command themselves. There are men who by
their burning words can sway vast multitudes who can not
keep silence under provocation or wrong. The highest mark
of nobility is self-control. It is more kingly than regal crown
and purple robe."—Idem, pages 198, 199.
    3. Impatience! This evil thing is manifest everywhere.
How many irritable, fretful souls there are who manifest,
through sharp, impatient words, the raging, uncontrolled
Passions within. In many professed Christian homes hearts
are many times caused to ache because of unkind words,
spoken because of anger aroused through some trifling thing.
"My brethren, these things ought not so to be." With the
Lord there is help for every soul who is "easily provoked."

    15. What blessing is promised for• obedience? Prov.
13: 13; Ps. 19:7-11.
                              Notes.
   1. The Lord blessed Abraham that he might be a blessing.
For a like reason he blessed the Sabbath day, that it might
be a blessing to man. The blessing of God placed on the Sab-
bath is just as real a thing as the blessing which He gives to
man. But in order for us to enjoy this blessing it is neces-
sary that we observe, as He has directed, the day He blessed.
   2. We- are to remember the Sabbath to keep it holy.
Throughout the entire week we are to so plan our secular
affairs that, when the Sabbath comes to us, we will be ready
to receive it, and not desecrate its sanctity because of our
forgetfulneSs. In this sense the fourth commandment, like
the other nine, covers all the transactions of life during the
entire seven days of the week.
   1. The divine Sabbath law commands that man's work shall
         Prayerfully consider the unentered Melds.
 32          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   be done in the "six working days" (Eze. 46: 1). The first hour
  of the Sabbath is as holy as any other hour, and when the day
   begins our own work should end and the Lord's work only
  should be done. Many are so burdened with the "cares of this
  life" that they frequently violate the sanctity of the Sabbath
  at its beginning and at its close in order to do their own
  work. Those who do this grieve the Spirit, and fail of re-
  ceiving the full blessing of the Sabbath-keeping.
      There is no more fitting way to begin the Sabbath than,
  as its sacred hours draw near, to assemble the family, and,
/ after singing, and reading God's blessed Word, engage, in a
  season of prayer, invoking pardon for sin, and asking for a
  Sabbath blessing. Then as its closing moments draw nigh,
  offer a prayer of thanksgiving; and ask for strength for the
  coming week.
      4. "When the Sabbath commences we should place a guard
  upon ourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God
  by appropriating to our own use that time which is strictly
  the Lord's. We should not do ourselves, nor suffer our chil-
  dren to do, any manner of our own' work for a livelihood, or
  anything which could have been done on the six working
  days. Friday is the day of preparation. Time can then be de-
  voted to making the necessary preparation for the Sabbath,
  and to thinking and conversing about it. Nothing which will
  in the sight of heaven be regarded as a violation of the Holy
  Sabbath should be left unsaid or undone, to be said or done
  upon the Sabbath. God requires not only that we refrain
  from physical labor upon the Sabbath, but that the mind be
  disciplined to dwell upon sacred themes. The fourth com-
  mandment is virtually transgressed by conversing upon
  worldly things or by engaging in light and trifling conversa-
  tion. Talking upon anything or everything which may come
  into the mind, is speaking our own words. Every deviation
  from right brings us into bondage and condemnation."—Testi-
  monies for the Church, Vol. 2, pages 702, 703.
      5. We are not to do our own ways, or our own pleasure,
  or speak our own words on the Sabbath. To think and plan
  regarding our secular business on the Sabbath, or permit our
  mind to dwell on things pertaining to worldly pleasure, is a
  violation of the Sabbath. The fourth commandment, like the
  other precepts, covers the thoughts and intents of the heart,
  and when the Sabbath begins there should be a cessation, not
  simply of secular labor, but of secular thoughts as well.
 We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                          our field.
