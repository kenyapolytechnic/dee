    LESSON 1.—The Salvation Provided for All.
               OCTOBER 6, 1906.
                        Questions.

Born. 3:23.

22 : 17.
     6. What is God declared to be? 1 John 4 :8.
     7. What are those who hate God, and reject the plan
of salvation,' said to love? Prov. 8 : 35, 36.
     8. What is the nature of the salvation which is as-
sured to the Israel of God? Isa. 45: 17.

  10. What warning is given to those who "neglect" it?
Heb. 2 : 3.
  11. After so full provision for free salvation, what
will be the final experience of those who "neglect" it?
Jer. 8 : 20.
  12. When .only is the "accepted time" for receiving
salvation? 2 Cor. 6: 2 ; Heb. 3 : 15.

                                Note.
    Salvation means to save from sin, and from all of its woeful
results, of which the "second death" is the ultimate. It is,
therefore, a message of life, instead of death, a message of fulness
of joy, instead of unutterable woe. This•is, in brief, the "Great
Salvation." The whole scheme is beyond our comprehension, yet
we can joyfully and thankfully avail ourselves of all of its
benefits.

   "The plan for our redemption was not an after-thought, a
plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of
`the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eter-
nal.' It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal
ages have been the foundation of God's throne. Prom the be-
ginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy 'of Satan, and
of the fall of man through the deceptive power of the apostate.
God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its
existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emergency. So
    The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5
great was His love for the world, that lie covenanted to give
His only-begotten Son, `that whosoever believeth in Him should
not perish, but have everlasting life.' "—Desire of Ages, page 80.
   "Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the Father and
the Son had united in a covenant to redeem man if he should be
overcome by Satan. They had clasped their hands in a solemn
pledge that Christ should become the surety for the human race.
This pledge Christ has fulfilled. When upon the cross He cried
out, 'It is finished,' Ho addressed the .e'ather. The compact had
been fully carried out. Now He declared, 'Father, it is finished.
I have done Thy will, 0 My God. I have completed the work
of redemption. If Thy justice is satisfied, I will that they also,
whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.' "—Id., pa,f
834.

secure our salvation, what responsibility is laid upon
us? Heb. 2: 3.
                              Notes.
   1. God delights in the association of pure, intelligent creatures.
This is likewise the greatest delight that the human mind can
experience. Our Father knows full well that we can be supremely
happy only in His service, and .when our minds are filled with
His thoughts, and our eyes behold His glory; even as the Saviour,
having the highest happiness of His followers at heart, said, "Fa-
ther, I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me, be with
Me where I am; that they may behold My glory which Thou hast
given Me; for Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the
world." From this view-point, God is a jealous God, jealous for
the supreme happiness of His people—for the service of any other
than the true God can only bring them misery. It is for this
reason that He says, "My glory will I not give to another," for
if His glory were bestowed upon another, it would make "an-
other" an object of worship, which would result in confusion and
sorrow to some of God's creatures. He only glorified His Son
with Himself, and not separately. See John 17:5.
    2. " Through every age, through every hour, the love of God
had been exercised toward the fallen race. Notwithstanding the
        The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       7
perversity of men, the signals of mercy had been continually ex-
hibited. And when the fulness of the time had come, the Diety
was glorified by pouring upon the world a flood of healing grace
that was never to be obstructed or withdrawn till the plan of
salvation should be fulfilled."—Desire of Ages, page 37.
    " The heart of the human father yearns over his son. He
looks into the face of his little child, and trembles at the thought
of life's peril. He longs to shield his dear one from Satan's
power, to hold him back from temptation and conflict. To meet
a bitter
       er conflict and a more fearful risk, God gave His only-
begotten Son, that the path of life might be made sure for our
little ones. 'Herein is love.' Wonder, 0 heavens! and be aston-
ished, 0 earth! "—Id., page 49.
    3. "I have seen the tender love that God has for His people,
and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints with their
wings spread about them. Each saint had an attending angel.
If the saints wept through discouragement, or were in danger, the
angels that ever attended them would fly quickly upward to carry
the tidings, and the angels in the city would cease to sing. Then
Jesus would commission another angel to descend to encourage,
watch over, and try to keep them from going out of the narrow
path; but if they did not take heed to the watchful care of these
angels, and would not be comforted by them, but continued to go
astray, the angels would look sad and weep. They would bear
the tidings upward, and all the angels in the city would weep,
and then with a loud voice say, Amen. But if the saints fixed
their eyes upon the prize before them, and, glorified God by prais-
ing Him, then the angels would bear the glad tidings to the
city, and the angels in the city would touch their golden harps
and sing with a loud voice, Alleluia! and. the heavenly arches
would ring with their lovely songs."—Early Writings, pages 81, SL
    4. The greatest possible danger to the children of men is to
presume upon, or abuse, God's mercy; for probation for each
individual will close all too soon, and when despised mercy no
longer lingers, many will be surprised. See Isa. 33:14.


     LESSON TV.—The Captain of Our Salvation.

                               Notes.
    1. "In every age there is given to men their day of light and
privilege, a probationary time in which they may become recon-
ciled to God. But there is a limit to this grace. Mercy may plead
for years and be slighted and rejected; but there comes a time
when mercy makes her last plea. The heart becomes so hardened
that it ceases to respond to the Spirit of God. Then the sweet,
winning voice entreats the sinner no longer, and reproofs and
warnings cease."—Desire of Ages, page 587.
    2. ''Light comes to the soul through God's Word, through His
servants, or by the direct agency of His Spirit; but when one ray
"Pray ye therefore. the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        11
of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing of the spiritual
perceptions, and the second revealing of light is less clearly dis-
cerned. So the darkness increases, until it is night in the soul.
Thus it had been with these Jewish leaders. They were convinced
that a divine power attended Christ, but in order to resist the
truth, they attributed the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan. In
doing this they deliberately chose deception; they yielded them-
selves to Satan, and henceforth they were controlled by his
power."—Desire of Ages, page 322.
    "In rejecting Christ, the Jewish people committed the unpar-
donable sin; and, by refusing the invitation of mercy, we may
commit the same error. We offer insult to the Prince of life, and
put Him to shame before the synagogue of Satan, and before the
heavenly universe, when we refuse to listen to His delegated mes-
sengers, and instead listen to the agents of Satan, who would draw
the soul away from Christ. So long as one dces this, he can find
no hope or pardon, and he will finally lose all desire to be recon-
ciled to God."—Id., page 524.

even Satan, to yield Him implicit, unquestioned obedience; but
that lie (Satan) had proved _himself unworthy a place in heaven.
Then Satan exultingly pointed to his sympathizers, comprising
nearly .one-half of all the angels, and exclaimed, These are with
me! Will you expel these also, and make such a void in heaven?
He then declared that he was prepared to resist the authority
of Christ, and to defend his place in heaven by force of might,
strength against strength."—spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 1, page ee.
    2. "It is through Christ, by the ministration of His heavenly
messengers, that every blessing comes from God to us."—Desire
of Ages, Nye 140.
    3. The prophet likeits the people of God to a: maiden, laughing,
and shaking her head at this fierce foe. Think of this strong
army- outside of Jerusalem, and "the virgin daughter of Zion"
laughing and shaking her head at the heathen king's legions.
Certainly she must have had confidence in divine protection.
   4. When an earthly government sends an amLa ssador to another
country, in such a representative is vested all the power of the
nation in whose service he is. So when God commissions a heav-
 enly ambassador to represent the government of the Universe,
all of the power of the kingdom of heaven is vested in the mes-
senger neat for the accomplishment of God's purpose.

                              Notes.
    1. "Whenever one is encompassed with clouds, perplexed by
circumstances, or afflicted by poverty or distress, Satan is at hand
to tempt and annoy. He attacks our weak points of character.
He seeks to shake our confidence in God, who suffers such a con-
dition of things to exist. We are tempted to distrust God, to
question His love. Often the tempter comes to us as he came to
Christ, arraying before us our weakness and infirmities. He hopes
to discourage the soul, and to break our hold on God. Then he
is sure of his prey. If we would meet him as Jesus did, we
should escape many a defeat: By parleying with the enemy, we
give him an advantage."—Desire of Ages, pages 120, 121.
    2. The Word of God is not simply so many leaves, chapters
and verses. It is a thing of life. If all copies of the Scriptures
in existence were burned, the Word of God would still stand fast.
Heb. 4:12, R. V.; 1 Peter 1:23.
    3. "By coming to dwell.with us, Jesus was to reveal God both
to men and to angels. He was the word of God,—God's thought
made audible."—Desire of Ages, page 17.

           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    17
                              Notes.
   1. The first object worshiped by those who forsake the true
God is self; the next is usually the sun, which is the brightest
object visible to men. Then any object, either animate or in-
animate, may be selected as an object of worship by the darkened
mind.
   2. After the wind, the earthquake, and the fire, God spoke to
Elijah by a "still, small voice." While the Lord is using wind-
storms, earthquakes, and great fires to herald His coming, He
desires to speak to each of us by "the still, small voice" of His
Spirit.

tion? Rom. 8: 22.

18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
  10. In connection with what great event will this be
realized? 1 Thess. 4 : 16, 17; Phil. 3: 20, R. V.
  11. In whom then is our hope centered? Mieah 4:8.
  12. What has been promised to man? Ileb. 2 : 5-8 ;

  15. Who have a right to all the blessings of the new
earth? Rev. 22: 14.
                                Notes.
    1. It is not death, or the condition of being "unclothed" that
the redeemed long for, but pbssessing mortal flesh and being
subject to death, there is a natural longing to be "clothed upon,'
or to possess immortality.
    2. There is probably not a single member of the human family
who would endure the struggle against the world, the flesh, and
the devil were it not for that hope which is "an anchor of the
soul, both sure and steadfast," which constitutes the helmet of
salvation. The glorious prospects of "the world to come" thus
constitute an important resource in the plan of salvation.
    3. Joy is usually of a very transient nature here, but in the
"world to come" the ransomed of the Lord will possess "ever-
lasting joy."

sia? Isa. 44: 28; 45: 13. When and how was this ful-
filled? Ezra 1 :1, 2.
   15. What statement did Peter make concerning the
certainty of divine prophecy? 2 Peter 1: 16-19. What
exhortation is given relative to these prophetic utter-
ances?
                               Notes.
     1. The power of the Creator to foretell future events implies
 foreknowledge, and the power also to fashion all things according
 to the council of His own will. As we may stand where our view
 is unobstructed, and he eye-witnesses of scenes which transpire
 before us; so God can look down through the stream of time,
 and with unclouded vision see the end, and all the intervening
 events, from the beginning.                                     •
     2. In the prophecy of the 2,300 days of Dan. 8:14, the exact
 date of the crucifixion of our Lord was foretold. This period
 began with the "going forth of the commandment to restore and
 to build Jerusalem." This decree went forth 457 B. C. See Ezra
7. At the end of sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years, the "anointed
 One, the Prince" was to appear. Christ was anointed at His
 baptism with the Holy Spirit, A. D. 27, and began His work as
"the Messiah. After ifs baptism He came into Galilee "preaching
 the gospel of God and saying, The time is fulfilled." No doubt He
 referred to prophetic time. In the midst, or middle, of the week,
 or three and one-half years later—A. D. 31—He was to be cut
 off, or be crucified, thus causing the "sacrifice and the oblation
 to cease." It would be well in this connection to make a care-
 ful study of the 2,300 days. .See "Thoughts," or "The Sanc-
 tuary and Its Cleansing."
     3. "It [Tyre] is a Babel of broken walls, pillars, vaults, etc.,
 there being not so much as one entire house left! Its present in-
 habitants are only a few poor wretches, harboring themselves in
 the vaults, and subsisting chiefly on fishing; who seem to be
 preserved in this place by divine Providence as a visible argu-
 ment how God has fulfilled His word concerning Tyre, that it
 should be the top of a rock, a place for fishers to dry their nets
 on."—Mandrell.
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

should they not preach?

afflictions of this life appear? Verses 17, 18.
                               Notes.
    1. While this scripture applies especially to ministers of the
Gospel, it does not exclude others also. The Lord has given to
all a part in the work of reconciliation.
    2. He who preaches should not only believe what he teaches,
but should conscientiously practice the same.' The most effectual
way of preaching is by practicing. Rom. 2:21-23.
  " The teaching of Christ was the expression of an inwrought
conviction and experience, and those who learn of Him become
teachers after the same divine order. The Word of God, spoken
by one who is himself sanctified through it, has a life-giving
power that makes it attractive to the hearers, and convicts them
that it is a living reality."—Desire of Ages, page 142.

promise goes with it? Matt. 28: 19, 20.
  17. What promise is for soul-winners? Dan. 12 : 3.
Note.
                               Note. •
    It is said of Jesus, that "for the joy that was set before
Him," He "endured the cross, despising the shame." That joy
is in seeing the blood-bought throng before the throne, "filled
with joy unspeakable and full of glory," and of knowing that all
this bliss could not have been experienced had it not been for
His sacrifice. Isa. 53:11. The faithful minister will share in
the joy of his Lord, when he himself stands before the throne
and sees around him the vouchers of his ministry, the flock his
care has nourished, fed, and saved.

Col. 1 : 10.
                               Notes.
  1. If it is our duty and privilege "in whatsoever we do in
word or deed to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus," then we
should be careful to see that our every word and action adorn that
worthy name whereby we are called.
    2. The greatest "stumbling-block" in the way of unbelievers
is the inconsistent course of professed believers. By ungodly lives,
they often give occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,
and to scoff at the reality of the religion of Jesus Christ. By
such that blesesd name is trampled in the mire.
    3. The world at large will not come to the Word of God to
receive light, and to learn the way of salvation. While it is true
"The Advent message to the world in this generation"-our
                      watchword.
26          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
that the works of God in nature are a constant witness to all, yet
the Lord's true disciples will give infallible proof in their lives
of the reality of the religion of Jesus Christ. "Now that Jesus
has ascended to heaven, His disciples are His representatives
among men, and one of the most effective ways of winning souls
to Him is in exemplifying His character in our daily lives. Our
influence upon others depends not so much upon what we say as
upon what we are. Men may combat and defy our logic; they
may resist our appeals; but a life of disinterested love is an argu-

"I want a light, thin Bible with the largest type made."
    How often has every Bible salesman heard this re-
quest. The day of the Bible with voluminous Helps
is past, and the day of the very thin Bible is here.
    And this is only one of the numerous points we have
learned about the kinds of Bibles our customers want.
They also want the most durable leathers, the most sat-
isfactory papers, the handiest Bibles for the pocket, the
most helpful styles for the student, the most attractive
and serviceable for the children.
    In laying in our new stock—all our old books were
burned—these points have all been carefully consid-
ered as a glance over the following list will prove.
    If the information is not sufficient, please write -for
a more complete description and it will be gladly given.

   Says the Sunday School Times concerning it: " The Standard
translation of the Bible for the English-speaking world."
   The Pilgrim Teacher says: " This version is the best that has
ever been published in the English language."
  Elder M. C. Wilcox, editor of The Signs of the Times, says:
"The most perfect translation of the Bible into English there is
in the world."
  Northwestern Christian Advocate says: " There can be no
doubt that in this version we are nearer the thought, and there-
fore the spirit of the Master than in any other version now exist-
ing in English."
