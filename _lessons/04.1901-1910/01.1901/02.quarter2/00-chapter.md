   It has been some time since our schools studied the sub-
ject of the sanctuary, and we are sure that many will es-
teem it a great privilege to have our Sabbath-school lessons
on this important theme once more.
   In the last lesson of the last quarter we were exhorted -
to remember the law of Moses which the Lord commanded
"for all Israel." Mal. 4:4. If we form a part of the "Israel
Of God" (Gal. 6:16), we will study and remember that law
which was a "shadow of good things to come" (Heb. 0:1),
that we may understand the position and work of our High
Priest in "the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and
not man" (Heb. 8:1, 2). The things which "were written
aforetime were written for our learning, that we through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope"
(Rom. 15:4).
   No one should get the idea that the subject of the sanc-
tuary has been treated exhaustively in these lessons, for
such is not the case. The different phases of the subject

in the most needy foreign fields.
4               LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.


are just touched upon, therefore we urge upon all, the
earnest, prayerful study of this great question, simply re-
garding the lessons as a guide in suggesting an orderly
arrangement of its different phases. This study should
prove a great blessing to all our people.
  The subscription edition of "Desire' of Ages" is used for
reference. Those who have ,z.ly-the trade edition of this
work will find the quotations in the following chapters:
Chapter 1, "God with. Us;" chapter 4, "Unto You a Saviour;"
chapter 11, "The Baptism;" chapter 27, "Thou Canst Make
Me Clean;" chapter 71, "A Servant of Servants;" chap-
ter 77, "In Pilate's Judgment•, Hall;" chapter 78, "Calvary."
These chapters may all be read with profit while studying
the lessons, also the following chapters in "Patriarchs and
Prophets:" Chapter 5, "Cain and Abel Tested;" chapter 30,
"The Tabernacle and Its Services."
  The following helps are recommended to our schools while
studying this series of lessons: "Christ Our Advocate," No.
128 of the "Bible Students' Library," price 10 cents; "Look-
ing unto Jesus," in cloth, price $1.00, and the same in paper,
as No. 5 of the "Berean Library," price 25 cents.
  We are glad that our schools will have these excellent
helps in the study of the lessons, in addition to some very
instructive articles on this important subject that have ap-
peared in our periodicals in recent years, and to others that
will be published in the "Signs of the Times," beginning about
April 1. Above all, and more important than all, we urge
upon every student the necessity of carefully studying the
Scriptures, that he may be taught by the great Teacher, and
know for himself the truth as it is in Jesus. The texts in-
closed in parenthesis are suggested as side lights to be
studied with the lessons.

                             NOTES.
   1. "He, the Sin-bearer, endures the wrath of divine jus-
tice, and for thy sake becomes sin itself."-Desire of Ages,
p. 755. "Into the world where Satan claimed dominion, God
permitted His Son to come, a helpless babe, subject to the
weakness of humanity. He permitted Him to meet life's
peril in common with every human soul, to fight the battle
as every child of humanity must fight it, at the risk of fail-
ure and eternal loss."-P. 49.
   2. "The heart of the human father yearns over his son.
6               LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

He looks into the face of his little child, and trembles at the
thought of life's peril. He longs to shield his dear one from
Satan's power, to hold hini back from temptation and con-
flict. To meet a bitterer conflict and a more fearful risk,
God gave His only-begotten Son, that the path of life might
be made sure for our little ones."—Id., p. 49.
    3. "This was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have
remained at the Father's side. . . . But He chose to give
back the scepter into Ihs Fa•ther's hands, and to step down
from the throne of the universe, that He might bring light
to the benighted and life to the perishing."—Id., p. 21.
   4. "If we had to bear anything which Jesus did not en-
dure, then upon this point Satan would represent the power
of God as insufficient for us. Therefore Jesus was in all
points tempted like as we are. He endured every trial to
which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf
no power that is not freely offered to         p. 22.
   5. "The blood-drops of agony that from His wounded
temples flowed down His face and beard, were the pledge
of His anointing with the oil of gladness as our great high
priest."—Id., p. 734.
   i. Having taken man's place, Jesus was treated as sinful
man deserved. Spurrell's Translation of 2 Sam. 7:14 reads:
"Even in His suffering for iniquity, I will chasten Him with
the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men."
By this treatment He was earning the right to become man's
advocate. See "Desire of Ages," pp. 25, 744. These experi-
ences of suffering were to fit Him to be a merciful High
Priest. Heb. 5:1, 2; 2:17; "Desire of Ages," p. 742; Heb.
7:28, margin.

    LESSON I11.—POSITION OF OUR HIGH PRIEST.

i John 5:4; Isa. 30:15.
    9. Through whom is the victory gained? Rom. 8:35-37;
1 Cor. 15:57.
                            NOTES.

   1. Just at the time when men could endure Christ no
longer, and took counsel together and put Him to death, de-
claring they had no king but Caesar, God, by the power of .
the resurrection, declares Him to be His Son and His King,
and places Him at His own right hand, giving Him all power
and dominion. And for what purpose? "Having collected
the riches of the universe, and laid open the resources of
infinite power, He gives them all into the hands of Christ,
and says, All these are for man. Use these gifts to convince
him that there is no greater love than Mine in earth or
heaven. His greatest happiness will be found in loving
Me."—Desire of Ages, p. 57.
    2. "God has adopted human nature in the person of His
Son, and has carried this same into the highest heaven. It
is the Son of man who shares the throne of the universe.
. . . Heaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is
enfolded in the bosom of infinite love."—Desire of Ages, p. 25.
   3. If we belong to Christ, our foes and Christ's foes are
the same. They . are the sins of our own heart.
  4. While we cling to our sins, He can not put them under
His feet without putting us there with them, and so He
                LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.                       9


waits for us to give them over into His hands. We are to sit
where He sits, and in quietness and confidence give over all
our enemies into His hands, and we have the promise that
the . God of peace shall "bruise Satan under your feet
shortly."



LESSON IV.—DWELLING-PLACE FOR THE LORD.

                         April 17, 1901.


   1. Where does our High Priest minister? Heb. 8:1, 2.
    2. What other sanctuary is mentioned in the Scriptures?

Verse 8. Note 1.
    5. Of what was the sanctuary an object lesson? 2 Cor.
6:16. (Isa. 57:15; Ps. 1.32:13, 14; Heb. 9:8, 9, 11, 23.) Note 2.
    6. How was Moses directed to build it? Ex. 25:9, 40;
Heb. 8:5.
    7. Who is our example, or pattern? 1 Peter 2:21, 22.
(Rom. 8:9; Phil. 2:5.)       •
    8. Then what is our duty? Heb. 3:1; 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.
Note 3.
    9. What will compose the spiritual temple of which the
earthly was an object lesson? 1 Peter 2:5.
                        •
                             NOTES.
                                                            •
   1. The Lord invited His people to build Him a sanctuary.
In so doing He expressed a desire to dwell among them.. lie
has cherished this desire and expressed it in different ways
from the beginning. By creating man and visiting him, He
showed a desire for his companionship. When man departed
so •far from Him that his thoughts were only evil, God was
grieved, but still showed His desire to dwell with him by
preparing an ark for saving all who would enter it. Ex.
25:8 again reveals the same desire, also Matt. 1:23; John 1:14.
It is again expressed in strong language in the Saviour's‘
prayer to His Father. John 17:24. It is also expressed by
promise in John 14:3 and in 1 Thess. 4:16, 17. He will he
satisfied when the New Jerusalem comes down from heaven,
and the Father and Son come to dwell with us eternally.
Rev. 21:2, 3. "I will dwell in them and walk in them" had
10               T.ESSONS ON TIM SANCTUARY.

also reference to God's dwelling in the sanctuary. See Ex.
.29:43, 45; Lev. 26:11, 12. The Spirit of God quotes it as re-
fferring to the temple of our body, thus showing that the
sanctuary was but an object lesson of the real dwelling-place
of God.
   2. God is not satisfied with heaven and earth as His
dwelling-place, for His own hands made these; but He
asks us to build Him an house and place of rest, and says
He will look for it in the contrite heart. - Isa. 57:15.
   3. Moses was exhorted to "look" that he make all things
after the pattern (Ex. 25:40), and he was careful to do so
 (Ex. 39:43). So in order for us to build after the Pattern,
we must study the Pattern, look "unto Jesus." "By behold-
ing, we become changed."



     LESSON V.—THE SANCTUARY AND ITS
                COVERINGS.

                         May 4, 1901.

   1. Where do we find God's way revealed? Ps. 77:13.
   2. Of what were the sides of the tabernacle made? Ex.
26:15, 29.
   3. How many boards were used? What were their di-
mensions? Verses 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25.
   4. Of what was the ceiling or roof of the tabernacle
made? Ex. 26:1-6. Note 1.
   5. What was used to cover the tabernacle? Verses 7-13.
Note 2.
   6. What other coverings were made for the tabernacle?
Verse 14. Note 3.
                          NOTES.
   1. The linen curtain which formed the ceiling of the
sanctuary was a beautiful symbol of the fine linen which is
said to be the righteousness of saints. Rev. 19:8. This is
obtained by faith in Christ, the antitype of the goat that
  as slain for a sin-offering, of which the goats'-hair curtain
would be a constant reminder.
   2. The first covering was of goats' hair. The goat in
the type was the sin-offering whose blood cleansed the peo-
ple and the sanctuary. It was a type of Christ, the true sin-
offering, whose blood actually takes away sin.
               LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.                  11

   3. The second covering was made of rams' skins dyed red.
Our sins are said to be "red like crimson." Isa. 1:18.
The wages of sin is death. Sin forfeits the life, it demands
the shedding of blood, for "without shedding of blood is
no remission" (Heb. 9:22), that is,' no remission of sin. The
blood is the life. The rams' skins "dyed red" would be
emblematic of the sinner, whose sins require the shedding
of blood. The outer covering was made of badger skins or
sealskins, as most Bible expositors teach. The words in the
original seem to indicate that they were sealskins or some-
thing similar. From this we conclude that this outer cur-
tain was for the curpose of protection from the elements.



LESSON VI.—THE COURT, ALTAR . OF BURNT-
       • OFFERING, AND LAVER.

                        May 11, 1901.

   1. In what was the sanctuary .inclosed? By what was it
surrounded? What was its size? Ex. 27:9-18.
    2. Of what was the gate or door composed? Where was
it placed? Ex. 27:14-16. Note 1.
    3. On entering through the door into the court what
would be reached first? Ex. 40:6.      -
    4. What offerings were slain there? Lev. 1:10, 11;
6:25; 4 7:2.
    5. What was done with the blood? Lev. 4:7, 18, 30.
    6. What is the blood declared to be? Lev. 17:11, 12, 14.
(Gen. 9:4.)
    7. For what purpose did Christ shed His blood or give
His life? 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 John 1:7. (1 Peter 1:18, 19; 2:24;
3:18.)
    8. Where was the laver placed? What was its use?
Ex. 30:18-21.
    9. How are we washed and cleansed? John 13:8-11; 15:3.
Note 2. "Desire of Ages," p. 646.
                           NOTES.

   1. By carefully comparing the statements in verses 9-18,
it will be seen that the gate of the court.was on- the east
end. This corresponded, of course, to the door of the taber-
nacle, which was at the east end in both the sanctuary which
Moses built and the temple which Solomon built. See
Eze. 8:16, and "Christ Our Advocate," pp. 20, 21.
12              LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY:0

   2. The people came to the sanctuary, where God dwelt
between the cherubim, through the gate or door of the
court, by the altar of burnt-offering and the laver. So we
come to the heavenly sanctuary, where God dwells, through
Christ, who is the door (John 10:7, 9), the sin-offering (Heb.
9:13, 14; 10:10-14), that was slain at the altar of burnt-
offering, and the living Word by which we are cleansed from
sin (John' 1:1; 15:3; 1 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 5:25, 26). Christ was
symbolized by the smitten rock which gave water to the peo-
ple in the wilderness. When Aaron and his sons were chosen,
for the priesthood, they were washed all over by Moses, who
was a representative of Christ. The new birth is spoken of as
the washing of regeneration. Titus 3:5. Ps. 119:9, 11 shows
how we are cleansed by the Word.




     LESSON V11.-TABLE OF SHOWBREAD AND
             GOLDEN CANDLESTICK.

     1. By comparing Ex. 25:15-25 with 1 Kings 6:2, 16-20, we
 learn that the tabernacle was ten cubits wide and thirty
 cubits long, that the temple proper was twice as large, viz.,
 twenty cubits wide and sixty cubits long, and that the lat-
 ter was composed of two apartments, one twice as large
 as the other. The oracle, or most holy place, was a perfect
 cube, twenty cubits on a side. Verses 16, 20. As both these •
 structures were built after a pattern, we conclude that the
 most holy place of the tabernacle was also only half as large
 as the holy place, or first apartment. See "Looking unto
 Jesus," pp. 61, 62.
     2. "It was called showbread, or bread of the presence,
 because it was ever before the face of the Lord. Ex. 25:30.
 It was an acknowledgment of man's dependence upon God
 for both temporal and spiritual food, and that it is received
 only through the mediation of Christ. God had fed Israel
 in the wilderness with bread from heaven, and they were
 still dependent upon His bounty, both for temporal food a•nd
 spiritual blessings. Both the manna and the showbread
 pointed to Christ, the living bread, who is ever in the
 presence of God for us."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 354.
 Fine flour is bread-corn, bruised until it is smooth and even.
.Christ is the bread-corn bruised. Isa. 53:5; John 6:48, 51.
     3. As the candlestick gave light in the sanctuary and
 temple of ancient times, so Jesus by His Spirit and Word
 sheds light into our hearts. John 8:12; 1:1, 4, 9; Eph. 3:17;
 Ps. 119:105. Thus we as temples of God are lighted, and
 God's people are the light of the world. 1 Cor. 3:16, 17;
6:19; Matt. 5:14. So in Rev. 1:12, 13, 10, 20; 2:1, the seven
 golden candlesticks represented the seven churches, God's
 people, and Christ walked among them. In the heavenly
 sanctuary we have the seven lamps of fire burning before
 the throne (Rev. 4:5), the antitype of the candlestick with
 seven lamps in the worldly sanctuary.
     4. "There being no windows in the tabernacle, the lamps
 Were never all extinguished at one time, but shed their
 light by day and by night."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 348.
 We read about snuffers and snuff-dishes, but not a word is
 said about an extinguisher. When our High Priest walks
 among the golden candlesticks He has often to apply the
 snuffers, and cut off something which would hinder the lamp
 from sending forth its light. But. when the high priest
  came with the snuffers, he brought the oil vessel at the
 same time. So when Christ removes something that we love,
 He gives us more of the oil of the Holy Spirit, that we may
  be brighter and better Christians.

LESSON VIII,-ALTAR OF INCENSE, THE VAIL,
                       AND ARK.


                        May 25, 1901.



    1. Where was the altar of incense placed? lIx. 30:1, 6;
40:26.
    2. For what purpose was it used? When was it of-
fered? Ex. 30:7, 8.
    3. With what was the offering of incense connected?
Of what was it a symbol? Ps. 141:2; Rev. 8:3, 4. Note.
    4. For what purpose was the second vail? Ex. 36:35, 36;
40:3, 21. (Deb. 9:4.)
    5. What was connected with the ark that needed to be
wailed? Lev. 16:2.
    6. What was represented by the vail? Into what place
may we now come? Heb. 10:19, 20.
    7. What was placed within the ark? Ex. 25:16; Dent.
10:4, 5.
    S. With what was the law covered? Ex. 25:21.            •
    9. Where was the blood of the atonement sprinkled?
Lev. 16:15.
   10. Where does our hope center? -Pleb. 6:19, 20.
   11. What confidence should this give us? Deb. 4:16.

                            NOTE.

   "Day and night the holy incense diffused its fragrance
throughout the sacred apartments, and without far around
the tabernacle." "The incense, ascending with the prayers
of Israel, represents the merits and intercession of Christ."
"In the offering of incense the priest was brought more di-
rectly into the presence of God than in any other act of daily
ministration."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 348, 353. So in
prayer we are brought nearer to God than in any other act
of worship.

ings were made. Lev. 4:2-21.
    2. What offering was - made by a ruler, or by any one of
the common people, for the same sin? In what way was it

and the whole congregation? Lev. 4:22-35; 6:25-30.
    3. For what purpose were some of the sin-offerings
eaten? Lev. 10:16, 17. Notice that where the priest was
concerned in the sin, he was not permitted to eat of the
offering. _

Heb. 13:10-13. Note 1.
    5. What offering has been provided for us? Eph. 5:2.
    6. What must we do with the offering? What will be

    7. How many kinds of sins are mentioned -in Lev. 5;
6:1-7; 7:1-7? How were the offerings made? Note 2.
    8. What offering has been provided for us? Eph. 5:2.
    9. What must we do with the offering? What will be
the result? Isa. 53:10, 11. Note 3.
   10. To whom did the fat of all these - offerings belong?
Lev. 3:14-17.
   11. What were the fat and the parts burned with it
called? Lev. 3:11; Eze. 44:7; Lev. 21:6, 8, 17; Nuni. 28:2,
margin. Note 3.
   12. For whom was the altar made? What was it called?
Ex. 20:24, 25; Mal. 1:7, 12.
   13. What did the fat represent? Isa. 43:24; Ps. 37:20.
   14. To whom do our sins belong? Gal. 1:4. Why, then,
is the fat the Lord's?

                            NOTES.

   1. There were two ways in which the priest bore the sins
into the sanctuary, by the blood and by eating the flesh.
16               LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

See "Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 354. Those priests were
not permitted to eat their own sin-offering, as the eating of
the offering was for the purpose of conveying the sins to the
priest, to teach us that Christ actually bore "our sins in His
own body"—became "sinful flesh." We, however, can eat our
sin-offering, and by so doing become righteous.
   2. The distinction between sin and trespass does not seem
very clear, hence will bear much study. One writer has
said: "In the sin-offering we see Christ offering Himself for
us, for what we are in ourselves,—sinful creatures. In the
trespass-offering we see Jesus offering Himself for our sins,
our trespasses, the fruits and effects of our sinful. natures,—
what we do."
    3. There are two classes of offerings, the sweet savor and
the non-sweet savor. The sin and trespass offerings belong
to the non-sweet savor, as sin was upon them by imputation.
Therefore they could not be burnt upon the brazen altar,
which was God's table. Mal. 1:12. However, in order to
teach us the preciousness of our giving up our sins, the fat,
representing them, is consumed on God's altar, and is called
the bread of the Lord, a savor of His rest, as we can not enter
into His rest except by ceasing from our own works of sin.
Heb. 4:10. All the fat is the Lord's, so all our sins belong
to Him, and we should fill Him with the fat of our sacri-
fices, and not cause Him to serve with our sins. Otherwise
our bodies must be burned without the camp in the great
burning day. See Ps. 37:20.

   LESSON X.-THE OFFERINGS (Continued).
                  'The Burnt-Offering.

                        June 8, 1901.


     1. What must the burnt-offering be? How must it be
offered? Lev. 1:3.
     2. How does the worshiper identify himself with this
offering? What promise is connected with it? Verse 4.
     3. What is then done with the offering? How much of
it is accepted? Verses 5-9.
     4. Were the daily offerings burnt-offerings or sin-'
offerings? Ex. 29:38-42. What did they symbolize? Ans.-
        b
"The daily   consecration of the nation to Jehovah, and their
constant dependence upon the atoning blood of Christ."-
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 352.
     5. How was the acceptance of this offering shown? Gen.
4:4; Heb. 11:4; Ps. 20:3, margin. Ans.-"Fire flashed from
heaven and consumed the sacrifice."-Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 71. Note 1.
     6. The fire having once been kindled by the Lord, what
command was given concerning it? Lev. 6:12, 13. Note 2.
     7. How are we to present ourselves to the Lord? Rom.
12:1.
     8. How do we find acceptance? Eph. 1:6. Note 3.

                   The Meat-Offering.
    9. Of what materials was the meat-offering composed?
Lev. 2:1, 13.. Note 4.
   10. What was represented by the flour? John 6:48.
   11. What was poured upon the flour? Lev. 2:1. What
was poured upon Christ? John 3:34. What, then, is repre-
sented by the oil? Acts 10:38, 39; Rom. 8:9. Note 5.
   12. With what was the offering seasoned? Lev. 2:13.
What are we exhorted to have? Mark 9:50; Col. 4:6. By
thus using salt in their sacrifices the, people were bound to
Jehovah in most solemn covenant. Read Num. 18:19;
2 Chron. 13:5. Note 6.
   13. Everything in Christ's outer and inner life was a
 sweet odor to God; hence how much of the frankincense
was to be burnt on God's altar? Lev. 2:16. Repeat
2 Cor. 2:14-16. How much of the oil and flour was burnt?
Lev. 2:2. What was done with the rest of the offering?
What kind of offering wa.s it? Lev. 2:2, 3.
18               LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

   14. In what different ways could it be prepared? Lev.
2:4, 5, 7, 11. What must be excluded from it? Ex. 12:18-20;
Luke 12:1; 1 Cor. 5:6-8; Gal. 5:9. What is represented by
leaven? Honey would not stand the fire, hence was excluded.

                            NOTES.

   1. When we see sin losing its hold upon us, being reduced
as it were to ashes, by the fire of the Holy Spirit, we may
know that God is accepting our consecration, and that we are
serving the true God. 1 Kings 18:24, 36-39.
   2. This fire kindled by God, represented one phase of the
work of the Holy Spirit. Matt. 3:11; Isa. 4:4; Mal. 3:23.
This fire must never be allowed to go out. John 14:16. So
we are commanded not to quench the Holy Spirit, but
should keep it burning, with the fat of our sin-offerings and
our whole burnt-offerings.
   3. In these different sacrifices we get so many different
aspects of Christ's one sacrifice. All the sacrifices stood for
the one who offered them. Christ gave Himself for us.
Christ is our burnt-offering: we bring Him to God, and He
accepts Him as a whole burnt-offering for us, and counts us
just a•s worthy as the offering we bring. John 17:23.
   4. There was no life taken nor any blood shed in this
offering, hence it did not represent Christ in His death, but
Christ in His life. Rom. 5:10. In the meat or food-offering
we have a shadow of the perfect Man.
   5. This offering was either baked, boiled, or fried in oil,
showing how fully the Holy Spirit entered into the life-and
work of Christ (Heb. 9:14), and must not be separated from
ours.
   6. The salt represented the saving qualities of the right-
eousness of Christ. By using salt in their sacrifices the peo-
ple were bound to Jehovah in a most solemn covenant.
When the Arabs make a covenant together they put salt on
the blade of a sword,' and every one puts a little in his
mouth. This constitutes them bloOd relations, and they re-
main faithful to each other, even when life is in danger.

   LESSON XI.-THE OFFERINGS (Continued).
             The Peace=Offering.

                       June 15, 1901.

    1. Of what might •the peace-offering consist? Lev. 3:1,
7, 12. Note 1.
     2. What must be its condition? Lev. 22:21-25; Mal.
1:13, 14.
     3. How was it offered? Lev. 3:2-5.
     4. What part was given to the priests? Lev. 7:29-34.
Who could eat it with them? Num. 18:11. What was done
with the remainder of the flesh? Lev. 7:15; Dent. 12:5-7, 12.
Note 2.
     5. What three classes of peace-offerings are specified?
Lev. 7:15, 16.
     6. If it was a thanksgiving-offering, what should be
offered with it? When must it be eaten? Verses 11-13.
     7. If the offering was a vow or a voluntary one, when
could the flesh be eaten? Verses 16, 17. Note 3.
    '8. What should we .do about our vows? Ps. 65:1; Eccl.
5:4-6; Ps. 61:8; 76:11. Note 3.
     9. When can we bring our peace-offering? Rom. 5:1, 2.
How long should we continue to offer it? Heb. 13:15. Read
the 107th psalm, and note the different reasons given for
 praising the Lord.
    10. How much peace may we expect? . Rom. 15:13.
    11. Where do we find it? John 16:33.
    12. How do we get it? John 1.4:27; Isa. 32:17-19; Ps.
119:165; Isa. 26:3. Repeat Isa. 27:5: 2 Thess. 3:16.
    13. What will it do for us?, Phil. 4:7.
                            NOTES.
   1. There must be a sin-offering and a burnt-offering before
there could be a peace-offering. So now a man must first
come to God as a sinner, to have his sin put away. He must
come to God as a worshiper, laying all upon the altar, to be
accepted in Christ, and must feed upon Christ as the food-
offering. The result of this will be peace.
   2. Notice that the sin-offering was given to the officiat-
ing priests alone. Lev. 6:26; 7:7. No one is to share our
sin but Christ. The burnt-offering was wholly the Lord's.
Lev. 1:9. Our consecration must be to God alone.' The
meat-offering was given to God-to Aaron and his sons (Lev.
2:9, 10)-which was, to represent God and the church feed-

    TO EVERY NEW SUBSCRIBI
          URING the year to come the Signs will have more than
           the usual number of valuable articles from its able
           contributors. Some of the following series already
           appearing are being highly appreciated: "Religious
           Liberty from a Biblical Standpoint," i. e., "The
Origin of Government," "The Theocracy of Israel," "The
Kingdom of Heaven," "Constitution and Laws of the Kingdom
of Heaven," "The Apostles and the Powers That Be," etc.
     The prophecies of Daniel and Revelation will receive
special attention in a series of articles by M. C. Wilcox, the
editor. No one can afford to miss these. Pastor R. S. Owen
will contribute a rare treat to all lovers of the Bible in an ex-
position of the generally meagerly understood book of Zechariah.
"The Sabbath Question" will receive the attention of A. 0. Tait,
the assistant editor, and J. A. L. Derby will consider '•'The
Nature of Man, His Origin and Destiny," while from the pen
of L. A. Phippeny will come interesting, instructive, and com-
forting words about the "Second Advent of our Lord."
     The Sanctuary will receive special attention during the time
when that subject is studied by our Sabbath-schools. Thus will
the readers of the Signs receive each week, fresh and crisp, choice
bits of instruction directly along the line of the Sabbath-school
lessons. The paper will also continue to publish the Sabbath-
school lessons and notes. Subscribe now and get them all.
     Many are the good words we hear for the Signs. Space
forbids our giving any of them here. The paper should certainly
be in every home. Surely no one can afford to be without it if
he has any desire to keep pace with this rapidly advancing mes-
sage. Every one should read it for his own benefit and then
hand it to his neighbor for his benefit.

ing on Christ. The peace-offering was extended to all, the
Lord, the priests and their families, the offerer and his whole
household, with his friends and the Levite, thus showing
that the Lord desires us to offer His peace to all, as an-
nounced by the angels at the birth of Christ. "Peace on
earth, good will toward men." "And preached peace to you
which were afar off and to them that were nigh." Eph.
2:16, 17.
   3. The Lord does not ask any of us to live on past
mercies and blessings. He "daily loadeth us with benefits."
His mercies "are new every morning." Hence we should
make fresh thanksgiving-offerings every day.



     LESSON X11.—THE OFFERINGS (Concluded).
               The Purification-Offering.


                        June 22, 1901.


    1. What command did the Lord give to Moses and
Aaron? Num. 19:1, 2.
    2. Who is represented by this•red heifer? Ans.—Christ.
Why must the heifer be red? Isa. 63:1-3; Rev. 19:13.
    3. What is represented by a yoke? Lam. 1:14; Nahum
1:11, 13; Gal. 5:1. Note 1.
    4. Did Christ ever come under this yoke? 2 Cor. 5:21;
1 Peter 2:21, 22.
    5. Who were to bring the red heifer to the priest? Who
was to slay it? Where was it to suffer? Num. 19:2, 3.
    6. Who brought Christ to the priest? Who slew Him?
Matt. 26:47, 57; 27:2, 26. Where did He suffer? Heb. 13:12.
    7. What was then done with the offering? What was
burnt with it? Num. 19:4-6.
    8. What was done with the ashes? For what purpose

    9. For whose benefit were they used? Verse 10.
   10. Who were to be benefited by the death of Christ?
Heb. 2:9; Acts 2:39.
   11. For what was this offeriim. made? What was the
effect upon the tabernacle if the person was not cleansed?
Niim. 19:11. 13, 16.
   12. What was the effect upon everything the unclean per-
son touched? Verse 22; Hag. 2:13, 14.

   13. What would befall the one who refused to purify
himself? Num: 19:20.
   14. Who only will be cut off? Ps. 37:9.
   15. What, then, is represented by touching a dead body?
   16. How did Paul feel when he came in contact with it?
Horn. 7:23, 24, margin.
   17. Describe the manner of purification. Num. 19:17-19.
   18. What does the water represent? Eph. 5:26. Note 2.
   19. How did David refer to this mode of cleansing?
Ps. 51:7.
   20. If the touching of the dead body represented sin and
death, what did the cleansing represent? Eph. 2:1, 4, 5.
Repeat Heb. 9:13, 14.
                          NOTES.

   1. The yoke represents the yoke of bondage and sin.
Christ never came under this yoke. 2 Peter 2:22. He who
was above the law, being the Author of the law, voluntarily
became sin for us, suffering the penalty of the broken law
in our stead. Yet, never having committed sin, He never
came under the yoke of bondage. His submission was
wholly voluntary.
   2. This was called the water of separation, because when
sprinkled upon a defiled person it separated him from his
uncleanness, and admitted him to all the privileges which he
for a time had lost. Num. 5:2. The ashes point to the suf-
fering and death of Christ; the Holy Spirit uses the word
(symbolized by the running water) to remind us of that
suffering. Ps. 19:7, margin.

Heb. 13:12, 13. Note 1.
   11. What did the leper bring for offerings? Lev. 14:10, 11.
   12. State the order in which they were offered. Verses
12-20, 53. Note 2.
   13. How many offerings do we have to bring to accom-
plish far more than was done for the leper? Heb. 10:10-14.
                           NOTES.
   1. The leper was brought by some one to the priest, so
we are to bring sinners to Christ. Christ suffered outside
of Jerusalem, that He might save the world, so we are to
go outside the church to bring sinners to Him, who sees
them when they are "yet a great way off" and runs to meet
them.
   2. The blood being touched upon the right ear would indi-
cate that our hearing should be consecrated to God. We
must know no voice but His. John 10:4, 5. It being put
upon the thumb and toe would indicate that the service of
our hands and feet must be only for Him. Ps. 119:101. The
oil was placed upon the blood. Wherever there is cleansing
and consecration there is also the presence of the Holy
Spirit. Notice that the same offerings and consecration
were required of the leper that God required of the high
priest. Exodus 29. So the humblest child of God must be
as devoted and consecrated as was Christ. John 17:19.

        HOW TO USE TRACTS



               GREAT responsibility rests upon us as a
              people because of the wealth of our litera-
              ture.
                 Of English tracts alone we have almost
              two hundred and fifty different titles, cov-
               ering a wide range of important subjects.
                 Our trade books now number over one
              hundred, exclusive of foreign editions,
              while our subscription volumes have almost
              reached the fifty mark.
                 This literature provides work for all; and
              especially is this true of the tracts which
              are now so low in price that no one can
              excuse himself from using them liberally.
              We should realize that these "silent mes-
              sengers" are, in the hands of God, power-
              ful agents for the conversion of souls and
       \„, teaching the truth.        •
                 Far better will they do an effective work
than can be done by argument; and, generally speaking,
they will accomplish what one can seldom hope to accom-
plish in a conversation that must often be hurried or
interrupted.
     We trust that the suggestions contained in this leaf-
let may be of assistance to those who have wished to
begin this line, but have perhaps hardly known how to
begin; a helper even to the more experienced ones, and,
if possible, a means of inducing others who have not
labored for Him to heed the Master's command, "Go,
work in My vineyard." The Saviour's rich blessing and
commendation await all such.
     The first plan that we will suggest is the most sys-
tematic, and has opened the way for the Bible worker
and the minister in.a remarkable manner. It is called
      The-Package System.—Briefly this is as follows: A
graduated list of tracts suitable for distribution is selected
and arranged in packages enclosed in envel-
opes. On the envelope there is generally
printed a statement that the tracts are
loaned for a certain length of time, and
that they will be called for. How-
ever, it is not necessary for these
envelopes to be printed, nor is it
really necessary that envelopes be
used at all. The tracts may 'be
handed out loose with a few pleas-
ant words of greeting and a state-
ment concerning the time at which
they will be called for. But the envel-
ope keeps them from becoming soiled, " With a few pleasant words of
                                             greeting."
 and the printed statement upon it
 assists those who have difficulty in talking to the people.
 In this connection, the following suggestions for pack-
 ages up to No. 4 will not be amiss:—

      After four packages are used the interested ones will
probably call for light on special subjects. Those who
have not become interested will not desire tracts longer;
or, if they do, you can give them
such as seem best to you.
      As to the best way— of fol-
lowing up this work, we would
advise you as far as possible to
follow up the interest yourself.
It will, of course, be too much to
expect that the reading matter
of itself will always bring people
into the truth. There are other
essentials, and one of these is the
witness of the Holy Spirit's
power in your own life to em-
phasize the value of the publica-
tions, and to convince the parties
to whom they are given that you
                                     "And then they may be enclosed in
believe fully the truths they con-   ordinary letters."
•tain, because you yourself have been benefited by
 them. This means on your part consecration and
 earnest study of the Word, with much prayer.
    The Correspondence Plan.—This is a method
 that can not be recommended too highly. The
 various publications in the Apples of Gold Library
 have been issued for this special purpose, and are
 particularly appropriate. Those who are mailing
                                                             Maih zg the
 the Signs or other periodicals, and are correspond- periodicals."
 ing with those to whom the papers are sent, will
 find these little Apples of Gold leaflets especially valuable.
 And then they may be enclosed in ordinary letters, inas-
 much as they are all rich in spiritual thought and expe-
 rience. A portion of the Words of Truth Series will
 also go into an ordinary envelope.
       Besides this general plan of enclosing the leaflets in
 letters, use them with the plan adopted for mailing the
 Signs. Send tracts to names and addresses, accompany-
  ing the first ones with letters. Send one tract each week
                                    until five or six have been
                                    sent, then write another
                                    letter. Send to ministers,
                                    also to professional. men
                                    and others in this way.
                                               Reading Racks.—
                                             People waiting for
                                             trains at depots are
                                             generally glad to
                                             get hold of almost
                            "People          anything to read.

                                             noted that usually
where racks are kept up they are liberally patronized.
There may be other public places, as hotels and halls .or
public buildings, where racks can be placed. Any small
church or even an isolated individual may keep up a rack
of this kind; and no one can estimate the good that may
result therefrom. The writer of this series of suggestions
has watched these racks very carefully in a large number
of different places, and he has yet to see a single publi-
cation destroyed. We are personally acquainted with a
blacksmith who kept a little reading rack in the rear of
his shop; and as people waited for work to be done, he
pointed the matter out to them. He bears witness to the
fact that an immense amount of literature was taken and
read, and some were converted through this means.
God has said that His Word "shall not return unto
                                                             Ifie
Him void." Some day—it may not be until eternity
—we shall see the fulfilment of this promise if we
are faithful in scattering the Word.
     Miscellaneous Distribution.—` Blessed are
ye that sow beside all waters." Isa. 32:2o.
     Under this heading we might
speak at length concerning oppor-
tunities for the distribution of these
silent 'messengers. But the oppor-
tunities are innumerable, and the
servant of the Lord must be "in-         "Send to professional men."
stant in season and out of season." You talk with a
friend, neighbor, or chance acquaintance about the ter-
rible storms, the political upheavals, war, money matters,
etc., and he shows his interest in these things. Take
advantage of this interest, and hand him a tract like
"Heralds of His Coming," "The Eastern Question,"
"Labor and the Money Power," or the pamphlet,
       "Marshaling of the Nations." The conversation you
       have had and the interest he has shown will insure the
       reading of a short treatise of this kind, and may do much
       toward bringing the truth to the individual. You may
                            be riding on the train; leave a tract on
                            the seat. You drop into the public
                            library or reading room; leave one of the
                            silent messengers on desk or table. You
                i           call at the busy man's office on business
                            or at the store; leave a leaflet on the
                            corner of the desk or show-case or
                            counter. When you pass through the
                            parks or squares, leave a tract here and
         - \lt;

       the train or at the depot or on the boat. When you visit
       the hospitals, the asylums, or the prisons, give a few
       tracts to the inmates when you have opportunity, or
        place a few in the reading room or library. Surround-
       ings and special calling will suggest other ways and
        plans.
                   Some General Hints.—When you do not know that
        a person is interested, so far as consistent,•use the smaller
        tracts. Select tracts dealing with the second coming of
        Christ or the unsettled condition of affairs at the present
 time. These are not likely to arouse prejudice. We
would not advise introducing doctrinal subjects until
your readers are somewhat acquainted with other litera-
ture. Use a plentiful supply of good, practical tracts,
such as "He Saves to the Utmost," "Justification by
Faith," "The Way to Christ," "What to Do with
Doubt," "Jesus Died for You," "The Sure Promises of
God," "The Benefits of Bible Study." Let your readers
become impressed with the fact that Christ is all and in
all, and that you are not anxious simply to convince
people of doctrinal points. Be courteous, charitable; con-
siderate, quiet, unobtrusive, giving no occasion for preju-
dice by word or manner. Above all things else, bear a per-
sonal witness to the saving power of Christ in your daily
life. Without this everything else will be in vain.
      Supplies.—The matter of having a sup-
ply of tracts and leaflets to do this work is
very important. It would be an excellent
thing if every Seventh-day Adventist family
could have at least one copy of every
tract published, for study and reference.
Then you will be able to judge quite well
for yourself what will be best to use in a
given case. If you can have them
bound, so much the better.
      We know, however, that many of our
people do not have these tracts. Now to
such and to all others who wish to take ad-
vantage of the offer, we will send complete
sets of the Bible Students' Library (not in-
cluding pamphlets) and Apples of Gold Li-
brary, together with a year's subscription to
each library during 1901 for $1.00. This is
                                                "Send one tract
                                                each week."
 a most liberal offer, and is made because of our interest
in the good that may accrue to our own people in becom-
ing active in this work, and the influence beyond in the
great needy world, and not to any interest otherwise as
publishers.
     We will also furnish envelopes for package work
with a good form of introduction and greeting printed
thereon for fifty cents per hundred, post-paid.
     Talk this matter over in the home, with your
brethren and sisters, and in the church; and then let us
unitedly "work while it is called to-day."

Looking Unto Jesus
                    By URIAH SMITH


    It contains 288 pages of most interesting and in-
structive matter regarding the great plan of salvation
as revealed in the Sanctuary Question.
    Many complex passages are clearly solved, and
prophecy, history, and precious instruction are inter-
woven and applied in a powerful and convincing
manner.
    A valuable aid to the study of the Sabbath-
school lessons.

  Testimony for the Church
                 NUMBER THIRTY-FOUR


The manuscript for this long-expected volume is now in
the hands of the printers, and it is expected that books will be
ready for delivery early in April. The instruction which it
contains for the church is grouped into six departments, namely:

S. THE OUTLOOK               4. MEDICAL MISSIONARY WORK
    2. EVANGELISTIC WORK         5. CANVASSING
        3. EDUCATION                 6. CAUTIONS AND COUNSELS

During the ten years since "Testimony to the Church No. 33"
was published many messages of counsel, warning, admonition,
and exhortation have been given to the church. These have
been read from manuscripts and booklets published for ministers.
But the church members want them in book form for all to
study. From the great wealth of instruction given, matter has
been selected which makes a volume of over five hundred pages.
It deals largely with present issues, and will be read with
interest by every Seventh-day Adventist, and by many others.
