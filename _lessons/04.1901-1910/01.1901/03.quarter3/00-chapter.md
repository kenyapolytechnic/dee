 Volume 6....
    The writer of this notice has just had the
opportunity of reading this new volume of
Testimonies, and the thought came to him
again and again, "How can any of our people
afford to be without it in these closing days,
when Satan has so many traps laid for our
feet?"
    Many of the messages which have hereto-
fore been confined to typewritten copies in the
hands of a few, are here given for the benefit
of all who can read.
    The book is divided into sections, such as
Camp-meeting Work, Educational Work, Med-
ical Missionary Work, Canvassing Work, and
Calls to Service.
    It contains 499 pages. Price in cloth,
$1 .00; limp ledther, $1.5o; library leather,
$1.50.

"None to
 Speak of"
  "How many potatoes did you raise this
year?" asked one farmer of another. "None
to speak of," is the reply. He does not speak
of his potato crop because he has none to
speak of. And this is the reason why many
do not speak of their experience; they have
no experience to speak of.
  Reader, if you do not have an experience
to speak of, get one. If you already have
an experience worth speaking of, then speak
of it.

and practical book

    2. "As the features of the countenance are reproduced
 with unerring accuracy on the polished plate of the artist,.
 so the character is faithfully delineated in the books above."
—Great Controversy, page 487. When. these books are
 opened to the righteous, and the counsels of the heart are
made manifest, then the saints can judge the world, but not
before.
    3. The wicked dead being raised at the end of the one
thousand years, and the righteous returning to this earth,
fully looses Satan.
    4. "This [the destruction of the wicked] is not an act of
arbitrary power on the part of God. The rejectors of His
mercy reap that which they have sown. . .            By a. life of
rebellion, Satan and all who unite with him place themselves
so out of harmony with God that His very presence is to them
a consuming fire. The glory of Him who is love will destroy
them."—Desire of Ages, pp. 763, 764. "At the second advent
of Christ the wicked shall be consumed with the 'spirit of His
mouth,' and destroyed 'with the brightness of His coming.'
The light of the glory of God, which imparts life to the
righteous, will slay the wicked." "To sin, wherever found,
our God is a consuming fire. In all whip submit to His
power, the Spirit of God will consume sin. But if men cling
to sin, they become identified with it. Then the glory of
God, which destroys sin, must destroy them." Id. pp. 107,
108. And so with the Word of God. To those who obey it, ft
is food and life, but to the disobedient, a sword of destruction.
    5. Christ, in wearing the crown of thorns, bore the curse
of the earth, that He might redeem it. "The creature was
made subject to vanity, not willingly." Rom. 8:18-23. It is
only "waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God," ere
her wilderness will burst forth "like Eden," and her desert
like the "garden of the Lord."

this time? Jude 14, 15.
    7. What weapons are used in their punishment? • Ps.
149:5-9; Rev. 19:13-15.
    8. What is this sharp two-edged sword? Heb. 4:12.
     9. To what is God's Word further compared? Jer.
   10. What is God Himself said to be? Heb. 12:29; Ex. 24:17.

                             NOTES.
   Read "Great Controversy," chap. 42; "Early Writings,"
pages 151-154..
   1. Those only who have "followed" Christ, and who have
"continued with" Him in His temptations, are to sit on
thrones of judgment. Every temptation we have was Christ's
temptation before it could be ours, or He could not give a
victory already gained. But how often, instead of "continu-
ing with Him" in the temptation, we deny him, as Peter did.
"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation." Only, those
who have been "saviours" can be judges.

  13. What in the type foreshadowed this? Lev. 16:20-22;
"Great Controversy," p. 659.
  14. Where are the righteous during the thousand years?
Rev. 19:1; 20:4.
                             NOTES.

   Read "Great Controversy," chapters 40, 41.
   1. The voice of God at this time evidently causes the par-
tial resurrection spoken of in these verses. The side texts
given with the others show positively that those who took
part in His crucifixion will see Him when He comes. Rev.
14:13 would indicate that those who had fallen asleep under
the third angel's message would be raised at that time, for
all are rewarded according to their works. "All those who
have died in the faith of the third angel's message come forth
from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace with
those who have kept His law."—Great Controversy, p. 637.
See "Early Writings" ("Spiritual Gifts"), p. 145.
   2. "At the voice of God they [the living saints] were glori-
fied; now they are made immortal, and with the risen saints
are caught up to meet their Lord in the air."—Great Contro-
versy, p. 645.
   3. Notice that in Rev. 20:4, 5, it says the saints "lived and
reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the
dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished."
Then, at the beginning of the thousand years, the first resur-
rection takes place, which event we have found to occur at
the second coming of Christ. 1 Thess. 4:16. Hence the bind-
ing of Satan takes place at the same time, and is caused by
the saints being taken to heaven, and the destrtiction of the
wicked. The earth reduced to a chaotic state may fitly be
termed the bottomless pit, where Satan is cast or confined.
during the thousand years.
24               LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

was represented by two golden calves which Jeroboam set up.
2 Chron. 13:8; 1 Rings 12:28-30. In. that worship all the com-
mandments of God were forsaken. 2 Kings 17:16. So at this
time, the professed people of God have forsaken His law and
are exalting this sign of Baal, or sun-worship, and swear that
it is of the Lord, and at the same time are seeking for the
words of the Lord. But God will' now cut off the remem-
brance of Baal and those that swear by false gods.
Zeph. 1:2-6.



      LESSON X11.-THE COMING OF CHRIST,
     Its Results to the Righteous and the Wicked.

                       September 21, 1901.

4:16, 17. (1 Cor. 15:51, 52.)
      2. What is caused by the voice of God? Joel 3:16; Heb.
12:25-27. (Matt. 24:29; Isa. 2:19, 21.) "Early Writings,"
 page 33.
      3. In what words do God's people then express their
 faith? Ps. 46:1-3, 7-11.
      4. What other event takes place at the same time? Dan.
12:1, 2; Rev. 1:7. (Lithe 21:27-30; Matt. 26:64.) Note 1.
       5. What follows the.. shaking of the powers of heaven?
 Matt. 24:30, 31.
      6. How do the saints welcome their Saviour? Isa. 25:9.
       7. What will be the result of His coming to them?
1 Thess. 4:16-18. (Phil. 3:20, 21; 1 John 3:2: 1 Cor. 15:51, 52;
 Matt. 13:43.) Note 2.

probation by persistently refusing to listen to the voice of -
the Spirit. When the Spirit is finally rejected, there is no
more that God can do for that soul. "I have not forsaken
you, saith the Lord, but ye have forsaken Me." When the
last soul has done this, God announces the fact to the
heavenly host by saying, "It is done." "He that is unjust, let
him be unjust still." See "Great Controversy," p. 613.
    2. The day Noah entered into the ark the door was shut.
Noah was safe. The wicked world was shut out; but still
they knew not until the flood came, seven days later. There
was a short period of time after the decree went forth before
the total destruction of the wicked. "So shall also the com-
ing of the Son of man be."
    3. To "stand up" means to reign. Dan 11:2, 20. The king-
doms of this world are given to Christ at the close of His
work in the sanctuary, and He is crowned "King of kings,
and Lord of lords."
    4. The pouring ont of the wrath of God was, John says,
a great and marvelous thing. Isaiah speaks of it in the same
way (Isa. 28:21), "That He may do His work, His strange
work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act." To our
loving Father the act of punishment is a strange act. Never-
theless, the character of God is exalted by it in the sight of
the heavenly universe, as is proved by the words of the angels
in Rev. 16:5-7. God's purpose in pouring out judgments upon
the. earth may be, first, to save all that can be saved, or to
convince those who have never fallen, and those who will
finally be destroyed, that the Lord is God, and that His ways
are just. When the seven last plagues are poured out, God
knows that no more will turn to Him, yet He does not visit
His judgments upon men until the whole universe is con-
vinced that He is God, and that His ways are just. When
"loving-kindness" and "favor" do not draw men to Him, He
is forced to lift up His hand in judgments as a last remedy,
and the fact that the wicked do not then repent and give Him
glory (Rev. 16:9-11) is positive evidence that God can do no
more for them. When this fact is seen by all, God's voice
is again heard, not only in heaven, but on this earth, saying,
"It is done." Rev. 16:17-21; Heb. 12:26; "Great Controversy,"
pp. 636, 637. Then is given to great Babylon the "cup of the
wine of the fierceness of His wrath," in the seventh plague,
which is universal. The others are not. "Great Controversy,"
p. 628. This manifestation of God's unmingled wrath against
sin is but another manifestation of His unmingled love for
those whom sin is seeking to destroy.
    5. The sin of Samaria was .Baal, or sun-worship (1 Kings

of their testimony enables them to overcome.

the world hath He appeared to put away sin;" and "the wor-
shipers once purged should have had no more conscience of
sins."

                         •   NOTES.

   1. None but those who, by confession, had transferred their
sins to the sanctuary, could possibly come into the work of
the cleansing of the sanctuary. So in the antitype, the work
of Christ in cleansing the heavenly sanctuary is alone for
those whose names have been recorded in the Lamb's book
of life.
   2. They must have been "accounted," or judged, "worthy"
of a part in the first resurrection before Christ comes, or they
could not. be "raised incorruptible" in connection with that
event.
18               LESONg ON l'HE .qANCTUARIL

the antitype relating to the cleansing of the sanctuary was
partially seen. And as in the type the sanctuary was cleansed
on the tenth day of the seventh month of the Jewish year,
that point in the autumn of 1844 was accordingly fixed upon."
—Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation, under Rev. 14:6-12.
As the Jewish year began with the first new moon after the
vernal equinox, the seventh month began October 12, and the
tenth day of that month fell On October 22.
    6. In ancient times the master of ceremonies provided
each guest with a wedding-garment, and a little time was,
 given to array himself. The Lord gives each of us the robe
 of Christ's righteousness, and a little time in which to clothe
 ourselves. Then the master of ceremonies came in .to see if
 each were properly arrayed before going in to the wedding.
 The Lord, since 1844, has been examining the guests, and
 When the case of every one has been decided, then those who
 are found ready will go in to the marriage; the door will be
 shut; the foolish virgins will knock in vain, because the Lord
 does not know them. Let us now become acquainted with
 God.


 LESSON VI11.—TIME OF THE INVESTIGATIVE
                         JUDGMENT.

                        August 2.4, 1901.


   The subject of the time of judgment is so Important that
we•trust the student will bear with us if in this lesson we go
again over some of the familiar texts which have been used
in previous lessons, for we seek to place them in a new con-
nection, in order that they may the more readily be seen in
all their bearings.
     1. What has the Lord said definitely about the time of
 the judgment? Acts 17:30, 31.
     2. To whom will this appointed thy be revealed? Who
 will have no need for fear in that day? Eccl. 8:5; John 5:24.
     3. What does the wicked man know about the judgment"?
 Row does this little knowledge make him feel? What does
 he not know? . gccl. 8:6, 7; Dan. 12:10.
     4. What two phases of the judgment are spoken of?
 Rev. 20:12 (investigative); .John 5:27 (executive). • —

                            NOTES.

    Read "Great Controversy," chapter 21.
    1. The last of the three signs in the sun, moon, and stars
took place in 1833. The Saviour says that when•we have seen
all these things, we may know that He is near; so when the
church know that He is near, they go out to meet Him.
Having carried the minds of His disciples down to that tiMe,
Hesays, "Then shall the kingdom," etc. It was at this very
time that William Miller and others began to preach the• sec-
ond coming of Christ as near at hand; and in 1844 they went
out to meet the Bridegrooni.
 - 2. In ancient times the capital city represented the whole
kingdom. When a- new king took possession of it, and was
crowned,- wedding festivities were., celebrated. Thus when
the New Jerusalem is prepared as, a bride,. Christ's work as
a high priest being finished, the 'marriageceremony takes
plaee. The bride,- the capital city of the new. earth, which
stands for all the kingdoms of the world, is given to Christ,
the Bridegroom.
    3. It could not be said that the Bridegroom "tarried" Un-
less He was expected at a certain time, no more than:we
could say a train tarries unless there is a specified time for
arrival; but when this time passes, and no train appears, we
say, "The train tarries."
    4. "They all slumbered and slept"—one class in unconcern
and abandonment of their faith, the other class patiently
waiting till clearer light should be given.
    5. "In the summer of 1844, midway between the time when
it had been first thought that the 2,300 days would end, and
the autumn of the same year, to which it was afterward
found that they extended, the message was proclaimed in the
very words of the scripture, 'Behold, the Bridegroom coin-
eth.' "—Great Controversy, page 398. See also "Early Writ-
 ings" ("Spiritual Gifts"), pp. 102, 103. "The cause- of this
sudden arousing was the discovery that the- great.prophetic
period of 2,300 days (years) of Dan. 8:14 did-not end in
spring of 1844, but would extend to the autumn of that year.

world, was a terrible trial of faith and patience." Anothei
writer says: "A mistake had been made which apparently
involved the integrity of the little book they had been eat-
ing. What had been so like honey to their taste suddenly
became like wormwood and gall. But those who had the
patience to endure, so to speak. the digesting process, soon
learned that the mistake was only in the event, not in the
time, and that what the angel had given them was not unto
death, but to their nourishment and support."
   3. They must distinguish between the precious and the
vile, between truth and error, and put. a. difference between
the holy and the profane. Eze. 22:26; 44:23, 24. "Be ye
clean that bear the veszels of the Lord." The sanctuary must
be cleansed. Then "shalt thou be as My mouth:" Jer. 15:19.
And that is the work of the third angel's message.

        LESSON VI.-THE DISAPPOINTMENT.

                        August 10, 1901.


    1..What shows that there would be something in connec-
tion with the message and work of the angel in Revelation 10
which would not be understood? Rev. 10:1, 3, 4. The angel
was "clothed with a cloud."
    2. What was there to be in the experience of God's people
after eating the little book which would further indicate dis-
appointment? Verses 9, 10.
    3. What mistake had they made in interpreting the little
book which caused this bitterness? Note 1.
     4. How does Jeremiah describe the experience of God's
people in eating the little book? .Jer. 15:16.
   .5. How does he picture
                       '       the disappointment. which fol-
lowed? Verses 17, 18. Note 2.
    6. How does the• Lord seek to encourage them in their
disappointment?' Heb. 1.6:35-38.
    7. What further work does He give them to do?
Rev. 10:11.
    8. What message is here referred to? Rev. 14:9-12.
    9. In order to give this message, what must they do?
Jer. 15:19; Rev. 14:12. What would they be? Note 3.
   10. How would this message be received? Jer. 15:20.
   11. What will be the final outcome of if? Verse 21.;
Rev. 14:1.4-16.
                            NOTES.
   1. "In common with the rest of the Christian world, Ad-
ventists then held that the earth, or some portion of it, was
the sanctuary. They understood that the cleansing of the
sanctuary was the purification of the earth by the fires of the
last great day, and that this would take place at the second
advent. Hence the conclusion that Christ would return to
the earth in 1814."—Great Controversy, page 409.
   2. "Great Controversy," pp. 403, 404, says: "Some who had
been very confident were so deeply wounded in their pride
that they. felt like fleeing from the world. Like Jonah, they
complained of God, and chose death rather than life. . . .
The earnest, sincere believers. had given up all for Christ.
     . With intense desire they had prayed, 'Come, Lord
Jesus,. and come quickly.' But He had not come; and now
to take up again the heavy burden of life's cares and per-
plexities, and to endure the taunts and sneers of a scoffing
12               LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

   11. What other event takes place at the same time?
Rev. 11;15, 19.
   12. How does Daniel describe the scene which tools place
at the opening of the temple in heaven? Dan. 7:9, 10, 13.
                             NOTES.
    1. Jewish writers tell us that the purpose of this blowing
of trumpets was to announce the day of judgment as at hand,
so that the people might prepare for it.
    2. "In 1833 William Miller received a license to preach in
the Baptist Church, of which he was a member, a large num-
ber of the ministers of his denomination also approving his
work." This work was the preaching of the Advent doctrine.
Also in that year "the last of the three signs in the sun,
moon, and stars appeared, which were promised by the
Saviour as tokens of His second advent. 'The stars shall fall
from heaven.' "—Great Controversy; pp. 332, 333. From that
time on until 1844 the judgment message was preached with
increasing power.
    3. This message is coincident with the meSsage -of Rev.
14:6, 7, till the autumn of 1844, when the Advent people ex-
perienced their bitter disappointment. It contains the phase
of definite time that was connected with the first angel's mes-
sage prior to that disappointment. The message of Rev.
10:1-6 closed in the autumn of 1844, because the light which
 came from the study of the sanctuary explained the disap-
pointment, the work to be done at the end of the 2,300 days,
and the nature of the message to be given after its close. See
 Rev. 10:7, 11; 14:6-12; and "Christ Our Advocate," pp. 73-81.
    4. The time referred to can not mean ordinary or com-
 mon time, - for succeeding days are mentioned in the next
 verse. Neither can it mean probationary time, for another
 message is yet to be given. Verse 11. Being connected with
 prophecy, it would, most assuredly, be prophetic time.
    5. The mystery of God is the gospel. See Eph. 1:9, 10;
6:19; 1 Tim. 3:16; Col. 1:27. The finishing of the mystery
 would be the close of the proclamation of the gospel, the
 completion of the work which it was designed to accomplish.
 According -to the above texts, that work is the placing of
 "Christ in you," "God manifest in the flesh." When this is
 fully done, then the "mystery of God" is finished. But this,
 as we have seen, is the very result that is reached in the great
 work called the cleansing of the sanctuary. In that Christ
 brings His work as priest to an end; He finishes His media-
 tion, cleanses His people, decides the cases of all mankind,
 and concludes the work of the gospel. The closing work of
 the gospel on earth is coincident with the closing work of
 Christ as priest in the heavenly temple. See "Christ Our
 Advocate," .page 98,

later, that is, in the spring of A. D. 28. His' second Passover
would be in the spring of 29; the third, in the spring of 30.
At His...fourth Passover, in the spring of A. D. 31, He was
crucified "in the midst of the week." After confirming the
new covenant with the Jews for three years and a half, He,
by virtue of His death, caused the sacrifices to cease. And
during the remaining three and a half years of the seven-
tieth week the covenant was confirmed with the Jews by the
apostles. Heb. 2:3: The end of this time brings us to A. D.
34, when the gospel began to go to the Gentiles.
    5. Soon after this, Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles,
was converted, and we hear him saying to the Jews, "It was
necessary that the Word of God should first have been spoken
to you; but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves
unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles."

   14. What was to take place at the end of the 2,300 days?
Dan. 8:14.
   15. Then when did Christ go into the most holy place to
begin the work of cleansing the sanctuary?
                           NOTES.
   1. The first definition of "determine" given by Webster is
"to fix the boundaries of; • to mark off or separate." Thus
the 70 weeks fixed the boundaries of the special work for the
Jewish people. It ended with that period. The 70 weeks
were also marked off or separated from the 2,300 days, and
they fixed the boundaries of. that period by showing when it
commenced, and by giving intermediate dates during the
period which would test the accuracy of every exposition of
it. Gesenius, in his Hebrew Lexicon, says that the word
translated "determined" means "cut. off." As no other period
was mentioned in the vision except the 2,300 days, it must
have been "cut off," or "marked off," from that period.
    2. Artaxerxes began to reign B. C. 464. See Smith's "Com-
prehensive Dictionary," article "Artaxerxes." The seventh
year of his reign would be 457 B. C. See "Christ Our Advo-
cate," page 59.
    3. The prophecy indicates that 7 weeks, or 49 years, would
be allotted to the building of Jerusalem. Hence the com-
mandment could scarcely be said to "go forth" until the
 building was actually commenced; therefore, as Ezra and the
Jews with him did not arrive till the fifth mouth, half of the
year 457 had elapsed before the decree "went forth." There
would, therefore, be only 456T/2 years to A. D. 1. And as only
about 6 months of the year 27 A. D. were passed when Christ
 was anointed, we can count only 261/2 years to His baptism,
 when He was called the Messiah. Thus, adding the 4561/2
 B. C. to 2614 A. D., we have just the 69 weeks, or 483 years;
 from the "going forth of the commandment" "to Messiah the
 Prince."
    4. Christ attended four Passovers, as recorded. John 2:13;
5:1; 6:4; 13:1. As He began His public ministry in the
 autumn of A. D. 27, the first Passover would be six months

    2. Apparently Daniel had connected the cleansing of the
sanctuary at the end of the 2,300 days in some way with the
ending of the 70 years of the captivity. But it is evident that
he was desirous of further light ,upon the subject, and his
faith laid hold of the command that he had heard given to the
angel Gabriel to "make this man to understand the vision."
And lo, while Daniel was speaking in prayer, "even the man
Gabriel," whom he had "seen in the vision at the beginning"
being caused to fly swiftly on account of Daniel's supplica-
tion, has now come forth to give him skill and understanding.
Daniells told to "consider the vision;" and as no other vision
has been mentioned except the one in chapter 8, we must. con-
clude' that Gabriel has now come to finish carrying out the
command recorded in that chapter to make "this man to un-
derstand the vision."

   12. What did he tell him to consider? Verse 23. Note 2.

in the previous vision, at what point does he now begin?
 Verse 24.
                           NOTES.
   1. The student will notice that the chronology of Arch-
bishop Usher, which is used in the margin of our Bibles,
places the vision of Daniel S in 553 B. C., and the vision of
Daniel 9 in 538 B. C., 15 years apart. It was formerly sup-
posed that the Belshazzar of Dan. 8:1 and of Daniel 5 was the
Nabonadius of secular history, whose reign began. in 555
B. C. Later researches have proved, however, that Belshaz-
zar was the son of Nabonadius, and that his reign dated from
543 B. C. .This would make his third year 538 B. C., the same
year he W
        as overthrown and succeeded by Darius. Thus the
visions of the two chapters would be in the same year, and
not 15 years apart. See "Christ Our Advocate," pp. 48, 49.

    2. The scapegoat could not typify Christ, because only one
lot was for the Lord. The Hebrew word for "scapegoat," as
given in the margin, is "Azazel." The Syriac has "Azzail,"
"the angel (strong one) who revolted."
    3. This was to be a day of atonement, or "at-one-ment,"
as representing the time when God's people shall be fully
made one with Him. "Now a mediator is not a. mediator of
one" (Gal. 3:20), so when God's pedple have all been made
one with Him, they will no longer need a. mediator. Christ
will have finished His work as priest. Atonement was to be.
made for all the sins of Israel. Lev. 16:34. No more sins
will, therefore, be committed by any of them after the day
represented by the day of atonement is over. "It shall be an
holy convocation." Then, in the antitypical day of atone-
ment, they that feared the Lord spake often one to another.
"Not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together; . . .
but exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye see
the day approaching." "Ye shall afflict your souls." So now
we are exhorted 10. "repent, and be converted, that your sins
may be blotted out." This day of atonement is the time
of the blotting out of sins. Every sin then must be con-
fessed. "And offer an offering made by fire." This offering
made by fire was the burnt-offering, which represented con-
secration. "Ye shall do no manner of work therein, for it is
a day of atonement." "It shall be unto you a sabbath of
rest." So in the antitype we must cease wholly from our
own works of the flesh. "For he that is entered into His rest,
he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from His."
Heb. 4:10. Our own works are works of sin. Gal. 5:19-21.
The ceasing from physical labOr on that day was an outward
object-lesson of the ceasing from sin, which must- be done
fully before the day of atonement is over; then it will be
indeed a sabbath of rest to our souls.
   4. We find from these verses that it is necessary that
heavenly things should be purified; and that, as the high
priest in the earthly sanctuary entered in every year with the
blood of others to cleanse it, so our High Priest, with His
own blood (verse 12), enters in once, "in the end of the world,
to put away sin, or cleanse the sanctuary, by the blood of the
sacrifice which had already been made on the cross when He
gave Himself for our sins.

people? What would be the result if they did their own
work or did not afflict their souls? Lev. 23:27-32. Note 3.
As this was the day when every ease was decided, what day
must it represent?
   13. For what purpose does Christ go into the most holy
place in the heavenly sanctuary? When does He enter in?

   14. Has the exact time "in the end of the world" been ap-
pointed for the cleansing of the sanctuary, that is to say, for

   Read "Great Controversy," chapter 23; "Looking unto
Jesus," chapters 30, 31.
   1. Each year's service in the earthly sanctuary was a type
of the whole work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.
                          ON      SANCTUARY.                  5

from himself to the innocent sacrifice. By his own hand the
animal was then slain, and the blood was carried by the
priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the vail, be-
hind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner
had transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through the
blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary. In some cases
the blood was not taken into the holy place, but the flesh was
then to be eaten by the priest.    . . Lev. 10:17. Both cere-
monies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from the peni-
tent to the sanctuary. Such was the work that went on day
by day throughout the year. The sins of Israel being thus
transferred to the sanctuary, the holy places were defiled."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 332. So the ordinances of
divine service connected with the heavenly sanctuary are for
the purpose of separating the sinner from his sins. "By faith
the sins of the repentant a•re placed upon Christ and trans-
ferred, in fact, to the heavenly sanctuary."
    4. When a person sinned, the sanctuary was in a sense
defiled, as brought to view in these verses; because it con-
tained the law that had been transgressed. But until that
sin was confessed it did not become a part of the "iniquity
of the sanctuary," referred to in Num. 18:1; for the sinner
still bore his own sin, and his own blood would be required
to atone for it. But when confession was made, and his
offering presented, the priest, through the blood, or the flesh,
took the sin and bore it in a figure into the sanctuary. Thus
the sinner was left free, and the priest stood responsible.

   1. There were ordinances of divine service connected with
the worldly sanctuary. These are described in Leviticus
and Numbers, and briefly summarized in Heb. 9:6, 7. That
sanctuary was a figure (verse 9), or pattern (verse 23), of
the sanctuary, or true tabernacle, which is in heaven. Heb.
S:1, 2. And the .services of• the worldy sanctuary were an'
example or shadow Of the services in the heavenly sanctu-
ary. Verses 3-5. The worldly sanctuary and the service of
the priests were to teach us by illustration in regard to the
heavenly sanctuary and the work of our great High Priest.
    2: "The daily service consisted of the morning and even-
ing burnt-offering, the offering of sweet incense on the
golden altar, and the special offerings for individual sins.
And there were also offerings for sabbaths, new moons, and
special feasts."-Patriarchs and Prophets, page 352,

 of the tabernacle, and placing his band upon the victim's
head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them
