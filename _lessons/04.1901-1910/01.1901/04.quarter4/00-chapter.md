    NOTE.—In the preparation of these lessons all Scripture refer-
 ences, and the pages of " Christ's Object Lessons," should be
 thoroughly studied first, then the questions. The questions are
 not the lessons. They are only for the purpose of finding out what
 we have observed while studying.
    More of the preciousness of these lessons will be obtained if
 the lesson is studied each day throughout the week. In the
 parables of Jesus there is salvation from sin for every type of
 sinner—from the Pharisee to the prodigal.
    The notes are wholly selected from such portions of " Christ's
 Object Lessons" as apply to each lesson.

                              NOTES•

    To Adam and Eve in their Eden home nature was full of the
knowledge of God, teeming with divine instruction. Wisdom
spoke to the eye, and was received into the heart, for they com-
muned with God in His created works. As soon as the holy pair
transgressed the law of the Most High, the brightness from the
face of God departed from the face of nature. The earth is now
marred and defiled by sin. Yet, even in its blighted state, much
that is beautiful remains. God's object-lessons are not obliterated;
rightly understood, nature speaks of her Creator.
     In the days of Christ these lessons had been lost sight of.
Men had well-nigh ceased to discern God in His works. The sin-
fulness of humanity had cast a pall over the fair face of creation;
and, instead of manifesting God, His works became a barrier that
concealed Him. . . . Not only the things of nature, but the
sacrificial service and the Scriptures themselves,—all given to
 reveal God,—were so perverted that they became the means of
concealing Him.
     Jesus sought an avenue to every heart. By using a variety of
 illustrations, He not only presented truth in its different phases,
 but appealed to the different hearers. Their interest was aroused
 by figures, drawn from the surroundings of their daily life.
     In the Saviour's parable teaching is an indication of what
 constitutes the title "higher education."
     Too often the minds of students are occupied with men's theo-
 ries and speculations, falsely called science and philosophy. They
 need to be brought into close contact with nature. Let them
 learn that creation and Christianity have one God.
      Christ's purpose in parable teaching was in direct line with the
  purpose of the Sabbath. . . . The Sabbath bids us behold in
  His created works the glory of the Creator.      . . On the holy
  rest day, above all other days, we should study the messages that
  God has written for us in nature. We should study the Sa-
  viotir's parables where He spoke them in the fields and groves,
  under the open sky-, among the grass and flowers. As we come
  close to the heart of nature, Christ makes His presence real to us,
  and speaks to our hearts of His peace and love.

      LESSON IL—PARABLE OF THE SOWER:

              Lesson Scriptures.—Matt.   13: 1-9; Luke 8:

           AID.—" Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 33-43.

      r. When Jesus gave the parable of the sower, what were the
surroundings? Matt. 13: t, 2.
     2. What did He say? Verse 3.
     3. Was a sower in ,sight when He said this? What is the
meaning of the word "behold "? In the application of the parable,
who is the sower? Verse 37. What does He sow? What kind of
seed? What is the seed? Luke 8 : 1 r.
     4. What causes growth?—Life. Who quickens, or gives life
to, all things? I Tim. 6:13.
     5. Is that past merely, or present also? By whose life does
the Creator make things live and grow?
     6. If there were another source of life than God Himself,
what would be necessary?—Another god besides the Lord.
What, then, is the life of every seed and plant and tree?
     7. What is a " fountain "? With whom is the "fountain of
life"? Ps. 36: 7-9.
     8. By what means are people created? Job 33 : 4.
     9. How are they kept alive? Acts 17 : 25.
    10. What relation is there between God's Word and His life?
John 6 : 63.
    it. Then, since all things are now caused to be, and made to
grow, by the " life " of God, does that mean by the " word " of
God?                 •
    12. How are men born again? I Peter I :23.; John 3 : 6. Ans.—
Born again by the " word "; born by the "Spirit." "The words
that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." John 6 : 63.
             LESSONS ON THE PARABLES OF' JESUS.                    7
   13. Are written signs and characters the real word of God?
Heb. 4 : 12.
   14. Since it is the same life in what we call "natural" things as.
that which is found in spiritual things, what ought we to see in all
natural objects?
   15. In the parable what did the sower sow?
                              NOTES.

   They expected the Messiah to prove His claims by mighty
deeds of conquest, to establish His empire on the ruins of 'earthly
kingdoms. This expectation Christ answered in the parable of
the sower. Not by force of arms, not by violent interpositions, was
the kingdom of God to prevail, but by the implanting of a new
principle in the hearts of men.
   The word of God is the seed. Every seed has, in itself, a ger-
minating principle. In it the life of the plant is enfolded. So
there is life in God's word. . . . In every command and in
every promise of the word of God is the power, the very life of
God, by which the command may be fulfilled and the promise
realized. He who, by faith, received the word, is receiving the
very life and character of God.
    But the teacher of sacred truth can impart only that which he
himself knows by experience. " The sower sowed his seed."

                                      NOTES.

   Satan has many helpers. Many who profess to be Christians
are aiding the tempter to catch away the seeds of truth from other'
hearts. Many who listen to the preaching of the word of God
make it the subject of criticism at home. They sit in judgment on
the sermon as they would on the words of a lecturer or a political
speaker.
   It is not because men receive the word immediately, nor ,
because they rejoice in it, that they fall away. As soon as Matthew
heard the Saviour's call, immediately he rose up, left all, and fol-
lowed Him. As soon as the divine word comes to our hearts,
God desires us to receive it; and it is right to accept it with joy.
" Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth."

    8. For whom, then, does good ground bring forth fruit?
    9. What is our final test—correctness of theology merely, or
fruit-bearing? Matt. 25:31—q6.
                               NOTES.
   Throughout the parable of the sower, Christ represents the dif-
ferent results of the sowing as depending upon the soil. In every
case the sower and the seed are the same. Thus He teaches that
if the word of God fails of accomplishing its work in our hearts
and lives, the reason is to be found in ourselves.
    The garden of the heart must be cultivated. The soil must be
broken up by deep repentance for sin. Poisonous, satanic plants
must be uprooted. The soil once overgrown by thorns can be
reclaimed only by diligent labor. So the evil tendencies of the
natural heart can be overcome only by earnest effort in the name
and strength of Jesus.
    The "honest and good heart" of which the parable speaks, is
not a heart without sin; for the gospel is to be preached to the
lost. Christ said, " I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance." He has an honest heart who yields to the convic-
tion of the Holy Spirit.

I2            LESSONS ON THE PARABLES OE JESUS.

                              NOTES.

    The parable of the seed reveals that God is at work in nature.
The seed has in itself a germinating principle, a principle that
God Himself has planted: yet if left to itself, the seed would have
no power to spring up. Man has his part to act in promoting the
growth of grain. He must prepare and enrich the soil and cast in
the seed. He must till the fields. But there is a point beyond
which he can accomplish nothing.
    There is life in the seed, there is power in the soil; but unless
an infinite power is exercised day and night, the seed will yield no -
returns. . . . The life which the Creator has implanted, He
alone can call forth. Every seed grows. every plant develops, by
the power of God.
    As the earth bringeth forth her bud, as the garden causeth the
things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord will cause
righteousness and praise to spring forth.
    The germination of the seed represents the beginning of the
spiritual life, and the development of the plant is a beautiful figure
of Christian growth. As in nature, so in grace; there can be no
life without growth. The plant must either grow or die.
    At every stage of development our life may be perfect; yet if
God's purpose for us is fulfilled, there will be continual advance-
ment. Sanctification is the work of d lifetime.
    There can be no growth or fruitfulness in the life that is cen-
tered in self.
    Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
 Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be
 perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim
them as His own.
    Were all who profess His name bearing fruit to His glory, how
 quickly the whole world would be sown with the seed of the gos-
 pel. Quickly the last great harvest would be ripened, and Christ
 would come to gather the precious grain.

   23. What shows the literal character of the fire and the suffer-
ing?
   24. At that time who will shine forth? Where?
                               NOTES.

    The tares represent a class who are the fruit or embodiment
of error, of false principles. " The enemy that sowed them is the
devil." Neither God nor His angels ever sowed a seed that would
produce a tare. The tares are always sown by Satan, the enemy
of God and man.
    It is from enmity to Christ that Satan scatters his evil seed
among the good grain of the kingdom. The fruit of the sowing he
attributes to the Son of God. By bringing into the church those
who bear Christ's name while they deny His character, the wicked
one causes that God shall be dishonored, the work of salvation
misrepresented, and souls imperiled.
    Christ has plainly taught that those who persist in open sin must
be separated from the church ; but He has not committed to us the
work of judging character and motive.
    The Redeemer does not want to lose one soul ; His experience
with Judas is recorded to show His long patience with perverse
human nature ; and He bids us bear with it as He has borne.
   The Saviour does not point forward to a time when all the tares
become wheat. The wheat and tares grow together until the
harvest, the end of the world. Then the tares are bound in
bundles to be burned, and the wheat is gathered into the garner
of God.

   15. Can one have the spirit of both these kingdoms at the same

                               NOTES.

    The Jews looked for the kingdom of God to be established in
 the same way as the kingdoms of the world. To promote righteous-
 ness they resorted to external measures. They devised methods
 and plans. But Christ implants a principle. By implanting truth
 and righteousness He counterworks error and sin.
    Not only is the growth of Christ's kingdom illustrated by the
 parable of the mustard seed, but in every stage of its growth the
 experience represented in the parable is repeated.
    At the outset its advocates are few. By the great men of the
 world, and by a world-conforming church, they are opposed and
 despised.
    In this last generation the parable of the mustard seed is to
 reach a signal and triumphant fulfilment. The little seed will
 become a tree.
    Every seed that sends up its green blade to the sunlight declares
 the wonder-working power of that word uttered by Him who
 " spake and it was ;" who " commanded, and it stood fast."
    In everything that tends to the sustenance of man is seen
,the concurrence of divine and human effort. There can be no
 reaping unless the human hand acts its part in the sowing of the
 seed.

  LESSON VI11.—THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.
                 VARIOUS COMPARISONS.
                Lesson Scriptures.—Matt. 13:33; 44-52.
                  Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 95-134.

                       November 23, 1901.

    1. In this scripture, how many comparisons are made? What
are they? What was hid? Where? Until what resulted? Was
the leaven naturally in the meal? What practical lesson do you
get from this fact? At the beginning which was the greater in
bulk—the leaven or the meal? Finally, what did all become?
What does this show of the efficiency of the "hidden life"?
    2. What is the second comparison? What will the man do
who actually finds it? Does he reluctantly part with his former
possessions in order to obtain the " hid treasure "? What are
you willing to give up for heaven?
    3. What is the third comparison? When we are the " mer-
chantman," who is the " Pearl "? When Christ is the "Merchant-
man," who is the " pearl "? Mal. 3:17. What price did He pay for
us? Give scripture proof. Does the merchantman regret to part
with all his former possessions in order to procure the "pearl of
great price "?
    4. What is the fourth comparison? What is gathered in the
 net? What is done with the bad? With the good? In reference
to the kingdom, when does He say He will " sever the wicked from
among the just "? Then how long will bad fish be found in the
 gospel net? How does this agree with the parable of the tares?
 In this case, who separates the bad from the good? Where were
 the tares cast? Where are these cast?
    5. To close this series of parables, what question did Jesus ask?
 What did they answer? Then what further instruction came? If
 we are among the " scribes instructed unto the kingdom of
 heaven," what may we do?

                             NOTES.
   The leaven—something wholly from without—must be put into
the meal before the desired change can be wrought in it.
   As the leaven, when mingled with the meal, works from within
outward, so it is by the renewing of the heart that the grace of
God works to transform the life.
   The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the
whole mass under its leavening process ; so the leaven of truth
works secretly, silently, steadily, to transform the soul,
   Man is not endowed with new faculties, but the faculties he has
arc sanctified.
   The leaven of truth will not produce the spirit of rivalry, the
love of ambition, the desire to be first.
   The grace of Christ is to control the temper and the voice.

what circumstances? Why would this circumstance lead one to

    3. Had He taught this same prayer before? Where?
    4. In the prayer, what endearing name are we permitted to

ourselves to be? How does the beloved John show his apprecia-
tion of this relationship with the Holy One? I John 3: I, 2. To
whom do these words have more than an empty sound?
    5. What incident is related to impress the Lord's prayer?
At what hour is the request made for bread? Where is the one

of whom the favor is asked? Why does he at first object? What
will persuade him to rise and give the bread? How much will
he give?
     6. Why are some prayers never granted? James 4 : 3.
     7. In the parable, for whoe benefit was the urgent request
made?
     8. For whom were Jesus' earnest prayers offered? John
17:9-r1, 15-26; see note. What practical lesson may we learn
from this fact?
     9. What deepening of purpose is expressed when we ask, seek,
and knock? How many receive? Who finds? To whom will the
treasure-house of God be opened?
    10. Turning from the sleeping friend to an earthly father, what
precious truths are taught in reference to prayer? Why does even
this fail to equal our heavenly Father's willingness to give? How
only may we preserve the capacity for receiving of God? See
note.
    tr. Does prayer work any change in God? See note.
   12. Have God's promises any conditions? What are they?
John 14 : 13-15.
                             NOTES.

    Not for Himself, but for others, He lived and thought and
prayed. From hours spent with God He came forth morning by
morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily He received
a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit.
    Here Christ represents the petitioner as asking that he may
give again.
    A selfish man will grant an urgent request, in order to rid
himself of one who disturbs his rest. But God delights to give.
    Our prayers are not to be a selfish asking, merely for our own
benefit. We are to ask that we may give.
    The capacity for receiving is preserved only by imparting. We
can not continue to receive heavenly treasure without communi-
cating to those around us.
    Prayer is not to work any change in God ; it is to bring us
into harmony with God. When we make a request of Him, He
20            LESSONS ON THE PARABLES OP' JESI1S.

may see that it is necessary for us to search our hearts and repent
of sin. Therefore He takes us through test and trial, He brings
us through humiliation, that we may see what hinders the working
of His Holy Spirit through us.
   God does not say, Ask once and you shall receive. He bids
us ask, unwearyingly persist in prayer. The persistent asking
brings the petitioner into a more earnest attitude, and gives him
an increased desire to receive the things for which he asks.
   The practise of telling our difficulties to others only`makes
us weak, and brings no strength to them.

selves here, accepting their Redeemer as their all in all? Rom.
8: 16, 17.
                            NOTES.
   Whoever trusts in himself that he is righteous, will despise
others.
   The sense of need, the recognition of our poverty and sin, is
the very first condition of acceptance with God.
   Those whom heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to
parade their own goodness.
   Great as is the shame and degradation through sin, even
greater will be the honor and exaltation through redeeming love.
To human beings striving for conformity to the divine image
there is imparted an outlay of heaven's treasure, an excellency
of power, that will place them higher even than the angels who
have never fallen.

                             NOTES.
   The Lord permits trials in order that we may be cleansed from
earthliness, from selfishness, from harsh, unchristlike traits of
character. He suffers the deep waters of affliction to go over our
souls, in order that we may know Him, and Jesus Christ whom
He has sent, in order that we may have deep heart longings to
be cleansed from defilement, and may come forth from the trial
purer, holier, happier.
   There is no danger that the Lord will neglect the prayers of
His people. The danger is that in temptation and trial they will
become discouraged, and fail to persevere in prayer.
   From age to age the Lord has made known the manner of
His working. When a crisis has come, He has revealed Himself
and has interposed to hinder the working out of Satan's plans.
 With nations, with families, and with individuals, He has often
permitted matters to come to a crisis, that His interference might
become marked.
   In this time of prevailing iniquity we may know that the last
great crisis is at hand.
   From garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds,
from mountains and deserts, from the caves of the earth and the
caverns of the sea, Christ will gather His children to Himself.

                             NOTES.

   As the shepherd loves his sheep, and can not rest if one be
missing, so, in an infinitely higher degree, does God love every
outcast soul. Men may deny the claim of His love, they may
wander from Him, may choose anothei master, yet they are
God's, and He longs to recover His own. He says, "As a
shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his
sheep that are scattered, so will I seek out My sheep, and will
deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in
the cloudy and dark day."
   In the parable of the lost sheep, Christ teaches that salvation
does not come through our seeking after God, but through God's
seeking after us.
   Every soul whom Christ has rescued is called to work in His
name for the saving of the lost. This work had been neglected in
Israel. Is it not neglected to-day by those who profess to be
Christ's followers?
   In this work all the angels of heaven are ready to cooperate.
All the resources of heaven are at the command of those who are
seeking to save the lost. Angels will help you to reach the most
careless and the most hardened. And when one is brought back
to God, all heaven is made glad.

                              NOTES.
   In the parable of the prodigal son is presented the Lord's
dealing with those who have once known the Father's love, but
have allowed the tempter to lead them captive at his will.
   Whatever the appearance may be, every life centered in self is
squandered.
   The love of God still yearns over the one who has chosen to
separate from Him, and He sets in operation influences to bring
him back to the Father's house.
   The prodigal son in his wretchedness " came to himself."
    In his restless youth the prodigal looked upon his father as
stern and severe. How different his conception of him now !
So those who are deceived by Satan look upon God as hard and
exacting.
    In the parable there is no taunting, no casting up to the prodi-
garof his evil course; the son feels that the past is forgiven and
forgotten, blotted out forever.
   Self-righteousness not only leads men to misrepresent God, but
makes them cold-hearted and critical toward their brethren. . . .
While the soul is making its very first struggles against the flood
of temptations, they stand by, stubborn, self-willed, complaining,
accusing. They may claim to be children of God, but they are
acting out the spirit of Satan. By their attitude toward their
brethren these accusers place themselves where God can not give
them the light of His countenance.
