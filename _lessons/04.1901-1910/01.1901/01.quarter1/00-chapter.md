LESSON 1.—DEBTORS TO DO THE WHOLE LAW.


                      January 5, 1901.

                   (Gal. 4:30, 31; 5:1-8, R. V.)


   "What saith the Scripture? Cast out the handmaid and
her son; for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with
the son of the freewoman. Wherefore, brethren, we are
not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman. With
freedom did Christ set us free; stand fast therefore, and be
not entangled again in a yoke of bondage. Behold, I Paul
say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will
profit you nothing. Yea, I testify again to every man that
receivet.h circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole
law. Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified
by the law; ye are fallen away from grace. For we through
the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. For
in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
uncircumcision; but faith working through love. Ye were
running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
the truth? This persuasion came not of Him that calleth
you."

   Remember that this whole epistle is devoted to showing
the difference between the flesh and the Spirit. The -trouble
with the Galatian brethren was that, having begun in the
Spirit, they were-seeking perfection through the flesh. See
chapter 3:3. In the fourth chapter we have A sharp `con-
trast between the flesh and the Spirit. Tl e flee is -bondage,
the Spirit is freedom. If we have been baptized into e:akst,
we have put on Christ, and Christ through the Spirit abides
in us. "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if sb be
that the Spirit of Cod dwell in you." Rom. 8:9. "So then,
brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the
free;" for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
2 Cor. 3:17. Not to Sinai, but to Mount Zion, do we dome
for life. See Heb. 12:18-24.

                          QUESTIONS.

   1. What saith the Scripture?
   "Cast out the bondwoman and her son."
  .2. What is the bondwoman? To what does • she bring
forth? Who is the child of the bondwoman? According to
what was he born?
   3. What is true of them who are in the flesh?
   "They that are in the flesh can not please God." Rom. 8:8.
   4. Then what of the son of the bondwoman, born 'after
the flesh?
   "The son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with. the
son of the freewoman."
   5. Whose children are we?—"We are not children of the
bondwoman, but of the free." How so?—With freedoria did
Christ set us free. Compare John 8:31, 32, 34-36.
   6. What, therefore, should we do?
   "Stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again, in a
yoke of bondage."
   7. What is said to those who receive circumcision?
   "Christ will profit you nothing."
   8. What is true of every man that is circumcised?
   "Ile is a debtor to do the whole law."
   9. What of those who would be justified by the law?
   "Ye are severed from Christ." "Christ is become of no
effect unto you." "Ye are fallen away from grace."
   10. How only may we expect the hope of righteouSness?
   "Through the Spirit."
   11. Is the mere question of circumcision then so vital a
matter?
                   L]SSSONS 114 GALATIANS.                   5


  "In ChriSt Jesus neither circumcision availeth .anything,
nor uncircutucision."
  12. What is the only essential thing?
  "Faith Workinr, through love."
  13,- Had. the Galatians ever been in the right way?
       cUrl run well."
  14. What is indicated by the question, "Who did hinder
you?" in what had they been hindered?
  "That., ye should not obey the truth."
  15. What is truth? Where and where only' is it found?
How only may we know it? What will it do for us?

                            NOTES.

   1. "if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you noth-
ing." "Ye are severed from Christ, ye whowould be justi-
fied by the law." These two statements, together with a
remembrance of what circumcision signified, and also the
controversy that was being waged in the churches by the
false brethren, make the case very clear. Why were some
now turning to circumcision?—Because false brethren had
taught. them "except ye be circumcised, ye can not be saved."
It was for justification, salvation. Circumcision was a sign
of righteousness, of the keeping of the law, but only of
righteousness by faith. Rom. 4:11. Those, therefore, who
were trusting to circumcision for justification, were seeking
righteousness by their own works of the law.

   2. "Neither circumcision availeth ' anything, nor uncir-
cumeision." That is, neither circumcision nor uncircum-
cision haS ally power. Neither condition can help any per-
son to gajn righteousness. Circumcision was never designed
as a help; it was never intimated by the Lord that it had
any power. It was given merely as a sign of the righteous-
ness already possessed through Christ. What every person
needs is bower, but neither circumcision nor anything else,
except Christ, can give that. The cross of Christ is the
power of God, and in that we get the righteousness of God.

   3. The original purpose of God in giving the sign of cir-
cumcision, had been lost sight of, and the thing had been
wholly perverted. It was given to Abraham as a sign of the
righteousqess which he already had, through faith, after he
had madecthe vain attempt to fulfil the promises of God by
his own flesh. It was to be a sign, a reminder, that "the
flesh profiteth nothing." Therefore in a warning against
6                  LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


those who are of the circumcision—who trust in their own
works for salvation—we read, "For we a•re the circumcision,
which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus,
and have no confidence in the flesh." Phil: 3:3.     •

    4. Circumcision was given as a sign of righteousness, a
sign. of perfect commandment-keeping. It is evident, there-
fore, that wherever there was circumcision, we should expect
to find the law fully kept, and whoever was circumcised in
order to secure righteousness, thereby pledged himself to
do the whole law, to make himself wholly righteous through
the flesh. But this is an impossibility, for righteousness can
he obtained in no other way than through faith in Christ—
faith which receives and appropriates the life of Christ.
Therefore the man who undertakes to make himself right-
eous is in debt to the laW; he is debtor to do the whole law.
He has assumed obligations which he can never fill, and he
is everlastingly a debtor. He owes perfect righteousness, and
has not the first thing wherewith to pay. It is a terrible Con-
dition in which to be. Read Rom. 8:3-7. To seek righteous-
ness through the flesh is to seek righteousness by that which
is diametrically opposed to righteousness. It is like seeking
reconciliation with God by Making a league with the devil.
Of course every man on earth is in debt to the law, in that
nobody has fulfilled the law's just demands; but when one
has acknowledged the claims of the law, and has -set him-
self to discharge the obligation, the condition is emphasized.

   5. The hope of 'righteousness is the inheritance. "The
promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to
Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the
righteousness of faith." Rom. 4:13. See also Gal. 3:18;
2 Peter 3:13. it is through the Spirit that we wait for this;
for the Spirit is "the earnest of our inheritance until the
redemption of the purchased possession." Eph. 1:14. Only
through the Spirit of God can rightemtsness be obtained.
"The righteousness of the law" is fulfilled only in those
"who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom.
8:4.
   6. "Who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
truth?" What is truth? "Thy Word is truth." John 17:17.
Christ is the Word, and He is "the Truth." John 14:6.
Therefore, only in Him is there sanctification. John 17:17,
19; 1 Car. 1:30. In Him dwells the law in perfection. Ps.
40:8. He sets the captive soul at liberty, a liberty which is
                  IXSSONS IN GALATIANS.


found only in seeking God's precepts. Ps. 119:45. In Him
is "the perfect law of liberty." The freedom which Christ
the Truth gives, is freedom from sin, from disobedience to
God's holy, righteous, and good law. 1"Stand fast therefore
in the liberty wherewith Christ bath Made us free."

 LESSON H.-THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW.

                      January 12, 1901.

                       (Gal. 5:7-12, R. V.)


    "Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye
should not obey the truth? This persuasion came not of
Him that calleth you. A little leaven leaveneth the whole
lump. I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye
will be none otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you
shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. But I, brethren,
if I still preach circumcision, why am     still persecuted?
then bath the stumbling-block of the cross been clone away.
I would that they which unsettle you would even cut them-
selves off."                                  r •

                          QUESTIONS.

    1. How did the Galatians begin the Christian race?
    "Ye did run. weft." See also Gal. 3:3.
    2. In what had they allowed themselves to be hindered?
    "That ye should not obey the truth."
    3. From venom did the apostle say this persuasion did
not come?—"Not of Him that calleth you." From whom,
then? Gal. 1:7; 2:4.
 • 4. What is involved in admitting a single error?
    "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."
    5. What does the apostle say would result, if he preached
circumcision?
    "Then is the• offense of the cross ceased."
  . 6. What wish is expressed for those who were troubling
the brethren?
                  LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


  "I would they were even cut off which trouble you."
Compare Gal. 1:7, S.
  7. To what have all been called in Christ?
  "Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty."
  S. What must be guarded against?
  "Use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh."
  9. What .should be done?
  "By love serve one another."
  10. What will thus be fulfilled?
  "All the law."
  11. In what is all the law fulfilled?
  "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
                           NOTES.

   1. Verse 7 shows that in the beginning the Galatians
obeyed the truth, that is, kept God's commandments through
faith in Jesus. Now they were ceasing to obey. Professor
Boise gives this rendering of the last part of the verse:
"Who did hinder you from continuing to obey the truth?"
Make special note of the fact that the seeking of right-
eousness by the law, through the flesh, results in disobedi-
ence to it. "Israel, which followed after the law of right-
eousness, bath not attained. 'to the law of righteousness.
Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it
were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that
stumbling-stone." On the other hand, "the Gentiles, which
followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteous-
ness, even the righteousness which is of faith." Rom. 9:30-32.

    2. "Then is the offense of the cross ceased." The Greek
is skandalon, scandal. The preaching of the cross is to the
Jews a stumbling-block, a scandal, and to the Greeks fool-
ishness; but to those who believe, it is the power of God.
1 Coy. 1:23, 24. If Paul. had preached circumcision, that is,
justification. by the law, through one's own efforts, there
would have been no trouble with either Jew or Greek. The
heathen would have applauded the high morality even of the
law of God. Righteousness by works meets with universal
acceptance. All men are willing to have as much righteous-
ness as rests in the power of their own flesh. All systems
of religion extol "morality," in name, but only the Christian
religion has it in fact. It is only when Christ is preached,
when it is shown that in the flesh dwelleth .no good thing,
and that all real righteousness must come from without as
a gift, that men rebel. Their pride and self-confidence are
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


wounded. To admit that they are nothing, and that Christ
is all, is too much for them.

   3. It is good always to believe the best concerning men.
Love "thinketh no evil." Paul expressed his confidence that
in spite of their error, the Galatians would still have no
other mind than that of Christ. They wished to• do• right;
they had a zeal of God, although not according to knowl-
edge. Now that they were shown so plainly and so forcibly
Christ as the only way of righteousness and life, he believed
that they would again run into it.

   4. Christ calls to liberty, not liberty to the flesh, but
liberty from the flesh. Keep this distinction always in mind.

   5. God is love, and His law, which is His life, is love.
"Love is the fulfilling of the law." Rom. 13:10. Whenever
men either wilfully or through ignorance depart from the
law of God, the law of love, it is evident that dissensions
must ensue. Then there is danger that they will devour
one another, for having departed from God, they are doing
the will of Satan, whose work it is to devour. 1 Peter 5:8.
Love, the keeping of the commandments 'of God, "worketh
no ill to his neighbor."

   0. Love is the fulfilling of the law, and all is fulfilled in
one word, even in this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself." This is indeed the second of the two great com-
mandments which sum up the whole law (Matt. 22:37-40),
yet it comprises the whole law, because it is love, and love
is of God. The man who loves his brother, must love God
also, for without the love of God, he could have no love for
anybody. He who loves at all loves all.

LESSON I11.-THE FLESH AGAINST THE SPIRIT.


                       January 19, 1901.

                       (Gal. 5:13-18, R. V.)


   "Ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your
freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be
servants one to another. For the whole law is fulfilled in
cue word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed
that ye be not consumed one of another. But I say, Walk
by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the
other; that ye may not do the things that ye would. But if
ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law."

                          QUESTIONS.

    1. To what have all been called in Christ?
    "Ye have been called unto liberty."
    2. What must be guarded against? What, caution is
given?
    "Use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh."
    3. What should we do instead?
    "By love serve one another." "Through love be servant
one to another."
    4. How complex is the law of God?—"All the law is ful-
filled in oue word." What is that?—"Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself."
    5. If men instead bite and devour one another, what result
may be expected?
   "Take heed that ye be not consumed one of another."
   6. Against what does the flesh strive?
   "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit."
   7. Does the Spirit yield to the flesh?
   "The Spirit [lusteth] against the flesh."
   8. How do the flesh and the ,Spirit stand as regards each
other?
   "These are contrary the one to the other."
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                    11


   9. What. is the condition of the man in which both are
striving for the mastery, and neither one fully yielded to?
   "Ye can not do the things that ye would."
   10. How can we escape the lust of the flesh?
   "Walk in the Spirit."
   11. What is sure if we walk in the Spirit?
   "Ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."
   12. What, then, is our state?
   "If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
                            NOTES.
   1. The student can now, as we come near the close of the
epistle, see more clearly the practical character of it. It is
not that the apostle now takes leave of the "doctrinal," The
argumentative, and gives some "practical" exhortation, but
we have here the conclusion of the whole .matter. All true
doctrine is intensely practical, it is given for nothing else
but practise. This epistle was not written to furnish ground
for controversy, but to silence it; its purpose is to reclaim
those who are sinning against God by trying to serve Him
in their "own weak way," not knowing that "they that are
in the flesh can not please God." Rom. ,S:S. Do not relax
any diligence in study. :Let every word be indelibly printed
on your mind. Read the verses scores of times, not forget-
ting that which we. have already passed over.

   2. The contrasts in this epistle are the true and the false
gospel; the power of God and the power of man; living,
active faith, against dead works; reality against forms;
trust in the promises of God, against confidence in one's
self; freedom against bondage; the Spirit against the flesh;
justification, righteousness by faith, against attempted right-
eousness by works; the blessing of perfect righteousness by
the cross of Christ, against the curse of outward obedience,
which at best is but sin; complete submission to the Spirit
of God, against wavering between the flesh and the Spirit;
peace with God, the peace of God, against human strife.

   3. Christ came not to be served, but to serve, and to give
His life a ransom for many. Matt. 20:28. He "emptied
Himself, taking the form of a servant." Phil. 2:7, R. V. The
mind of a servant He had already. "I am among you as he
that serveth." Luke 22:27. Perfect knowledge of Christ,
appreciation of His life and character, is shown in service.
Thus the law is fulfilled.
12                 LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


    4. Compare verses 16-18 with chapter 2:20 and Rom. 8:8-10.
if the life that we live in the flesh is lived by the faith of
the Son of God, who lives in us, and whose life alone is
manifested in us, then we are not in the flesh, but in -the
Spirit; for He is a "quickening Spirit" (1 Cor. 15:45), with
"power over all flesh" (John 17:2).

    5. The Spirit and the flesh are irreconcilable. They are
"contrary the one to the other." Literally, they "lie over
against" each other; they are diametrically opposed. The
picture here presented is very striking, when we consiaer
the force of the word "lusteth.' it is from a compound
Greek word meaning to "rush eagerly against" or upon; to
"strive vehemently." The picture is of two armies encamped
over against each other, each sharply watching the other,
eager to find some advantage, and both in deadly opposition.
They have nothing-in common. The Spirit is given by God
to strive with all flesh, so that every man is a battle-ground.
It is easy to see that a man who knows something of the
working of the Spirit, and wishes to do right, yet who is still
in bondage to the flesh, can not do the things that he would.

   6. But there is the greatest hope, for the Spirit is as much
opposed to the flesh as the flesh is to the Spirit, and the.
Spirit is the stronger. Christ has "power over all flesh."
John 17:2. "As many as received Him, to them gave He
power to become the sons of God." John 1:12. The prom-
ise is sure. "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
lust of the flesh." There is complete deliverance.

   7. "If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
Note carefully the connection. See how manifest it is that
to be under the law is to be in bondage to the flesh. But
that is to be in a state of war against the law, not of obedi-
ence to it, because "the carnal mind is enmity against God;
for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can
be." Rom. 8:7. Christ has come to save not only those who
know nothing.of the law, and who are known as open sin-
ners—heathen--but those who are in bondage to the law
which they acknowledge, and are vainly striving to keep.
He will deliver such from their bondage to the law to free-
dom in it. Whoever walks in the Spirit, will not be under
the law, and will not be in bondage to the flesh; for "the
law is spiritual." ROM. 7:14.

   LESSON IV.-THE WORKS OF THE FLESH.


                      January 26, 1901.

                       (Gal. 5:16-21, R. V.)


   "But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the
one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye
would. But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under
the law. Now the works of the flesh are, manifest, which
are these, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divi-
Isions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revelings, and such
like; of the which a forewarn you, even as I did forewarn
you, that they which practise such things shall not inherit
the kingdom of God."
                          QUESTIONS.

• 1. What positive assurance have we?—"Walk by the
Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh." How
may we be saved from the lust of the flesh?—"Walk by the
Spirit."
   2. What is sure if we walk by the Spirit?
   "Ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."
   3. How does the flesh regard the Spirit? •
   "The flesh lusteth against [rushes against, strives
against] the Spirit."
   4. How is it with the Spirit?
   "The Spirit [lusteth] against the flesh."
   5. What agreement is there between the flesh and the
Spirit?
   "These are contrary the one to the other."
   6. What, then, is the result when we do not fully yield
to either?
   "Ye can not do the things that ye would."
   7. What is our condition if led by the Spirit?
   "Ye are not under the law."
   8. What can not be hid when they are pr,pent?
   "The works of the flesh are manifest."

    9. What are- they?
   10. Of what are we repeatedly forewarned?
   "That they which do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God."

                            NOTES.

   1. Nate. the deadly opposition between the flesh a•nd the.
Spirit.. So long as there is any compromise with the flesh
on the part of any professed Christians, "ye can not do the
things that ye would." "They that are in the flesh can not
please God." Now recall chapter 3:3 and see that just this
practical instruction is the subject of the epistle all the way
through. The Galatians were not apostates; they had riot
deliberately turned their backs on God and righteousness,
but were still striving to do right. But they were striving to
perfect themselVes by the flesh. They were substituting
their own power for the power of God. This thing is
attempted in these days as much as it was then, and the
danger is the same. That is why the Lord had this epistle
preserved for us. There is absolutely no hope of righteous-
ness through the flesh. No matter.liow good one's desires,
or how earnest the resolves, it is impossible for them to be
fulfilled by means of the flesh.

   2. "If ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
Note the context very carefully. Let all this portion. of
Scripture be indelibly fixed in your mind, and there will not
be the slightest difficulty in seeing that to be "under the
law" is identical with fulfilling the lust of the flesh. It was
from this state that Christ died to redeem us. Chapter 4:4, 5.
in verse 13 we see that the flesh is in sharp contrast with
love, which is the fulfilling of the law. The law is love, but
the flesh is hate and strife. The law. forbids hatred': there-
fore all who are in the flesh are under the law.

   3. The works of the flesh can not be hid; they are mani-
fest. Enumerate them, and study . each word carefully.
Take the word "divisions." How many think it a very
serious matter to get up a division, and to form opposing
parties in society, and even in the church? 'But it is one of
the works of the flesh, and "they which do such things shall
not inherit the kingdom of God.". It is of the same class as
fornication, idolatry, sorcery, "and such like." The student
will notice that the list differs somewhat in the Revision
from that givet in the common version. That is because
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                    15


some of the Greek words may be rendered by several words
which are quite similar. Indeed, the text itself shows that
all the things named are of one class, and the object is not
to give a complete list of the works of the flesh, but simply
to sow their nature.

   4. "The works of the flesh are manifest." They consist in
externals. All that the flesh does, even when it assumes to
keep the law, is for outward show; but this profits nothing,
for God desires truth in the inward parts, and the flesh itself
is sin. There is no hope except in "the hidden man of the
heart, in that which is not corruptible" (1 Peter 3:4), and
the destruction of the flesh, with all its works.

   5. The person who cherishes enmity or jealousy, who
makes divisions, or who is swayed by a spirit of emulation,
desiring to get ahead of somebody else, may be considered
a very • "moral" man as compared with the drunkard, the
adulterer, the murderer, the sorcerer, etc., but he is one of
them, and has no more prospect of inheriting God's kingdom
than they have.

   6. All these are "the works of the flesh." They are com-
mon to all human flesh. Whenever we hear of a gross crime,
we may truly say, "That is what I should be doing if it were
not for the grace of God." Bead Mark 7:21-23. If army
unconverted person has not openly committed all the sins
mentioned here, it is simply because of education, surround-
ings, freedom from temptation, lack of opportunity, or from
cowardice—fear of consequences. The evil is in all human
flesh, and no person can boast over another.

   7. But while there is no hope that anybody can be saved
while still in the flesh, there is the clearest hope that any
may be saved from the flesh. The Spirit is stronger than
the flesh, and Christ has power over all flesh, and if yielded
to, will free us from all iniquity. He "is able to keep you
from falling, and to present you faultless before the pres-
ence of His glory with exceeding joy." Jude 24.

     LESSON V.-THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT.


                      February 2, 1901.

                       (Gal. 5:22-26, R. V.)



   "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-
suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, tem-
perance; against such there is no law. And they that are of
Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and
the lusts thereof. If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let
us also walk. Let us not be vainglorious,• provoking one
another, envying one another."

                          QUESTIONS.

  1. What are tne works of the flesh?
  2. What of those who do such things?
  3. What is the fruit of the Spirit?
  4. With what are these things in harmony?
  "Against such there is no law."
  5. What have those done who belong to Christ?
  "Crucified the flesh."
  6. And what have they crucified with it?
  "The passions and the lusts thereof."
  7. By what do we live?
  "By the Spirit."
  8. By what, then, ought we to walk?
  "By the Spirit let us also walk."
  9. If we walk by the Spirit, in what state shall we.not be?
  "Not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another,
envying one another."

                             NOTES.

   1. Note the contrast between the flesh and the Spirit, not
only in the nature, but also in, the way in which the nature
manifests itself. We have the works of the flesh and the fruit
of the Spirit. The flesh is restless and agitated, always
striving, yet never attaining. It works, but works itself to
death, even while struggling for life. The Spirit is calmness
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                      17

and peace and rest. Its life is as the life of a tree, quietly
bearing fruit to life eternal.

    2. The law is spiritual (Rom. 7:14), therefore it can not
be against the fruits of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit
is the fulfilling of the law, for love sums it all up. Compare
this lesson with chapter 3:21. The law is not against the
promise of God, but is just what God has promised to put
into our hearts, that its fruits may be borne by us.

  3. Each of the words used in describing the fruit of the
Spirit might well be the subject of an entire lesson. Who-
ever studies this lesson exhaustively will find work for many
months or even years. The best we can do, now is but to
make a beginning. Let us make a good beginning.

   4. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none
of His." Horn. 8:9. And if any man have the. Spirit of
Christ, this fruit must be borne. Therefore if any man is
not loving and joyful, if he does not exercise faith, or is not
temperate, he is none of Christ's. But do not let anybody
therefore immediately resolve to be joyful, or to have peace.
This fruit of the Spirit is not worked out;' it comes as a
necessary consequence of yielding to the Spirit. Christ has
left His peace with ns, and God alone can put gladness into
the heart. But it must be there if God reigns there, for in
His presence there is fulness of joy. Ps. 16:11.

   5. "If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk."
But do we live by the Spirit?—Certainly, there is no other
source of life. "The Spirit of God hath made me, and the
breath of the Almighty hath given me life." Job 33:4. "As
God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the
Almighty, who bath vexed my soul; all the while my breath
is in me, and the Spirit of God is in my nostrils; my lips
shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit."
Job 27:2-4. The fact that anybody has 'breath, is reason
enough for him to serve God, who "giveth to all life, and
breath, and all things." Acts 17:25; 1 Tim. 6:17. The fact
that God gives us breath, makes us dependent on Him, and
constitutes His claim on us. Whoever would be independent
of God, must cease to breathe God's breath. But there is
still more in this. We often hear that "while there's life
there's hope;" this is so because life is hope. We live only
by the Spirit; therefore, all we have to do is to yield to "the
18                LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

power that worketh in us" (Eph. 3:20), and the fruit of the
Spirit will be brought forth "above all that we ask or think."
We think that it is easy to do wrong, and so it is; but God -
has made the way of righteousness much e•asier,_ even to the
extent that He is stronger than Satan, and life is stronger
than death.

   6. It is possible for one to live in the flesh and yet be
wholly free from the flesh. See Gal. 2:20. There is no Christ
except the crucified One, and if we are His, it is by being
baptized into His death. nom. 6:3, 4. We are crucified with
Him, but we also rise with Him, to live a new life, even a
spiritual life. He does not raise the flesh—the old man. If
we build up the things once destroyed, we make ourselves
transgressors. But "if Christ be in you, the body is dead
because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteous-
ness." Rom. 8:10. That which is impossible with man is
possible with God, and whatever He has made possible for
us, He has a right to expect to see in us.



LESSON VI.-FULFILLING THE LAW OF CHRIST.


                      February 9, 1901.

                       (Gal. 6:1-5, R. V.)


    "Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye
which are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of meek-
ness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye
one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. For
if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is noth-
ing, he deceiveth himself. But let each man prove his own
work, and then shall he have, his glorying in regard of him-
self alone, and not of his neighbor. For each man shall bear
his own burden."
                         QUESTIONS.
  1. What verses in chapter 5 indicate that the members of
the Galatian churches had begun to quarrel with one
another?
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                     19

   2. What should rather be done even if a brother were in
the wrong?
   3..In what spirit should the brethren proceed to restore
him?
   4. Who only should do this work?
   5. What should they consider? Why?
   6. What should we do for one another?
   7. In so doing what do we fulfil?
   S. When does a man deceive himself? Is such self-
deception common? What is man at his best state? Ps.
39:5. Then what is the case with every ma•n who thinks
himself to be something?
   9. What should every man do to his own work? What
will then be the result? For what purpose should a man
prove himself? 2 Cor. 13:5.

                             NOTES.
   1. Before beginning the study of this lesson, review the
preceding one, and indeed the whole of the fifth chapter
carefully. From the last part it is evident that the Galatians
had begun to quarrel among themselves. They had allowed
themselves to be drawn away from God, and disunion among
themselves must necessarily follow. Having set out to gain
justification by works, they naturally became critical, as
each thought that the other's- works did not reach his
standard. Their mutual criticisms, intended of course to set
one another right, resulted only in mutual provocation to
retort. There were envyings and emulations, and they were
biting and devouring one another. A vainglorious spirit was
taking the place of the meek and gentle Spirit of Christ.
Having seen this from what we have already studied, we can
readily see the pertinence of the exhortation that is given
in the scripture composing this lesson. Study every word of
it most carefully. It is as applicable to us as it was to the
Galatians.

    2. The Bible presents the sinner as sick and bruised.
"The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the
sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in
it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores." Isa. 1:5, 6.
Christ came "to bind up the broken-hearted" (Isa. 61:1); "to
preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to
the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised" (Luke
4:18); and He "went about doing good, and healing all that
were oppressed of the devil" (Acts 10:38). His work is to
20                 LESsoNs IN GALATIANS.

heal and restore. A very tender Physician is He. "A bruised
reed shall He not break, and the dimly burning wick shall
He not quench." Isa. 42:3, R. V., margin.

   3. He says, "As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I
vou." John 20121. All His followers are His ambassadors
(not executioners), praying men in Christ's stead, "Be ye
reconciled to God." 2 Cor. 5:20. He Himself is not sitting
as judge, but as pleader. He "came not to judge the world,
but to save the world." John 12:47. When He is lifted
up, He does not repel, but draws all to Himself. John 12:32.
Consequently, His disciples are, with Him, "to seek .and
to save that which was lost." Luke 19:10. They are to in-
struct in meekness even those who set themselves in opposi-
tion to the truth. 2 Tim. 2:25. Much more, then, are they
to be considerate of a brother who has been pursued by a
fault and has fallen into its power.

   4. The word here rendered "restore" means to adjust, to
set in order. It is used with reference to a. bone that has
been broken—to set it. This reminds us of Ps. 51:8: "Make
me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice." If a brother has fallen and bruised
himself, he is to be treated carefully, so that he may recover.
The carefulness with which a man with a broken leg should
be handled represents the treatment that should be accorded
to one who has fallen into sin.

    5. Who is to restore him?—"Ye who are spiritual." Some
one will say, "But suppose I don't know that I am spiritual?"
Evidently then the thing to do is to find out. If there is
any doubt in the matter, our business . is with ourselves,
rather than with the other man. "But suppose there is no
one in the church who is spiritual; is the erring brother to
be left to go his way without correction?" The question
suggests its own answer. If there is no person spiritual
enough to restore the faulty brother, then it is evident that
all the rest are at fault as well as he, and each needs a per-
sonal work done for himself.

   6. It is plain that the first question for each one to ask
when he sees a brother in error is, "Am I spiritual? Am I
walking in the Spirit?" It can be seen that if the exhorta-
tion of the Spirit through the apostle Paul were followed,
the sight of a brother in the church who has fallen into sin,
would be the signal for a general revival; and it would be
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                     21

strange if, by the time all the rest got into a live spiritual
condition, the specially erring one were not also restored.
But let no unsanctified, unspiritual man presume to try to
restore an erring brother. If he does, the work will be done
in the most bungling manner. Christ said, "For their sakes
I sanctify Myself, that they also might be truly sanctified."
John 17:19, margin.

   7. "In the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou
also be tempted." Remember that no temptation comes to
any one but such as is common to all men. Our brother is
the same flesh as we are, and we are liable to the same sin
that has caused his fall. Christ helps us, because He places
Himself by our side, as sharer of our weakness, and oppressed
by the same temptations. If we would help a sinner, we
can do far more by confessing to him our own weakness,
perhaps our own fall into the very same sin that has snared
him, and telling how the Lord gave us the victory, than we
can by any stern rebuke. He knows that he is a sinner, but
does not know the way out of his trouble. Spend more
lime telling him what he does not know than in telling him
what he already knows.

   8. Christ bears the sin of the world. Whether we acknowl-
edge Him or not, our sins are on Him, and He bears them.
The law is in His heart; it is His life, and it is love: The law
of Christ is that of self-giving. "Love worketh no ill to his
neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." We can
fulfil the law only by coming into "the fellowship of His
sufferings." Christ associates His true followers with Him-
self as saviours of the world. We are, therefore, to bear the
burdens of others' sins in so real a manner as to lift the sins
from their shoulders.

   9. "If a man think himself to be something, when he is
nothing." Better rendered, "though he is nothing." in the-
Greek the participle is used, "If a man think himself to' be
something, being nothing." We are nothing. "Every man
at his best state is altogether vanity." Ps. 39:5. Compared
with God, all nations together are "less than nothing, and
vanity." Isa. 40:17. Therefore, if any man think himself to
be something, he deceiveth himself. That is not the way to
bear one another's burden of sin. Christ, the Sin-bearer,
says, "I Can of Mine own self do nothing." John 5:30. The
thought of the- first. two verses is still continued. We bear
one another's burden of sin,, thus relieving him of it, and
22                 LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


restoring him, by acknowledging in the spirit of meekness
that we are as weak and as helpless and sinful as he is.
This is the only way; it is Christ's way.



      LESSON V11.-SOWING AND REAPING.


                      February 1F, 1901.

                       (Gal. 6 : 6-10, R. V.)



   "Let him that is taught in the Word communicate unto
him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God.
is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
also reap. For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of
the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit
shall of the Spirit reap eternal life. And let us not be weary
in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint
not. So then as we have opportunity, let us work that
which is good toward all men, and especially toward them
that are of the household of the faith."
                          QUESTIONS.
   1. What is the one who receives instruction in the Word.
to do?—"Communicate unto him that teacheth." In what
respect?—"ln all good things."
   2. What warning is given?—"Be not deceived." Why not?
"God is not mocked."
   3. What shall every man reap?
   "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also. reap."
   4. What will a man reap who sows to the flesh?
   "He . . . shall of the flesh reap corruption."
   5. Who will reap corruption?
   "He that soweth unto his own flesh."
   6. What will be reaped by the one who sows to the
Spirit?
   "He . . . shall of the Spirit reap eternal life."
   7. Who will reap life everlasting?
   "He that soweth unto the Spirit."
   S. From what will he reap life everlasting?
   "Of the Spirit."
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                     23


   9. To what does this encourage us?
   "Let us not be weary in well-doing."
   10. What will come in due season?—"Iii due season we
shall reap." On what condition?—"If we faint not."
   11. What should we therefore do?—"Do good unto all
men." Under what circumstances?—"As we have oppor-
tunity."
   12. Who should especially profit by our good acts?
   "Them that are of the household of the faith."

                            NOTES.

   1. There is probably no one who has ever read the sixth
chapter of Galatians who has the slightest doubt that the
exhortations in verses 1, 9, 10 are addressed personally to us,
or that the statement in verse 8 is of universal application.
This should show us that the whole epistle concerns us. The
same conditions exist to-day, and all the instruction is as
applicable to us, and as necessary,- as it was to the Galatians.
The question is between faith which works, and works which
produce nothing, and is as vital a one to-day as it ever was.
   2. "Communicate." Have in common. Compare 1 Con
9:7-14; 2 Cor. 9:1-8. From these it is very evident that the
reference is to the sharing of temporal goods with those
who are instructors in the Word. We do not buy our way
to the favor of God. True giving is the result of the grace
of God already in the heart. The brethren in Macedonia.,
who are presented as models in Christian giving, "first gave
their own selves to the Lord." 2 Cor. 8:1-5. The sacrifices
of God are a broken spirit. Ps. 51:17. When this is present,
God is "pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness." When
this is absent, all gifts are an abomination to Him. - Amos
5:22-24; Micah 6:6-8. True Christian giving,•—giving because
of love of the truth,—is therefore one form of sowing to the
Spirit.
    3. "God is not mocked." The Greek word here rendered
"mocked" is not used elsewhere in the New Testament.. Ti,
means "deceived," thrown off the track, just as our word
"mocked" often does. See Matt. 2:16. Ananias and Sapphira
tried to deceive the Lord, but failed. Acts 5:1-9.
    4. There is great danger of becoming weary in well-
doing, especially when we see no immediate fruit of our
labor. We need to remember how patiently God waits upon
us. He is continually supplying us with good things, yet
very few appreciate His efforts sufficiently to thank Him.
How often we ourselves have murmured when we ought to
24                 LII;SSONS IN GALATIANS.

have been returning thanks! When men treat us with only
a portion of the indifference and disrespect that we show to
God, we say that they are unworthy, and are inclined to do
nothing more for them; but God does not do that way with
us. We are to learn patience from Him.
    5. "In due season we shall reap." "Cast thy bread upon
the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days." Ecci.
11:1. "In the morning sow thy. seed, and 'in the evening
withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not whether shall
prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall lie
alike good." Verse 6. "They that sow in tears shall reap
in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious
seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his
sheaves with him." I's. 126:5, 6. There is no doubt about
the reaping; it is sure. No act of kindness is ever wasted.
God's Word shall not return to Him void, even though many
 to whom it is sent reject it. Christ did not die in vain. He
 gave .Himself for all the world, and none of His love is
 thrown away. Every act done for love of God is sure to
 bear fruit to life eternal.
    6. We are not to be partial in our good deeds. The house-
hold of faith standing nearest, will naturally be the first
partakers of our service, but no opportunity to do good is
to be slighted. Read Matt. 5:43-48. We are' to do good "as
we have opportunity." It is to be considered a privilege,
not a task.
    7. There is no doubt that in these verses the apostle is
speaking of rendering temporal assistance; yet since no
gift is recognized by the Lord unless it comes from the
heart in which His love is shed abroad by the Holy Spirit, -
it is evident that what is said about sowing and reaping
applies to every act of life. He who lives for the flesh, will
reap only corruption; from the Spirit alone can life everlast-
ing come.

   LESSON VI11.-GLORYING IN THE CROSS.


                     February 23, 1901.

                      (Gal. 6:11-18, R. V.)


   "See with how large letters I have written unto you with
mine own hand. As many as desire to make a fair show
in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that
they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. For not
even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the
law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may
glory in your flesh. But far be it from me to glory, save
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the
world .hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcisiou,
but a new creature. And as many as shall walk by this
rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel
of God. From henceforth let no man trouble me; for I.
bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus. The grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren.

                            NOTES.
    1. Paul doubtless, partly at least on account of the weak-
ness of his eyes, was accustomed to dictate his letters to
an amanuensis. This epistle, however, was so important.,
and he was so full of earnestness, that he was obliged to
seize the pen and write with his own hand. If we turn to
2 Thess. 2:2 we shall see that some zealous persons took
advantage of Paul's custom, to write letters in his name,
thus troubling the brethren. This forging of documents
was very common in the first centuries after Christ, for
there were many who wished to go beyond that which was
written by the authority of the Holy Spirit. In the Epistle
to the Thessalonians the apostle told the brethren how they
Could tell whether an epistle was from him or not. "The
salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
                    LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                    27

 in every epistle, so I write." He always signed his own
 name, and wrote the salutation with his. own hand. In
 writing to the Galatians, however, he wrote the whole
  epistle with his own hand, and therefore there could be no
 chance for misunderstanding. No one could say that some
 man's ideas were incorporated along with. Paul's. writings.
  • 2. Circumcision was given as a. sign of righteousness—the
 keeping of the law. Born. 4:11. it was a sign of righteous-
 ness by faith, of course, for in no other way except by
 faith can the law be kept. But the people who were mis-
 leading the Galatians were making it a substitute for faith,
 and so of course they did not keep the law. An outward
 show was all that they desired. They would entice their
 victims with fair words, and afterwards boast over their
 mere formal religion. "Meddle not•with him that flattereth
 with his lips." Prov. 20:19. "A flattering mouth worketh
  ruin." Pros. 26:28.
      3. Compare verse 12 with 5:11. Attempted righteousness
 by works means self-glory and boasting.           Righteousness
  by faith in the cross of Christ means humility and meek-
  ness, the acknowledgment that there is no goodness in the
 flesh. A man can preach "morality" of the highest kind by
  the year, and meet with nothing but approval from all
 classes of men, if he does not preach righteousness through
  the cross. if he assures his hearers that they can do it,
 there will be no persecution; but when he assures them that
  in them is no good thing, and that only through confession
 and self-renunciation and perfect dependence on Christ can
  they. ever attain to any goodness, there will be plenty of
 opposition.
      4. But there is glory in the cross of Christ. It is all
  glory. People talk of the "shadow of the cross," but it casts
 a shadow only in the same way that the sun does. The sun
  is light; from itself alone there comes no shadow; it casts a
  shadow. only when something comes before it. Whenever
 we get out from behind any object interposed between us
  and the sun, we are no longer in the shadow, but only in
• the light. So from the cross itself no shadow comes. The
  shadow comes only from the things which people's unbelief
  has interposed between them and the cross. When they
  cast aside unbelief, and their own works, which are the
  result of unbelief, and come into full view of the cross, they
   find that "the darkness is past, and the true Light now shin-
  eth." 1 John 2: S. Jesus said, "I am the Light of the world;
  he that followeth. Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall
   have the Light of life." John 8:12.
28                  LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

    5. In Christ Jesus only a new creature availeth anything;
and "if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." 2 Cor.
5:17. Then "all things are of God." God's law will, there-
fore, be fully manifested in the life, even as in Christ's life.
It is not our works that save us, but God's own works,
which He has done, and laid up for us. Eph. 2:8-10; Ps.
31:19, 20.
    6. "1 bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus." The
Greek word rendered "marks" is the plural of "stigma,"
which we have incorporated into our own language. It was
used specially of marks pricked or branded into the skin of
a slave, to show to whom he belonged. Paul was- crucified.
with Christ, and so bore the marks of the cross. The word.
"stigma" has with us the idea of shame, and so the cross
was considered. The slave who had any fineness of feeling
would naturally wish to conceal the evidence of his servi-
tude. But the Christian will glory in that which shows that
he is indissolubly linked to Christ. Let none presume to
trouble such an one, for his MaSter will protect him.



         LESSON IX.--GENERAL REVIEW.

                        March 2, 1901.


   We have now devoted eight months to the study of. the
Epistle to the Galatians, and should, in that time have
acquired a thorough acquaintance with it, since we have
had an average of less than one verse a day. It ought, there-
fore, to be a pleasant task to review the whole epistle in
one lesson. It is self-evident that if this is done no one can
stop to go into details. That has been done in preceding
lessons, and it is to be supposed that our knowledge of
details is now sufficient to enable us to take in any chapter
or even almost the whole epistle at a glance. It is to be
hoped that the interest aroused by this study is so great
that every one will make the epistle the subject of much
more study in the time to come:
                       QUESTIONS.
    1. What important truths are mentioned in the saluta-
tion?

this epistle.
 Lessons from Malachi.
   The name Malachi is a contraction of Malachijah, mean-
ing "Messenger of Jehovah." The term indicates the
prophet's office, rather than. his name. He was Jehovah's
last inspired messenger among the prophets of that age to
announce the coming of God's great messenger. He reproves
certain sins in the close Of that age, which are paralleled by
the same sins in the close of this age. The date was about
B. C. 420 to 390. His work followed that of Nehemiah. The
grand scope of the book will be developed in our study of
its lessons.



         LESSON• I.-UNHOLY OFFERINGS.

                        March 9, 1901.
                         (Mal. 1:1-14.)


                         QUESTIONS.

final sentence upon those who continue to regard Him with
such disrespect? Verse 10. Note 5.
   14. Where does the Lord declare His name will be hon-
ored? Verse 11. • Note 6.

                           NOTES.

    1. "Israel." Israel is a comprehensive term, including all
God's people. The study of the book 4vill show that the
general term at the beginning includes not alone the peo-
ple of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, but all who have
come in among God's people from the Gentiles. See Ilona.
9:6-3; Eph. 2:11, 12, 19, 20; 3:6.
    2. "Jacob—Esau." It is not of the individual men, but of
the characters represented by these men, that the prophet
speaks. Despite all Jacob's imperfections, .he believed God,
and longed to be like Him. He finally obtained the victory,
and became prevailer with God. His character was manifest
in his descendants. God hated the selfish character- of Esau,
who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, whose
descendants exercised intense hatred toward their brethren
and rejoiced in their downfall. God loves the sinner that
He may save him, but He hates of necessity the sin, and the-
character that is formed by cherishing sin. These men stand
as types of characters in all ages—the one of the imperfect
man who desires to reform, and does so by God's grace; the
other of those who despise God's blessings and reject His
character.
    3. "In that ye say." They probably did not say it in
words, but their deeds spoke more loudly. If it was worthy
only of their poorest offering, of their unclean bread; surely
it was contemptible and unclean. We have considered some
of these verses out of order, so as not to repeat the same
thoughts, but it is well to note the • repetition. It shows
how emphatically and clearly the Lord reveals their sin.
   4. "Entreat the favor of God." God reproved that they
might . repent. It was not in His plan that they had failed
                  LESSONS FROM MALACHI.                  33

and their trouble had come upon them. It was all by theii
means, and God could no•t accept of half-hearted service.• '
The repentance must be deep and. lasting.
   5. "Oh, that there were one among you!" The Lord
longed for one brave man, according to the Revised. Version,
who would rise up and close the house of God against the
unholy, polluted, imperfect offerings, which were degrading
God before the eyes of all that saw. God did not accept the
imperfect, cheap offerings, and the fire upon His altar was
kindled in vain.
   6. "My name shall be great.'-' (Margin.) God's name will
be honored. He desires that it shall be honored by the holy,
faithful, earnest, true lives of His people. If they will not
do this, His name will not the less be honored. He will get
honor from their unfaithfulness. He desired to be honored
by Pharaoh's conversion, but Pharaoh would not have it
thus, so God used his overthrow to honor Him. He longs
to get honor and spread abroad His name through His peo-
ple's success, but if He can not do this, He will get glory
through their downfall.
                 SUPPLEMENTARli QUESTIONS.
   When was it that Edom was beaten down? What, kind.
of offering does the Lord desire? What kind, of offering
did He make for us? If we have only the lame, yet give our
best, will Ite not accept it? What is the state of our piety
when the regular service of God becomes a "weariness"?

    9. What had the Lord done to save His honor? In what
proportion had Tile done this? What evil thing does He
mention? Verse 9.

equality and God's impartiality? How, then, ought man to
treat his fellow? What do those do who deal treacher-
ously with their brethren? Verse 10. •
   11. What has. Judah done? What was in Israel and
Jerusalem? In what particulars? Verse 11. Note 2.
   12. What will the Lord do to the man who thus separates
from Him? Verse 12.
   13. What hypocrisy did Judah and Israel show in their
sins?. How does God regard it? How does He receive their
offering? Verse 13.
   14. What question do they ask in their blindness? What
specific sin does the Lord point out? For what purpose was
the wife given? Verse 14. Note 3.
   15. How did God make man and woman? Why? To
what should every one give heed? What should not be
done? Verse. 15.
   16. What two things does God here say that He hates?
What warning- does He repeat? Verse 16.       •
   17.. How had their words affected the Lord? Why? In.
what two things had they especially sinned? Verse 17.
                           NOTES.
   1. "0 priests." This Chapter is especially addressed to
priests; but because of this no one need give it away. God
designs that His people-all of them-should be priests unto
                   LESSONS FROM MALACHI.                    35

the world. "And He made us to be a kingdom, to be priests
unto His God and Father." Rev. 1:6, R. V. "But ye are an
elect race, a royal priesthood, . . . that ye may show
forth the excellencies of . Him who called you out of
darkness into His marvelous light." 1 Peter 2:9, R. V. And
this was God's design with Israel of old. "And ye shall be
unto Me a kingdom of priests." Ex. 19:6. All God's chil-
dren should be priests to the world, ministering the grace
and knowledge of God to the needy. And the world has a
right to expect this of them.
   2. "Abomination is committed." The Lord counts Him-
self as husband to His people. See Jeremiah 3, especially
verse 14; Rom. 7:4. He takes poor humanity in their vile-
ness, gives them His own royal name, and His glorious robes
of righteousness. When those who have been thus honored
depart from Him and unite with another, they are as truly
committing adultery as is a Woman who leaves her own law-
ful husband to become the wife of another, When the
church unites with the state, she is profaning God's holiness
and committing abomination.
   3. "Thy companion." God did not give man a wife, to
satisfy his lust, nor to be his slave or servant, nor to occupy
an inferior position, even though a different one. The orig.
final expression is "a help, meet for him," one fitted to be
his companion in a noble service for God and humanity.
Husband and wife are to be one, but neither he nor she is
to be the one. Both are to blend in one purpose, in one life,
 out neither to be the slave of the other.

                          QUESTIONS.

    1. Whom does the Lord promise to send? What would
he do? Who would come? Where would He come? What
is He called? How is He regarded? What is again said of
this Messenger of the covenant? Verse 1. Note 1.

       3. As what shall He sit? Whom will He purify? How
  thoroughly? What will be the result? Verse 3.
       4..How will the Lord regard these righteous offerings?
  Verse 4. See Lev. 9:22-24. •
  •    5. In what also will He come near? Against what class
  will He be a witness? What kind of witness? Of what
• are all these transgressions? What is His rule of witness •
  and judgment? Verse 5.
  •    6. What only has saved the wicked from destruction?
  Verse 6. Note 3.
       7. What had the people done? For how long? What
  invitation does the Lord give? What promise does He
  make? What question is asked by•the disobedient? Verse 7.
       8. What solemn question does the Lord ask? What
  statement does He make? How does unbelief again ques-
   tion? How does the Lord reply? Verse S.
       9. What is the result of robbing God? How many are
  affected? Verse 9. Note 4.
      10. What duty does the Lord urge? Why? What does
  He ask us to do as respects Himself? With what are we to
  prove Him? What will He do if thus proved? How great
  will be the blessing? Who says this? Is His word good?
  Verse 10.
      11. What will He rebuke? For whose sake? What
  further promises does He make? Verse 1.1..
      12. What will be the ultimate results of such blessing?
  Who thrice declares all these promises? Verse 12.

                            NOTES.

    1. "My messenger." Christ's messenger, John the Bap-
 tist. Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27. "The Lord, whom ye seek."
 Jesus Christ, the Desire of all nations. "Come to His tem-
 ple." Including all His first craning, to the temple at Jeru-
 salem, to the people of God, to the sanctuary on high,
 where Ile ministers Hies own life for His people, and con-
 firms His covenant in every soul that accepts. "Behold, He
 cometh." His second coming, including the work of judg-
 ment, when He comes before the Father, as well as His
 appearing in glory.
    2. "Abide." No one, save only in Christ's righteousness,
 may abide that day, or stand before Him 'acquitted in the
 jud‘gment. That they may do it then, He. is now like a
 refiner's fire to burn away all dross, like soap to cleanse.
                  LESSONS FROM MALACHI.                    87

He is not only the fire through His Spirit, but He watches
over the process, that the fire may not be too fierce, and yet
that the dross may be consumed. "A refiner." When the
refiner of silver can see his own image perfectly reflected
in the molten metal, the silver is pure. So Christ waits, yea,
even kindles the furnace fires, that the dross ma•y be con-
sumed. "Sons of Levi." God's own spiritual priesthood,     a
which Levi was a type.
   3. "Therefore." It is because God does not change,
because "His mercy endureth forever," that men are spared
in their sins. Not until there is no hope, till the sinner
identifies himself with the Sin, dbes the sinner die.
    4. "The curse" is not an arbitrary curse pronounced upon
the disobedient. It inheres in the very transgression itself;
and it keeps back the blessing of God, not alone from the
transgressors, but front those associated with them in
church capacity. They are diseased members, affecting the
whole body, and not until they are separated or healed will
the blessing of God come in its fulness.
                  SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS.
   How much is a tithe? To whom does the tithe belong?
God tests man in respect to time and means. What is a
test with respect to time? What in respect to means?
Where is the tithe to be brought? If after we have paid it
honestly, it is wrongly used, shall we lose the blessing?
What is the tithe?—A debt we owe? a self-assumed obliga-
tion? or God's share in the revenue of our partnership with
Him?

                           NOTES

   1. "It is vain." This is the sight of the fleshly eye, the.
worldly view, the darkness of unbelief. David said that he
was envious when he saw the prosperity of the wicked, until
he went into the sanctuary of God, where he looked at
them as the Lord saw them; then he saw their latter end.
"Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and prolong his
days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that
fear God; . . . ' but it shall not be well with the wicked."
Righteousness is always gain, even though it seems to end
in defeat. It is not y et revealed what the children of God
shall be, but we know that when He shall appear, we shall
be like Him. They are here now, but they are not revealed.
What they suffer makes it seem as though they were counted
as sheep for the slaughter; but in all these things they are
more than conquerors through the love of Christ.
   2. "Healing in His wings." From the time of Adam the
race has deteriorated, and God's people have gone down in
death through wasting disease, starvation, and in every con-
ceivable ill way; but when Christ comes, He will heal all
these defects and restore man to his normal size and beauty.
   3. "Leave them neither root nor branch." God gives to
                   LASSONS FROM MALACHI.                    39

all existence and life that He may be glorified. His glory is
always for His creatures' best good. If man will not use
God's life aright, he will revert to his original elements, the
dust of the earth. They who have triumphed over and
oppressed the good have perished with the sin they have
chosen; sin can not exist in the unveiled presence of God
when He comes into His own, and they perish in the burn-
ing glory of His presence. Satan, the root of all, and the
wicked, the branches, perish forever in what they have
chosen.
   4. "Remember ye." The law of Moses for all Israel, with
the statutes, would include all typical offerings, all the
truths connected with the sanctuary, and the significance of
the ceremonies, as well as the nature of the moral precepts.
Rememioering this would lead to the development of all the
truth of the great threefold message of Revelation 14. It
would show the service of the Levitical priesthood to be no
meaningless service, but replete with Gospel truth, a service
unto the shadow and example of heavenly things.
    5. "I will send you Elijah." "But did not God send
Elijah in John the Baptist?"—Yes, in a sense. Matt. 11:14;
17:10-12. But John declares that he was not Elijah. John
1:21. What, then, are we to understand?—Simply this:
Elijah in this work of reform was a type of John, who went
before Christ "in the spirit and power of Elias." Luke 1:17.
But the "great and terrible day of the Lord" did not then
come, save to that one people as a nation. All these were
types of the great and terrible day of the Lord upon. the
world. We have in Elijah's time the apostasy of Israel
through the influence of Jezebel, a sun-worshiping Zidonian.
We have the antitypical Jezebel in the great apostate church.
We have the union of 'that ,church with the state, even as
Jezebel with Ahab. There is demanded the spirit and power
of Elijah to reprove of sin, preach again God's down-
trodden truth, be very zealous for His law, and reprove
the sun-worshipers of Baal. These will be manifest, not
through one person, to one country, but through all God's
true people to the world.
