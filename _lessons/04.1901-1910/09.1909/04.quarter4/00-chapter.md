Recommendations on Sabbath-School Work Passed by the
     General Conference, May 13 to June 6, 1909.



    1. Whereas, The Sabbath School Worker is a molding factor
in our Sabbath-schools, and it is the medium whereby Sabbath-
school laborers are kept in touch with progressive methods; there-
fore,
    We Recommend, That earnest efforts be made to place this
journal in the hands of every officer and teacher in our Sabbath-
schools.
             Sabbath-School Home Department.
    2. Whereas, The Home Department of the Saboath-school
has been established to meet the needs of our people who are
isolated from those of like precious faith ,. as well as those whom
circumstances prevent from attending the, local school; therefore,
    We Recommend:
    (a) That the conference workers be urged to cooperate with
onf secretaries by strengthening this work by securing the names
and addresses of all isolated Sabbath-keepers within' their ter-
ritory, that they may be brought in touch with the progress .
of the message.
    (b) That we urge the carrying forward of this work more
fully in our local schools, thus bringing the vitalizing power of
the Sabbath-school lessons to the whole - denomination.
            Sabbath-School Offerings to Missions
    3. Whereas, Our Sabbath-schools need the blessed inspiration
of a real burden for mission fields, while opportunities to spread
the message in foreign lands are multiplying faster than their.
means; therefore,
    We Recommend, That our Sabbath-schools give all their do-
nations to missions, providing for their expenses in some other
way; and, further,
    We Recommend, That each conference pay the entire expenses
of the Sabbath-school departmental work without drawing upon
the Sabbath-school offerings given by the schools for missions.



   Four Sabbath-schools were held during the General Conference.•
   The largest attendance was 1;840. The total amount of gifts
to missions was $597.06.

           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                             Notes.
    1. Jesus does not force the Gospel upon any. The Gadarenes
being indifferent to the Gospel, He left them and went to the
other side of the Sea of Galilee, near Capernaum. Here the
people were more willing to hear His words. But the man
whom He had healed He left as a witness of His work in Gadarn.
    2. -When Jesus was on earth, none were ever turned away empty
who came and asked help of Him. He deeply sympathized with
this father in his trouble, and responded at once to his request
for help. "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for-
ever." Heb. 13:8. A. R. V. Jesus is just as' Willing to-day
to help those who are in trouble and who call upon Him in
faith, as when He walked the shores of the Galilee.
    3. "It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must be-
lieve in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which
embraces Him [Jesus] as a personal Saviour; which appro-
priates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith, as an opinion.
Saving faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ
join themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith
is life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding
trust, by which 'the soul becomes a conquering power."—"Desire
of Ages," page 347.
    4. The American Revised Version reads, "And . straightway
Jesus, perceiving in Himself that . the power proceeding from
Him had gone forth, turned Him about in the crowd, and said,
Who touched My garments?" Though she was unnoticed by
men, the Saviour recognized the touch of faith from this poor
woman. It is even so now. The touch of faith still brings healing
from disease, healing from sin.
     5. "Talitha Cumi.— This is mere Syriac, the proper trans-
lation of which the evangelist has given."— Dr. Adam Clarke.
    6. Note the power which is in the words of Christ. " Such
is the Gospel call to those who are by nature dead in trespasses
and sins, and can no more rise from that death by their own
 power, than this child; and yet the command, Awake, and arise
 from the dead, is neither vain nor in vain; there follows im-
 mediately, Christ shall give thee light."—Tfenry and Scott.
     7. The Lord here gives us an example of hOw He desires
 to cooperate With us in helping others. He raised the girl to
 life; this was something the parents could not do. He might
 have given her food also, but this He asked them to do.

  20. If the people did not receive them, what were
they to do? What would be the result of rejecting the
gospel message sent? Verses 14, 15.
                              Notes.
    1. The limit of what God can do for us is simply the limit
of our faith. "And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All
things are possible to him that believeth." Mark 9:23. A. R. V.
    2. He [Jesus] wished to be saved from all unnecessary pub-
licity, that He might the more effectually prosecute His ministry,
and so avoid unnecessarily awakening the opposition of the Jews;
but such a light could not be hid."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    3. "Light comes to the soul through God's word, through
His servants, or by the direct agency of His Spirit; but when
one ray of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing
of the spiritual perceptions, and the second revealing of light
is less clearly discerned. So the darkness increases, until it is
night in the soul. Thus it had been with these Jewish leaders.
They were convinced that a divine power attended Christ, but
in order to resist the truth, they attributed the work of the
Holy Spirit to Satan. In doing this they deliberately chose de-
ception; they yielded themselves to Satan, and henceforth they
were controlled by his power." `Desire of Ages," page 3'2.
    4. "Jesus had now been among the people long enough to
see their wretched condition spiritually, to detect their misdi-
rected yearnings, and their dissatisfaction with the religious in-
struction they were receiving, and also to discover the entire
unfitness of their teachers for the work of instruction and saving
them. They were like sheep, incapable of caring for themselves,
but capable of being turned and led into right ways. But who
should do all this? An extensive harvest waited to be garnered,
but who shall do the work' Very few were able to engage in it.
The Lord of the harvest alone could raise ❑p and send forth
the needed laborers."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    Now, as then, the people are without a shepherd, and the very
last hours of probation are drawing near. The harvest of
the earth is nearly ripe, and is soon to be gathered. In a special
sense should the people of the Lord earnestly pray at this time
that the Lord of the harvest will raise up laborers and send
them forth into the field to give the last call of salvation,/
    5. "Peace,,among the Hebrews, had a very extensive meaning
— it comprehended all blessings, spiritual and temporal. To
wish peace to a family, in the name and by the authority of
Christ, was in effect a positive promise, on the Lord's side, of
            SABBATH-SCHOOL UESSON QUARTERLY                     11

all the good implied in the wish. This was paying largely
even beforehand. If the house be worthy — if that family shall
be found lto- be proper for a preacher to lodge, in, and the master
ready td embrace the message of salvation, your peace, the bless-
ings you have prayed for, shall Come upon, the family; God will
prosper them in their bodies, souls, and substance."— Dr. Adam
Clarke.

   14. When Jesus had finished this instruction to His
 disciples, what did He do? Matt. 11.: 1.
                            Notes.
   1. Daily the servant of the Lord should be studying the great
themes of the Gospel, and filling the mind with the mighty
truths of God's word. Then when asked fora reason of his faith,
whether before judges or councils, or whether in trial by the
adversary of our souls, the Holy Spirit will bring to the mind
the very promises of the Word that are needed. To bring to
our remembrance the words of the Lord is the work of the
Holy Spirit. John 14:26.
    2. The martyrs have not all been burned at the stake nor
have they all died in dungeons. Some are in homes suffering for
the truth's sake. As a result ,of obeying God and walking in
the light, wives have borne persecution from husbands, and bus-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    13
hands from wives, and parents from children. To stand true
to God under such circumstances takes a martyr's spirit and a
heart made strong by the love of God. Though the Gospel is a
Gospel of peace to those who receive it, its rejection often causes
suffering and sorrow. But the Lord admonishes His people under
all circumstances to stand without wavering. Those who as
good soldiers endure to the end will be saved.
    3. God's greatness is seen in His care for the most minute
objects of His creation as well as in making and upholding
worlds. Not a sparrow is uncared for by Him. If one falls, He
sees it. Even the hairs of our head are numbered! This reveals
a most wonderful and intimate knowledge of God concerning us.
Small comfort this for hypocrites and lukewarm professors; but
for the trusting child of God it brings peace, and banishes from
the heart all needless anxiety and worry. "Casting all your
care upon Him, for He careth for you." 1 Peter 5:7.
    4. To save man Jesus gave up all. Phil. 2:5-8. To follow
Jesus we also must give up all. "In this way, then, every one
from ainong you who is not bidding adieu to all his own. goods
can not be My disciples." Luke 14:33.— Rotherhant's Translation.

                            Notes.
   1. "The Herod who killed John the Baptist was not Herod
the Great who built the temple and slew the children of Beth-
lehem. Herod Antipas was the son of Herod the Great by
Malthace, a Samaritan. His father had originally destined him
as his successor in the kingdom, but by the last change of his
will, appointed him 'tetrarch of Galilee and Perea' (Matt. 14:1;
Luke 3:19; 9:7; Acts 13:1; Luke 3:1.) He first married .a
daughter of Aretas, King of Arabia Petra a, but after some time
he made overtures of marriage to Herodias, the wife of his half-
brother, Herod Philip I, which she received favorably. Aretas,
indignant at the insult offered to his daughter, found a pretext
for invading the territory of Herod, and• defeated him with
great loss."—"Smith's Bible Dictionary." Art. Herod.
   2. "The place of John's imprisonment was the castle of
Machwrus, a frontier fortress between Perea and Arabia, and
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     15
where all the transactions of the following narrative tool- place."
—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    3. Sinners do not like to be reproved for their wrong-doing,
but John dealt faithfully with sin wherever found. He did
not spare even the king.
    4. 'Herod's birthday — either the day on which he was born
or the day on which he began to reign; for both were termed
birthdays. '—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    5. "The word 'charger' formerly signified a large dish, bowl,
or platter."—Id. ,
       "For the sake of thousands who in after years must pass
from prison to death, John was to drink the cup of martyrdom.
As the followers of Jesus should languish in lonely cells, or
perish by the sword, the rack, or the fagot, apparently forsaken
by God and man, what a stay to their hearts would be the
thought that John the Baptist, to whose faithfulness Christ
Himself had borne witness, had passed through a similar ex-
perience."
    "Not Enoch, who was translated to heaven, not Elijah, who
ascended in a chariot of fire, was greater or more honored than
John the Baptist, who perished alone in the dungeon."—"Desire
of Ages," pages 224, 225.

  17. 'Where did they land? What blessings did Jesus

                             Notes.
   1. The "desert place" to which Jesus retired for rest was not
a barren, desolate region. Matthew tells us there was grass there
(Chap. 14:19), John says there was mueh grass (Chap. 6:10),
and Mark says that the grass was green (Chap. 6:3,9). They
went to a quiet, sparsely populated region to be away from the
people, in order that they- might find needed rest.
    2. The Saviour had been performing miracles throughout the
day. His question was doubtless intended to try Philip's faith,
and to see whether he and the other disciples had paid proper
attention to the miracles which they had already witnessed, and
to direct their attention in a special manner to the great miracle
He was about to perform.
    3. Five loaves and two fishes seemed but little. Philip
said, "What are they among so many?" But Jesus said, "Bring
them hither to Me." Matt. 14:18. He was able to feed the
multitude with the little they had. We may learn a lesson from
this. Our talents may be meager, but if we bring them to Jesus
He can use them, and multiply bread for the hungry multitude
who are perishing for the bread of life.
    "Gather up the fragments that remain." Though able to
create bread by a word, Jesus taught them a striking lesson in
carefulness and economy.
    4. "The Jews had often suffered by famine in those times
in which their enemies were permitted to prevail over them; but
finding that Jesus had such power as to multiply a few loaves
to feed thousands, they took it for granted that while He was
at their head no evil could possibly happen to them, and there-
18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

fore were determined immediately to proclaim Him king. Our
Lord- perceiving this, either by some words which—they--had
dropped or by His penetration of their hearts, retired—befere
the project had been-fully-formed,-or• could be put-into-execu-
tion."Dr. Adam Clarke.
    5. The life of Jesus was crowded with labor and responsi-
bility as no other life has ever been• yet He took time to pray.
Read Mark 1:35; Luke 5:15, 16;' 6:12. "In Christ the cry
of humanity reached the Father of infinite pity. As a man He
supplicated the throne of God, till His humanity was charged with
a' heavenly current that should connect humanity with Divinity.
Through continual communion He received life from God, that He
might impart life to the world. His experience is to be ours."
—"Desire of Ages," page 863.
    6. Jesus came to His disciples "in the fourth watch of the
night." The fourth watch began at 3 A.M.
    7. "It is I; be not afraid." It is thus that Jesus ever seeks
to comfort those who are buffeted with the storms of this life.
To every troubled heart He says, "I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world."
    8. Notice Peter's words, "If it be Thou." They express
doubt. Jesus had just said He was present, but Peter could not
understand .how He could be there, or how He could walk on
the water. But "if it be Thou," if You are really here, Lord,
prove it; let me also walk on the water. To anxious, doubting
Peter the Lord gave the required evidence.
    9. So long as Peter kept his eyes on the Saviour, he walked
on the water. But when he began looking at the other disciples,
and on his surroundings, he began to sink. It is ever .so in our
experience.
   10. The disciples had forgotten the miracle of the loaves. How
quickly we too forget the wonderful providences of God in our
behalf, and grope in doubt and unbelief.

                             Notes.
   1. Having seen His wonderful miracle, the people were follow-
ing Jesus hoping to receive some temporal benefit. But je'sus
sought to turn their minds away from the perishing things of life
by pointing them to the true bread, which if they would eat,
they would live forever,
   2. ''They had already seen the miracle of the five loaves, and
did not believe; and it was impossible for them to see anything
more descriptive of unlimited power and goodness. Even miracles
themselves are lost on persons whose hearts are fixed on the per-
           . ABBATH-SCTIOOT, 'LESSON QUARTERLY'                  21
 ishing things of the world, and whose minds are filled with
 prejudice against the truth. Their argument seemed to run thus:
 Thou hast, we grant; fed five thousand men with five loaves and
 two small fishes; but what is . this in comparison with what
 Moses did in the desert, who for forty years fed more than a
 million persons with bread from heaven? Do something like this,
 and then we will believe on Thee, as we have believed on Moses."
•— Dr. Adam Clarke.
     3. "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to
 receive Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our
 sins, and that we are complete in Him."—"Desire of Ages,"
 page 389.
     4. "The words I have spoken." John 6:63, A. R. V. Not
 some new point of doctrine I am about to reveal, but the words
 I have just spoken concerning My being the living bread, they are
 eternal life. There is eternal life abiding in these words for us
 at this time.
     5. "By the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples were
 still further alienated from Jesus. They were greatly displeased;
 and wishing to wound the Saviour and gratify the malice of the
 Pharisees, they turned their backs upon Him, and left Him with
 disdain. They had made their choice,— had taken the form with-
 out the Spirit, the husk without the kernel. Their decision was
 never afterward reversed; for they walked no more with Jesus."

                               Notes.
    1. From the questions of these scribes and Pharisees, it seems
 plain they came to Jesus to find fault, and to seek to entrap
 Him in His talk, that they might have something whereof to
accuse Him before the rulers at Jerusalem.
     2. These words of Christ apply with equal force to the tradi-
 tions of the "fathers" to-day as to those then held by the Jews.
 Of man-made traditions, Jesus said, "Every plant which My
 heavenly Father bath not planted, shall be rooted up." To ob-
 serve such traditions, the commandment of God must be set
 aside. How literally is the fourth commandment of the law set
'aside to-day, that a tradition of the "fathers," with much re-
 ligious zeal and devotion, may be observed! All such worship
 Christ declares to be "in vain." "The words of Christ were
 an arraignment of the whole system of Pharisaism. He declared
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

that by placing their requirements above the divine precepts, the
rabbis were setting themselves • above God."—"Desire of Ages,"
 page 397.
    3. " ' They [the disciples] neglect only a ceremony introduced
by men,' retorted Jesus; 'but how conies it that you, who know
the law, transgress commands which are not of man, but from
God Himself? How comes it that, for the sake of traditions
invented by the rabbis, you set aside the most explicit commands
of God? He has, for example, said that we must honor our
father and mother, and support and care for them in old age.
He has declared it worthy of death for any one to deny his par-
ents due reverence, or to treat them harshly or with neglect. But
you have invented a doctrine which absolves children, in many
cases, from this commandment. "If any one," says your tradition,
"is asked by his parents for a gift or help, for their benefit, he has
only to say that he has vowed that very part of his means to the
temple, and they can not press him further to contribute to their
support." How cunningly have you circumvented God's law!
How easy is it for any one to break it, and affect a zeal for re-
ligion in doing so!' "— Geikie's "Life of Christ," Vol. 1, p. 197.
    4. From this point on until the close of Jesus' ministry,
He sought not public places; but, through the hatred of the
Pharisees, was driven to th more secluded sections of the
country. But His fame had spread throughout all the region
round about, and all who came to Him for relief from the heavy
biirdens of sin and physical suffering, were tenderly received by
Him, and healed of their infirmities.
    5. "Jesus received the importunities of this representative of .a
despised race in the same manner as the Jews would have done;
this was not only to prove the faith and sincerity of the woman,
but also to teach His disciples a lesson of mercy, that they might
not be at a loss how to act in similar cases after Jesus should
leave them and they could no longer go to Him for personal
counsel. Jesus designed that they should be impressed with the
contrast between the cold and heartless manner in which the
Jews would treat such a case, as evinced by His reception of the
woman, and the compassionate manner in which He would have
them deal with such distress, as manifested by His subsequent
granting of her petition in the healing of he- daughter."—"Spirit
of Prophecy," Vol. 2, page 802.

                               Notes.
    1. The disciples should have recalled at this time how, on a
 former occasion, Jesus, by blessing a few loaves and fishes, fed
 the five thousand. But they did not. "Again the disciples re-
 vealed their unbelief. At Bethsaida they had seen how, with
 Christ's blessing, their little store availed for the feeding of the
 multitude; yet they did not now bring forward their all, trusting
 His power to multiply it for the hungry crowds. Moreover, those
 whom He fed at Bethsaida were Jews; these were Gentiles and
 heathen. Jewish prejudice was still strong in the hearts of the
 disciples, and they answered Jesus, 'Whence can a man satisfy
 these men with bread here in the wilderness?' "—"Desire of
 Ages," page 405.
     2. Magdala was on the west side of the sea, in Galilee itself.
 In this country Jesus had performed His most remarkable
 miracles, and He was well known. He again meets the cold un-
 belief of the scribes and Pharisees, in marked contrast to His
 welcome among the heathen people about Gadara and in the
 coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And He remained only a short time in
 this place.
     3. " As the preaching of Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites,
 so Christ's preaching was a sign to His generation. But what
-a Contrast in the reception of the word! The people of the
 great heathen city trembled as they heard the. warning from God.
 Kings and nobles humbled themselves; the high and the lowly
 together cried to the God of heaven, and His mercy was granted
 unto them." "Every miracle that Christ performed was a sign
 of His divinity. He was doing the very work that had been fore-
 told of the Messiah; but to the Pharisees sthese works of mercy
 were a positive offense."—"Desire of Ages," page 406.
     A most profitable lesson is furnished the last generation in
 the answer Christ gave the unbelieving Pharisees. That genera-
 tion' lived in the blazing light of truth taught by the divine Son
 of God Himself, and thus enjoyed what kings and prophets of for-
 mer generations had longed to see and hear, but had not. Through
 hardness of heart, these glorious truths were rejected. So now,
 through the third angel's message, light is shining from God's
 word in almost dazzling brightness. When men turn from truth,
 there is nothing more that heaven can do for them. 'When the
 message of truth is presented in our day, there are many who,
 like the Jews, cry, Show us a sign. Work us a miracle.'           To
 such is applicable what Jesus said to the Pharisees in the parable
 of the rich man and Lazarus: "If they hear not Moses and the
 prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from
 the dead." Luke 16:31.

                              Notes.
   1. Jesus no doubt expected at this time to see in the hearts
of His disciples some evidence that they truly grasped His di-
vine mission. The shadows of the cross were beginning to fall
upon His pathway. His disciples had witnessed many of His
mighty works, and their interpretation of what He had said about
the leaven of the Pharisees was evidence that they but faintly coin-
30          SABBATH-SCHOOL UESSON QUARTERLY .

 prehended who was daily in their presence. They failed to grasp
 and hold the truth that they had with them the Creator of all
 things — Him who had only to "speak" and it "stood fast."
 Jesus apparently from this time on sought especially to impress the
 disciples with His divine mission, thus preparing them for the
 dark scenes of His trial and crucifixion which were just before
 Him at Jerusalem.
     2. Jesus approached the question of His divine Sonship with
 great caution. He knew that upon this question hung the destiny
 of a world; that around this truth the storm of the ages was
already gathering, and would soon burst in relentless fury. Satan
 had assailed this point in the wilderness of temptation with,
"If Thou be the Son of God.'' Jesus knew His foe, and the
strength of the temptation awaiting the disciples upon this point.
 He desired to prepare them for it while He was still with them.
    3. "From the first, Peter had believed Jesus to be the
Messiah. Many others . . . now doubted that Jesus was the
Messiah for whom they had looked so long. Many of the disci-
ples who had ardently expected Jesus to take His place on David's
 throne, left Him when they perceived that He had no such in-
tention." "On this day, before they were brought face to face
with the great trial of their faith, the Holy Spirit rested upon
them in power. For a little time their eyes were turned away
from 'the things which are seen,' to behold 'the things which are
not seen.' Beneath the guise of humanity they discerned the
glory of the Son of God."— "Desire of Ages," pages 411, 412.
    4. "Upon this rock.— This true confession of thine, that I am
the Messiah, conic to reveal and communicate the living God, that
the dead, lost world may be saved — upon this very rock, Myself,
thus confessed (alluding probably to Ps. 118:22 and Isa. 28:16)
will I build My church, My assembly, My congregation, that is,
of persons who are made partakers of this precious faith. Jesus
Christ did not say, on thee, Peter, will I build My church, but
changes immediately the form of expression, and says, upon that
very rock, to show that He neither addressed Peter nor any other
of the apostles."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    " 'Thou art Peter.' " Petros in Greek, Cephas in Aramaic.
. . . 'And upon this rock [Petra] I will build My church.
Petros usually means a stone, a piece of rock; Petra, the rock in
mass, the foundation rock.' "—Peloubet.
    e
    ThAmerican Revised Version reads, "And I also say unto
thee, that thou art Peter [Greek Petros, margin], and upon this
rock [Greek, Petra, margin] I will build My church; and the
gates of Hades shall not prevail against it."
    "Peter was not the rock upon which the church was founded.
The gates of hell did prevail against him when he denied his
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     31

Lord with cursing and swearing. The church was built upon
One against whom the gates of hell could not prevail."—"Desire
of Ages," page 413.
   5. "The keys of the kingdom of heaven" are the words of
Christ. All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here
included. These words have power to open and to shut heaven.
They- declare the conditions upon which men are received or re-
jected. Thus the work of those who preach God's word is a savor
of life unto life or of death unto death.. Theirs is a mission
weighted with eternal results.
    The Saviour did not commit the work of the Gospel to Peter
individually. At a later time, repeating the words that were
spoken to Peter, He applied them directly to the church. And
the same in substance was spoken also to the twelve as representa-
tives of the body of believers. If Jesus had delegated any
special authority to one of the disciples above the others, we
should not find them so often contending as to who should be
the greatest. They would have submitted to the wish of their
Master, and honored the one whom He had chosen."—Id.
   6. This rebuke of Christ's reveals still more clearly that Peter
was subject to strong delusions from the enemy, and therefore
could not be — which many desire to make of him — the rock
on which Christ built His church. Before the interview was really
over in which Christ commended Peter for His statement con-
cerning the Sonship of his Master, the Lord found it necessary to
rebuke him by saying in the presence of the other disciples, "Get
thee behind Me, Satan." Jesus recognized the deceiver working
through Peter, hence the rebuke.



    LESSON X.— The Trans figuration; Healing of
                  a Demoniac.
                      DECEMBER 4, 1909.

   PARALLEL SCRIPTURES: Matt. 16:28 to 17:21; Luke 9:27-45.
   LESSON HELPS: "Desire of Ages," chapters 46, 47; "Spirit
of Prophecy," Vol 2, chapter 28; Sabbath School Worker.
   PLACE: Probably Mt. Hermon. "The reasons for believing
that some part of Hermon was the scene of the transfiguration are:
(1) Jesus and His disciples were in this vicinity within a week of
the transfiguration. (2) Mark 9:30 represents Jesus as passing
32         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

through Galilee after the scene on the mount,' as if He had been
within its limits; while Tabor, the only other site suggested, is
within Galilee. (3) It was a high mountain, more than four
times as high as Tabor. (4) 'It was well suited for the scene by
its height, seclusion, and snowy splendor.' (5) There is no au-
thority in the tradition which favors Mt. Tabor. (6) Tabor
had a Roman fortification and town upon its top in the time of
Christ. "= Peloubet.

was His reply? Verses 11-13. Compare Matt. 17: 10-13;
Luke 1 : 13-17.
                 HEALING OF A DEMONIAC.

Him? What reply did Jesus make? Verses 28, 29.
Note 7.
                             Notes.
   1. This statement of Jesus that some of those present should
not taste of death until they saw the kingdom of God come, no
doubt referred to the Transfiguration. Here was given a repre-
sentation in miniature of the future kingdom and home of God's
people. Jesus, the King, was seen in His glory, Moses stood as
a representative of the resurrected saints (Jude 9), and Elijah
of those who will be translated at the coming of Christ. 1 Thess.
4:16, 17.
34          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   2. "The cares and troubles of his [Peter's] wandering life,
and all his gloomy forebodings for his Master and himself, had
faded away before such brightness and joy, and, in his fond,
childlike simplicity, he dreamed of lengthening out the delight."
— Geikie.
    Jesus does not desire that His people shall live in solitude
like monks. He desires that they mingle with the world lost in
sin, and carry to the people the glad news of salvation.
    3. "Questioning one with another what the rising from the
dead should mean." Had the disciples not been filled with' their
own false notions, they would have believed the words of Jesus,
and His meaning would have been clear. This explains why many
fail to understand the scripture.
    4. "The words of Christ pointing to His death, had brought
sadness and doubt. And the selection of the three disciples to
accompany Jesus to the mountain had excited the jealousy of the
nine. Instead of strengthening their faith by prayer and medi-
tation on the words of Christ, they had been dwelling upon their
discouragements and personal grievances. In this state of darkness
they had undertaken the conflict with Satan."—"Desire of
Ages," page 430.
   5. The Revised Version reads, "And Jesus said unto him, If
thou canst! All things are possible • to him. that believeth."
Rotherham's Translation reads, "And Jesus said to him, As for
this, 'if it be possible to thee,' Why! all things are possible to
him who has faith."
    "If thou canst." Jesus repeated the words of the father
in gentle rebuke for his unbelief, and then encouraged him to
believe.
    6. Note the words, "Enter no more into him." Jesus does
not intend that our victories over Satan shall be only temporary.
    7. "This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and
fasting." It requires a special struggle to overcome some of
our besetting sins. But when we become sufficiently earnest in the
work of gaining the victory over our shortcomings that we will
with continued prayer and fasting seek the Lord for victory, we
shall obtain it.

   15. What should ever be our attitude toward others?
Verse 10.
                             Notes.
   1. It was because the disciples were at strife among them-
selves as to who should be greatest, that the real truth concerning
the events to transpire at Jerusalem was hidden from them.
They might have known, but they still held to the Jewthh idea
that the Messiah must establish a temporal kingdom at Jerusalem.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     37
They were so busy with anticipation as to their own future place
of authority in the hew administration of affairs, that they had
no desire for the unwelcome truth Jesus began to unfold to them
regarding His sufferings and death.
    2. "Peter saw in the collector's question an insinuation touch-
ing Christ's loyalty to the temple. Zealous for his Master's honor,
he hastily answered, without consulting Him, that Jesus would
pay the tribute. But Peter only partially comprehended the pur-
pose of his questioner. There were some classes who were held
to be exempt from the payment of the tribute. . . . In the days
of Christ the priests and Levites were still regarded as especially
devoted to the temple, snit were not required to make the annual
contribution for its support. Prophets also were exempted from
this payment. In requiring the tribute for Jesus, the rabbis were
setting aside His claim as a prophet or teacher, and were dealing
with Him as with any commonplace person. A refusal on His
part to pay the' tribute would be represented as disloyalty to the
temple; while, on the other hand, the payment of it would be
taken as justifying their rejection of Him as a prophet. Only
a little before, Peter had acknowledged Jesus as the Son of God;
but he now missed an opportunity of setting forth the character
of his Master. By his answer to the collector, that Jesus would pay
the tribute, he had virtually sanctioned the false conception of
Him to which the priests and rulers were trying to give currency."
—"Desire of Ages," page 433.
    This tribute money should not be confounded with the Roman
taxes. It was levied by the Jewish rulers upon their own people
for the support of the temple and its service. For instruction to
Christians regarding the support of civil powers, see Rom. 13:1-6.
    3. "If Jesus had paid the tribute without a protest; He would
virtually have acknowledged the justice of the claim, and -cycloid
thus have denied His divinity. But. while He saw good to meet
the demand, He denied the claim upon which it was based. In
providing for the payment of the tribute He gave evidence of His
divine character. It was made manifest that He was one with
God, and therefore was not under tribute as a mere subject of the
kingdom."—"Desire of Ages," page 434.
  • 4. Self-seeking, born of selfishness, is sure to cause offense.,
 Christ's example condemns this spirit in all His followers. "In
honor preferring one onother," is the standard for the Christian
believer. "Lucifer had said, 'I will be like the Most High;'
and the desire for self-exaltation bad brought strife into the
heavenly courts, and had banished a multitude of the hosts of
God. Had Lueifer really desired to be like the Most High, he
would never have deserted his appointed place in heaven; for the
Spirit of the Most High is manifested in unselfish ministry. Lu-
38          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
cifer desired God's power, but not His character. He sought for
himself the highest place [the very thing the disciples at this
time were doing], and every being who is actuated by his spirit
will do the same. Thus alienation, discord, and strife will be
inevitable."—"Desire of Ages," page 435, 436.
    5. "Men often part with some member of the body, at the
discretion of a surgeon, that they may preserve the trunk, and
die a little later; and yet they will not deprive themselves of a
look, a touch, a small, pleasure, which endanger the eternal death
of the soul." "We must shut our senses against dangerous ob-
jects to avoid the occasions of sin, and deprive ourselves of all
that is most dear and profitable to us, in order to save our souls, •
when we find that these dear and profitable things, however in-
nocent in themselves, cause us to sin against God, or lead our
hearts away from Him."— Dr. Adam Clarke.

rebuke them? What did He say He had come to do?
Verses 54-56.
                             Notes.
    1. The world is the one lost sheep of the universe. To save
the world, cut off as it was from heaven by sin, Jesus gave His
life. For every sinner, therefore, there is hope. However far
we may have strayed from the fold, we can be assured that the
great Shepherd of the sheep is seeking for us.
    2. "Go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone."
"If he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more."
The Lord desires that alienation between brethren and all dif-
ficulties in the church should be kept within as small a circle
as possible. "An earnest effort should be made in every church
to put away evil-speaking and a censorious spirit as among the
sins productive of the greatest evils in the church. Severity and
fault-finding must be rebuked as the workings of Satan. Mutual
love and confidence must be encouraged and strengthened in the
members of the church. Let all, in the fear of God and with love
to their brethren, close their ears to gossip and censure." "If
a brother is supposed to have erred, his brethren and sisters
should not whisper it among themselves and comment upon it,
magnifying these supposed errors and faults. Much of this work
is done, and the result is, the displeasure of God Tests upon those
who do it, and Satan exults that he can weaken and annoy those
who might be strong in the Lord."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, pages
609, 615.
    3. The Lord here clearly teaches the necessity of maintaining
the purity and order of the church. The place for heathen men
and publicans is outside, not inside, of the church. When they
have been separated from the church, our duty, then, aS Christians
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      41
is to continue to labor for their conversion that they may be con-
verted and again brought into the church from which they have
been separated.
     Some claim that to disfellowship a member is the spirit of the
 Papacy. While it is possible to do the right thing in an arbitrary
manner, disciplining church-members because their lives are a re-•
 proach to the church, is just the reverse of the work of the Papacy.
 The papal church, so far as we know, does not discipline mem-
 bers because they practise sin.
     "He who is unforgiving, cuts off the very channel through
 which alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not
 think that unless those who have injured us confess the wrong,
 we are justified in withholding from theM our forgiveness. It is
 their part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and
 confession; but we are to have a spirit of compassion toward those
 who have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess their
 faults. However sorely they may have wounded us, we are not to
 cherish our grievances, and sympathiie with ourselves over our
 injuries; but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses against
 God, we are to pardon all who have done evil to us."—"Mount
 of Blessing," pages 158, 159.
     4. If the church on earth follows the instruction of Christ in
 dealing with offenses, we are assured that the decision will be
 ratified in heaven. This is a serious thought for the church itself
 as well as for the offending members.
     5. "Every one who has been free to condemn or discourage,
 will in his own experience -be brought over the ground where he
 has caused others to pass; will feel what they have suffered be-
 cause of his want of sympathy and tenderness."—"Mount of
  Blessing," page 185.
      6. We, like the servant in the parable, because of sin were ten
  thousand talents in debt. But when we came to Jesus and asked
  forgiveness, He freely forgave us the whole debt. The offense of
  those who may have done us wrong is but a hundred pence .as
  compared with our debt to God. If. the Lord has so freely for-
  given us the ten thousand talents, ought we not freely to forgive
  the hundred pence? Every truly forgiven soul will forgive_,
  others. "-But--if-ye_forgive not-men their- trespasses, neither
-will-your heavenly Father forgive - your - trespasses.    Matt:- 6:15
      7. " The people refused to receive Him [Jesus], because He
  was on His way to Jerusalem. This they interpreted as meaning
  that Christ showed a preference for the Jews, whom they hated
  with intense bitterness. Had He come to restore the temple and
  worship upon Mount Gerizim, they would gladly have received
   Him; but He was going to 'Jerusalem, and they would show Him
   nohospitality."—"Desire of Ages," page 487.

                              Notes.

    1. Jesus no doubt saw that this offer to follow Him was
prompted by a desire for personal gain. In placing before
him His own poverty and sacrifice to save man, He revealed the
life of toil and sacrifice of all who truly follow Him.
    2. This does not seem to be a request simply to attend the
funeral of a father, then dead. The father might live for years.
But when the fathe  r    dies, and the estate is divided, and all
temporal matters fixed up, then the son will follow the command
to go and preach the Gospel. All this, and more, seems to be
implied in this answer. Temporal things first; spiritual things
secondary. Many to-day are making the same mistake.
    3.. Worse than Sodom! And why? Simply because they re-
jected the message of light and salvation sent to them.. No
more forceful statement could be made of the terrible conse-
quences of failing to receive_the Gospel and to walk in the light.
    4. While the people of these cities were generally impenitent,
yet, three of the disciples—Philip, Andrew, and Peter — came
from Bethsaida, upon which a woe is here pronounced. John 1:44.
"More tolerable," If we are lost, our condemnation in the
Judgment and final punishment will depend upon the amount of
light we have rejected.
    5. How many there are, who, like the lepers, receive blessings
continually from the hand of the Lord, and yet fail to return and
give thanks to Him. Israel-of 'old-"
which-had-done great - things -in Egypt." --instead-they-44-riTur---
mured-in-their ' tents,-and` hearkened- -not -unto -the-vaice-lof-the-
Lord:"-
    " If we would give more expression to our faith,' rejoice
more in the blessings that we know we have,— the great mercy and
love of God,— we should haye more faith and greater joy. No
tongue can express, no finite mind can conceive, the blessing
that results from appreciating the goodness and love of God.
—"Ministry of Healing," pages 252, 253.
