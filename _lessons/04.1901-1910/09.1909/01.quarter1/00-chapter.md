                              Notes
    1. " The chief city of Eastern Macedonia was near the Thracian
border, on a fertile plain between two mountain ranges. It
derived its name from Philip of Macedon, who took it from the
Thracians, B.C. 358, strongly fortified and garrisoned it, and re-
sumed the working of the gold mines near it. The town had
been called Datum, and still earlier Crenides, 'fountains,' from!
its copious springs. Philippi was the 'first' city reached after
leaving its seaport Neapolis (Acts 16:12, B. V.), northwest
of which it lay, at about ten miles distance, by the Via Egnatia,
a paved Roman road over a steep height called Symbolum. On
the plain of Philippi was fought the famous battle in which
Brutus and Cassius were overthrown by Octavius and Anthony,
B.C. 42. Later, when Octavius had become the Emperor Augustus,
he transported Roman citizens to Philippi and made it a 'colony'
—a miniature Rome, where Roman laws, customs, and language
prevailed, the people were governed by their own magistrates, and
possessed the rights of Roman citizens."—"Bible Dictionary,"
American Tract Society, Art, "Philippi."
    The principal facts which throw light on the epistle to the
Philippians are found in the epistle itself, in the sixteenth chap-
ter of Acts and in 2 Cor. 8:1-5. In Luke's narrative we learn
that Philippi was "the chief city of that part of Macedonia,
and a colony." Acts 16:12. By the term "colony" is meant
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

that the city was founded, or at least occupied, by Roman citizens,
who had gone there under the direction of the Roman Govern-
ment, and who possessed all the privileges of the inhabitants of
the city of Rome.
    2. Satan could not allow the work to go on unmolested. He
sought to bring it into disrepute by identifying his own work
with it. The damsel who followed Paul and Silas, saying, "These
men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us
the way of salvation," is said to have been possessed with a
"spirit of divination," margin "python." She was doubtless
a priestess of the Pythian Apollo, whose chief temple and oracle
was at Deft hi. To this celebrated oracle people flocked to re-
ceive information, just as people now go to consult noted Spir-
itualist mediums. The damsel was really a Spiritualist medium,
whom Satan controlled, and through whom he worked. The
effect of her testimony concerning Paul and Silas, though the
exact truth, would be to cause people who wereorably  av       im-
pressed with their preaching to think that they were in harmony
with her. Paul's rebuking her was in harmony with his injunc-
tion, "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of dark-
ness, but rather reprove them." Eph. 5: 11.
    3. The miracle which Paul wrought deprived the men of the
gain which came to them through the girl's soothsayings. This
 enraged them against Paul and Silas. On a later occasion, at
Ephesus, a great uproar was made against Paul and his fellow
laborers, by men who thought that their gains were endangered.
Observers of the signs, of the times can not fail to see that this
spirit still is working. Paul and Silas had not, troubled the
 city. They had gone quietly about their own work, and all the
 trouble had been caused by the men who had brought the ac-
 cusation. Satan always charges upon the servants of Christ the
 trouble which he himself originates.

   14. In so doing, what words of Paul were they ful-
filling? 2 Cor. 1: 3-6.
                                Notes
    1. ''Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved." We must accept perfect belief on the Lord Jesus Christ
as the all-sufficient means of salvation. We are saved by faith, not
by works. The reason so many speak disparagingly of simple be-
lief; saying, "It is all right to believe; but we must do some-
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        7
thing, as well," is because they fail to realize the wonderful
comprehensiveness of Bible belief. Believing, in the Bible sense,
includes doing. When Christ was asked by the Jews what they
should do in order to work the works of God, He replied, "This
is the work of ' God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath
sent." John 6:29. This shows that there is no danger of anti-
nomianism in real faith. Paul says that faith establishes the
law. Rom. 3: 31. Faith is the substance of things hoped for.
That is, everything good that we desire, we may have through
faith. It is faith which brings strength out of weakness, and
light out of darkness, and works of righteousness in the place of
disobedience. Let no one decry faith in Christ, but let all seek
to know what it is in truth.
     2. "Paul and Silas felt that to maintain the dignity of Christ's
church, they must not submit to the illegal course proposed by the
Roman magistrates. The apostles were Roman citizens, and it
was unlawful to scourge a Roman, save for the most flagrant
crime, or to deprive him of his liberty without a fair trial and
condemnation. They had been publicly thrust into prison, and
now refused to be privately released, without proper acknowledg-
ments on the part of the magistrates.
     "When this word was brought to the authorities, they were
alarmed for fear the apostles would make complaint of their
unlawful treatment to the emperor, and cause the magistrates
to lose their positions. They accordingly visited the prison, apolo-
gized to the apostles for their injustice and cruelty, and them-
selves conducted them out of the prison, and entreated them to
 depart out of the city. Thus the Lord wrought for His servants
 in their extremity."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," page 79.
     3. "And when they had seen the brethren, they comforted
 them, and departed." What a wonderful lesson these words
 contain! One would naturally think that Paul and Silas, after
 the shameful and cruel treatment that they had received, were
 the ones to be comforted. But no; they had received their com-
 fort already. They had been sharers in the sufferings of Christ,
 and He had borne their sorrow for them. As God had given them
 comfort, they, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God
 (1 Peter 4:10), ministered the same comfort to others. From
 this we may learn that the proper way to use trials is not to
 mourn over them, burdening others in our efforts to obtain
 sympathy, but to take- the increase of krace which God always
 gives in tribulation, to those who will receive it, and thereby
 be able to testify to others with greater confidence, of the good-
 ness of God.

     LESSON I11.— Paul's Desire for .the Church.
                     Phil. 1:1-11.
                  JANUARY 16, 1909.
    GENERAL NOTE.—"In this epistle to the Philippians Paul
commends their Christian zeal and firmness under persecution,
informs them of his own temporal and spiritual condition, and
of the progress of Christianity at Rome, gratefully acknowledges
their continued affection to him, and the receipt of their gift
by favor of Epaphroditus; exhorts them to unity and to a
lowly and unselfish life, like Christ's (Phi]. 2:1-8); warns them
against Judaizing teachers and the example of worldly men
(Phil. 3:1-19). This epistle, written by Paul while a prisoner
at Rome, A.D. 62 or 63, is remarkable for its Christian joy and for
the warm affection the apostle shows for the Philippian con-
verts (Phil. 4:1). It contains important teaching as to the
humiliation and exaltation of Christ (Phi]. 2:5-11), and the
resurrection of believers (Phil. 3:21). The Philippine Christians
are reminded that as believers in Christ they partake of a dignity
and privileges far more exalted than those belonging to them as
Roman citizens (Acts 16:12), and are exhorted to live worthily
of their heavenly citizenship (Phil. 3:20; 1:27)."—"Bible
Dictionary," American Tract Society, Art., "Philippians."
                           Questions.
   1. Whom does Paul associate with himself in his
salutation to .the Philippians? What does this indicate?
Phil. 1: 1, 2. Note 1.
   2. To whom was the epistle addressed? Verse 1.
   3. What is the office of a bishop? Titus 1: 5-7 ;
compare 1 Tim. 3 : 1, 2. Note 2.
    4. With what feeling did Paul always remember the
Philippians? Phil. : 3, 4.
   5. Por what was he thankful on their behalf? Verse 5.
   6. Of what was he confident? Verse 6. Note 3.
   7. Why was it fitting that the apostle should have
this thought of the Philippians? Verse 7.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      9

    8. How were they partakers with him in his bonds?
2 Cor. 8: 1-4.
    9. Of what did Paul tell them that God was record,
or witness? Phil. 1: 8.
  10. What was the burden of his prayers for the Phi-
lippians? Verse 9.
  11. What may we learn by comparing verses 1 and 9?
Ans.— That the fact that people are saints in Christ
Jesus does not prove that they have reached the highest
state of perfection. Saints are to grow in grace.
   12. What is the proper condition to be in when Christ
comes? Phil. 1: 10. Note 4.
   13. With what did the apostle pray that the. Philip-
pians might be filled? By whom does the fruit of right-
eousness come? Verse 11.
   14. Who only can bring forth good fruit? Luke 6: 45;
John 15 : 5.
   15. What must we receive before we can bring forth
the fruit of righteousness? Rom. 5: 17.
                           Notes
   1. In this epistle Paul associates Timothy with himself. In
the salutation of nearly all of Paul's epistles, some one is asso-
ciated with him. This does not indicate that those mentioned
had any share in writing the epistle, but simply that they joined
in the greeting to the brethren. The epistle is written by Paul.
    From the preceding lessons we have learned of the establish-
men of the church at. Philippi. The epistle to them makes known
to us when and why it was written. It was when Paul was a
prisoner at Rome. A. peculiar bond of sympathy existed between
Paul and the Philippian brethren, because they had been par-
takers in the same afflictions which Paul suffered in bringing the
gospel to them (Phil. 1:28-30), and because they alone had at-
tended to his physical necessities (Phil. 4:15). So when they
heard that Paul was in prison in Rome, they sent Epaphroditus,
a prom1nent member of the church, with things necessary to Paul's
comfort. While there, Epaphroditus had been sick near unto
10        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

death. See Phil. 4:18; 2:25, 26. It was by him, after his
 recovery, that Paul sent his letter to the Philippians, which is
remarkable for the spirit of love and tenderness that breathes
through it.
    2. In the Bible, the words "bishop" and "elder" are syn-
onymous. See Titus 1:5-7, where both words are used. The
word "bishop" is from a Greek word signifying to look over,
to stand guard as a sentinel. It is in the same sense that the
word "overseers" is used in Acts 20:28, where we read that
Paul told the elders of Ephesus to take heed to the flock over
which the Holy Spirit had made them overseers. The idea of
being overseers of the flock suggests shepherds; and in 1. Peter
5:1-4 we find that the elders are called under-shepherds, Christ
being the Chief Shepherd. An elder who realizes that his duties
are those of a shepherd will know that neither harshness nor
negligence are to he among his characteristics.
    3. "Being confident of this very thing, that He which hath
begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of
Jesus Christ." The fact that the geiod work had been begun
by the Lord was the ground of Paul's confidence in this matter.
"Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it." See
1 Thess. 5:23, 24. A work that is begun by man, that rests upon
human power, will surely come to naught, no matter how good
an appearance it presents for a season. Christ is the only sure
foundation. He is able to complete everything that He begins;
and this thought, coupled with the fact of His willingness, as
shown in His beginning the work, should beget the same con-
fidence in all who have given themselves to Him.
    4. The word "sincere" means pure, clear, unmixed. The
Greek word from which it is translated has the signification of
tested by the sun, as the sun shining through a substance/is the
test of whether or not it is pure, or has an admixture/of some
foreign substance. A Christian who is sincere, is unalloyed.

   15. What did he say concerning his spiritual relation-
ship Gal. 2 : 20.
                             Notes
                        •
    1. "And we know that all things work together for good
to them that love God." The superficial observer might fail to
see the fulfilment of this in the case of Paul. The trouble is
that' too many in reading the text think only of selfish good.
They do not_ realize that everything is good which tends to the
advancement of the cause of Christ. And when one has accepted
12        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

God's will as his will, and realizes that God is ordering all his
ways, he knows and feels that nothing but good can come to
him. This is the only sure preventive of complaining at one's
lot, and worrying over the future. Paul's cruel treatment at
Philippi would have been called by some the worst thing that
could happen to him; nevertheless, if it had not been for that,
perhaps the jailer and his family would not have beard the
gospel. It worked to the good of the jailer, and then to the
honor of Christ, and this was good to the apostle, who had no
ambition but to honor his Master.
    2. There were two classes of people who preached the gospel
in Rome, as a consequence of Paul's imprisonment there. One
class was moved by a sincere love for the truth, the other by
envy. But Paul did not waste time in mourning, and thinking
that the work was all going to pieces. He knew that be himself
was only a servant, and that the Master was competent to care
for His own work. He knew that the truth would triumph, even
if he should die.
    3. "For me to live is Christ. and to die is gain." noSe
who understand this verse as if it read, "For to me to liVe is
Christ, and to die is gain to me," can have but a very imperfect
conception of the spirit of the great apostle to the Gentiles. To
read such an idea into the verse is to do violence to the whole
passage. Even if we knew nothing of Paul's character but what
we find here, we might learn that he had no thought of per-
sonal gain (even if that could be secured by death), but only
of gain to Christ. The whole passage is full of expressions of
desire for the advancement of the cause of Christ. Paul's im-
nrisonment has resulted in the furtherance of the gospel, and
he reioices. knowing that he is set for the defense, not of him-
self, but of the gospel. in verse 20 be says that his earnest
expectation and here is that Christ should be magnified in his
body, whether by life or by death. How forced and unnatural.
then. the supposition that in the very next sentence he should
break the continuity of his thought, and speak about his death
being a grin to himself! No; Paul was ready to die "for
the name of the Lord .Tesus" (Acts 21:13), and as his whole
life was given to Christ, his only thought of death wis that
it might also tend to advance the cause.

guage? 2 Cor. 5: 4. Note 1.

cution? Acts 5 : 41.
                               Notes
    1. The passage in Phil. 1:22, 23 is parallel to 2 Cor. 5: 1-4,
in which three different conditions are brought to view, by the
expressions, "in this tabernacle," "unclothed," and "clothed
upon." There can be no question but that being "in this
tabernacle" signifies our present life, when we, as Paul says
in Phil. 1:24, ''abide in the flesh." Compare 2 Peter 1:13, 14.
The condition of being ''clothed upon" is the state wherein
mortality is "swallowed up of life"; and that is at the coming
of the Lord and the resurrection, when this mortal puts on im-
mortality, and death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Cor. 15:51-54.
When we put on immortality, we are "clothed upon with our
house which is from heaven,"which is eternal. Consequently,
the ''unclothed" state must be the time between the putting off
of ''this tabernacle" (compare 2 Peter 1:14) and the putting
on of the house from heaven. In other words, it is the state
of death. But the apostle says that while we groan to be re-
leased from the burden of "this tabernaele,"— this infirm flesh,
— we do not groan to be "unclothed," that is, to die, but rather
to be ''clothed upon." That is, the object of the Christian's
longing is not death, but ,the coming of Christ. And since, also,
none can be with Christ except at His coming, it is evident that
when Paul said that he had a desire to depart and be with Christ,
he did not long for death, but for the time of the resurrection
of the dead and the translation of the living.
    2. The word "conversation," in every place where it occurs
in the Bible, has either an entirely different, or else a far wider
signification than the one now commonly given to it. In Ps.
37:14; 50:23 it means "way," as the margin indicates, and as
the Revised Version hai it. In Gal. 1:13 it is evident that the
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    15

word means Paul's whole course of life as a Jew. In Eph.
2:3; 4:22 it also means "manner of life." This is the most
common meaning of the word. The Greek word from which it
is translated is the same that is rendered "behave" in 1 Tim.
3:15. In Phil. 3:20 the word "conversation" means "citizen-
ship." We are to be strangers and pilgrims on this earth,
having our citizenship in heaven, whence we look for the Lord
Jesus. In Phil. 1:27 the American Revised Version has "manner
of life," and the margin gives the reading, "behave as citizens,
worthily." The idea is the same, and is in harmony with the
statement in Phil. 3:20. Our citizenship being in heaven, our
continuing city is there, and there our names are entered on the
great register. Therefore, our manner of life should be such as
becomes those who say that they seek such a country. In other
words, we should live as citizens of heaven. This present world
is not the Christian's country. Heb. 13:14.

Rev. 5 : 6-14.
                            Notes
    1. "If there be therefore any consolation in Christ." The
exhortation which these words introduce is evidentlyl a conclusion
from what has gone before. The idea is that through persecution
the Philippians have been brought to understand the consolation
there is in Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit. And now,
by the strength of that consolation and fellowship, they are
exhorted to be of the same mind. Compare chapter 1:27. The
word "if" does not imply any doubt about there being conso-
lation in Christ, or fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 1:3-5) ; but
the apostle would make the well-known fact a strong incentive to
unity. Since they all receive consolation from Christ, whose
sufferings they share, and have the fellowship of the same
Spirit, they must be of the same mind.
    2. ''Look not every man on his own things, but every man
also on the things of others." Phil. 2:4. The sense of the
verse is very forcibly expressed in the Syriac Version, thus: "And
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    17

let not each be solicitous (only) for himself, but every one
also for his neighbor." Compare 1 Cor. 12:25.
    3. The true idea of the text is more clearly set forth in the
American Revised Version: "Have this mind-in you, which was
also in Christ Jesus; who, existing in the form of God, counted
not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,
but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant." The idea
is that while Jesus, having the form of God, had also equality
with God, He did not count that position a thing to be grasped
or held to, while He saw men going to perdition without hope.
He could not enjoy the glory of heaven without trying to save
fallen man. This is the perfect example of unselfishness. He
desired not simply His own welfare, but that of others; He
found His highest joy in contributing to the joy of others. This
enables us to understand what Christ means when He says,
"Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." It means that the
faithful servant will have the joy that Christ has in seeing the
happiness of souls who have been brought to that happiness
by means of his self-denial.
    4. These expressions, "That at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow" and "every tongue should confess" are
fulfilled when the wicked gather about the New Jerusalem, at
the close of the thousand years. Here the coronation of the Son
of God takes place in the presence of the assembled universe.
The Father presents in panoramic view the history of the greai
conflict between good and evil, and each beholds just that part
in the drama he has acted. "As if entranced, the wicked have
looked upon the coronation of the Son of God. They see in
His hands the tables of the divine law, the statutes which they
have despised and transgressed. They witness the outburst of
wonder, rapture, and adoration from the saved: and as the
wave of melody sweeps over the multitude without the city, all
with one voice exclaim, 'Great and marvelous are Thy works,
Lord God Almighty: just and true are Thy ways, Thou King
of saints; and falling prostrate, they worship the Prince of
life."—"Great Controversy," pp. 668, 669.

result? John 12: 32.



LESSON VI11.— Faithful Servants. Phil. 2: 17-30.
                 FEBRUARY      20, 1909.

                                Note
    When Paul wrote the epistle to the Philippians, he was in
prison, awaiting his trial. Epaphroditus had come from Philippi
with assistance for him, and while waiting on him was taken
sick. Paul's anxiety was not for himself, but for the brethren
in Philippi, not only for their spiritual welfare, but because of
their anxiety about Epaphroditus. So he sent him back, although
he really needed his help, and designed, moreover, to send Timothy.
But he did not yet know how it would go with him at his trial.
He might be put to death, he might have a little respite, or he
might be set at liberty. As soon as he should find out how his
case would turn, he would send Timothy, thus parting from his
dearest friend and helper.

22         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                              Notes
    1. The word " dog" is used in the Bible as a term of re-
proach, to signify a shameless, corrupt person. See Rev. 22:15.
    2. From the matter-of-course way in which the apostle goes
on to explain what the concision is,'as contrasted with that which
is only outward, we conclude that by the word " concision " he
means "circumcision." This was a term used synonymously with
Jews, but is here used with special reference to those Jews who
trusted in circumcision as the means of justification. These were
classed with dogs and evil workers, as equally dangerous, for
they would turn all who listened to them away from the sim-
plicity of the gospel, a proceeding classed with the beguiling of
Eve by the serpent. 2 Cor. 11: 3, 4.
    3. " Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
righteousness which is' in the law, blameless." Besides his birth
and his orthodox training, the two points above mentioned were
perhaps the things upon which Saul, the Pharisee, depended most
for salvation. Believing that the traditions of the fathers were
the commands of God, he was "more exceedingly zealous" for
them than any other man in the nation. Therefore the more he
persecuted those who opposed traditions, the more favor he
thought he was finding with God. Then, too, he was a Pharisee
of the strictest sect. That is, he was most punctilious in the
outward observance of the law. But when he saw the righteous-
ness of the law as it is in Christ, he acknowledged that all the
self-righteousness upon which he had been building his hopes
of salvation was so far short of perfection that it was suf-
ficient to condemn him; and he gladly counted it worse than
useless, that lie might receive the free gift of Christ's perfect
righteousness.




 LESSON X.— The Heavenly Calling. Phil. 3: 7-14.

    3. Why was his own righteousness worthless? Rom.
8: 3, 8; Isa. 64 : 6.

    5. What does the Lord require of us? Ps. 51: 6.

   12. What is assured to those who know the fellowship
of Christ's sufferings? Phil. 3:10, 11. See also Rom.
8 : 17.
   13. Did Paul count his victory gained? - Phil. 3:12,
13. Note 4.
   14. When only will the warfare end? 2 Tim. 4 : 6-8.
   15. What did Paul forget? Phil. 3 : 13. For what
was he continually reaching? Verses 13, 14.
   16. What is the calling of God in Christ Jesus 1
1 Cor. 1 : 9 ; 1 Thess. 4 : 7 ; 1 Peter 1 : 15.
                            Notes
   1. The fact that Paul counted all his own righteousness as
worthless that he might win Christ, is evidence that there was
nothing in it that would in the least help him in the way of
salvation. As he wrote to the Romans, there is no difference
between Jew and Gentile; no one has anything that will com-
mend him to the favor of God.
   2. The righteousness which is by faith of Jesus Christ is
that perfect righteousness which the law requires, but which
24        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
it can not give to any man. This righteousness God gives freely
to those who have true faith in the blood of Christ. See Rom.
3: 21-25. When it is imputed, it not only cancels the sins of
the past, so that they are no longer counted against the sinner,
but it changes the man, making him righteous, so that, out of
the good treasure of his heart, he may bring forth that which
is good.
    3. There is nothing that so much exalts the law of God as
the plan of salvation through faith in Christ. The fact that
righteousness must be received as the free gift of God, shows
that the righteousness of the law is perfect; that it is far above
human grasp.. There can be no true morality without faith in
Christ.
    4. "Not as though I had already attained, either were already
perfect." .The thing to be attained is in the preceding verse
said to be the resurrection of the dead. The Christian life is a
continual but victorious struggle unto the end. No matter how
exalted a man's position or how great his attainments in holi-
ness, he is never in this life beyond the necessity of patient
continuance in well-doing. There is always before him the pos-
sibility of still higher attainments.



LESSON XI.—The Heavenly Citizenship. Phil. 3: 15-21. .
                   MARCH 13, 1909.

know and have? Phil. 3 : 8-10.
    2. Did he count himself as having reached perfec-
tion? Verse 12.

Lord, have in the course which he was pursuing Phil.
3 : 17.
     7. Would he have us follow him regardless of Christ?
1 Cor. 11: 1; Eph. 5 : 1; 1 Thess. 1: 6.
    8. What necessity is there for taking note of 'those
who walk 'according to the rule set forth by Paul.?
Phil. 3 : 18, 19.
     9. Instead of minding earthly things, what should
we mind? Col. 3 : 1, 2 (margin).
   10. Why should we do this? Phil. 3 : 20. Note.
   11. If our citizenship is in heaven, how shall Ave hold
ourselves as relates to this world? 1 Peter 2 : 11 ; Heb.
11: 13-16.
   12. How did David, in the height of his power, re-
gard himself? Ps. 39 : 12.
   13. Since our citizenship is in heaven, for what pur-
pose do we look for the Saviour's return? John 14 : 1-3.
   14. Before taking us to the eternal mansions that He
has prepared for us, what will He do? Phil. 3: 21 ;
1 Cor. 15 : 51-54.
   15. What is the power by which this wonderful trans-
formation will be effected? Phil. 3: 20, 21; 2 Peter 1: 3.
                               Note
    "For our citizenship is in heaven." A.R.V. This is the
proper reading of the first part of Phil. 3:20. The word "citi-
zenship" expresses the exact meaning of the Greek word. The
idea is that this present world is not our home. 'Our citizenship
is in heaven, where is our King; there is the city which contains
our permanent residence; and we look for our Saviour to take
us there according to His promise. Therefore, as stated in Phil.
1:27, " we should live as citizens, worthily."

                             Note
   The American Revised Version of Ps. 37:8 reads as follows:
"Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself, it
tendeth only to evil-doing."
   This text gives the true idea of all the fretting and worry
in life. It all tends simply to evil.
   "In the heart of Christ, Where reigned perfect harmony with
God, there was perfect peace. He was never elated by applause,
nor dejected by censure or disappointment. Amid the greatest
opposition and the most cruel treatment, He was still of good
courage."—"Desire of Ages," page 330.
