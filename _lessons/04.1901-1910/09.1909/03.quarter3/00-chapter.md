   The present series of lessons on the "Life of Christ" will
continue in all the divisions until the end of 1910.

   The German Little Friend has a circulation of over 25,000
copies.

    We have eight mission schools in the interior of Africa with a
membership of 387. These schools donated in one quarter, $26.06.
It is an inspiration to think of these black people in Central
Africa, who themselves are living in one of the darkest and most
needy mission fields of the world, giving from their poverty to
carry the light to others.

    As an indication of the growth of the Sabbath-school work
in, foreign fields the senior lessons are printed in the following
languages, the figures show the number printed:
    German, 10,000; Dutch, 350; Russian, 950; Esthonian, 300;
Lettonian, 350; Polish, 200; Rumanian, 150; Hungarian, 250;
Bohemian, 150; and Spanish. Translations are also made in a
number of other language-s, but the number required being so
limited they are not issued in printed form.

   "Desire of Ages" is an excellent help in a study of the les-
sons on the Life of Christ. Every family should procure a copy
and study it.

    The latest reports give the number of Sabbath-schools in the
world as 3,747. Of these, 1,269 are outside the United States and
Canada. The total membership is 88,843. Of this number, 4,463
are Home Department members.

   During the year 1908, the Sabbath-schools contributed 04,-
365.65 to advance the work in mission fields.

                              Notes.
    1. Frequently we are told in the Scriptures that Jesus prayed,
sometimes all night. Surely if He needed to pray, how much more
do we. Jesus loved communion with His Father. If we trusted
self less and knew God better, we would be much more in prayer.
"Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer
and the searching of the Scriptures will be overcome by his at-
tacks."—"Great Controversy," page 341.
    2. Galilee is the name given to one of the three divisions of
Palestine, the other two being Judea and Samaria. "This is
the district which of all others was the most honored with the
presence of our Saviour. Here He lived entirely until He was
thirty years of age; and although, after the commencement of
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        7
His ministry, He frequently visited other provinces, it was here
that He chiefly resided."—"Popular and Critical Encyclopedia."
    3. In the account given by Luke, the "beloved physician," it
is stated that this man was " full f leprosy." It was indeed a
desperate case. But Jesus touched him, thus showing His com-
passion and love. He spoke, and the word cleansed the poor,
helpless, afflicted man. Even so will He cleanse the sinner who
will come to Him. "Jesus loves to have us come to Him just as
we are, sinful, helpless, dependent. We may come with all our
weakness, our folly, our sinfulness, and fall at His feet in peni-
tence. It is His glory to encircle us in the arms of His love
and to bind up our wounds, to cleanse us from all impurity."—
"Steps to Christ," page 65.
     4. "Jesus desired the man to present himself to the temple
before any rumors concerning the miracle had reached them [the
priests]. Thus an impartial decision could be secured, and the
restored leper would be permitted to unite once more with his
 family and friends."—"Desire of Ages," page 264.
     5. When on earth Jesus met' with sinners, received sinners,
 saved sinners. Our only hope lies hi that which 'the scribes and
 Pharisees criticized, that. Jesus still eats and drinks with sinners.
 Rev. 3:20.
     6. The Bridegroom soon left His people and is still away.
 There is still need of fasting and prayer.
     7. The new, undressed, unshrunk cloth, would by shrinking
 tear the old fabric. The wine bottles were made of the skins of
 animals. The new bottles, or skins, would expand with the wine.
 The old were dry and rigid, and would crack, or break, under the
 fermenting wine. This contains a spiritual lesson for all time.
 God's message is living. We can not retain the old traditions,
 errors, and selfishness, and at the same time receive the new
 life from above.

Verses 45-47.
                             Notes.
    1. "A feast of the Jews." There is great difference of
opinion as to what feast this was, but many able scholars are
agreed that it was the feast of the Passover, and that a year's
ministry in Galilee lay between this and John 6:4, His third
Passover.
    2. ''From the simple Bible account of how Jesus healed the
sick, we may learn something about how to believe in Him for
the forgiveness of sins. Let us turn to the story of the paralytic
at Bethesda. The poor sufferer was helpless• he had not used
his limbs for thirty-eight years. Yet Jesus bade
                                               ' him 'Rise, take
up thy bed and walk.' The sick man might have said, 'Lord,
if Thou wilt make, me whole, I will obey Thy word.' But no,
he believed Christ's word, believed that he was made whole, and
he made the effort at once; he willed to walk, and he did walk.
He acted on the word of 'hrist, and God gave the power. He
was made whole.
    "In like manner you are a sinner. You can not atone for
your past sins, you can not change your heart and make your-
self holy. But God promises to do all this for you through Christ.
You believe that promise. You confess your sins and give your-
self to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you do
this God will fulfil His word to you. If you believe the promise,
— believe that you are forgiven and cleansed,— God supplies the
fact; you are made whole, just as Christ.gave the paralytic power
to walk when the man believed that he was healed. It is so,
if you believe it."—"Steps to Christ," pages 61, 62.
    3. It was not because Jesus did not regard the Sabbath that
He was persecuted by the Jews, but because He did not observe
it in the way they did. His course of life condemned their dead
formalism.
    4. Apart from John, Jesus presented an infallible twofold
10          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
witness. His own works which He wrought were confirmed by
the word which the Jews professed to believe. That word was
centuries old, and they knew that Jesus, the man, could not have
altered it. That infallible witness of the Scriptures made His
words an infallible witness, because they were established by the
testimony of the word. Even so must our lives witness with His
word.
    5. The reception, discernment, and appreciation of truth do
not come by great worldly education, nor by wisdom nor knowl-
edge. They come because the heart is yielded to God, in harmony
with His truth, delighting to do Him honor. The real test as to
whether or not the Jews believed Moses was their attitude toward
Christ. It is always so. Our test of faith is present light and
duty.

                            Notes.
• 1. "Corn" is a common English term for grain. It was
probably a wheat-field through which Jesus and His disciples
were passing. According to the tradition of the Jews the dis-
ciples were thrashing grain, and were therefore guilty of sin.
"Lawful" means according to law. Through claiming that they
did that which was not lawful they were exalting their tradition
 to an equality with the law of God.
     2. The Sabbath was made for man; it is not against him. It
 is designed of God to be a blessing, not a hardship or a curse..
12           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

It is neither a burden nor a yoke, but a helpful friend. All this
is pledged in the fact that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sab-
bath. In Him and His gifts can be found only light and love
and blessing.
    3. According to Luke the healing of the man with the with-
ered hand in the synagogue was on "another Sabbath" doubt
less not long after the events recorded in the previous lesson.
    4. Read the parallel scriptures. According to Matthew they
first asked the question, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
day?" Their emphasis was on the fact of the mere work. Jesus
puts the question on the true basis, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath
day to do good, or to do evil, to save life, or to kill?" Then
by an illustration drawn from their own practise, He shows the
emptiness of their zeal. They ,would help a sheep or an ex in
distress, but would suffer a man to die. No wonder that the
heart of Jesus was indignant at such inhumanity and disregard
of the true nature of God's service. He did not break the
Sabbath. It is lawful always to do well on the Sabbath day.
It was- not a vindictive anger which came to the Master. His
soul was grieved at the hardness of their impenitent hearts.
    5. Simon was surnamed Peter, sometimes called Simeon, and
Cephas. John and James He surnamed Boanerges, meaning "sons
of thunder." Matthew is also called Levi. Simon the Canaanite
is also called Zelotes, or the Zealot. Thaddeus is also called Judas.

Note 11.
                            Notes.
   1. " The Sermon on the Mount, though given especially to the
disciples, was spoken in the hearing of the multitude."-"Desire
of Ages," page 298. Jesus was tempted as all have been to
indulge in idle talk, but He ever resisted all such temptations,
14           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  and when He spoke He taught His hearers. The things of God
  were paramount in every word and act. What a lesson this should
  be to those who are looking for His second coming!
      2. The poor in spirit are the humble, the penitent, the teach-
  able. "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of
  a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word." Isa. 66:2. In
  such hearts Christ sets up His throne, and there He dwells. Isa.
  57:15.
      3. True meekness comes alone from Christ. "It is the love
prof self that destroys our peace. While self is all alive, we stand
  ready continually to guard it from mortification and insult; but
  when we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God, we
  shall not take neglects or slights to heart. We shall be deaf to
  reproach, and blind to scorn and insult. . . . The meekness
  of Christ, manifested in the home, will make the inmates happy;
  it provokes no quarrel, giiTs back no angry answer, but soothes
  the irritated temper, and diffuses a gentleness that is felt by
  all within its charmed circle."—"Thoughts from the Mount of
Blessing," pages 30, 31. .•?
     4. Hunger means much. Men have become so overpowered by
 it that they have taken human life to relieve it; but thirst is
/even more intense. Men go insane from thirst, and it is nearly
 always the case that it is thirst which renders hunger intolerable.
 Men can live without food for many days, but they can live only
 a short time without water. These characteristics of our physical
 needs should teach us the importance of supplying our spiritual
 sustenance. Does our body need bread? more than this our souls
 need the bread of life. Does the physical man call for water`1
 infinitely more do we need God's Spirit, the water of life. But
 if we hunger and thirst, the Great Provider will abundantly supply
 our need.
     5. We are not to wait to exercise mercy till we are asked; we
 are ever to hold this disposition toward our greatest enemies. As
 we deal with them who offend us, so God will deal with us. "For
 he shall have judgment without mercy, that lath showed no
 mercy;. and mercy rejoiceth against judgment." James 2:13.
     6. There is but one thing which hides God's face from us,
 and that is sin. Read Isa. 59:1, 2.
     7. It is easy to stir up strife, to cause hard feelings among
 brethren; to peddle gossip. But the true Christian will ever work
 to heal all differences and alienations between brethren.
     8. Notice that the promise to the persecuted is the sanie as
 that to the poor and humble.
     9. "A man whose heart is stayed upon God is just the same
 in the hour of his most afflicting trials and most discouraging sur-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     15
roundings, as when he was in prosperity, when the light and favor
of God seemed to be upon him. His words, his motives, his actions,
may be misrepresented and falsified, but he does not mind it, be-
cause he has greater interests at stake."—" Thoughts from the
Mount of Blessing," pages 52, 53.
    10. Salt is a preservative, and is so used as a symbol here. So
 God's church instead of bringing calamity upon the world, pre-
 serves the world. Ten good persons in Sodom would have kept
 it from destruction. When France persecuted the. Huguenots, she
 drove out her best friends. But if the savor, the preserving power
,of the salt of the earth, be lost, both salt and earth will perish.
    11. Jesus is "the light of the world." John 8:12. God's
 word is a lamp to our feet, and a light to our path. Ps. 119:105.
 That word wrought into the lives of His children through Christ
 Jesus makes them the light of the world. How they should prize
 the sacred responsibility!

   16. Is there any special reward to those who love only
 those who are kind to them? Verses 46, 47.
   17. What high standard is placed before us? Verse 48.
                           Notes.
    1. Taken in its broadest sense, the expression "The law
 and the prophets" would include all the Old Testament Scrip-
 tures, and must, therefore, include the Ten Commandments,
            SABBATII-St1-100L LkSSOI Qt3AllTE1ILY           17
which are the sum of all moral requirements, and by the trans-
gression of which all ceremonial precepts, ordinances, and all
local, civil regulations came into existence. " The prophets"
includes all the Heaven-sent instructions reproving God's peo-
ple for the transgression of the law, and expounding its great
truths, and explaining its exceeding breadth and depth and
height. That Jesus referred to the great moral law is shown
in His reference to two of its commandments. See Matt. 5:
21, 27. He came not to destroy the law, nor the commentary
upon it by the prophets which His Spirit had inspired. 1 Peter
1,:11. He came to " fulfil " the law. The only way a moral
law can be fulfilled is by keeping it to the full. John 15 :10;
Gal. 6:2. This. Jesus did, and then in His love died to meet
its claims, that the righteousness of the law might be ful-
filled in His followers. Rom. 8:4; Titus 2:14. He fulfilled in
part the prophecies. Eternity only can fulfil them all; for
they prophesy of the eternal kingdom of God. William W.
McLane, Ph.D., D.D., well says in the Homiletic Review of
October, 1908, "Christ did not come to destroy the law of
the prophets, but to fulfil by obedience both in His own per-
son and in the person of all who believe and obey. . . 7
God in Christ and in His cross fulfils His own law of love
and most graciously compels forgiven men to fulfil the same
law.!)
    2. A " jot " (the Hebrew letter yod, answering to our letter
i) is the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet. A "tittle"
is a distinguishing point of a letter, which serves to distin-
guish one letter from another, as the difference between our
capital E and F. Some Hebrew letters are much more alike,
and the absence, or presence, of the distinguishing point would
make great difference in the meaning. God's law could not
be changed in one jot or tittle till heaven and earth should
pass away; and ''the earth abideth forever."
  ' 3. The idea is not that those who break the law shall be
the least in the kingdom of heaven; but that the judgment of
the kingdom of heaven will call, or count, those characters who
break God's law and teach men to do so as the least of all,
"of no esteem in the kingdom of heaven." They will have
no part there.      •
    4. Not "by them of old time," but as in the margin and
in the American Revised Version, "to them of old time."
So also in verse 27. God said it in His law. This law forbids
every sin against God; it includes every cherished thought and
impulse which would lead to killing. " Whosoever hateth his
brother is a murderer. " 1 John 3 :15.
18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     5. "When one who professes to serve God, wrongs or injures a
 brother, he misrepresents the character of God to that brother,
 and the wrong must be confessed, he must acknowledge it to
 be sin, in order to be in harmony with God. Our brother may
 have done us a greater wrong than we have done him, but this
 does not lessen our responsibility. If when we come before
 God we remember that another has aught against us, we are
 to leave our gift of prayer, of thanksgiving, of free-will of-
 fering, and go to the brother with whom we are at variance,
 and in humility confess our own sin, and ask to be forgiven."
     `Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"L pages 89, 90.
     _err God does not wish His children to mutilate themselves.
 That brings Him no glory; but He does mean to say that if we
 have anything about ,us as dear as the right hand or the right
 eye, which is grieving His Spirit and keeping us back from the
 kingdom of God, we must let it go, cut it off, cast it from
 us. j Andy to carry it further; if the church of Christ have
"in-embers ever so great, and they are causing her to stumble,
 and they can not be won to the truth, the church, should cast
 them out, rather than let the whole body be corrupted.
      7. "Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the
 judicial oath, in which God is solemnly called to witness that
 what is said is the truth, and nothing but the truth. Jesus
•Himself, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse to
 testify under oath. . . .         If there is any one who can
 consistently testify under oath, it is the Christian."—"Thoughts
  from the Mount of Blessing," page 100.
      8. "But let your speech be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; and what-
 soever is more than these is of the evil one." A.R.V. The con-
 text shows the admonition to be against unnecessary oaths. There
 are those who are so anxious to make their words emphatic that
 they use all kinds of adjurations.

   14. When we fast, what course should we avoid?
 Verse 16.
   15. What is said to those who fast? Whose approval
 should we seek? .What is said concerning the reward?
 Verses 17, 18. Note 4.
                              Notes.
      1. "In the secret place of prayer, where no eye but God's
  can see, no ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most hid-
  den desires and longings to the Father of infinite pity; and in
  the hush and silence of the soul, that voice which never fails to
  answer -the cry of human need, will speak to our hearts."—
  "Mount of Blessing," page 128.
      2. Study well the instruction of our Saviour, and the prayers
  recorded in the scripture. This passage does not forbid public
  prayer; for our Lord prayed in public, as did His servants. Pub-
  lic prayers should on all ordinary occasions be short. Let the
  long prayers be in secret. Come to God with humility, with a
  sense of utter unworthiness, and of His holiness, and mercy.
  Thank Him for His goodness. Praise Him for His love and
  mercy. Ask in simple faith as we need, but always according
  to His will. Do not often repeat the name or titles of Deity,
  nor speak to the great God as you would to your human neighbor.
  Holy reverence becomes the Christian; and this is fitting to the
- most implicit faith.
      3. There is a story of a knight in olden time who went to
 an aged pastor to ask his blessing before he went to avenge him-
 self on his enemy. The pastor said, "Son, on one condition
  I bestow my blessing; kneel and pray with all thy heart our
 Lord's Prayer after me." The knight (lid so until he came to
 the petition for forgiveness, and then paused. The good man
 bade him continue. The knight said he could not.           Then,"
 said the aged man, "I can not bestow my blessing." Again and
 again the old man repeated the prayer, and the knight followed
 him until he came to that petition. Finally, the words broke his
 heart, and he followed the prayer clear- through. "Now, my
 son," said his counselor, "I will bless thee on thy mission."
 "I have none," replied the knight; "I have no enemy to avenge."
     4. " Anoint thine head, and wash thy face,— these were for-
 bidden in the Jewish canon on days of fasting and humiliation;
 and hypocrites availed themselves of this ordinance that they
 might appear to fast. Our Lord, therefore, cautions us against
 this; as if He had said, Affect nothing, dress in any ordinary
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  21
manner, and let the whole of thy deportment prove that thou
desirest to recommend thy soul to God, and not thy face to men."
— Clarke.

   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 6:19 to 7:6.
   RELATED SCRIPTURES: Luke 11:34-36; 16:13; 6:37-42; Rom.
2:1-3; 14:1-13; James 2:12, 13.
   LESSON HELPS: "Mount of Blessing," pages 169-209; "De-
sire of Ages,"-chaRter 31.
                           Questions.
   1. Where should our treasures not be deposited?
What becomes of treasures- laid up on this earth?
Matt. 6: 19.
   2. Where should we lay up treasure? Verse 20.
    3. What great principle is involved in the placing
of our treasures? ' Verse 21.
   4. How does Jesus further show the importance of
seeking God with singleness of purpose and heart?
Verses 22, 23. Note 1.
   5. What great truth does lie declare regarding our
service? Verse 24.

service of God? Verse 25. Note 2.

   7. By what illustrations does Jesus show God's care
for His children? Verses 26-30.
   8. What instruction is given in reference to being
anxious concerning temporal things? Why is this net
necessary? Verses 31, 32,
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    9. What should we first seek? What cheering prom-
ise is made to those who do this? Verse 33.
  10. What did Jesus say in reference to worrying
about things in the future? Why should we not do. this?
Verse 34.
                           JUDGING.
  11. How does Jesus admonish us in reference to
judging others? Matt. 7: 1.
  12. By what principle will God judge us? Verse 2.
  13. Where should the work of judging begin? What
comparison is made? Verse 3.
  14. What should we do before beginning the work of
reforming others? Verses 4, 5. Note 3.
  15. What counsel should we follow respecting .those
who will not hear God's truth? Why? Verse 6.
                             Notes.
   1. The direction of the eye shows . the purpose of the man
as does the laying up of treasures the affections of the heart.
He who has a single purpose to do God's will, who steadfastly
looks to God, will be guided and filled with the light of God.
He whose pUrpose is turned upon the low, dark ambition of self-
ishness, worldliness and sin will become a body of darkness.
And if he who has known the light, turns to the darkness, how
great is that darkness.
   2. The injunction is not an excuse of laziness, shiftlessness,
thoughtlessness. "Take no anxious thought," is the better ex-
pression. God demands prudence, industry, care in His service,
but having done our duty in His fear and by His grace, do not
worry. Leave results to Him.
   3. Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith.
                 "What paineth thee
              In others in thyself may be;
              All dust is frail, all flesh is weak,
              Be thou the true man thou dost seek."
   We may join Christ 's condemnation of sin; but with Him
we should love the sinner, and endeavor to save him from sin.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    23
Never is it for us to count a soul irretrievably lost; that Christ
can save him has been demonstrated in that He has saved us.

Verse 19.

23. Note 5.
                       RIGHT BUILDING.
14. To whom does Jesus liken the obedient hearer?
Verses 24, 25.
  15. To whom does He liken the disobedient hearer?
Verses 26, 27.
16. How did the people regard His teaching? Why?
Verses 28, 29. Note 6.
                                Notes.
   1. "Ask," "seek," "knock." Be in earnest. Many pause
on the very threshold of blessing and deliverance.
   2. Luke, instead of saying that the Lord will give us good
things, says He will give His Holy Spirit, which brings all other
blessings in its train. The Lord is more willing to give that ful-
ness of all blessings than is an earthly parent to give the needed
food to a hungry child. But we must yield all to receive the
blessing. Then the love of God will be shed abroad in our hearts.
Rom. 5:5.
   3. The thought is not what we would like to do to others,
but what we would have others do to us if our circumstances and
eonditions were reversed. "Put yourself in his place," is the
mot10. There would never be religious persecution, nor harsh,
eruel judgment if men would follow this rule. In it is summed
up all the teaching of God regarding our duty to our fellow
men.
  - 4. "Strait" is used in the sense of narrow in.both verses. The
gate does not lot the pilgrim in laden with selfishness, worldli-
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   25

ness, riches, sin. All these must be left without. As long as
we cling to them we have not entered the narrow gate, whatever
we may profess to the contrary.
    5. "I never knew you." Awful words will they be in the
final judgment. Jesus Christ is not the minister of sin. He
came to save front sin, not in sin. He died to "redeem us from
all iniquity-51awlessness, law-breaking; and purify unto Him-
self a pecuhar people, zealous of good works." Titus 2:14:
It can not be too strongly emphasized that faith in Christ leads
to sin-cleansing, clean living, and righteous doing.
    6. "Having authority." The scribes built their teachings
on the traditions of men. Jesus came with a mission, a message,
to save men; and the words He spoke were spirit and.life. As
the Father sent Him, so He has sent others.' If we are His
heralds, we have His message, and in that message is authority
and power. He would noteav His servants frightened from
the positiveness of the message by the cry of "dogmatic," or
the insolence of tradition, or the sneer of "learned" philo-
sophical critics. "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of
season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doc-
trine."

49, 50. Note 6.
                             Notes.
    1. The disciples of Jesus truly believed on Him, but their
faith, bad not gone beyond' His personal presence, beyond the aid
of the natural senses. The centurion comprehended to some ex-
tent the great and perfect government of God. Even as in
the Roman system, he, the centurion, could send soldiers to exe-
cute his commands, so Jesus had control of power and agents
 far beyond ordinary men."Jesus could say, "Go," and His
 servant would go. The 'Roman recognized the great unseen
 working of God. And Jesus "sent His word and healed" the
child, as Matthew intimates. We may not see the physical form
 of Jesus, but He is just as able to cleanse and help and heal
 to-day as- He then was when visible.
    2. Jesus showed before John's messengers what He bad pre-
 viously declared. John 5:36. God's word, John's testimony,
 and the work of our Lord all agreed, and constituted the strong-
 est kind of evidence. Note the tender appeal in the assurance
 of verse 23, sent to the prophet in prison.
" 3. John was a type of the last-day messengers of God. Those
 who know God's message to-day will not be reeds shaken in the
28           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

wind, "carried about with every wind of doctrine." They will
not be concerned about wearing soft raiment, nor will they live
luxuriously. They will be content to be voices of God, crying
in the wilderness of sin. John 1:23.
    4. John's message, as every other great message of God, de-
veloped two classes, the believers and the unbelievers. The be-
lievers were obedient and were baptized. The unbelievers were
God's enemies and their own. The believers, in the great judg-
ment-day, will reveal by their presenee in the kingdom of God
that John's message was sufficient to save, and God was justi-
fied in its giving. So will it be with God's last message.
    5. What a picture of the present generation is that which
Jesus draws of that generation. How uncertain is religious be-
lief! How men criticize every good! But there will be some
who will fear and serve the Lord. These are the truly wise.
"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
    6. Let us not dwell on the physical details of the parable.
Let us not discuss the question as to whether the woman was
Mary, the sister of Lazarus, and the occurrence the setae as that
recorded in John 12:1-8. There are arguments on both sides;
let that phase of the matter stand as it is. Note the tender
mercy of God in His message to the woman and to us also.

30          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                             Notes.
    1. How clear, how simple, how mighty was His argument!
It appealed to common sense, and to the practise of their own
disciples. Admitting that He must cast out demons by the Spirit
of God, as every consideration proved, then the kingdom of
God had come nigh to them. Why would they not enter in?
He was demonstrating to them that He was stronger than Satan.
He had entered Satan's own domain, and had released his cap-
tives. The Jews were taking their stand against Christ, and
at the same time they were taking their stand with Satan. The
term "devils" in the plural ought always to be "demons."
There is but one devil; namely, Satan, the prince of the demons,
or evil angels.
    2. The unforgivable sins are the unrepented sins. The Holy
Spirit is the great operative agency in God's work, in creation
(Gen. 1:2; Job 26:13) and in regeneration (John 3:3-5). By
the Spirit men are convicted of sin. John 16:8-11. If men, with
sin-benumbed faculties, ascribe the work of the Spirit of God to
Satan, God has no other agency by which to soften their hearts.
When the heart comes to that condition where the beneficent
operations of the infinite power of the Spirit are counted unholy,
the heart becomes hardened and unimpressible, and its sins un-
repentable. So the Jews came to that awful place where they
could say that Jesus, who was doing only good, had an unclean
spirit. Mark 3:30.
    "The most common manifestation of the sin against the
Holy Ghost is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation to
repent. Every step in the rejection of Christ is a step toward
the rejection of salvation, and toward the sin against the Holy
Ghost. In rejecting Christ the Jewish people committed the un-
pardonable sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy we may
commit the same error."—"Desire of Ages," page 324.
    3. 0, the idle words; the cheap, trashy, foolish words; the
silly, senseless words; the vapid, empty words; the low, base
words; away with them all. Let Jesus Christ come into the heart
and fill it. Then out of the abundance of the heart let the
mouth speak. Mark well the great and solemn truth expressed
in these verses that the decision of eternity turns on our words.
    4. Professed scientists and higher critics regard as untrue the
account of Jonah and the whale. But the Saviour, in replying
to the cavils of unbelievers in His day, endorsed this story. He
said that "Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
belly." No one can discredit the divine narrative given in the
book of Jonah without rejecting the words of Christ.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      31
    5. God may have accepted us as His people; He may have
cast out the unclean spirit. We can not pause then. If we cher-
ish self, if we- consult selfish ease, pleasure, profit, if we refuse
to let reign the great salve principles of God's life, the spirit
which once sapped our vitality will return to the empty, negative
heart, and will bring a brood of even more wicked ones to enter
and dwell there. It was the privilege of the Jews to accept of
Jesus and let Him fill with life the empty house. They would
not admit Him,, but they admitted the demons of destruction.
   "Sinners, when awakened, if they grieve away the Spirit of
God, become worse than before. They are never as they were
before. Their hearts are harder, their consciences are more
seared, they have a more bitter hatred of religious men, and
they plunge deeper and deeper into sin. Seven devils often dwell
where one did, and God gives the man over to blindness of
mind and hardness of heart. This shows also the great guilt and
danger of grieving the Holy Ghost."—Barnes.
    6. "Christ loves the heavenly beings that surround His throne;
but what shall account for the great love wherewith He has loved
us? We can not understand it, but we can know it is true in
 our own experience. And if we do hold the relation of kin-
ship to Him, with what tenderness should we regard those who
 are brethren and sisters of our Lord. Should we not be quick to
 recognize the claims of our divine relationship? Adopted into the
 family of God, should we not honor our Father and our kindred?"

    blind eyes. We blind them ourselves by turning from God's
    voice till, becoming deaf to its peculiar loveliness, we can not die-

 iinguish it. So, with the light and pleadings of the Spirit. Had
  He spoken to them in plain language, they would not have be-
 lieved, and would probably have sought His life. He sought to
 arrest their attention by speaking to them in parables, and so
  lead them to seek the truth, and yet leave them without excuse.
  It is to the eager eye, the open ear, the responsive heart, that
,God reveals His truths.
      2. The parable is a familiar one, known to dwellers in most
  countries. There is the hard-beaten, wayside path, the stony
  ground, the• thorns by the field-side, and the well-prepared soil.
  The seed, as told in another parable, represents the word of
  God. Our lesson is not found in the seed, nor in the sowing, but
  in the soil of the heart. If we wish it to become a hardened
  pathway on which all things shall travel and make no impres-
 sion, we may. Our minds may become as a worn and ,barren
  highway on which travels everything, making no impression, and
  forming a place for the feeding-ground of demons. We may let
  the soil remain filled with unproductive rock, or we can "gather
  out the stones," and "break up the fallow ground." The
  third class rouses our sympathy. They do receive the word; they
  have good soil, but they allow pleasure, care, worry, anxiety, and
  other things to choke the word, and they bring no fruit to per-
  fection.
      3. " 'Into good ground,' those whose hearts are prepared by
  grace to receive it honestly, and to give it opportunity to grow.
  In a rich and mellow soil — in a heart that submits itself to the
  free influence of truth, unchecked by cares and anxieties; under
  the showers and summer suns of divine grace; with the heart
  spread open, like a broad, luxuriant field, to the rays of the
  morning and to evening dews, the Gospel takes deep root and
  grows; it has full room, and then and there only shows what
  it is. "— Barnes.

                             Note.
   We present no extended notes to this lesson. In ''Christ's
Object Lessons" will be found splendid developments of the
passages of scripture. These lessons are worthy of double em-
phasis: 1. Jesus taught that evil and good would continue to the
end; 2. that it was not His servants' duty to execute judgment
upon sinners; this He had reserved to Himself at the end of
the world; 3. that the business of the Christian is to sow the
seed of truth; to spread the leaven and life of the kingdom; to
lay all upon the altar that we may win the great prize; to teach
the truth of God applicable to the times.

                            Notes.
    1. The Master was. weary, and in calm trust He slept. We
may well believe that "the prince of the power of the air" saw •
in the circumstances a good opportunity to destroy Him, hence
the storm which constantly increased in power. The strong,
hardy fishermen were afraid, and doubtless uttered, as their own
efforts seemed futile and their fate certain, all three appeals re-
corded by the evangelists, indicating their- increasing fear and
intense desire for their Lord's direction at such a time. First
came, "Lord, save us, we perish." Then, as the storm increased,
"Master, Master, we perish!" Then as He slept on seemingly
unmindful, there is a tone of reproach in their cry, "Master,
carest Thou not that we perish?" They did not yet know that
"anywhere with Jesus" was safety; that,
         "No water can swallow the ship where lies
           The Master of ocean and earth and skies."
    2. "Gada,ra, now Umkeis, a fortified chief city of Decapolis,
of considerable importance in the time of Christ, and having
many Greek inhabitants. It lay south of the river Huvomax,
seven miles southeast of the Sea of Galilee, upon a level sum-
mit of a steep, limestone hill. . . . The country of tke
Gadarenes extended to the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee."—
"Bible Dictionary," American Tract Society.
    3. Other evangelists mention two demoniacs. One was prob-
ably much worse and more fierce than the other. His first yield-
ing to Satan may have been in the path of pleasure. He came at
last to know that service in that way was the greatest bondage
of the whole man. The man longed for freedom. He tried to
pray for deliverance; but the demons made him pray for the
 departure of Jesus. The evil spirits ,used his tongue to plead
 for themselves. But beyond this discordant voice, Jesus heard
 the cry of the imprisoned soul, and set the captive free.
     The word "deep" is from the same Greek word as "bottom-
 less pit" in Rev. 20:1, meaning abyss, the place where Satan will
 be cast with his angels. They seemed to know that their doom
 was assured. The time had not come for the execution of that
 judgment.
     4. "The demons were permitted to sweep a herd of swine
 into the sea; and to the dwellers of Gadara the loss of these out-
 weighed the blessings which Christ had bestowed, and the divine
 Healer was entreated to depart. This was the result which Satan
 designed to secure. By casting the blame of their loss upon
 Jesus, he aroused the selfish fears of the people, and prevented •
 them from listening to His words. . . . But the purposes of
38             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Christ were not thwarted. He allowed the evil spirits to destroy
the herd of swine as a rebuke to those Jews who were raising
these unclean beasts for the sake of gain."—"Great Contro-
versy" page 515.
   5. Telling what great things the Lord has done ought to be
the mission of every redeemed soul. How quickly God's message
would go if every one professing His name would so respond!
And this man began his work near home. There is a lesson in
this for us.
