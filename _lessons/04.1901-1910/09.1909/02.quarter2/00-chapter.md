         Sabbath-School Lessons on the

LIFE OF CHRIST
    INTRODUCTION : Previous Sabbath-school studies have given
many precious lessons from the word of God. This quarter we
begin a study of the life of the Master as revealed in the four
Gospels. The lessons are upon the Incarnate Word; the Word
lived and taught and exemplified in Jesus, Son of Man and
Son of God, in whom it pleased the Father that all the fulness
of the Godhead should dwell. Teachers and students should
study these lessons, not simply for a Sabbath-school recitation,
but for their life value.
    "It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each
day in contemplation of the life of Christ. We should take it
point by point, and let the imagination grasp each scene, espe-
cially the closing ones. As we thus dwell •upon. His great sacri-
fice for us, our confidence in Him will be more constant, our
love will be quickened, and we shall be more deeply imbued
with His Spirit. If we would be saved at last, we must learn
the lesson of penitence and humiliation at the foot of the cross.
    "As we associate together, we may be a blessing to one
 another. If we are Christ's, our sweetest thoughts will be of
 Him. We shall love to talk of Him• and as we speak to one
                                      ' softened by divine in-
 another of His love, our hearts will be
 fluences. Beholding the beauty of His character, we shall be
 `changed into the same image from glory to glory.' "—"Desire
of Ages," page 88.
   Some of the Scripture answers to the questions of the lessons
are long. Let the student remember: (1) This must be the
case if we cover the entire Gospel record within the time allotted.
(2) Such long 'scripture lessons will generally occur where the
lesson is chiefly narrative. (3) There is no royal road, no easy
path, to the attainment of the best things. No wealth of knowl-
edge of the word of God can be gained without study. Read
the entire lesson scripture through carefully, thoughtfully, and
prayerfully. Stop and think through it, then read again. Do
this before you read the questions. Fasten the main points in
                                                          5

each question and answer in the mind by study, prayer, practise,
and meditation.
    In this study we have aimed as far as possible to follow the
events of our Lord's earthly life in chronological sequence. We
have followed in general the "Synopsis of the Gospels," by James
P. Cadman, as given in his scholarly work, entitled "Christ in
the Gospels," which is probably as good as any. In this Quar-
terly is found the• synopsis of these lessons as given by Mr.
Cadman. We would earnestly exhort the student of these les-
sons to read "Desire of Ages" for the light which it throws
upon the life of the Master. However, it is almost impossible at
times to refer to chapters in "Desire of Ages" commenting
upon the scripture studied in a lesson. The student will find
greater help if he will note the lesson scripture in any or all
of the Gospels and then turn to the "Scriptural Index" in the
"Desire of Ages" and there find the very pages in the book
where the scripture in question is treated.
    In "Christ's Object Lessons" much light is thrown upon the
parables of our Lord, and this excellent book should also be
freely used in the study of the lessons.
    Study, too, the persons and the places named .in the lessons.
Consult a Bible dictionary or encyclopedia. Schaff 's Bible Dic-
tionary, the American Tract Society 's, or Smith's Bible Diction-
ary, and Fausset's Bible Cyclopedia, are each excellent. An out-
line map of Palestine is in the Quarterly. This should be used,
and all places mentioned in the lessons located.


          LESSON I.— The Word Made Flesh.
                        APRIL 3, 1909.
    LESSON SCRIPTURE:     John 1:1-18.       a
   RELATED SCRIPTURES: Gen. 1:26; TM. 63:9; Micah 5:2;
1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16.
   LESSON HELPS : ''Desire of Ages," chapters 1 to 3.
   NOTE: At the beginning of each lesson, chapters or pages are
designated in "Desire of Ages" and other books to which we
are referred to . find help upon the lesson. No better notes, or
commentary, could possibly be written than those found in these
books, and we urge that all provide themselves with these books
and carefully study the references cited.
   THE RECORD: The Gospel of John, the beloved disciple, writ-
ten probably at Ephesus, near the close of the first century.
This Gospel emphasizes the deity and divinity of ChriSt, and
His rejection by His own people; and life through believing.

  16. What contrast is drawn between Jesus and Moses?
Verse 17. Note 6.
  17. What is said about man having seen God? How
only may we know Him? Verse 18. Note 7.
                            - Notes.
   1. The Greek term here rendered "word" is logos. The
Son is here called the Word, because He was "God's thought
made audible."
    HOw far back "in the beginning" goes we may not say.
We could not understand it if we were told. Suffice it to say
that it was before the earth and stars were created.
    2. In Him was and is life. The Gospel of John is the Gospel
of life. Our Lord came to give the dying world what it needed
most — life. And that life lived and given is the only salva-
tion, the only guide, the only life to lead and save the souls
of men.
    3. "Lighteth every man." This is what Jesus has done.
His spirit of conviction, of persuasion, of enlightenment, has gone
unto all the earth's inhabitants. The doctrine of the future pro-
bation of man ignores this illuminating scripture.
    4. The "right," the "power" (authority), the "privilege,"
to become a son of God is open to every soul. The receiving of
Him is the yielding all of self to Him and accepting all from
Him instead. It is self-denial, crucifixion, and believing on His
name for cleansing, for life, for leading.
    5. "The Word became flesh." Divinity taliernacled in the
flesh of humanity. Not the flesh of sinless man, but such flesh
as the children of earth possess. That was the glory of it.
The divine Seed could manifest the glory of God in sinful flesh,
even to absolute and perfect victory over any tendency of the
flesh. This is the victory of our faith; for so Christ will dwell
in our flesh, to conquer self and sin. See Gal. 2:20; 1 John 4:1-5.
    6. Moses could only speak law. He had no life in himself
to impart to the people. It was Moses' desire that the people
should hear God speak and live. They refused and would listen
only to the human, the voice of right words, but words devoid
of life that would save. Christ Jesus spoke words of life and
grace and truth. God's word received from man as the word
of man is only cold, dead law.
    7. "He bath declared Him." The Son of God came not to
manifest Himself. All the grace, love, tenderness, and wisdom
revealed were of God. The revelation of Jesus Christ, who is
Himself the revelation of the Father,           be seen in the char-
acter of His people.

   PLAGE :   erusalcm.
   PERSONS:(1) Herod the Great, king of Judea, son of Anti-
pater, an Idumean, made king by the Roman Senate B.C. 40.
He was ambitious, despotic, and cruel. He died in B.G. 4; (2)
Zacharias, a priest; and (3) Elizabeth, his wife, of the family
of Aaron; (4) the angel Gabriel, God's messenger of Revela-
tion. See Dan. 8:16; 9:21; (5) Mary; (6) Joseph, of the tribe
of Judah.

    9. Shortly after this, what announcement came to
the virgin Mary? What was to be the name of this
child? Verses 26-31.
  10. What is said of the promised child? Verses
32, 33.
       Why was the child to be called the Son of God?
Verse 35. Note 2.
  12. Relate the chief things for which Mary praised
God? Verses 46-55. Note 3.
                               Notes.
    1. The Gospel of Luke was written by an educated man, a
physician, a companion of Paul. See Col. 4:11, 14; Acts 16:10-
17 (as Luke, being the writer of the book of Acts, uses the
pronoun "we," it is evident he was a companion of Pau]) ;
2 Tim. 4:11. It was written with the Gentiles in view, pre-
senting Christ as the Saviour of men of every nation. Luke
makes especially prominent the human nature of Jesus, and
speaks much of His healing power. He gives not less than twenty-
three parables, miracles, and incidents not mentioned by the
other Gospel writers._ His Gospel was probably written about
A.D.. 63. The fact that Luke had studied the events of Christ's life
does not in any way lessen the inspiration of his narrative.
    2. The subject studied in our last lesson is. here told in detail.
While we can not explain the mystery of the incarnation, yet
this amazing sacrifice is a demonstration to every trembling soul
of the love of God for sinners, and an assurance that all who
will may be delivered from the bondage of sin, and receive as
a gift the precious boon of eternal life.
   3. Note (1) Mary's song is not an exaltation of self, but of
God, her Saviour; (2) Jesus regards the lowly; (3) It was the
mighty One who wrought, who is holy, merciful, and strong to
put down evil and save the good, and ;vim remembers Israel
and His covenant to Abraham,

 LESSON HE— Birth of John the Baptist — Birth
                 of Jesus.
                   • APRIL 17, 1909.
   LESSON SCRIPTURE:    Luke 1:57-80; 2: 1-7; Matt. 1:18-25.
   GENEALOGY OF JESUS: Luke 3:23-38; Matt. 1:1-17.
   The apparent difference between these two genealogies is best
explained by the supposition that Matthew gives the royal descent
of Jesus through the males, while Luke gives the descent from
Mary through Joseph the son, or son-in-law, of Mary's father,
or Heli. Men only are mentioned because according to Jewish
law the descent of genealogy is so reckoned.
   LESSON HELPS: - "Desire of Ages," chapter 4; 'chapter 10,
pages 100-102.
    TIME: B.C. 4, birth of Jesus. "It is very perplexing to
many to find that Jesus was actually born four years before
the time from which we count His birth. The simple reason is
that no one calculated dates from the birth of Christ until cen-
turies after He was born, and then Dionysius Exiguus, the monk
who published the calculations in A.D. 526, made a mistake of
four years. . . . Since it is impossible to rectify the dates
in all books and records over the world, we simply apply the true
dates to the life of Christ. He was five years, old at the close
of A.D. 1."— Peloubet.
    PLACES : Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem.
    PERSONS: Elizabeth, Zacharias, and John; Mary, Joseph, and
Jesus; Cwsar Augustus, emperor of Rome; Quirinus, Roman gov-
ernor of Syria. Look up the biography of those persons in a
Bible dictionary or an encyclopedia.                   •-
                        Questions.
               BIRTH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST.
   1. When the time for the fulfilment of God's promise
to Zacharias came, what occurred? Luke 1 : 57, 58.
 • 2. How was the name of the child selected? Verses
59-63.
       Whet blessing came to Zacharias? How were
the people affected? Verses 64-66.
. 4. What additional great blessing was bestowed upon
Zacharias? Verse 67.

                       BIRTH OF JESUS.

    7. What announcement was made to Joseph con-
cerning Mary? Matt. 1: 21.
    8. Of what would this birth be a fulfilment? Verses
22, 23.
    9. What is the meaning of the word Emmanuel?
Verse 23. See also John 1: 14. Note 2.
  10. What decree went forth about the time of John's
birth? Luke 2:1, 2. Note 3.
  11. What persons are especially mentioned as meeting
the requirements of this decree? To what place did
they go? Why? Verses 3-5.
  12. What occurred while they were at Bethlehem?
Verses 6, 7.
                            Notes.
    1. The prophecy of Zacharias may be summed up in the fol-
lowing: Redemption to Israel; the appearance of the Saviour
in the house of David as predicted of old; the remembering of
God's holy covenant to Abraham; deliverance from our enemies
in order that we may serve God; John the forerunner of David's
son to give knowledge of salvation from sin, light to those in
darkness, and to guide us in the path of peace.
    2. Jesus — Saviour; Emmanuel— God-with-us. Thus was sal-
vation brought to us. "The Word was made flesh." He be-
came one with poor, lost humanity, that every lost soul might be
saved and become one with God.
    3. The word "enrolled" (see margin) is better than "taxed."
This was a register preparatory to the taxing. This decree was
given by Augustus Caesar in his twenty-eighth year, under the
Roman governor Quirinus. Both Joseph and Mary, being of
the seed of David, went up to Bethlehem.

  17. Who• else dwelt in the temple? What was her

  18. What did she do and /say? Verse 38. Note 3.
                            Notes.
    1. The message of the angel was 'a consummation of the long-
deferred hope of the ages. Seers and prophets had predicted it.
With longing eyes and aching hearts God's people from dungeon
and exile and captivity had looked for that hour. The Re-
deemer of the lost race was born into the world. Truly this
was good tidings; why'should not hearts be glad.?
    2. Anna.—` `An aged widow, daughter of Phanuel, of the
tribe of Asher. She had married early, but after seven years
her husband died, and during her long widowhood she daily at-
tended the morning and evening services of the temple. Anna
was eighty-four years old when the infant Jesus was brought to
the temple by His mother, and entering as Simeon pronounced his
thanksgiving, she also broke forth in praise."— Popular and
Critical Bible Encyclopedia."
    3. All of God's children could have known of the coming of
Jesus as well as Simeon and Anna. The prophecies concerning
His coining might have been understood by all, but sin and un-
belief had blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts. It will
be the same at the second advent of the Saviour. A few will be
waiting for Him like Simeon of old, but the wicked will pass on
and be punished. "Many shall be purified, and made white, and
tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked
shall understand; but the wise shall understand." Dan. 12:10.

or Median. They were from a priestly caste, who doubtless had
received light from the Holy Scriptures, through the influence
of Daniel and otherwise.
    "As these magi studied the starry heavens, and sought to
fathom the mystery hidden in their bright paths, they beheld
the glory of the Creator. Seeking clearer knowledge, they turned
to the Hebrew Scriptures. In their own land were treasured pro-
phetic writings that predicted the coming of a divine teacher.
Balaam belonged to the magicians, though at one time a prophet
of God; by the Holy Spirit he had foretold the prosperity of
Israel and the appearing of the Messiah; and his prophecies had
been handed down by tradition from century to century. But
in the Old Testament the Saviour 's advent was more clearly re-
vealed. The magi learned with joy that His coming was near,
and that the whole world was to be filled with a knowledge of
the glory of the Lord."—"Desire of Ages," pages 60, 61.
    2. "That star was a distant company of shining angels. "—

     "Strange occupants were in that stable. The wise and proud
  were there kneeling. Angels had been there adoring. The Son
  of God was there sleeping in a human mother's arms. The
  stable was greater than the palace of a king, for its manger
  cradled the 'King of Kings, Emmanuel, the Wonderful, Coun-
  selor, Prince of Peace, Redeemer, Saviour of men,' who were all
  embraced in that helpless infant. There it lay, calm and fair,
  and lovely, the companion of cattle, and yet the Maker of the
  earth and the adored of heaven — the son of a carpenter, and
• the 'Son of God.' . . . The priests of Aaron had stood before
  the altar and struggled for ages with the mighty 'problem, and
  lo! the 'Star of Bethlehem' pointed to that Babe as its solu-
  tion. The long wanderings of the Hebrews, the miracles that
  preserved them, the imposing ceremonies of their -religion, the
  ` ark of God,' the 'mercy-seat,' the pomp ,of temple worship,
  what did they all mean? That silent star pointed to the reply.
  Altars and sacrifices, prayers and prophecies, all were to end
  here. For four thousand years the earth had been rolling on its
  axis to bring about one event, and lo! it was accomplished. "—
  Headley, in "Golden Sheaves," page 515.
      3. Archelaus was the son of Herod the Great by a Samaritan '
  woman named Malthace. On complaint before the emperor of
  his tyranny, he was dethroned, and exiled to Gaul where he died.

  14. What is further said concerning the work of Jesus?
Verse 17.
                             Notes.
    1. Observe how explicit Luke is in giving details. No writer
who cared for his reputation and who was not. sure of his ground,
would thus deliberately set down such detailed statements; so
easily proved false if the story were not true. The facts of the
record are well established.
    2. To us as well as the people in the days of John the Bap-
tist these words come as a warning. Cumberers of the ground
are as displeasing to the Lord now as then. The - severest rebukes
administered by our Saviour when on the earth were directed
against those who occupied a place in the vineyard, and yet
bore no fruit.

unto Jesus? Matt. 3 : 11.
                              Notes.
    1. "To fulfil all righteousness." Jesus was God acting in
 sinful flesh on behalf of the sinner. He made Himself one with
 humanity. He took upon Himself the woes, the needs, and sins,
 of humanity, so that He felt the•consciousness and keenness of it
 as no other soul ever felt it. He was baptized for humanity.
 In all that He did He was fulfilling righteousness for humanity.
    '2'. The word "baptize" is taken directly into English from
 the Greek, and means "plunge," "immerse," '''-whelm:" If
 the water had been sprinkled or poured upon the Lord, He need
 not have gone down into the water, as He must have done to
 have come up out of the water.
        The voice from heaven was the voice of the Father. It
 was God's encouragement to His Son to help meet the tempta-
 tion and agony that awaited Him in the wilderness. Every soul
 clothed in the righteousness of Jesus may take home to his heart
\the same words of comfort and encouragement.
     4. " There came to the Saviour, as if in answer to His prayers,
 one in the guise of an angel from heaven. He claimed to have
 a commission from God to declare that Christ's fast was at an
 end."—" Desire of Ages," page 118.
     5. Satan is "the god of this world." 2 Cor. 4:4. When man
 yielded himself to temptation in Eden, he yielded his dominion
 over the earth given him by the Creator. Satan holds this do-
 minion, in fact, but not by right, for man had no authority
 to yield that which he held in trust from God. Jeans came to
 win back the lost possession by giving His life to meet the penalty
 of sin. The devil offered what seemed an easier way. Only
 worship me, and all shall be Thine. The Master, however, did
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  21
not yield him homage. Yet many of His professed followers'
have done so, and through yielding, have themselves become sub-
jects of Satan.
   6. We have here one of the best meanings of worship; namely,
service. To serve is the highest kind of worship.
   7. It is worthy of note that one of the books of the Bible
which has been assailed by the "higher critics" was the armory
from which our Lord drew all His mighty weapons in this con-
test with Satan. These three temptations were representative;
appetite and the flesh, presumption, and the love of power.

What blessed assurance did our Lord give him? Verses
49-51.
                             Notes.
   1. I am not Elijah; that is, the personal Elijah for whom
some of the Jews were looking. He was Elijah only in the sense
of coming "in the spirit and power" of 'Elijah. Luke 1:17.
To this our Lord refers in Matt. 11:14. "That prophet" doubt-
less refers to a belief which the .Tews held that the prophet of
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    23

Deut 18:15, 18 was not the Messiah, but His forerunner. This
error was not, however, held by all. Others thought He was
one of the old prophets raised from the dead.
   2. John counts it the highest honor in simply being a "voice"
for God. He is a type of the remnant church. Like John they
should not seek earthly glory, buf be happy in being simply a
"voice" for Him in this generation.

Verse 23.
  18. Why did He not fully commit Himself to them?
What knowledge has He of man? Verses 24, 25.
                             Notes.
   1. The presence of our Lord at the marriage in Cana, and
the work which He did at that place, stamps with divine approval
the sacred marriage institution. It shows, too, that proper joy-
ous occasions are right in His sight. This does not mean that He
necessarily approved of all which may have been done there,
but holy, happy, home occasions He is pleased to honor with His
presence.
    2. Jesus when on earth was both the Son of God and the
Son of Man. This miracle manifested forth the glory, the good-
ness, the power, with which God clothed His Son, who "emptied
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       25

  Himself" to save humanity. In this Jesus was declaring His
  Father. John 1:18. His miracles when on earth were to help
  others, not Himself. Not a single thread of selfishness was seen
  in His life.
    3. "As Jesus entered the temple, He was indignant to find
  the court of the temple arranged as a cattle-market and a place
  of general traffic. There were not only stalls for beasts, but there
  were tables where the priests themselves acted as money-brokers
 and exchangers. It was customary for each person who attended
  the Passover to bring a piece of money, which was paid to the
  priests upon entering the temple. . . . Many came from a
 great distance and could not bring their sacrificial offerings.
 Under the plea of accommodating such persons, in the outer
 court were cattle, sheep, doves, and sparrows for sale at ex-
 orbitant prices."—"Spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 2; pages 115, 116.
      4. Unbelief asked, "What sign?" just as though the work
 of Christ then and there was not sufficient sign of His divinity.
  There is danger of being so blind to the present evidence of
 God's work that we shall fail to see any evidence whatever.
      5. By comparing Matt. 26:61, 62, we see that false witnesses,
 in order to secure Jesus' condemnation, perverted the statement,
 "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
  They quoted Him in a way that made Him appear to say that
 He was going to destroy the temple of Herod. Instead of this,
 lie told them to destroy this (His body) and in three days He
 would rise from the dead.
      6. "His disciples remembered." John wfles this long after
 the resurrection of our Lord. Jesus knew that His disciples must
.-pass through great -trials, and He was ever laying up evidence
  for them in and after the sore trials they experienced so that
 they could look back and see that all the v :ty there were witnesses
  for Him, and that His words had been f u lfilled.

  19. What is the final result of disobedience, or un-

                            Notes.
    1. ``Born again," or better, "born from above," as given in
the margin. The American Revised Version reads, "Except one
be born anew." The new birth from its very inception is of
divine origin.
    2. " The wind bloweth where it listeth." The A. R. Version,
margin, reads, "The Spirit breatheth .where it will." Rother-
ham's translation reads, "The Spirit where it pleases blows.,"
This is the only instance in the New Testament where the word
Pneuma is not rendered Spirit. It evidently means Spirit here
also. God's Spirit is not under man's direction, nor can man
measure its work. It is utterly incomprehensible to the natural
man.
    3. "Art thou a Master of Israel, and knowest not these
things"?' Nicodemus, holding the position he did, ought to have
fully understood concerning the new birth. "The conversion of
the soul through faith in Christ was but dimly comprehended by
Nicodemus, who had been accustomed to consider cold formality
and rigid services as true religion."—"Spirit of Prophecy,"
Vol. 2, page 131.
    4. "The learned Nicodemus had read these pointed prophecies
with a clouded mind, but now he began to comprehend their
true meaning, and to understand that even a man as just and
honorable as himself must experience a new birth through Jesus
Christ, as the only condition upon which be could be saved, and
secure an entrance into the kingdom of God. . . . The scales
fell from his eyes, and faith took the place of doubt and uncer-
tainty. Beams of light streamed from the secret interview in
the mountain and illuminated the cross of the Saviour."—
"Spirit 'of Prophecy," Vol. 2, pages 132, 135.
    5. The negative in this wonderful scripture ought to he
emphasized. Our blessed Lord did not come to condemn the
28          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

world, for the world, because of sin, is condemned already. He
came to save from the condemnation of sin.
   6. "A question arose between them and the Jews as to
whether baptism availed to cleanse the soul from sin; they
maintained that the baptism of Jesus differed essentially from
that of John. Soon they were in dispute with Christ's dis-
ciples in regard to the form of words proper to use at baptism,
and finally as to the right of the latter to baptize at all."—
"Desire of Ages," page 178.
    7. "Though John's mission seemed about to close, it was
still possible for him to hinder the work of Christ. If he had
sympathized with himself, and expressed grief or disappointment
at being superceded, he would have sown the seeds of dissen-
sion, would have encouraged envy and jealousy, and would seri-
ously have impeded the progress of the Gospel. John had by
nature the faults and weaknesses common to humanity, but the
touch of divine love had transformed him. He dwelt in an
atmosphere uncontaminated with selfishness and ambition, and
far above the miasma of jealousy."— Id., page 179.
    8. " 'He must increase.' His present success is but the be-
ginning of a most glorious and universal spread of righteous-
ness, peace, truth, and good will among men. 'I must decrease.'
My baptism and teaching, as pointing out the coming Messiah;
must cease; because the Messiah is now come, and has entered
publicly on the work of His glorious ministry."— Clarke. "He
must increase, but I must decrease," contains a great spiritual
lesson which should not be overlooked.

    NOTE: It was about this time that John was cast into prison,
as recorded in Luke 3:19, 20, for reproving Herod for marrying
Flerodias, his brother's wife. He was probably imprisoned in the
castle of Machaerus (the Greek name means, The Blaek For-
tress), east of the Dead Sea. Jesus went to Galilee on hearing

                              Notes.
   1. "Jacob's well is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but
was made famous by the meeting of Jesus with the woman of
Samaria at that place, as recorded in John 4:5-30. It is located
near Shechem, otherwise known as Sychar, the modern Nablus.
This is one of the very few spots in Palestine which have been
closely identified with our Saviour's presence. It is about half a
mile north from Joseph's tomb at the base of Mt. Gerizim. Mann-
dress, in 1698, found the depth of the well to be 105 feet, with. 15
feet of water. Captain Anderson, who visited it•in 1866, found it
to be only 75 feet. It may have been twice that depth originally.
When visited by Farrar in 1870, it was only about 20 feet deep,
and was in a state of hopeless ruin."—"Popular and Critical
Bible Encyclopedia."
   " Sychar,— a name of reproach applied by the Jews to
Shechem. "7— Id.
    2. One practical lesson to be gained from the narrative of
this woman from the city of Sychar is that she began her work
near her home. This is where we ought to begin. To the man
whom the Saviour healed in the country of the Gadarenes, He
said, "Go home to thy friends, and tell how great' things the
Lord hath done for thee." Mark 5:19. The world now is "white
already to harvest," and faithful, home missionary work is the
need of the hour.
    3. Such is the effect of simple witness born for Christ. We
would scarcely have selected this woman as the one to bring
a revival of godliness to the wicked village of Syehar. But
many "believed on Him for the saying of the woman, which
testified, He told me all that ever I did." The secret of her
success lies in the fact that she had a face-to-face talk with the
Saviour. This changed -her from a life of sin to a life of right-
eousness. Before we can bring souls to the Lord, we, too, must
have a personal interview with Jesus, and experience a trans-
formation of life.

provinces, it was here that He chiefly resided."—"Popular and
Critical Bible Encyclopedia."
    2. Nobleman. "The word so rendered in John 4:46 is the
Greek bas-el-ee-kos, which is somewhat varied in signification. It
may mean: (1) Descended from a king. (2) One belonging to
the court. (3) A soldier of the king, in which latter sense it
often occurs in Josephus. (4) Well born, used in the parable
of the talents as a title of the person who placed his servants
in charge of certain amounts, for which they were to be held
accountable, thus testing their fidelity and ability."-

lips, greatly impressed the people, and unbelief began to give
way. But they hardened their hearts. They remembered that
He was "Joseph's son," that He was a "carpenter," and there-)
fore reasoned that He could not be the Son of God.

                           Notes.
  1. "The Sea of Chinnereth (Num. 34:11.), called in the New
Testament, 'the Sea of Galilee' (Matt. 4:18), the. 'Sea of Ti-
             SA1313ATEI-S0E1001, LESSON QVARTEELY                 35
  berias' (John 21:1), and the 'Sea' or 'Lake of Gennesaret ' (Luke
  5:1-11), which last is but a variation of the Hebrew name."-
- "Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia."
     2. It would seem that Simon and the other disciples whom
  Jesus first called had gone back to their fishing -vvdien Jesus re-,
  turned to Galilee.
     3. We may, like the disciples who toiled all the night without
  results, in our labor for souls sometimes see no one won to Christ.
  Yet we should not become discouraged and abandon the work.
  Connect more fully with the Saviour, take Him on board the ship,
  and at the word let down the Gospel net, and it may enclose a
  multitude.
     4. The disciples "forsook all" in order to follow Christ. No
  less is required of His people in this age. We can not serve
  God and mammon. Following Christ means a separation from
  the world.
     5. "The mind of this wretched sufferer had been darkened
  by Satan, but in the Saviour 's presence a ray of light had pierced
  the gloom. He was roused to long for freedom from Satan's
  control; but the demon resisted the power of. Christ. When the
  man tried to appeal to Jesus for help, the evil spirit put words
  into his mouth, and he cried out in an' agony of fear. The de-
  moniac partially comprehended that he was in the presence of
  One who could set him free; but when he tried to come within
  reach of that mighty hand, another's will held him; another's
  words found utterance through him. The conflict between the
  power of Satan and his own desire for freedom was terrible."
   —"Desire of Ages," pages 255, 256.
