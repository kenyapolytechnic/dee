THE 83-CENT RATE
    This rate has been in operation only since January i, 1902, yet
many have taken advantage of it to such an extent that our mail-
ing list has been materially increased.
     For the benefit of those who have not fully understood the
plan, we state the offer again:—

    From any one who is taking a club of five or more
Signs, either through his church club or from the
publishers direct, we will accept new single subscriptions
at 83 CENTS PER YEAR, WHEN ORDERED FOR
MISSIONARY PURPOSES.


                Added Facilities
make it possible for us to handle these extra subscriptions at
such a low rate.


                Another Feature
     It is our plan at the present time to follow up each subscription
that expires and endeavor to secure a renewal of the same; but our
mailing list is now so classified that when a person sends a sub-
scription if he does not care to have the name followed up we will
not do so. Missionary workers will at once see the advantage
in this.

        FEEDING UPON THE WORD
  The only true way to study the Word of God is to feed
upon it. We must eat it day by day. It must be digested and
assimilated by that part of our organism which has been given
to us for this purpose. We can not live upon a light lunch
taken once a week. Our need is continuous, 'and the supply
must be continuous: This does not mean that we must have
the book before our eyes all The time, any more than we need
to sit at the table all the time in order to satisfy our physical
requirements ; but as we need to sit at the table every day in
order to supply that upon which the system feeds continually,
so we must come to the direct study of the Word each day in
order to supply that upon which our spiritual nature may feed
continually. There must be a definite appropriation in each
case of the definite provision which God has made for our
need.
  We wish to emphasize these principleS in connection with
the present lessons. They cover either directly or in a sug-
gestive way sufficient ground to become the basis of daily
study during the whole week. Those who live with them dur-
ing the week will get the most from them on the Sabbath.
Those who give them only a hasty and superficial study on
Friday evening or Sabbath morning, will find it practically
impossible to apprOpriate them as personal experience on so
short an acquaintance with them. By some people this denomi-
nation has been given the credit of being Bible students, but
we often feel compelled to think that this distinction is un-
merited now, whatever may have been the case in the past.
In view of the experiences which we are soon to face: in view
of the wonderful revelation of light and truth which is now
being made to us; in view of our great and constant need of
being built up in the most holy faith.—shall we not meditate
upon these things? Shall we not give ourselves wholly to
them? If we will do so, it is certain that our profiting will
appear unto all. The following extracts may be helpful in
stimulating us to form and carry into effect such a decision.



          A NECESSITY WHICH IS A PRIVILEGE
  "It is a weak and pale word, and not at all corresponding to
the real nature of the case and to the feelings of the Christian,

4               STUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.


 to speak. of our duty to read the Scriptures. Where there is
 reverence, love, trust; where there is joy in communion with
 God, we look upon the reading of Scripture not as a duty,—
 one among many others. It stands by itself. Listening to the
 voice of God is not one of many duties, but it is the source
 as well as the regulator of all duties. It is not merely a work
 which our conscience declares to be right, but our very con-
 science, and affections, and will, and mind, our whole inner
 man, receives from this Word light and strength.
    We feel it necessary to read the Scriptures, just as food is
 necessary to sustain life, and as we desire to breathe pure and
 fresh air. It is a necessity, not a compulsion of an external kind,
 which is opposed to our nature, and which is as a mechanical
 burden imposed on us. It is a necessity, in the sense that
 our whole spiritual life craves for it, and can not prosper with-
 out it. And is not one reason of our languid and feeble life
 the simple fact that we do not breathe sufficiently the Bible air?
 Sermons and tracts and religious books contain not sufficiently
that ozone which is the exclusive characteristic of God's Word.
   "But it may not be unnecessary to add a word on the copious
reading of Scripture. Read the whole Scripture, for Scripture is
a connected whole. Do not neglect the historical, or prophetic,
or doctrinal portions. Forget not the book of Proverbs nor
the little Epistle of Philemon. Think not that there is no food
for the soul in the books of the Chronicles. God has given us
the whole, and means us to use the whole, for it is. all profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in right-
eousness. We Protestants speak much, and at times somewhat
boastfully, of our great reverence and love for the Bible. Is
our glorying in truth? Do we. love the Bible, not merely as a
text-book from which to collect proofs for our doctrine, an
armory from which to select weapons to defeat our opponents,
but do we love the Bible as God's revelation, in which our minds
are to be moulded, by which our hearts are to he influenced?
Are there not many portions of Scripture so neglected that, if
to-morrow some magic hand were to efface them from our edi-
tions, very few of us would miss them? Have we not received
it more as a theory than a real and practical belief, that all the
books of Moses, and prophets, and apostles are inspired, author-
itative, profitable? Let us be really disciples. learners, not select-
ing, not rejecting, but receiving all our Lord has graciously
caused to be written for our instruction.
   "If such a diligent study of the Scripture should interfere with,
our reading of religious literature, we may rest satisfied that

            "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence

we shall not be losers, to say the least of it. yrhile we use with
gratitude the books in which men communicate their thoughts
and experience, we must always, not merely in theory, but in
practise, hold them in a subordinate position. The more the
Bible has the preeminence, the greater will be our power of
discernment, and the more shall we be truly benefited by the
writings of men. A diligent study of Scripture will place us
in the true position of not being in bondage to .man, and of
being willing to learn with gratitude from all servants of the
Lord."—Christ and the Scriptures.


                  SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES
  The Sabbath-school affords to parents and children a precious
opportunity .for the study of God's Word. But in order to
gain that benefit which they should gain in the Sabbath-school,
both parents and children should devote time to the study of
the lessons, seeking to obtain a thorough knowledge of the
facts presented, and also of the spiritual truths which these facts
are designed to teach. We should especially impress upon the
minds of the young the importance of seeking the full sig-
nificance of the scripture under consideration.
  "In some schools, I am sorry to say, the custom pr. 'ails of
reading the lesson from the lesson sheet. This. should not be.
It need not be, if the time that is often needlessly and even
sinfully employed, were given to the study of the Scriptures.
There is no reason why Sabbath-school lessons should be less
perfectly learned by teachers or pupils than are the lessons
of the day school. They should be better learned, as they
treat of subjects infinitely more important. A neglect here is
displeasing to God.
  "Parents, set apart a little time each day for the study of the
Sabbath-school lesson with your children. Give up the social
visit, if need he, rather than sacrifice the hour devoted to the
precious lessons of sacred history. Parents, as well as chil-
dren, will receive benefit from this study. Let the more im-
portant passages of Scripture connected with the lesson be
committed to memory, not as a task, but as a privilege. Though
at first the memory .may be defective, it will gain strength by
exercise, so that after a time you will delight thus to treasure
up the precious words of truth. And the habit will prove a
most valuable aid to religious growth.

" Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to

   "11 the time that,is worse than wasted in gossip, in minister-
 ing to pride, or for the gratification of appetite, were devoted
with equal interest to the study of the Bible, what encourage-
ment would be given to our Sabbath-schools! But when
parents are more anxious to have their children fashionably
dressed than to have their minds stored with the truths of
God's Word. the children themselves will soon learn to regard
dress and display as of more consequence than the things which
concern their salvation. . .
   "Observe system in the study of the Scriptures in your fam-
ilies. Neglect anything of a temporal nature; dispense with
all unnecessary. sewing and with needless provision fcr the
table, but be sure that the soul is fed with the bread of life.
It is impossible to estimate the good results of one hour, or
even half an hour, each day devoted in a cheerful, social man-
ner to the Word of God. Make the Bible its own expositor,
bringing together all that is said concerning a given subject at
different times and under varied circumstances. Do not break
up your home class for callers or visitors. If they come in
during the exercise, invite them to take part in it. Let it be seen
that you consider it more important to obtain a knowledge of
God's Word than to secure the gains or pleasures of the world."

                      INTRODUCTORY
   Those who wish to derive much benefit from these lessons
must be willing to - study faithfully. The lessons have been
written in this particular way in order to develop a connected
line of thought, but the brief statements with which the dif-
ferent Scripture references have been woven together are not
designed to be the real theme of the lesson. In the Scriptures
themselves will be found the truth to be studied, and the state-
ments made in the lesson are intended merely as a guide in
the study of the Word itself. Unless you see the truth in the
living Word, and as the living Word, you will not be able to
lay hold of the truth as a living experience. The lessons are
suggestive rather than exhaustive, and it is hoped that they
may prove a stimulus to the study of the subject itself, rather
than the mere preparation of a Sabbath-school lesson.
   It should also be remembered that the development of one

phase of the truth contained in some passages of Scripture is
not a denial of any other phases of the truth contained in the
same passages, even though. they are not specifically mentioned.
The truth is infinite; and we can touch at best only upon " parts
of His ways."
   The questions may prove of some help in developing the
subject, if they are used in the right way, or they may be made
a hindrance to real study. The aim in preparing the lesson
should not be merely to be able to answer the printed questions.
They are intended to assist in getting a clear view of the con-
nected chain of truth in the texts which are brought together
in the lesson; and, with the help offered in the questions and the
statements with which the texts are connected, the Scripture
itself should be studied, until the whole subject becomes familiar
to the mind in the exact words of the Scripture. It will usually
be found helpful to read more than simply the verse or verses
included in the reference. A clear understanding of the real
meaning- of a passage of Scripture often depends upon its rela-
tion to that which precedes or follows it, and sometimes upon
both. It is a good thing to form the habit of examining care-
fully the whole paragraph from which a text is taken, and this
will prevent that wrong application of Scripture which is often
made possible by disregarding the connection in which it is
found.
   The earnest, prayerful study of God's Word will yield rich
returns to every one who will give himself to it.         And we
have certainly come to a time now when every believer in the
truth should sink the shaft deep, and know for himself that
 "the foundation of God standeth sure." It is the earnest hope
of the writer of these lessons that they may contribute something
 toward this result.
   The subject studied in this series of lessons will be continued
 and further developed in the next quarter's lessons.

   LESSON I.—THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM
       AND THE COMING OF THE LORD.

                              Aprils, 1902.

  The coming of the Lord and the end of the world are in-
separably connected (Matt. 24:3), and a definite work is to be
done as the preparation for these events (verse 14). This
is the gospel of personal experience (Luke 17:20, 21), and in-
volves the, doing of God's will (Matt. 6:1o). It gives to God
His rightful place ( Jer. io :ro), and recognizes the exalted
position of Jesus Christ (s Tim. 6:14, 15). It sets forth true
humility as the basis of its citizenship (Matt. 18:3, 4), and
makes service to be true worship (Matt. 4:10). It shows upon
what the dominion is based (Heb. I :8), and the worthy ob-
jects of man's desire (Matt. 6:33).
  There is only one gospel (Gal. i :8), and this was preached
to Abraham (Gal. 3 :8), and involved the coming of Christ in
the flesh as his seed (verse 16). Wherever the gospel is men-
tioned, therefore, it is this same gospel of the kingdom, the
gospel of righteousness by faith, the gospel of the gift of the
Son of God to the human family. See, Rom. I :I-4, 16, 17.

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars will be at some
                              future period."
               STUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                       9

  Just before the coming of the Lord this gospel is to be
preached to all the world (Rev. 14:6) in a threefold message,
directing all to the worship of the Creator (verse 7), setting
forth the result of turning from this true worship (verse 8),
warning against the worship of the beast and his image (verses
9, to), and showing the result of accepting this gospel mes-
sage (verse 12). When the gospel of the kingdom, as set forth
in these verses, has been preached in all the world, the Lord will
come (verse 14), and the harvest of the earth will be reaped.
(verse 16; Matt. 13:39).

                   SUGGESTIONS FOR STU DY.

  Hold closely in your study to the line of thought suggested
in the lesson. There are many other things taught in these
texts, but they are used in this lesson to develop a special
theme. Try to get such a grasp of the scriptures used in this
lesson that they shall present to your mind a connected chain of
 bought concerning the nature of this gospel of the kingdom
and the message in which it is to be preached just before the
coming of the Lord. When this is clearly seen, other scrip-
tures will readily associate themselves with the theme and will
broaden the view of the subject.



  LESSON 11.—THE QUESTION OF SUPREMACY.

                         April. 12, 1902.

  In Rev. 14 :6-14 we have a brief statement of the gospel of
the kingdom as adapted to the special circumstances which will
exist just before the second coming of the Lord. In the very
hour of God's judgment the controversy over the law of God
comes to its climax. Shall the supremacy of God be acknowl-
edged or the supremacy of the beast and his image? Shall the
Creator be worshiped, or shall the beast and his image be wor-
shiped? In order that we may have a clear view of what is
involved in these questions, we must see plainly what the real
issue is.
           The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
               STUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                     21

   The beast of Rev. i4 :9 is evidently the same one mentioned
in Rev. 13:14, to whom an image was to be made, and this
beast is shown to be the same one spoken of in verses 2 and 3
of the same chapter by the reference to the deadly wound.
This beast receives from the dragon "his [the dragon's] power,
and his seat [throne], and great authority." But the dragon is
Satan (Rev. 12:9) ; and so, when all the world worship the
dragon and the beast (Rev. 13 :4), who is simply the representa-
tive of the dragon. they are acknowledging the supremacy of
Satan. This they do by asking the question, '`Who is like unto
the beast?" Verse 4. But this is the very question in which
the supremacy of God is set forth (Ex. 15:11 Ps. 89:3), as
well as in the direct statement (Jer. 10:7). And so the real
question to be settled in the last generation is this, Who 'is
God? Who is the rightful king? Whose supremacy is to be
acknowledged? Shall Jehovah or Satan be worshiped? But this
 is not a new issue. It is the old issue, but now it is to be finally
settled. Christ beheld Satan fallen from heaven (Luke io:i8,
 R. V.) just as the prophecy declares the fact (Isa. 14:12-14),
and the cause was his effort to take the place belonging to God.
 Our first parents fell because of their effort to do the same
thing. Gen. 3:4, 5. R. V. To man, who failed to recognize that
he was made in the likeness of God (Gen. 1:26), and so lost that
likeness, the gospel of the kingdom was preached (Gen. 3:15).
which will restore the fallen one to be, "like Him" (i John
3:2). The gospel of the kingdom teaches the supremacy of God
as the true King, the Creator, as the One to be worshiped and
served, in direct opposition to Satan's demand for worship and
service. and the gift of the Son of God in the flesh, that man
might he restored to the high position of likeness to God and
the privilege of being servant to the King of the universe.
                             QUESTIONS.
    I. Where do we find an outline of the gospel message which
is to usher in the coming of the Lord?
    2. What is the time? What is the subject of the contro-
versy? What are the questions to be answered?
    3. How can the beast mentioned in Rev. 14:9 be identified
with the first beast mentioned in the thirteenth chapter of
 Revelation?
    4. To whom is this beast indebted for all that makes him
great? Whose servant, then, is he?
    _5. Who is the dragon? Who is his representative? What,
then, would the worship of the beast really be?

             The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
I2              STUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

    6. In what question is the worship expressed?
    7. Mention the first instance in which this same question is
asked concerning God. The second. The third.
    8. What, then, is the real question at issue? What is now
to be done in regard to this question?
    9. In what condition did Christ see Satan?      4
   10. How is this expressed in the prophecy? What was the
cause of it?
  IL Whom did "that old serpent" tempt into the same experi-
ence?
  12. What fact was not recognized and acknowledged?
  13. In what promise was the gospel of the kingdom then
preached?
  14. When it is fully accepted, what change will be wrought?
  15. What is taught in this gospel of the kingdom?
                           SUGGESTIONS.

   Read carefully the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth chapters
of Revelation, that the whole picture may be clearly in mind. Do
not try to interpret the symbols in this lesson, as the present pur-
pose is simply to settle some principles. The specific interpreta-
tion will come later. Be sure that the, main point of the lesson,
the question of supremacy as involved in worship and service, is
brought out with clearness. The first part of the chapter in
"Patriarchs and Prophets," "Satan's Enmity against the Law,"
might be read in connection with this lesson.



LESSON 1H.—THE GREAT CONTROVERSY TRANS-
          FERRED TO THE EARTH.
                          April 19, 1902.

   The controversy between Christ and Satan began in heaven
 (Rev. 12:7) in a face-to-face combat. Satan was not content
with the position which he held as Lucifer (Isa. 14:12), or
light-bearer, as the name signifies; but he indulged the ambition
to "be like the Most High," and thus to be light itself (I John
I :5) and the source of light. Since light is only a manifesta-
tion of life (John I :4), this was the demand of a created being
 (Eze. 28:55) to be a source or fountain of life, which could

              Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
                 STUDIES ON Tile GOSPEL MESSAGE.                         13

only be granted to the begotten Son (John 5:26), one with the
 Father, the real Fountain (Ps. 36:9).
   Having lost his place in heaven (Rev. 12:7, 8), Satan sought
to establish his kingdom in the earth (verse 9). By falsehood
 (Gen. 3:4), and by transferring his own evil ambition into
the human mind (verse 5), he changed a / loyal servant of God
into a servant of sin and himself (Rom. 6:16), usurped his
dominion, and became prince of this world (John 12:31).
Christ came to this world to seek and to save that which was
lost. Luke 19 ao. Thus the controversy which was begun in
heaven was transferred to this earth. There it was the ques-
tion of the supremacy of God, through His Son, in heaven;
here it is the same question in its relation to man and the earth.
Shall the government of God be sustained in the earth,'or shall
Satan establish an independent kingdom? The Son of God,
as Michael. the leader of the angels, conquered Satan in heaven
 (Rev. 12 :7-9), and then, in behalf of man, He undertook, as the
Son of man, to conquer him on earth, and thus to vindicate
the righteousness and justice of the government of God, the
everlasting King. This is the gospel of the kingdom. It
means a Saviour in our flesh (Luke 2:10, II), to save from
sin (Matt. 1 :21), to be the channel of life to man (John to:to).

         LESSON IV.—THE TWO MYSTERIES.
                             24firi/ 26, 1902.

   In the gospel of the kingdom as first preached (Gen. 3:15),
and again proclaimed to Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3, 7), the prom-
ised Seed was the center of hope. This promised Seed was
the coming Messiah, the Christ (Gal. 3:16), the revelation of
the Father to the world (Matt.       :27), "God with us" (Matt.
1 :23). This union of divinity with humanity is the foundation
of Christianity. It is the heart and soul of all religious expe-
rience. Gal. 2:20. This manifestation of God in the flesh in
the person of His Son is the revelation of the secret of the
ages (Rom. 16:25, 26), and is "the mystery of godliness"
 (i Tim. 3:16).
   In the development of the gospel, every further revelation of
divine truth has been met by Satan with a counterfeit of the
truth. And so "the mystery of iniquity" was Satan's answer
to "the mystery of godlin;ss;" hut the Scripture unmasks the
deception. In the second chapter of 2 Thessalonians such a
manifestation of sin is described as might, in an accommodated
sense, be called the incarnation of Satan. This is "the falling
away" (verse 3, R. V.), and the revelation of the "man of sin."
The self-exaltation and the opposition to God set forth in, the
following verse correspond exactly to Daniel's prophecy of the
work of the "little horn," which Lad "eyes like the eyes of
man, and a mouth speaking great things." Dan. 7:8. The

"Pray ye Therefore the Lord of the harvest thit He will send forth laborers
                           into His harvest."
               gTUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.


whole chapter gives a view of the final stage of the controversy
between the "little horn" (the man of sin) and the Son of man.
In saying that "the man of sin " " opposeth " (or acts the part
of an adversary), he is identified as the direct representative
of Satan. See Zech. 3:1 and margin. And this again identifies
" the man of sin " with the first beast of Revelation 13, to whom
the dragon (Satan, Rev. 12:9) gave his own power. It thus ap-
pears that the controversy now is between the same., persons and
over the same issues as at the beginning—the controversy between
Christ and Satan for the supremacy—when "there was war in
heaven." Then it was a face-to-face combat in heaven. Now
the warfare has been transferred to the earth (Rev. 12:9), and
Christ in the flesh is to meet and vanquish Satan in the flesh.
And so "the mystery of godliness" is the only real answer to
"the mystery of iniquity." This, then, must be the principal
theme of the message against the beast and his image.

        LESSON V.—THE GIFT OF THE SEED.

                            May 3, 1902.

   The message for this generation is "the everlasting gospel"
 (Rev. 14:6), 'the one only gospel (Gal. :8), the gospel for all
nations, as it was declared to Abraham (Gal. 3:8), and all
contained in the original promise of the final triumph of the
Seed of the woman Gen. 3:15). We shall now study the devel-
opment of this promise to its triumphant consummation in the
present generation in the coming of the Seed (Gal. 3:19).
   The Seed is the Word of God. Luke 8 :Ir. This was the
original Seed of all things (Gen. r : r ; Ps. 33 :6; Heb. II :3, first
part), and was, therefore, Himself the Word of God, the Seed
of the universe. Through Him all things came into being.
John :3. All things were born (created) in Him. Col. :16,
R. V. In Him was the creative or germinating principle
 (John 5:26), and the sustaining principle for all things (Col.
1:17, R. V.). As the Word of God, the Seed, all things, vis-
ible and invisible, were contained germinally in Him. All
worlds and all powers were in the Seed of the universe. The
gospel was not the revelation of a new power, but the new appli-
cation of an old power (Rom. 1:16) to save from sin. In the
giving of the Son of God to and for humanity, which was
involved in the first announcement of the gospel. (Gen. 3:15),
the wonderful thing was not that He should be a Seed, for this
He was already, but that the Seed of the universe should con-
descend to become the seed of the woman, the germ of a new
humanity, was, even in the eyes of the heavenly host, an unpar-
alleled exhibition of love (John 3:16). This is the condescension
which makes us great. Ps. 18:35, R. V., margin. This is the
unspeakable gift. 2 Cor. 9 :15.
                            QUESTIONS.
   I. In what expression is the message for this time defined?
   2. In what emphatic way is the existence of more than one
gospel denied?
   3. How early, and in what specific statement, was it shown
that this was the gospel for all nations?
   4. In what simple promise is this complete gospel originally
found?
           "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.

   5. When will the fulness of the blessing in this promise be
experienced?
   6. What is the seed? Is there any other seed? Could there
be more than one seed and yet only one gospel?
   7. What came from this seed? What is this process called?
   8. Who was the Seed of the universe? What "more excel-
lent name" shows the relationship to God, which is the basis
of this great truth?
   9. How much owes its existence to this Seed?
  io. What gift placed Him on an equality with the Father?
  IL In whom is the existence of all things maintained?
  12. How much was contained in the Seed of the universe?
  13. In what sense only was the gospel a new revelation?
  14. What was the wonderful and new thing in the provision
for man's salvation?
  15. What led to this wonderful gift?
  16. What has such condescension done 'for tis?
  17. What expression indicates the infinite greatness of the
gift?


        LESSON VI.—FAITH IS THE VICTORY.
                            May zo, 1902.

  Inasmuch as the Word of God is the Seed, it follows that
whatever is promised by the Word of God is ,contained in the
promise itself. Faith is the act by which we obtain from the
Word of God, as a present reality, the benefit of what has not yet
been manifested to physical sight. Heb. ii :s, R. V. This is the
only basis upon which we can deal acceptably with God. Heb,
is :6. Faith must always deal with the Word of God (Rom,
r0:17), regarding the performance as certainly involved in the
promise (Rom. 4:20, 21). Thus faith in the promised Seed
(Gen. 3:15), whose name was to be called Immanuel, "God with
us" (Matt. 1:23), who was the manifested power and wisdom
of God (I Cor. 1:24), brought humanity the present experience
of the blessings of the gospel. The Seed, which was Christ or
the Messiah (Gal. 3:16), the life of all that lives (John 14:6),
was given in the promise of the Seed (Gen. 3:15). In this
gift of the Seed of all things was contained germinally the
gift of all things, visible and invisible. Col. 1:16, R. V. But
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to
                               harvest."
 8              STUDIES ON .THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

 the possession of these things depended wholly upon a living
 faith in the promised Seed. As soon as faith in the word of
promise as the Seed, and as containing in itself the things prom-
 ised, was exchanged for a fleshly confidence in that which is
 merely outward and visible, the power of the promise was no
longer experienced. Even the visible things—the land, the
temple, the service—already revealed through faith in the prom-
ise, were lost. This is the summary of the experience of God's
people during the long centuries of the preparation, and before
"the fulness of the time was come." Gal. 4 :4. It was the der ling
of men with the unseen things of the kingdom, through their
faith in the Word of God, which made possible the experiences
recorded in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. Abraham's test was
to reveal whether his faith rested in the flesh of Isaac as the
fulfilled promise of a son in whom the Seed should be !Called,
or whether he still rested only upon the 'power of the word
of promise. Heb. 11!17-19.
   All these men of faith believed in the coming kingdom, and
lived and died in that faith, although not yet receiving the
kingdom outside of the promise. Verse 1'3. But this very
faith brought to them the power of the kingdom, "the powers
of the world - to come" (Heb. 6:5), and made the invisible
kingdom a reality in them (Luke 17:2o, 21). As righteousness
is the scepter of the power of the kingdom (Heb. r :8), believers
in the promised Seed as the hope of the restored kingdom
shared in the restoring power to save them from sin, and thus
became righteous through their faith.
                              QUESTIONS.

    r. What is contained in every promise of God? Why is this?
    2. What does the Scripture declare faith to be? What pres-
ent experience results from the proving of things not seen
    3. Is there any other basis for an acceptable experience with
God?
    4. What must be the basis of any genuine faith? What does
faith see in a promise of God?
    5. What was the promised Seed afterward declared to be?
    6. How did these blessings become a present reality as soon
as the Seed was promised?
    7. What was really given in the promise of the Seed?
   8. In what way could the benefit of this gift be realized?

ises before the manifestation of Christ in the flesh he briefly

    LESSON VIL—THE COrlING OF THE SEED,

                            May 17, 1902.

   In the first announcement of the gospel (Gen. 3:15), the hope
of salvation was made to rest upon a coming Deliverer (Rom.
11 :26), who should appear in the flesh as the Seed of the
woman. This was the last Adam, the second man. i Cor.
1 5 :45, 47. By this promise human nature was brought into
a personal relation with divinity (2 Peter 1:4), and the pro-
vision made for that power to conquer Satan and sin which
is the very essence of the gospel (Rom. 1:16). It was faith
in this revelation of Christ in the flesh as a present Saviour
which made Abel's sacrifice "more excellent" (Heb. II :4), which
resulted in the translation of Enoch (verse 5), and which
brought to Noah the experience of righteousness (verse 7).
It was the rejection of this gospel message which permitted
corruption and violence to increase (Isa. 24:5; Gen. 6:II, 12),
and bring destruction upon the earth (verse 13).
   To Abraham the same gospel was preached (Gal. 3:8). and
abundant blessings promised. on condition that he should
forsake all (Gen. 12:1-3).      To him God made a promise
(verse 7) which involved the coming of the Seed, the Messiah
 (Gal. 3:16). In the further development of this promise we
find that it meant the restoration of the earth to man (Rohl.
4:13) for all everlasting possession (Gen. 13:15; 17:7, 8). But
it was distinctly stated that the consummation of these prom-
ises would not come during the natural lifetime of Abraham
 (Gen. 15:15), and they, therefore, included the resurrection
of the dead. This was "the hope of the promise made of God
unto our fathers (Acts 26:6-8). and included the coming of
the Lord and the new earth (2 Peter 3 :9-13).
                              QUESTIONS.
    I. What has been the central thought in the gospel from the
first announcement made in Eden?

 We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of our field.

LESSON VIM—A TENT OF IlEETING AND THE
           TRUE TEMPLE.
                              May 24t, 1902.

  The everlasting covenant with Abraham (Gen. 17:7-9) was
renewed to Isaac (Gen 26:1-4) and to Jacob (Gen. 28:13, 14),
with all that was involved in the original promises. And the
chief thing in all this was the gift of the Son of God in the
flesh as the power of the promise to restore all things. John
8:56. In the altar which the patriarchs built wherever they
settled temporarily (Gen. 13:7, 8, 18; 26:25; 33:20, and the
services connected with it; in Abraham's experience with
Melchizedek (Gen. 14:17-20), and in other instances which need
not be specifically mentioned, the same lesson was being taught

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars will be at some
                              future period."
               STUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                       21

which, was afterward given in a more detailed form in the
tabernacle and its services. The truth thus revealed was the
incarnation of the Son of God (John 2 :18-21) and His mediator-
ship in the flesh (i Tim. 2:5). In thus dwelling among them
(Ex. 25:8; 29:45), and walking in a tabernacle (2 Sam. 7:6),
God was setting forth His plan, through which even fallen
humanity could again become the temple of the living God
(2 Cor. 6:16). Thus the tabernacle and its services, afterward
embodied in a more permanent form in the temple, constituted
a parable (Heb. 9:8, 9, R. V.), a concrete revelation of the
gospel. This "tent of meeting" (Ex. 29:42, R. V.), this "taber-
nacle of witness" (Acts 7:44), was constantly testifying to God's
purpose that humanity should be His temple, through the gift
of His Son in the flesh, who would become "the appointed meet-
ing-place between God and humanity" (John I :14, R. V., margin).
Thus only could the seed of the woman inflict the mortal wound
upon the serpent (Gen. 3:15) and save humanity (Heb. 2:14, is ) •
Thus would the foundation be laid (i Cor. 3:11) upon which
and is which would be established the true temple (Eph. 2:19-22),
the church (i Tim. 3:15), the body (Col. 1 :18) of Him who is the
greater and more perfect tabernacle (Heb. :11, 12), who was
to build the temple of the Lord by becoming the Branch and
growing up (Zech. 6:12, 13).

   2. To whom were they next made?

     LESSON IX.—THE LAW OF GOD IN THE ARK
               AND IN THE HEART.
                            Nay 3r, 19oz.
   The tabernacle, as a mere building for the indwelling glory
(Ex: 25:8; 29:43), was a constant prophecy of the - divine-human
temple in which His glory was to be manifested (John 1:14).
The services of the tabernacle were an actual provision for
present salvation, which was also a promise of the ministry
of Christ in and through His taking the flesh. Heb. 9:6-12.
The tabernacle was the home of the ark (2 Sam. 7 :2), which
was the receptacle for the law of God, the ten commandments
(Deut. 50:3-5). All the services of the tabernacle had ref-
erence to man's relationship to that law (Heb.      ; I John 3 :4)
and the mediatorial work of Christ, through which the law would
he put into the mind and heart of man (Hell 8 :6, io). This
was accomplished by His coming in the flesh to live the law in and
for humanity. Ps. 40:7, 8. Thus the power of the endless life
was provided in the place of merely fleshly effort (Heb. 7:16),
and the dead letter was changed into the living promise (John
12 :50 ; Rom. 8:2). God made choice of Abraham as the head of
a people to whom He committed in a special manner the keeping
of the truths of the gospel (Rom. 9:4), that through them
He might teach His law to the world as the blessing of His
indwelling life to save from sin, through the mediation of His
Son in the flesh (Acts 3:25; 26). Their whole experience there-
after was a preparation for, and a fact-prophecy of, the coming
Messiah, the incarnation of the Son of God. Not only did "all
the prophets" teach this fundamental truth (Acts 3:24), but
it was brought out in their history. Just in proportion as they
made. the teaching of the sanctuary and its services a reality
in their lives, the power of this truth was shown in national
prosperity. Deut. 28:13. If they refused to make this revela-
tion of the truth through the obedience of faith, then came
national adversity. Verses 58, 59, 62. And even in the men
whom God raised up to deliver His people when they turned

              The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
              STUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                   23

to Him, He was testifying.to them and to the world of the
salvation through the great Deliverer, who was to reveal Him-
self in humanity. Read Psalms 105 and 026, and note especially
Ps. 105 :42-45 and Ps. 106 :39-45.

      LESSON X.—THE PROMSES TO DAVID,
                          June 7, 1902.

  The whole history of the children of Israel is of special value
at this time (I Cor.    :12), but we are necessarily limited to
the consideration of some special experiences. The time during
which the chosen people of God were made the depositaries of
the divine law is divided into three periods (Matt. I :17), and

            The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
24            STUDIES ON THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

the limit of each one constitutes a pivotal point in the history.
In this brief outline of the development of the original promise
of the Seed (Gen. 3:15), we now pass from the promise to
Abraham, and shall next consider the promise to David. This
naturally leads to a study of the seventh chapter of 2 Samuel.
                 QUESTIONS ON 2 SAM. 7:I-17.

   1. Under what circumstances did David's thought turn
toward the Lord's house?
   2. What did he say to the prophet Nathan?
   3. What reply did Nathan make to him?
   4. What experience did Nathan have the following night?
   5. What question was he instructed to ask of David?
   6. What was the period of time during which the Lord had
not dwelt in a house? What had He done during this time?
   7. Had the Lord during all this time demanded that a house
should be built for Him?
   8. What was David's occupation when the Lord called him?
To what work did He appoint him?

  The primary object in this and the next lesson should be to
become familiar with exactly what is said in this chapter. When
this has been done, we shall be better prepared to understand
what is meant by what is said. The main theme of the vision

               Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.

is evidently the king and his house. It is simply "the king"
who is first introduced. David is mentioned by name only twice
in the vision, and in each case it is "My servant David." As
long as His people were journeying from place to place, and
lived in tents, the Lord walked with them and made a tent His
dwelling-place. Now that the people have a more permanent
home, He will permit them to build Him a more permanent
temple as His dwelling-place, where His worship shall be con-
ducted. But He first emphasizes the fact tint He will make
David a house. And the vision closes with the emphatic dec-
laration that David's house, and David's..kingdom, and David's
throne "shall be established forever."


     LESSON XL—DAVID'S RESPONSE TO THE

  14. How did David express his confidence that what God had
said would be performed?
  15. For what blessing did he then ask? Why could he expect
this?
  16. How long did he ask that the blessing might be continued?
                                 NOTES.
  Note what was uppermost in David's mind as the result of
the revelation which the prophet had made to him. By the power
of His Word the Lord had united his house with eternity.
"David's house" and "forever" would hereafter include the same
immeasurable time, as the Lord had spoken them together.
When the Lord talked about his house that way, it would surely
be so, for in His Word, as the seed, was the thing promised.
  David showed the spirit of true humility by acknowledging
his own unworthiness, and yet accepting with unquestioning
faith the complete fulfilment of all that the Lord had• promised,
just as Mary did. Luke I :38. Because God was .God, His
words would surely come true, and the good thing which he
had talked about would become a matter of experience to David.
His seed would be "set up ;" his house would be "established
forever ;" his kingdom and his throne would be "established for-
ever." The eternal, everlasting, endless continuance of David's
house was now assured.



LESSON XIL—BUILDING THE HOUSE OP DAVID:
                             June 21, 1902.

  Through the tabernacle and its services God was teaching the
mystery of godliness,—God manifested in the flesh (I Tim.
3:15, 16), the King in His house. To show His purpose to
identify Himself with His people, He occupied the same kind
of a dwelling as they did (2 Sam. 7:6, 7), thus acting His word
as an object lesson before them (2 Cor. 6:16; Heb. 2 :14) . Now,
when David's heart is stirred to find out a settled place for the
Lord (Ps. 132:3-5), the Lord reveals to him that He will build
the house of David (2 Sam. 7:11, last clause); and make that
His permanent hotbe, .through the relationship which He would
establish with his family (verse 14, first clause).
  The real house is the people (Isa. 58:0, and is thus equivalent

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He Will send forth laborers
                            into His harvest."
               STUDti5 ON T 11E GOSPEL MESSAGE:.                        27

te household (2 Tim. 4:t9, A. V. and R. V.), or family (t Citron.
13:14). To build a house was to bring a son into the family.
Ruth 4:11. If a house continues forever, there must be .a son
in the family forever. When the Lord promised to establish
David's house and David's throne forever (a Sam. 7:16), He
renewed the promise of the Seed (Gen. 3 :15), and declared His
purpose to give His eternal Son to David's family (Isa. 9:6, 7)
to retain the flesh forever. This was the Seed of Abraham
(Gal. 3:29), the Seed of David (Rom. 1: 1-3), and the Son of
both (Matt.. :I). In Him Israel was brought into the relation
of a son (Ex. 4:22; Hosea II :1 ; Matt. 2:14, 15), and the fam-
ily on earth and the family in heaven were united (Eph. 3:14, 15)•
Read Luke 1:67-75.

ices?

LESSON XI11.—THE SURE MERCIES OF DAVID.
                          June 28, 1902.
    It is death which prevents the continuance of a house or fam-
 ily (Heb. 7:23) ; and sin is the cause, of death (James 1 :15) ;
and sin is disobedience to the law of God (I John 3:4). Right-
 eousness gives permanence to a house. Prov. 12:7. Therefore
 the promise to establish David's house forever (2 Sam. 7:16),
 and that his seed should never cease to exist (Ps. 8935, 36),
 was the promise of a Saviour to come in the flesh, who should
save from sin (Matt. 1:21), and bring to humanity complete
 victory over death and the grave (Rev. I :17, 18). This was
the blessing which David asked for his house (2 Sam. 7:29), the
blessing of righteousness by faith (Rom. 4:6-8), that righteous-
 ness which is the basis of God's eternal throne (Ps. 97:2), and
which has in it the assurance of eternity to man (Isa. 51:7, 8).
   Through the promises made unto David of a throne and a
house to be established forever, the covenant was made that
the Son of God should become the Son of man and occupy
David's throne (Luke 1:31, 32), as David's Son (Matt. 22:41, 42 ) .
This is the last Adam, the second Man (I Cor. 15:45-47), the
head of the new humanity, the promised Seed. Thus David's_
house became the Lord's house, and in this union of divinity
with humanity the rock foundation was laid upon which the
house was to be built which would continue eternally. Matt.
0:15-18. We personally share in "the sure mercies of David"
by building upon the sure foundation (Isa. 28:16), and becom-
ing a spiritual house (I Peter 2 :4, 5), the temple of the Lord
(Eph. 2:21, 22). In this house the law of God is enshrined
(Heb. 8 :to), as in the tabernacle of old, and over it Christ
the Loud is also Son (Heb. 3:6), as the pledge of its eternal
continuance.
                            QUESTIONS.
     I. What causes the extinction of a house?
  2. Of what is death the result?
  3. What does the Scripture declare sin to be?
  4. What will cause a house to stand permanently?
  5. What promise was made, concerning David's throne? •
  6. What promise was made concerning his seed?
  7. Whose coining was bound up in these promises? For
what purpose?
  8. What victory was thus assured for humanity?    '
  9. With what petition did David close his prayer after
Nathan's vision had been told to him?
           "There shall be delay no longer "—our confidence.

   ro. What is the experience of this blessing?
   Ir. What relation does this righteousness sustain to God's
 throne?
   12. Because of -its very nature, what will it be to the one
who receives it?
   13. In the fulfilment of the promises to David, who would
occupy his throne?
   14. As David's throne was a man's throne; what must he be-
come who sits upon it?
   15. What names does the Scripture give to tins occupart of
the throne?
   16. What foundation was laid by giving the Son of God to
humanity? What. • has been built upon this foundation? What
will this house be able to resist? Why?
   17. What is the 'experience through which we shall be able
to share in the benefit of the promises to David? What do we
thus become?        ..
   18. What will he found in this house?
   19. What is the assurance that all the members of this house
will live forever?

Words of Good Cheer
    We leave been delighted to know that our people are
all more than pleased with the recent change in "The
Sentinel." Our letter files are full of words of good cheer.
We would like to have you read them all, but space for-
bids. Here are a few:—


    The first number of The Sentinel for the year 1902 is excellent.
The number ranks high in tone, and reveals thorough work on
the part of the editor and all others aiding in its make-up.
    I had feared that the change to a monthly magazine was un-
wise. It did not seem that a monthly could be fast enough for the
hour. This number allays the remnant of that fear. Am satisfied
its present form is best fitted for successfully doing the work
to which it is called.
  Cincinnati, Ohio.                             M. S. BABCOCK.


     I am very much pleased with the change that has been made
in the form of The Sentinel, for I believe in this way it will be
very much more acceptable to the people than in its old shape.
I shall do all I can for The Sentinel and its work.
   Dallas, Texas.                              C. N. WOODWARD.


     It seems to me that The Sentinel is now a magazine that is
worthy of notice from every one, as far as appearance is concerned;
and what can be said of the matter in it is far ahead of anything
that one would be able to say of its appearance.
  Oakland, Cal.                                  W. V. SAMPLE.


   Whenever I read The Sentinel, I think it ought to be in the
hands of all who by their occupation or position have an influence
in molding opinion, and I wish I could do more to extend its cir-
culation among that class.
  Mountain Grove, Mo.                          J. S. TUCKER.
SOME THINGS WHICH ARE NOW
       BEING DONE
     The Retail Clerks' Association of Illinois are very persistent in
their demands for Sunday closing of stores by law. This movement
is being given national prominence by the press of the country.
     The question of whether the United States shall send an am-
bassador to the Vatican has been given much attention of late.
     Never before was there such a general and wide-spread move-
ment to enforce Sunday closing of all stores, saloons, etc.
     Rev. Dr. James B. Dunn, of the National Temperance Society,
makes the following remarkable and significant statement:—
    The battle now upon us means the triumph or overthrow of American insti-
tutions. . . . The American Sunday, by the statutes and fundamental laws
of the land, is recognized as a day of exemption from civil labor. It is an
American institution. . . . The American people are not prepared to ex-
change their God-given, time-hallowed, and honored Sunday for the European
Sunday.
    The Sentinel has done a very great work in the past in edu-
cating leading men—statesmen, politicians, molders of public
opinicn everywhere—in the true principles of liberty. The princi-
ples are the same to-day, and The Sentinel still advocates those
principles with as much energy as it ever did. It should be in the
hands of every citizen. To encourage giving it a wide circulation
we make the following
                               OFFER
    To ally one sending us a list of five or more names, we will
address, wrap and?nail The Sentinel for three months for 20 cents
per name. In clubs of five or more copies sent to one address the
rate is 70 cents a copy per year. To those who take 25 or more
copies per month for house-to-house work or for street sales, we
make the rate 5 cents per copy. Single subscriptions $I.00 per
year. Please note these rates carefully.
    In every community there are large numbers of people who
ought to have The Sentinel, so every church should be taking a
club of this periodical. Will you not agitate this important matter
in your church?
