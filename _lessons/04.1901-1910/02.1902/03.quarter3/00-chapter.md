LESSON I.—THE GOSPEL MESSAGE IS FOR ALL
              THE WORLD.
                           July 5, 1902.
  The time between the promises to Abraham (Gen.
12 : 1-3) and the birth of the Messiah is divided into three
periods (Matt. 1 :17), each one of which is marked off by
experiences which are pivotal in the history of Israel. We
have already given some study to the promises to Abraham
and to David in our previous lessons, and we shall now
deal with some of the circumstances which led up to the
captivity in Babylon.
  Special blessings were given to Israel (Rom. 9:4) that
they might minister them to all nations (Ps. 67:1, 2). If
they were faithful to their high privilege, they would rule
over the nations (Deut. 15:5, 6). Unfaithfulness to their
trust would make them subject to the nations. Deut.
28:15, 37. This is the explanation of the varying experi-
ences of victory and defeat in the history of God's people
among the nations, and of their captivity in Babylon.
 "The advent message to the world in this generation"—our watchword.
4           STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

The experience of Hezekiah will illustrate the principle.
Brought face to face with death (Isa. 38: I), he turned to
God with weeping (verse 3), and the gospel of life was
declared to him by the prophet Isaiah (verses 4, 5). The
sign of his salvation from death (verses 7, 8) was God's
method of arousing Babylon to send to Jerusalem to inquire
for the gospel of life (2 Chron. 32:31; Isa. 39: I). But
Hezekiah exalted himself instead of proclaiming the gift
of God's life to him. Isa. 39:2-4. This failure to improve
the opportunity to spread a knowledge of the God who
manifests Himself in flesh made communion with Babylon
a curse instead of a blessing (2 Chron. 32:25), and was the
occasion of a direct prophecy of the captivity (Isa. 39:6, 7).
                           QUESTIONS.
    1. Into how many periods is the time from Abraham to
Christ divided by the divine historian? How long was each
one? What events marked the beginning and close of
each?
    2. What special privileges were granted to Israel?
    3. What was God's purpose in thus letting special light
shine upon His people?
    4. What result would follow when they acted in har-
mony with God's plan?
    5. What would be the result of failure to receive and
impart the light of truth?
    6. What message was sent to Hezekiah in his sickness?
    7. What plea did he present to the Lord? What
showed his earnestness?
   8. What comforting response did the Lord make to
him? What new measure of life was granted unto him?

    9. For what purpose was a sign promised unto him?
   io. What was the promised sign? Did it actually take
place?
    t. How was this sign regarded in Babylon? Why
would they be sure to regard such an astronomical marvel?
   12. What did the king of Babylon hear was connected
with_this sign?
   13. What did he do as a consequence of hearing this
news?
  14. After what were the messengers from Babylon really
inquiring? What did Hezekiah show them? In taking
this course what did he really do?
  15. What inquiry did Isaiah then make of Hezekiah?
What was the reply? What was Isaiah'g next question?
What was Hezekiah's answer?
  16. What was the cause of Hezekiah's failure to teach
the gospel of life to the men of Babylon? What was the
consequence?
  17. What prophecy was uttered concerning the treasures
in Jerusalem? What would happen to some of the royal
seed?

     LESSON IL—CERErIONIALIS11 LEADS TO
                 BONDAGE.
                            July   12, 1902.

  Although the Lord had done so much for His people
(Isa. 5:3, 4), yet they did not yield the fruits of righteous-
ness (verse 7). Their service was mere formalism (Isa.
29:13); their confidence was placed in that which was
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to
                              harvest,"
6            STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

merely external (Jer. 7:4), and their ceremonialism be-
came an offense to God (Isa. 1:11-15). Thus what was
given as a means of salvation from sin was perverted into a
place of protection for sinners ( Jer. 7:9-10, and this led
to the announcement of the destruction of the temple (verse
14), and the scattering of the people (verse 15). Confi-
dence in the flesh left the people under the power of sin
(Jer. 17:5, 6), and this made them the prey of their enemies
(Jer. 5:6). The evil which was deferred during the days
of Hezekiah (2 Chron. 32:26), began to come in the days
of his son. The sin of Manasseh was very great (2 Chron.
33:9), and all messages of reproof were disregarded (verse
to). Then the Lord used other means of dealing with His
people (verse t), which had the desired effect (verse 12),
and opened the way for the Lord to work a deliverance
(verse 13 ). The wicked reign of Amon (verses 21-
23) was followed by a great reformation under King
Josiah (2 Chron. 34:33), but the next king returned to the
evil ways of his fathers (2 Kings 23:31, 32), and Jerusalem
became tributary to Egypt (verse 33). The people lost
their independence, and a foreign king appointed their ruler.
2 Chron. 36:4. A continued course of evil (verse 5)
brought upon the people the wrath which was kindled in
the days of Hezekiah (2 Chron. 32:25), and Jerusalem
came under the power of Babylon (2 Chron. 36:6, 7).
                             QUESTIONS.

    1. Who were called upon to judge of the Lord's deal-
ing with His people?
    2. What inquiry showed the fulness of His provision for
      The offerings for this gyatler go tq AlAe 1.1.1.44t needy fields.

them? What question reveals their failure to meet His
expectation?
    3. What fruit ought the Lord to find upon His "pleas-
ant plant"? What did He actually find?
    4. In what ways did the people make a profession of
religion? What was lacking? What became the basis of
their teaching?
    5. What shows that they had lost sight of the reality of
the teaching of the sanctuary and its services?
    6. What were some of the outward forms of service
which the Lord Himself had established for His people?
Why did He reprove them for their zeal in these matters?
    7. To what extent had the people perverted the central
feature of their worship? How is the same thing being
done to-day?
    8. What former experience would be repeated as a
result of such a perversion? What would become of the
people?
    g. What kind of trust fails to deliver from the curse of
sin? In what comparison is this truth taught?
   io. What relation was there between the sins of the
people and their ability to hold their place among the
nations?
    1. What delayed the evil result of Hezekiah's wrong
course?
   12. What indicates the greatness of the sin of his son?
   13. What did both Manasseh and the people reject?
   14. What other means did the Lord then use to bring
 them to repentance?
   15. What effect did this have upon Manasseh?
  we expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of our field.

  16. What deliverance did the Lord then accomplish for
him? What lesson did this teach him?
  17. What course did the son of Manasseh pursue?
 _ 18. What happened during the reign of the son of
Amon?
  19. What is said of the reign of the son of Josiah?
  2o. What befell the nation as a consequence of his
conduct?

independence?

make?
  23. What king came to make war against him? With
what result?

downward course which ended in the Babylonish captivity?


     LESSON I11.—THE CURSE OF FORMALISM.
                            July 19, 1902.

  The position of God's chosen people was one of privi-
lege (Rom. 3: 1, 2), and, therefore, of corresponding
responsibility (Amos 3: I, 2). Because they would not
serve Him and thus make known to the nations His great
name and the gospel of His kingdom (Ps. 145: 10-13),
they lost their place among the nations (Deut. 28:47, 48).
But God's purpose was unchanged. When His people, as
an organized body, refused to be a channel for the gospel
to the nations, and sought to cover their sins under the
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars will lie at
                         some future period."
            STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                          9
cloak of Pharisaism, glorying in the holy city, the hoiy
temple, and the holy land, the Lord took from them all
these outward evidences of the covenant promise, that they
might learn how to worship Him (John 4:23, 24), and that
some of them, as captives, might do what the nation had
failed to do as conquerors. Those who knew the spiritual
nature of the kingdom of God, as Daniel and his com-
panions did, could be used to proclaim the gospel as a
living experience.
   More than a century before it came upon them the Lord
had specifically warned His people of the result of their
hypocrisy (Isa. 29:13, 14), and only a few years before
the captivity He had made it still more definite (Hab.
1:5, 6). Their own sinful course had brought its sure
result. I Chron. 9: t. They lost the Jerusalem experience
before they lost the visible city. Dan. 9: 16. They lost
the reality of the sanctuary services before they lost the
visible temple. Jer. 7: 8-14. It was serving strange gods
in their own land which scattered them in a strange land.
Jer. 5: 10. Thus was being emphasized the truth concern-
 ing the real dwelling-place of God (Acts 7:48), and the
 folly of glorying in anything except a personal knowledge
 of God was made plain (Jer. 9: 23, 24). Under these cir-
 cumstances occurred those events which are recorded in the
 book of Daniel.
                            QUESTIONS.
    I. What special trust was committed to God's ancient
people?
    2. What would inevitably follow their failure to make a
right use of their privileges?
      Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
TO          STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

    3. What did God design that His people should do for
Him among the nations?
    4. What resulted from their neglect to fulfil His pur-
pose concerning them?
    5. Why did the Lord take away from His people all
the outward evidences of His covenant promise?
    6. Who could still be used to carry out God's purpose
for the nations?
    7. In what message through the prophet Isaiah did the
Lord describe the hypocrisy of His people?
    8. What did He say would be the result of such a
course?
    9. In what prophecy did He make this warning more
definite as to time?
   10. What was the result of their continued transgression'?
        What led to the loss of their city?
   12. Why were they deprived of the temple and its
services?
   13. What was the real cause of their being captives in a
strange land?
   14. What great truth was thus being taught to them and
to us?
   15. What is the only thing of which man may rightly
boast?
   16: For what events did this experience of transgression
and consequent captivity prepare the way?




           The needs of the cause of God are world wide.

LESSON IV.—LIVINO TEMPLES ARE FOUND IN
                BABYLON.
                         July 26, 1902.

               QUESTIONS ON DAN. I : 1-7.
    1. What two kings are mentioned in verse 1?
    2. What invasion by one of these kings is here re-
corded? When did it occur?
    3. What was the result of this invasion? Whose will
was thus being accomplished?
    4. To what country were the vessels from the temple
taken?
    5. What was done with them there?
    6. What command did the king give to his chief cham-
berlain? Of what rank were these children to be?
    7. Name the different qualifications which were required
of those who were to be thus chosen.
    8. For what purpose were these youths thus selected?
    9. What provision did the king make for their diet?
   io. For how long a time were they to be thus fed and
instructed?
    1. For what position was this course of training to
prepare them?
   12. What young men are mentioned by name as being
among those selected?
   13. What Babylonish names were given to these youth?
                             NOTES.
  1. It would be well to read 2 Chron. 33: I; 36:7 in ordE r
to have early in mind the course of circumstances which
           The Son of God beggared Himself to-enrich us.
12          STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

led up to the Babylonish captivity. The book of Daniel
opens with the simple statement of a conflict between the king
of Jerusalem and the king of Babylon, and a record of the
fact that the Lord permitted Babylon to conquer Jerusalem.
We have already seen that it was because of transgression
that this experience came to God's people. i Chron. 9: r.
Reasoning from the Babylonish standpoint there was abun-
dant evidence of the superiority of the religion of Babylon
over the religion of Jerusalem. Back to the land from
which Abraham went forth the vessels of the temple are
carried, and they are placed in the idol temple at Babylon
as tokens of triumph. Those whose religion consisted
merely in the ritual service of the temple of stone may well
feel that they have lost their religion.• The real fact was
that as soon as their religion became nothing more to them
than a ritual service, it thereby became essentially Baby-
lonish in its nature, and even worse in God's sight because
of rejected light. Therefore, Babylon triumphed over
them.
     2. The Lord's purpose that the gospel shall be preached
to all nations through the ministry of those who know the
truth is repeatedly set forth. About two centuries and a
half previous to the time of this lesson, when Nineveh was
the capital of the heathen world, God sent a warning
message to that city (Jonah r : 1, 2), and thus saved them
from destruction. His purpose is the same .for Babylon,
and as His people had shut away the gospel message of life
from Babylon, even when they sent up to Jerusalem after
it (2 Chron. 32 : 31), He now sends His people to Babylon
in captivity, but sends among them those who will give His
             Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
              STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                            13

message in Babylon. The power of the true gospel of the
indwelling life will reveal itself even under these apparently
adverse circumstances. Although the temple at Jerusalem
had been profaned and the typical service interfered with,
yet there are those among the captives who will make
known the true temple teaching. To open the way for this
the Lord stirred up the- mind of the king of Babylon to
select some of the captives to receive a training to stand
before him. The requirements demanded in these youth
could best be met by those who had retained the purity of
 the gospel in their experience, and this naturally gave to
 Daniel and his three companions places among those
selected for the king's court.
   3. Judging from the outward circumstances, the religion
 of Babylon was the best in the world, the wisdom of
 Babylon was superior to any other, and, naturally enough,
 the diet of Babylon would be regarded as best adapted to
 the needs of those who were to be instructed in the wisdom
 of Babylon. The king of Babylon seemed to recognize a
 relation between the physical and the mental, and so he
 provided the very best diet for these young captives,
 according to the Babylonish standard. Since Babylon has
 conquered Jerusalem, who shall say that the Babylonish
 diet does not develop more and better powers, both of mind
 and body, than any other diet? It was under these circum-
 stances, when true principles had apparently failed, and
 those who did not themselves know the experience of true
 principles were likely to become confused, that Daniel and
 his companions were brought to the front to bear witness to
 the truth in Babylon.
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness
              unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

LESSON V.—PRESERVING' THE TEl1i3LE FROM
             DEFILEMENT.

                            August 2, 1902.

                   QUESTIONS ON DAN. I          :8-16.

    I. What principle ruled Daniel's life?
    2. What special circumstances opened the way for a
violation of this principle?
    3. In what request was the ruling principle of his life
revealed?
    4. How had the Lord prepared the way that this
request might receive some consideration?
    5. In his reply to Daniel's request, what did the prince
of the eunuchs say was his attitude toward his king? What
had the king decided upon in this particular case?
    6. What unfavorable result did the prince of the
eunuchs expect would follow any departure from the diet
ordered by the king? In what personal danger would this
involve him?
    7. What reasonable trial did Daniel then suggest?
What diet did he ask for himself and his companions?
    8. What test was to determine the comparative value of
the two kinds of diet? What would this result decide?
    9. What answer was made to Daniel's request?
   fo. At the end of the ten days' trial what was the
physical condition of Daniel and his companions?
    1. What permanent change was accordingly made in
their bill of fare?
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers
                           into His harvest."

                              NOTES.
   1. The only life in the universe is God's life. Ps. 36:9.
" He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things."
Acts 17. : 25. Those who lay hold upon God's life through
faith in God's gift of His Son (r John 5 : II, 12) become
temples for this life (I Cor. 3: 16), and living stones in
God's house (I Peter 2 :4, 5). When a believer in the
gospel defiles his body he defiles the temple of God, and
this means destruction. i Cor. 3 :17.
   2. Now it was because the people of Jerusalem had lost
sight of the fact that they themselves should be the temple
of God, and that this was the essence of true religion, and
had fixed their minds upon a temple of stone as the Lord's
temple, and had substituted mere ceremonialism for the
true religion of the heart and life, that they had been
deprived of their beautiful temple, the outward services
were interrupted, and all the ceremonials of religion had
ceased.
   3. But during all this experience Daniel and his compan-
ions had been true to right principles, and, knowing their
value, they clung to them in Babylon as to their life, for
such they were. The test of loyalty to principle came to
them over the question of their food. " Why did Daniel
and his companions refuse to eat at the king's table? Why
did they refuse his meats and wines?—Because they had
been taught that this class of food would not keep the mind
or the physical structure in the very best condition of health
to do God's service. The four Hebrew captives were
thereafter permitted to have the diet they had chosen.
What effect did it have upon the mind and character?
 "The advent message to the world in this generation "—our watchword.
16         STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

They had conscientiously refused the stimulus of flesh and
wine. They obeyed God's will in self-denial, and He
showed His approval."—Special Testimonies for Minis-
ters and Workers, No. 9, p. 6o.
   4. Note just what the record says was the result of the
trial. The countenances of Daniel and his companions
" appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children
which did eat of the portions of the king's meat." Two
things would contribute to this result: Daniel and his com-
panions maintained, and doubtless improved, their former
condition of health, while those who departed from princi-
ple degenerated in health and appearance. No doubt their
loyalty to principle under severe trial brought to Daniel and
his companions a fuller flow of life than was contained even
in the food which they ate, and this fulness of life revealed
itself in their physical appearance. On the other hand,
those who denied their faith suffered a loss, which also
showed itself in their appearance.


LESSON VI.—THE GLORY REVEALED IN THE
               TEMPLE.
                         August 9, 1902.
              QUESTIONS ON DAN. I : I 7-21.

  1. How did God honor the fidelity to principle which
was shown by Daniel and his companions?
  2. What special gift was bestowed upon Daniel?
  3. What happened at the end of their course of study?
  4. Who was their chief examiner?
          "There shall be delay no longer "—our confidence.
             STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

  5. With what honor did Daniel and his companions pass
their examination?
  6. What position was assigned them?
  7. How did they rank with the educated Babylonians in
the practical administration of affairs?
  8. How long did Daniel remain in the province of
Babylon?
                               NOTES.
   i. The experience of Daniel and his companions is an
illustration of the divine plan for acquiring an education.
Our part of the work of obtaining knowledge is to keep the
body in the best possible condition by obeying the laws of
God for our physical well-being, and then to apply the
mental power to the utmost in seeking to grasp the truth.
This opens the channel through which God imparts His
own thoughts. Read Prov. 2:1-9 for the inspired declara-
tion of these principles.
   2. To Daniel and his companions was granted the privi-
lege of representing the true gospel principles in Babylon.
They were to set forth the fundamental experience of
Christianit, , the manifestation of the divine life in the flesh
(r Tim. 3:16), and in them was to be demonstrated the
superiority of the laws and principles of the heavenly king-
dom. The work which Hezekiah the king, and others who
followed him, failed to do in Jerusalem, was now to be done
by Daniel and his companions as captives in Babylon. And
this teaching of the truth was to be done, not by preaching
sermons in wrtain set phrases, but by the experience of the
fact in their lives. But this was altogether a matter of
" Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to
                               harvest."
18          STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

faith•in God on their part. Only a living faith in divine
principles would give them the courage to risk their all
upon these principles right in Babylon. The result showed
that to be right by faith in God and His Word is the ex-
perience of knowing how to do the right thing in the right
way at the right time, when others fail, and that even a
heathen can distinguish the difference between this genuine
righteousness by faith and the highest degree of Babylonish
wisdom. And thus was the message of justification by faith,
the good news of a divine life dwelling in human flesh as
its wisdom and power, the glory of God in His own temple,
proclaimed as a reality amid the darkness and error of
Babylon.
    3. Two charges are usually brought against the diet
which was originally given to man by his Creator. The
first is that it tends to physical weakness, and the second
is that it does not supply sufficient nutriment for the best
quality of brain work. The experience of Daniel and his
companions is a sufficient answer to both these charges.
Through them God set forth in Babylon the fact that health
of body and vigor of intellect are both the natural result of
living in harmony with the divine plan.
   4. From the facts recorded in this first chapter of Daniel
it is evident that there is the most intimate relation between
diet and righteousness by faith. They are in fact simply
the physical and the spiritual sides of the same great truth,
—the gift of the life from God to man and the right way of
receiving that life so that God may be glorified in the best
possible service.

have upon the king?
   19. What command did he then issue?
   20. What decree was then made? Why did they seek
for Daniel and his companions as the result of this decree?
                                NOTES.
   1. Daniel and his companions had been under training
for a definite purpose. The Lord had a message for Bab-
ylon, and it was to be given in the court of the king. "As
Israel had lost the power to arrest and command the atten-
tion of all the nations, that the nations might consider God
and 'His wonderful ways and works with the children of
men, God would now use them to enlighten those who had
acquired the power to arrest and command the attention of
all the nations, and thus cause all nations to consider the
wonderful ways and works of God with the children of
men."—Great Empires of Prophecy, pp. 6, 7. By the
training which they had received, these young captives had
been prepared to stand before the king, that they might
impart in his own language the knowledge of the true God
and His working among men.
   2. God purposes to demonstrate in Babylon that the •
wisdom of men is foolishness with Him, that true wisdom
comes from Him alone, and that it is imparted to man
through the indwelling of the divine life as the wisdom.
The failure of the Chaldeans to meet the demands of the
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars will be at
                         some future period."
         STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

kin, made it clear that all their pretensions of being the
channel of communication through which could come
knowledge which was otherwise unattainable was all a
sham. To justify their failure they declared that only the
gods could do what they were asked to do, and even in
this there was no hope, from the Babylonish standpoint
and experience, because, they declared, their "dwelling is
not with flesh." This is the creed of Babylon. This is
the teaching and experience of heathenism. And a pro-
fessed Christianity which does not bring this experience
into the life is no better than heathenism.
   3. The original promise in which the gospel was first
preached (Gen. 3:15) was the promise of the union of Divinity
with humanity in the flesh, and this is the essence of Chris-
tianity. Daniel and his companions are in Babylon to
teach this very truth, and the opportunity has now come in
God's own providence. According to the statement of the
Chaldeans themselves, the ability to reveal the, dream and
its interpretation as demanded by King Nebuchadnezzar,
would be equivalent to the demonstration of the fact that
God dwells with flesh. That which they put forward as an
excuse for their own failure will be the highest testimony to
the truth of the experience which they deny to the flesh, —
the indwelling of God in the flesh of sinful man. Thus the
truth is set forth that "their rock is not as our Rock, even
our enemies themselves being judges."

LESSON VI11.—THE LIVING TEMPLE REVEALS

  17. Whom did he declare to be the source of all wisdom?
What had the God of heaven made known to the king?
   18. What subject was occupying the mind of the king
the night of the dream?
  19. What was then made known to him? By whom?
  2o. What humble estimate did Daniel place upon his
own ability?
  21. For what purposes did he say the secret had been
revealed?
                              NOTES.
   r. A little careful attention to the reading of the verses
of this lesson will make clear to us what the real subject of
the lesson is. Observe that Daniel and his companions
were seeking God for knowledge of a secret, and that their
lives depended upon its being revealed to them; that it was
"the secret" which was revealed, that Daniel praised Goi
as the one who revealed "the deep and secret things;" that
Daniel in the presence of the king referred to the desired
knowledge as "the 'secret' which no human wisdom could
reveal," and called attention to the God of heaven as the
One " that revealeth secrets r' ' that Daniel said it was " He
that revealeth secrets" who was dealing with the king, and
that "this secret" was revealed in order that the king
might know the thoughts of his heart. When Daniel had
made known the dream and the interpretation, Nebuchad-
nezzar acknowledged his God as "a revealer of secrets,
seeing thou couldest reve ' this secret." From all this it is
clear that this chapter deals with the revelation of a secret.
   2. The next step of importance is to learn what this
secret is. It will perhaps be helpful in determining this to

state that when the book of Daniel was translated into
Greek, the word used with which to translate the Hebrew
word represented by the English word "secret," was the
same as in the Greek New Testament is rendered " mys-
tery" in the expressions, " the mystery of the kingdom,"
 "the mystery of God," "the mystery of the gospel," and
 "the mystery of godliness." Now we have a definition
for "the mystery of godliness;" it is the union of divinity
with humanity. i Tim. 3:16. This is the wonderful pro-
vision of God to save man from perishing. John 3:16.
   3. In making known to Daniel the dream and its inter-
pretation, the God of heaven revealed the working of this
divine principle to establish the kingdom of heaven upon
the earth, and showed how that the world kingdoms one
after another, and finally all together, would perish because
of the rejection of this same divine principle.
   4. But this divine principle is the gift of God's life to
make men right in His sight, in order that by sharing His
righteousness they may share in His eternal existence.
This is justification by faith.
   5. The real thing, then, which is set forth in this chapter
is justification by faith, not as an abstract teaching, but in
its concrete outworking in the history of the world. This
will appear more fully in the next lesson.
   6. When it was put to the test, the religion of Babylon,
the wisdom of its wise men, failed because they did not
believe that the gods dwell with flesh. The religion of
Jerusalem, as represented in Daniel, the wisdom which is
from above, met the same test, because Daniel knew the
experience of justification by faith, the great truth of
Christianity that God does dwell with flesh.

                                 NOTES.

  1. In a view, or vision, the record of which occupies
only five verses of the Scripture, the Lord set forth the
checkered history and final outcome of " the kingdom of
" Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth laborers
                            into His harvest."
            STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                          27

the world," and showed the triumph of the kingdom of
righteousness. The purpose of this dream is not to reveal
in advance the history of the world. It certainly did all
that, but this was simply a necessary step in the greater
revelation of the final outcome in the contest between oppos-
ing principles. The dream was not given primarily to
make it clear that there would be four universal kingdoms,
which would arise one after another, but to . show the tem-
porary character of all the world kingdoms, and to reveal
the nature, the time of setting up, and the eternal duration
of the fifth kingdom, the kingdom which the God of heaven
would establish. In order that we may have the whole
picture clearly before our minds, it will be profitable to .
sketch the historical fulfilment of the dream, so far as it has
been fulfilled up to the present time.
   2. The head of gold represented the Babylonian Empire
of the Bible, which was founded in 612 B. c., by a revolt
from the Assyrian rule, led by Nabopolassar, the father of
Nebuchadnezzar. • In 538 B. C., Babylon was conquered
by Medo-Persia. Daniel described this kingdom to Nebu-
chadnezzar as "another kingdom inferior to thee." In
 B. c. 331 Medo-Persia was conquered by Grecia, under
the leadership of Alexander  the Great. This was " the
 third kingdom of brass." In B. C. 168, Grecia was con-
 quered by the Roman power. This final step in the over-
 throw of the empire of Alexander the Great is mentioned
 in history as " the great victory gained by the Romans over
 Perseus, the king of Macedonia." The Roman Kingdom
 was " the fourth kingdom," which was to be " strong as
 iron." But of this kingdom it was said, " The kingdom

28          STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

shall be divided." And so it was. By the inroads of the
Barbarians from the north, beginning with the invasions of
the Visigoths, under the leadership of Alaric, A. D. 395,
the Roman Empire was gradually broken in pieces, until,
" by the establishment of the Herulian Kingdom of Italy,
A. D. 476, the final destruction of the Roman Empire was
accomplished."— The Great Empires of Prophecy, p. 675.
In the place of the Roman Empire, and occupying exactly
the same territory, there had been founded ten kingdoms,
according to the definite prophecy in the seventh chapter
of Daniel. It was "in the days of these kings" that the
God of heaven would set up His kingdom, and we may
therefore conclude that after A. D. 476 and before the over-
throw of these ten kingdoms the kingdom of heaven would
be established, that fifth kingdom which "shall stand
forever." The time of the setting up of the fifth kingdom
is more definitely determined by other prophecies, which
we shall study later.
   3. While it is true that this . dream and its interpretation
do deal with the history of the world from the time of
Nebuchadnezzar until the triumph of the kingdom of God
in the earth, yet it is equally true that it is not the main
purpose of the dream and its intefpretation to give a brief
outline of the events which we have just mentioned. These
facts of history constitute the setting in which is revealed
the working out of a great principle. This principle and
its working make the real subject of the dream and its
interpretation.

         LESSON X.—THE REVEALED SECRET.
                         September 6,   1992.

   The secret which was revealed to Daniel in a night vision
(Dan. 2:19) was not simply the then unknown facts of the
world's history. It was rather the revelation of the mystery
of the gospel, —how that the Lord can take the same kind
of people as were found in the kingdoms which could not
stand, but fell one after the other, and establish in them and
through them a kingdom which "shall stand forever."
Dan. 2: 44. This is the gospel of the kingdom, the mystery
of the kingdom of God. Here we have revealed in its
historical connection the working out of that divine principle
which      the very foundation of the gospel—that principle
which is the basis, of the first preaching of the gospel in
Eden (Gen. 3:15), and which we have followed in our study
of the promises to Abraham and to David. This dream
and its interpretation constitute the divine key to the pano-
rama of the world's history, its fall, and the establishment
of the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. h is worthy of careful study.
   From the different parts of the image mentioned (Dan.
2:32, 33) it is evident that it was the image of a man. It
was distinctly stated to Nebuchadnezzar that "this great
image . . . stood before thee." Verse 31. From
the interpretation which followed (verses 32 and 33 com-
pared with verses 38 to 40) it is evident that the different
parts of this image of a man represented the different king-
 doms of the world until the coming of the Lord. In other
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to
                              h arvest."
30          STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

words, this man included all the men comprising the king-
doms of the world. This man " stood " for a time, but
was destroyed by the stone (verse 34), and became as
chaff, and was carried away by the wind (verse 35). This
is the experience of the ungodly. Ps. I : 4. Of these it is
declared that they " shall not stand." It thus is made
clear that this image represented the history of the world of
ungodly men, the men who are " without Christ, . . .
having no hope, and without God in the world." These
are the very kind of people who are made over into the
subjects of the kingdom of God. t Cor. 6: 9-1 t. How
could a kingdom which " shall stand forever " be made
from such material? This is the secret revealed in this
chapter.
   Of the kingdom which the God of heaven was to set up
it was declared that it "shall stand forever." The word here -
translated "stand " is the Chaldaic form of the Hebrew
word which is used in Isa. 4o:8 in the declaration that
"the Word of our God shall stand forever." These two ex-
pressions (Dan. 2:44 and Isa. 4o:8) connect the gospel of
the kingdom as taught in the dream of Nebuchadnezzar
with the message of the prophet Isaiah, which was the
message of John the Baptist, which is the message for the
present generation. The message in Isaiah, with the
associated texts, reveals in express terms the secret which
is revealed in its workings in the dream and its interpreta-
tion. The message which is to prepare the way of the
Lord (Isa. 40:3) is given in verses 6-1o.        "All flesh is
grass; . . . the grass withereth. . . . But the Word
of our God shall stand forever. . . . Behold your God!

Behold, the Lord God will come." Compare this with John
I :I, 2, 14. The secret or mystery of the gospel is found
in that mysterious union of divinity with humanity, through
which comes the power to make weak mortal flesh "stand
forever." In the religion of Babylon there was no place
for such an experience as this (Dan. 2: I I), but it is the
fundamental truth of Christianity (I Tim. 3: 16). The
kingdom which the God of heaven will set up "shall stand
forever" (Dan. 2:44), because the Word of our God
shall stand forever " (Isa. 4o: 8), and because a vital union
has been made between the subjects of that kingdom and
that living and abiding Word (I Peter I: 24, 25).

LESSON •XI.—THE SECRET OF CONTINUANCE.
                         -   September 13, 1902.
  There is only one subject for the servant of the Lord to
present to the people (Eph. 6:19), and only one purpose
in presenting that subject (Eph. 3: 8, 9). This is the secret
or mystery which was made known to Daniel in the night
vision that he might make it known in Babylon. It means
the gift of the only-begotten Son to save men from perish-
ing. John 3:16. It means the gift of eternal life in the
gift of that Son. i John 5: It, 12. This means the bring-
ing into the mortal flesh the power to "stand forever," and
this is the secret of the everlasting continuance of the
kingdom of God.
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars will be at some
                              future period."
             STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.                      33
   This everlasting continuance of the kingdom of God is
assured by the everlasting continuance of Him in whom
and through whom it is established. This will be clear
from the consideration of a few scriptures. The first chap-
ter of the Epistle to the Hebrews is devoted to setting forth
the exalted character of the person of the Son. In devel-
oping this theme seven quotations are made from the Old
Testament. One of these quotations is from Ps. 102 :25-27.
One sentence of this passage in verse 26 reads as follows:
"They shall perish, but thou shalt endure." In the margin
we have the word "stand" in place of the word "endure."
When this passage is quoted in the first chapter of Hebrews
it is rendered, "They shall perish; but thou remainest."
In the Revised Version it is rendered, "They shall perish;
but thou continuest." Thus we have the words "endure,"
"stand," "remain," and "continue," to which may be
added the word "abide," all of which are used in our
English Bible to express the idea of continuance. Ever-
lasting continuance is a fundamental element in the reve-
lation which God has made to us of His being. His very
name, " I AM," signifies it. He proposed to share this
everlasting continuance (eternal life) with man by sharing
His own character (glory) with him (Ps. 8: 5), but man
lost this character (glory) through sin (Rom. 3:23). The
gospel of the kingdom is " the gospel of the glory of the
blessed God" (I Tim. I        R. V.), restored to man in and
through the gift of the Son of God to the human family
(John 17: 22). The only-begotten Son ranked with the
Father in the eternity of His being. John 5:26; 8:35, last
clause. Although the Jews entertained many erroneous

views concerning Christ, the Messiah, and His mission to
this earth, yet they saw clearly this teaching of the Scrip-
ture concerning His everlasting continuance. John 12 : 34.
In giving His Son to the human family, and sending Him
here to establish His kingdom in the earth, God made the
provision for the everlasting continuance of that kingdom by
providing everlasting continuance (eternal life) for all who
would receive the gift of His Son (John I: II, 12) and
share with Him in His righteous character. This is the
mystery of the kingdom of God. This is the secret of the
everlasting continuance of that fifth kingdom, of which it
was said, " It shall stand forever." Dan. 2:44.

LESSON X11.—JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH, THE
       BASIS OF THE CONTINUANCE
            OF THE KINGDOM
                       September 20, 1902.
   The reality of the kingdom of God is found in spiritual
principles rather than in material things.    Rom. 14:17.
The kingdom is to be established within. Luke 17: 20, 21.
Its scepter is a scepter of righteousness. Heb.          On
this basis shall the rule be established. Isa. 32:1. This
righteousness is everlasting. Ps. 119:142. This right-
eousness is brought to man in the gift of Jesus the Messiah
(Dan. 9:24, 25), who is Himself righteou.sness ( Jer. 23:6).
His coming is the coming of the kingdom. Mark 1:14, 15.
In His continuance as the seed is bound up the continuance
of the kingdom. Ps. 89:3, 4, 29, 35, 36. In Him as the
seed, the kingdom and the house of David would be estab-
lished forever. 2 Sam. 7:1 2, 13, 16, 26. The same right-
eousness which is the scepter of the kingdom is revealed in
the gospel as its power. Rom. 1 : 16, 17. This righteous-
           The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
36          STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

ness is a gift. Rom. 5:17. It is received through faith in
Christ. Rom. 3:21, 22. And this is the faith through
which we are justified. Gal. 2:1b. Thus it is evident that
the stability of the kingdom rests upon the stability of
character (Ps. II I :3); that on. God's part this stability of
righteousness has been provided for us in the gift of Christ
to the flesh (t Cor. I:30); that on our part we avail
ourselves of this provision, and so become righteous (justi-
fied) in Its sight through faith in Christ (Rom. 3:24-26).
The testimony to the genuineness of this experience is
found in the law (Rom. 3:21), which is established by our
faith (verse 31). Thus the whole basis for the stability, the
enduring character, the continuance of the kingdom of God,
is found' in .the experience of justification by faith. This is
the gospel of the kingdom which "shall stand forever."
                            QUESTIONS.

    I. What constitutes the reality of the kingdom of God?
    2. Where is the kingdom to be foUnd?
    3. What is the scepter of the kingdom?

    5. How permanent is this righteousness?
    6. How is this righteousness brought to humanity?
    7. What connection is there between the coming of the
Messiah and the coming of the kingdom?
    8. What connection is there between t.11e continuance
of the Messiah in the flesh and the continuance of the
kingdom?
    9. How are the kingdom and the house',Of David to be
established?
              Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.

provided for us?
   16. How do we avail ourselves of this provision?
  17. What bears witness to the genuineness of this
 xperience?
   18. What experience on our part involves and settles
the whole question of the continuance of the kingdom of
God?
   19. What relation does this experience sustain to the

LESSON XI11.—THE MESSAGE OF JUSTIFICA-
    TION BY FAITH WILL ESTABLISH
       THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM.
                        September 27, 1902.
  The day of wrath, now near at hand, will test the sta,
bility of character. Rev. 6 :15-17. Ungodliness is the
object of God's wrath. Rom. i : 18. Therefore the un-
godly will not endure the test. Ps. i : 5. The gospel is
God's provision through which and in which we may be
able to stand. i Cor. 15 : I, 2. This means a present
victory over Satan (Eph. 6 : I I), which will result in our
being able to stand permanently (verses 13, 14). This is
simply the experience of justification by faith (Rom. 5:
2), and this is the only experience which will enable us to
 "The advent message to the world in this generation "—our watchword.
38         STUDIES IN THE GOSPEL MESSAGE.

stand when the Lord comes. The whole experience is one
of faith on our part (Rom. xi : zo) and of manifested power
on God's part (Rom. 14 : 4, R. V.). It is, therefore, abun-
dantly evident that " the everlasting gospel " in the three-
fold message of Rev.     : 6-12, which is to prepare for the
coming of the Son of man as king (verse 14) must be the
original gospel of the coming of the Seed, the gospel of the
" unspeakable gift" of Jesus in the flesh as our right-
eousness, the gospel of justification by faith. And through
the giving of this message in the earth " in the days of
these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,
which . . . shall stand forever."

                           QUESTIONS.

    1. What will the men of might do in the earth in the
day of God's wrath?
    2. How will they ask to be hidden from that wrath?
    3. What reason will they give for such a request?
    4. Against what is God's wrath directed?
    5. What effect will this have upon the ungodly?
    6. What provision has the Lord made that His people
may stand now and eternally?
    7. What present experience does this bring to believers?
    8. What future experience is thus assured?
    9. Under what other form of expression is this same
experience presented to us in the Scripture?
   10. What will this enable us to do when the Lord
comes?
    t. By what only do we stand?
  12. Whose direct working is it which makes us stand?
   13. What is the purpose of the threefold message of
Revelation 14?
  14. What must be the nature of this gospel message?
   15. What will be accomplished through the giving of
this message in this generation?
          "There shall be delay no longer "—our confidence.
