                              Notes.
    1. Calling and Election.—It is not the purpose of these
lessons to answer objections to a teaching of which the Bible
knows nothing, but to aid in the study of a most encouraging
and helpful doctrine. The Bible teaches election, foreordination,
predestination, but always for our comfort and edification. The
"calling," the "inviting," and "appointing" precede and throw
light on the "election."
    2. "Called From.'!—We are called from all that is unlike
Him who calls us, from things natural to us. We are not by
nature good, or pure, or righteous. We by nature walk according
to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers
of the air, according to the spirit working in the sons of dis-
obedience, according to the lusts of the flesh; we are children of
wrath. Be not deceived into placing humanity on a higher plane
than God places them, and so lead them to minimize the Sa-
viour. Let us take comfort in the thought that God calls us from
all this evil to the better things.
    3. Saints.—The word "saint" means a holy one. But while
 wine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
4           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
God calls us to be saints, and by His Spirit calls His children
saints, we never find the devoted servants of God calling them-
selves saints. Their choicest title seems to be "servant." 'Paul,
a servant of God." God calls us to be saints, makes us children,
calls us friends, but we are His servants.




               LESSON 11.—The Election.
                    APRIL 13, 1907.
                          Questions.
     1. What earnest admonition is given us in 2 Petei
1 : 10?
     2. What is the meaning of election?—".Selection,"
"choosing after trying," "calling out of."
     3. Of whom is the choosing? John 15 : 16.
     4. To what does God sometimes choose men tempo-
rarily? Ans.—To a special work which does not of
itself insure salvation.
     5. What did He choose Abraham to be? Ans.—The
father of the promised Seed. Gen. 17 : 1-8.
     6. To perpetuate His promise, which of Abraham's
two sons was chosen? Gen. 21: 11, 12.
     7. Of Isaac's two sons, which was chosen? Gen.
25 : 23, 31-34.                                  •• A
     8. Of Jacob's twelve sons, which one was chosen as
progenitor of the promised Seed? Gen. 49: 8-10.
     9. Did the choice of any of these insure his eternal
salvation? Did it deprive the unchosen of life?
   10. What ancient king did God choose to glorify His
name? Rom. 9 : 17. Note 1.
"Lift up yoUr eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
               •    already to harvest."
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                5
  11: Was there salvation in this for him? Did he ob-
tain it?
  12. What other great ruler did God choose for a'
special work? Jer. 27: 5-8. Did he recognize the call
as from God? Dan. 4 : 34-37. Note 2.
  13. Name another ruler whom the Lord chose for a
special work . Isa. 44 : 28 to 45 : 5. 'Did he honor God's
call? 2 Chron. 36 : 23.
  14. Who of David's sons was chosen as an ancestor
of Christ? Matt. 1: 6.
   15. Who of all the maidens of Israel was honored as
the mother of Jesus? Luke 1: 26, 27. Did this insure
her salvation? Did it preclude others? Matt. 12 : 49, 50r.
   16. Although' God has used, or is using, us in His
work, what is necessary that we may obtain eternal sal-
vation? Heb. 3 : 14 ; 1 Cor. 9 : 27.
   17. What must we choose that God's choice may be
effected in us? Deut. 30 : 19 ; Isa. 56 : 4.
                            Notes.
   1. "Show in Thee My Power."—God is no respecter of
persons. He sent Abraham to Egypt to save Egypt. He sent
Joseph there for the same purpose. And when Moses presented
God's reasonable message, "Let My people go, that they may serve
Me," Pharaoh might have received that message, and it would
have brought him life and blessing, and would have made of
Egypt, in its knowledge of the true God, a light center. Not
until God had exhausted every effort upon Pharaoh's heart, did
He withdraw His Spirit, and so leave Pharaoh to his fate.
   2. "My Servant."—God had a work for Nebuchadnezzar to
do; but it took Nebuchadnezzar long to learn the lesson. Daniel
2, Daniel 3, and Daniel 4 are records of his education and ad-
vancement, until he came to the knowledge of God.

We expend sixty per cent. of our efforts upon four per cent. of
                          our field.

       5. In whom was all this purpose in creation wrought?

. posed character? Col. 1: 20-22.
       8. What is necessary on our part? Acts 20 : 21 ;

                        As to the Earth.
      9. What did God say of the earth as it came from
  His hand? Gen. 1: 31.
     10. For whom was it created? Gen. 1: 27, 28 ; Ps.
  115: 16.

     12. When man, its prince, yielded to Satan, who be-
  came the ruler of the earth? John 12 : 31; 2 Cor. 4 : 4.
 "This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world

             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        7

  14. Through whom is it to be restored? Luke 19 : 10.
  15. To whom will the first dominion then return?

3 : 13 ; Isa. 60 : 21.
                              Notes.
   1. "In the Image of God."—Not merely a physical image,
but a moral image—a being capable of being developed in char-
acter like unto his Maker. God had wrought everything in creation
that He could do. All that was lacking was a developed char-
acter; but as this could be formed only by choice, man alone
became responsible. He could refuse God's ways and die; lie
could choose God's ways and live.
    2. The original word translated "upright" is "Israel." God
created man to be Israel. Connect this' thought with the gates
of the New Jerusalem, into which all the redeemed enter. These
gates are named after the twelve tribes of Israel.
    3. The curse rested most heavily upon him who brought it;
but as the prince of the earth, under God, yielded to sin, he
brought the curse upon everything in his dominion. "For the
creation was subjected to vanity [uselessness', transientness, death],
not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it."
Born. 8:20.

                   APRIL 27, 1907.
                             Questions.
   1. What kind of a people did God design should in-
herit the earth? 2 Peter 3 : 13.
        The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
8            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. How many of this righteous character would there
be? Gen. 1: 28. Note 1. •
    3. When Satan thought to frustrate God's purpose
through seducing at least a part of the human family,
what provision did the Lord make? Gen. 3: 16, first
part. Note. 2.
    4. When were these righteous characters chosen?
Eph. 1: 4. Note 3.
    5. Where were the names of these characters written?
Heb. 12: 23; Rev. 17 : 8. Note 4.
    6. To what, then, is each one called of God?

verse? Eph. 3: 14, 15, R.V. Note 6.

dren? Dan. 12: 13. Note 7.

purpose? Born. 8 : 28.
    The offerings for thisquarter go to the most needy fields.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      9
                              Notes.
    1. "Replenish."—That is, not necessarily to fill again, as
our English implies, but to completely fill. God's infinitely wise
purpose must have included a certain number to inhabit this
earth, not one too many, not one too few. His perfect plan de-
manded the exact number, and as in redemption this plan is to be
completely fulfilled, we may well believe that the number of the
saved will be the exact number He at the beginning planned
should inherit the earth.
    2. "Greatly Multiply . . . Thy Conception."—God •
saw that many would listen to Satan, and yield to sin and death;
and therefore a greater number must be born into the world in
order that there might be gathered out of them the elect number.
    3. Characters Chosen.—In the sight of God that which is
most precious is character. It is character that God chose in
the beginning, a complete number of complete, harmonious char-
acters to people that perfect world. These characters compre-
hended in names, were written, before sin entered, in the Book
of Life.
    4. Names, not one, but different names, implying different
characters, one as to righteousness, but differing as to individu-
ality. To one of these characters, one of these names with the
trial and testing necessary, every soul is called. If he conquer, he
will have bestowed upon him absolutely that new name, wrought
in him and known only to him.
    5. "In the Book of Life."—When we yield up the world,
when we receive Christ, then we are accepted as sons and daughters
of God, and our names are written among the candidates for eter-
nal life.                      •
    6. The family name is of the Father, not the Son. "For
this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, from whom every
family in heaven and on earth is named."
     7. "His Lot."—Anciently, the land of Israel was divided by
1 t. Does not this text clearly indicate that that glorious, eter-
 nal land will be divided among the children? Name, crown, in-
 heritance, are all held out before the soul called of God.




"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the 'world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

      LESSON V.—The Extent of His Purpose.
                MAY 4, 1907.
                        Questions.
                 His Purpose in Eternity.
    1. When did God choose the characters of His peo-
ple? Eph. 1: 4.
     2. What did He then do for us? Eph. 1: 15, first
part. Note I.
     3. According to what did He foreordain us? Eph.
1 : 5.
     4. To whose praise were we foreordained? Eph. 1: 6,
first part.
     5. In whom is the grace bestowed? Eph. 1: 6, last
part.
              As Revealed in Christ Jesus.
     6. When we sinned, in whom did our hope still cen-
ter? How much does this redemption cover? Accord-
ing to what is the redemption given? Verse 7. Note 2.
     7. How has He made it to abound toward us?
Verse 8.
     8. What has He made known to us? According to
what has He made it known? Verse 9.
     9. What is the fulness of His purpose? Verse '10.
   10. What are we given in Him? According to what
purpose? After what counsel? Verse 11.
   11. What is the ultimate object .of all this for us?
Verse 12.
   12. How is this trust begotten? Verse 13, first part.
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   11
            Wrought in Us by the Spirit.
  13. What assurance is given us who yield to that pur-
pose? Verse 13, last part.
  14. What does this bestowal of the Spirit constitute?
Verse 14. Note 3.
  15. What will God give us int this? Verse 17.
  16. How much may we know of His, purpose? Verse
18.
  17. How much may we know of His power? Vei.ses
19-23.
                              Notes.
   1. "Predestinated," "foreordained," "marked out." God
marked us out in that character to which He called us. That is
His plan for us. That is our worth to Him. That is what He
will work out in us if we will yield all to Him.
   2. "According to the riches of His grace," not our poor
conception, not just enough to meet our needs, but grace super-
abounding over all sin.
   3. "The earnest," the pledge, the assurance of God. Alien
one party buys a piece of property of another, he often pays a
part down "to bind the bargain." This is "earnest" money,
a pledge that all will be paid in due time. Thus God pledges the
fulfilment of all His promises, and places in us the life pledge,
the earnest of all the glorious, eternal things promised, the Holy
Spirit.

   19. In so rejecting God's will and mercy, where do
men place themselves as regards His purpose? Prof.
1 : 29, 30. Note 3.
                              Notes.
    1. "Eternal Purpose."—Literally, "the purpose of the ages,"
the purpose of God before the world was, the purpose in the
creation of man, the purpose in the patriarchal age, in the Levit-
ical age • in the Christian age; it is the same eternal purpose of
the unchangeable God through all the ages.
    2. Our danger lies, not in the failure of God's grace or pur-
pose or plan or mercy.' His mercy and grace are inexhaustible.
Our danger lies in rejecting His mercy till we can no longer
discern His voice, no longer see His message, no longer feel His
presence. We may harden ouir hearts till God is compelled to
leave us alone to reap 'the fruit of our own sowing.
    3. God's purpose is only and ever to •do good. That, how-
ever, can be worked out only in harmony with righteous principle.
All outside of that purpose is outside of the great channels of
life, and must perish. When, therefore, we reject or refuse God's
plan to save us, we put ourselves outside of God's purpose and
plan, and must perish.

                             Notes.
    1. "Into," not "in," as in the Common Version. Not the
mere mention of a name, but into the name, swallowed up in
the name, whelmed by, immersed in, all that it stands for..
    2. "Name," character. God's name reveals His goodness.
Ex. 33:18, 19; 34:6, 7. When Jacob gained the victory, God
changed his name to 'Israel to correspond with his change of char-
acter. Gen. 32:24-28. Name as used in Matt. 28:19 stands for
character. See also Matt. 1:21.
    3. The name of the Father stands for goodness and right-
eousness, which He in mercy freely bestows upon us in Christ
Jesus. Rom. 3:20-22. Baptized into His name is to give up
all our sins, all our righteousnesses, and receive His alone. Phil.
3:8-10.
    4. The name of the Son stands for emptiness of self, self-
denial, self-abnegation, and fulness of God's righteous character.
The Son of God came not to reveal. Himself. He did not reveal
Himself when He came to earth. That was not His purpose.
John 1:18; 5:19, 30; 14:10. His character, His mind, was to
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of        a Saviour.

empty Himself, that the Father might fill Him with all the ful-
ness of the Godhead. Phil. 2:5-9; Col. 1:19.
   5. Power.--The active divine agency in effecting all God's
will is the Spirit. Over the chaos in the beginning, the Spirit
brooded and brought the cosmos of life and beauty. Gen. 1:2.
"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all
the host of them by the breath of His mouth." By the Spirit
His word is given. 2 Sam. 23:2! "By His Spirit He hath gar-
nished the heavens." Job 26:13. By the Sidra the dead are re-
created and the earth renewed. Ps. 104:30. By the Spirit Jesus
was begotten (Luke 2:35); by the Spirit His children are begotten
(John 3:5) •' by the Spirit Jesus was filled for service (Luke
4:18; Acts 10:38); and by the Spirit we are given power for
service (Acts 1:8); by the Spirit we are given life, and our
mortal bodies quickened (Rom. 8:8-10).

                            Notes.
    1. Man is "without strength," he has no power to help
himself. Let him strive as he will, he still comes short of God's
glory. He has physical life, fed by food and water and air; but
he is "separate from Christ," "alienated from the life of God,"
"having no hope, and without God in the world." Eph. 4:18;
2:12. No philosophy can change the great fact so clearly stated
in the Bible, and everywhere demonstrated in the history of the
race.
"The Advent message to the world in this generation"-our
                      watchword.

    2. A power must take possession of man that he has not
known, to lift him above sin. He must be "born from above."
The Spirit of God puts new life into the heart opened by faith,
and creates new affections.
    3. The Spirit is life to the believer, the life which comes by
faith in Christ. 1 John 5:11-13. "When the sinner has repented
of his sins, and is united with Christ, as the branch is engrafted
in the vine, the nature of the man is changed, and he is a partaker
of the divine nature. . . . The life-giving principle of the
Saviour is communicated to the Christian."—Spirit of Prophecy,
Vol. 3, page 90. " All professions of Christianity are but lifeless
expressions of faith until Jesus imbues the believer with His
spiritual life, which is the Holy Ghost."—Id., page 242. The
Holy Spirit is the breath of spiritual life in the soul. The impar-
tation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. It
imbues the. receiver with the attributes of Christ."—Desire of
Ages, page 805, large edition.

how many did he give? Acc'ording to what did he give?
    5. Whom does the nobleman represent? Eph. 4 : 8 ;
first part.
    6. What did the talents and pounds represent? Eph.
4: 8, last part. Note 1.

     7. To whom did Christ give gifts? For what pur-
pose? 1 Cor. 12 : 7.
 _ 8. For how long are they given?. Eph. 4: 13.
    9. What are some of the talents and pounds named
in this scripture? Eph. 4: 11.
  10. What list is elsewhere given? 1 Cor. 12 : 8-10, 28.
  11. What other enumeration is given? Rom. 12: 6-8.
Note 2.
  12. Are the gifts and the work the same to all? 1 Cor.
12 : 4-6.
  13. To what are these various gifts likened? 1 Cor.
12: 12; Rom. 12: 4, 5. Note 3.
                              Notes.
    1. When we have the same person, at the same time, making
certain gifts, to the same ones, for the same purpose, the gifts
             cal, though called by different names. pounds,
must be identi                                           he.
the talents, the spiritual gifts, are 'identical. God likens them
to the highest denominations of money to show how highly they
should be regarded. The pound was the highest division in Roman
money, the talent the highest in Hebrew money.
    2. All the spiritual gifts may not be named in these Scrip-
tures. God gives as we need. Note that sometimes the gift is
connected with the persons, as in apostles, and prophets, and evan-
gelists, and sometimes referred to in the gift alone, as prophecy,
the word of wisdom, etc.
    3. The church is likened to the body; the various gifts to the
different members. As in the perfect, healthy, normal body, no
part is lacking, and each and every part has its proper functions
to perform, so God's church, when complete, will have within it
every 'gift; all its members will be fitted for service.

22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  15. Thus abiding in Christ, what will be the effect
on the church 2 Eph. 4 : 16.
                             Notes.
      I. "Every one," "each one." Both expressions are used.
 There is not one soldier in Christ's army, not' one child in His'
 family, not one member in His body, who is to be an idler. Each
 and every one has a work to do for the Master which will use
 every power of his being. He needs that work for the forma-
 tion of character; he owes that work to Him who released him
 from bondage; he must share in it as a privilege if he is to
 be a partaker in the eternal joy. The great need of the world
 demands the consecration to God's service now.
      2. (a) "For the perfecting of the saints," the development
 of character. The gifts are God's tools by which His people
 are brought to a state of perfection. (b) "For the work of the
 ministry," not necessarily preaching, but including it. Preaching
 is only one form of ministry Every child of God ought to be
 a minister, a servant of His, and every work done for God is a
 work of ministry or service. The measure of our loving service
 is the measure of our greatness before God. (c) "The edifying
 of the body of Christ." No true gift in its exercise tears down,
 but builds up. That is the purpose of God through His chil-
 dren, to build each other up. But this can be done only in God's
.way, by God's means, His word, His Spirit, His service.
      3. A gift, not "the gift," as in our Common Version. Every
 soul has' received at least a gift, one gift, and as he has so re-
 ceived, let him use it in blessing others.
      4. "To him that hath shall be given." That is, to him
 wilo holds his gift for God, who uses it for God, shall be given
 other gifts. The use of the one gift makes that gift more effec-
 tive. To the faithful steward of one gift, if he has ability, God
 will add other gifts.
      5. It is not for man to choose his gift or gifts. God divides
  these gifts of the Spirit, not as we will, but as He wills. He
  tells us to covet earnestly the best gifts, but that ought ever
  to be the best gifts for us, which He chooses=those which we
  can use the best. An inordinate desire for some gift greatly
  esteemed throws man on 'Satan's ground, and leaves him open
• to the deceptions of the enemy.


  •Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."

                            Notes.
     1. "Apostle."---It is the Greek word transferred and angli-
 cized. It means a delegate, a messenger, an ambassador, a com-
missioner, "one sent forth."
     2. Jesus expressly called the twelve apostles. Luke 6.:13.
But these were not all the apostles. See Matthias (Acts 1:26) ;
Paul and Barnabas (Acts 14:14) ; James,, the Lord's brother
 (tial. 1:19); Epaphroditus, "messenger," literally apostle (Phil.
2:25), and others perhaps, messengers, apostles (2 Cor. 8:23), •
besides the great Apostle, our Lord Jesus Christ (Heb. 3:1).
Here are eighteen or more persons designated as apostles, those
sent forth of God to lead out and build up His work in the
earth.
     3. "Teachers."—There is ability to teach. There is the art
of teaching that may be acquired. All this is effective in the
world. But these alone are sounding brass and tinkling cymbals
in God's cause. The spiritual truth of God can be taught only
by men who are spiritually endowed teachers. Preaching and
teaching are great professions now, and the greatest preparations
are made in the schools; but often spiritual results are lacking.
So it will ever be if we slight the Spirit of God, the only power
which can regenerate, endow, and fit us for our work.
    4. Among the other gifts are evangelists, pastdrs, working
of miracles, healing, helps, governments, tongues, interpretation
of tongues, word of knowledge, word of wisdom,• discerning of
spirits, ministry, exhortation, giving. Nearly all of these are
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
       •     SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    25
self-explanatory. An evangelist is preeminently one who preaches
the Gospel, winning souls to Christ, gathering them into the flock.
A pastor is one qualified of God to care for those gathered in,
a shepherd of the flock. An evangelist may be a poor shepherd.
A good pastor may be a poor evangelist. How often we find men
that know above others just how to help, succor, relieve, at the
opportune moment. They have a gift. Some are adapted to
govern. Some have great knowledge and little wisdom, and others
vice versa. Both are useful; let the church recognize them both.
There are some who have discernment. They see the wrong
motives, the false hearts, the subterfuges, of the deceiver.
Neither are ;they ``judges" in          But, , what need of hu-
mility is there in its use. The blessed gift of service----common
to all—all may use. Let the church plan to use all these gifts
of God.
    5. No gift of the Spirit of God, without which we can do
no acceptable work for Him, can be acquired. No labor can
secure it; no committee can bestow it; no money can purchase it;
it can not come to us by any inheritance of the flesh. It is the
gift of God. Education may help to develop, discipline, and make
more effective the exercise of the gift; but it can do no more.

                               Notes.
   1. "Prophesy" means to foretell; and a prophet is literally
one who foretells. But the word hardly covers the office of the
prophet, as all the prophecies which have come down to us demon-
strate. The prophet_ spoke for God as Aaron spoke for Moses.
Ex. 7:1, 2. He was God's messenger to speak God's message. He
reproved, rebuked, warned of present and coming danger, in-
structed in righteousness and present duty.. Foretelling was fre-
       " There shall be delay no longer"--our confidence.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      27
quently a small part of his work. It was frequently only prac-
tical instruction in righteousness.
    2. There is a profound reason why, when God's law ceased
to be recognized, or was lost sight of, prophecy ceased, even though
good men lived. If the Lord bad allowed prophecy to flourish,
there could have been no standard of testing. The spirit of
prophecy is restored to the church synchronous with the restora-
tion of His law. False prophets. also abound, but we have the
standard infallible by which to test them, God's law, God's voice.
    3. Till "that which is perfect" is come, the church of God
will need prophetic guidance. 2 Peter 1:19; 1 Cor. 13 :8-10.
Even when she becomes Spirit-filled, and without spot or wrinkle,
she will not say, We do not need the prophetic word, for then
she will prize it most; it will be a part of her very being.
    4. "Desire earnestly the greater gifts," "spiritual gifts,
but rather that ye may prophesy." American Revised Version.
The greatness is measured by the service rendered. Matt. 20:
26, 27. By prophesying here we understand is meant speaking
God's word unto edification. 1 Cor. 14:3.
     5. The better way, and the only safe way, to seek any of
God's gifts is the way of love, set forth in 1 Corinthians 13.
 Then, indeed, will the Spirit of God divide to us the gifts we
 can best use. God bestows His gifts with wisdom and prudence.
Eph. 1:8.
     6. "Confirmed."—It is good to have good news and good
 things confirmed unto us. See Heb. 2:3. We have the assurance
 they are true; but they benefit us not if the work goes no farther.
 The spirit of prophecy has been confirmed unto many. But what
 God desires, and what we must have, is the testimony of Christ
 "confirmed in us."
     7. The gift of prophecy, if received, becomes the door, the
 entrance, to all gifts. If we will not accept the, gift which warns,
 reproves, instructs, God can not entrust us with other gifts.
 Until we prize pure, - true character more than display of super-
 natival power, God can not bestow the power. Power displayed
 without the fruits of the Spirit must come from some other
 source. As we accept the testimony of Jesus, other gifts will
 follow, and the church will stand complete, coming "behind in no
 gift."




         The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
