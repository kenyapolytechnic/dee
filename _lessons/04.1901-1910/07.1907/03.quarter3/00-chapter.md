         LESSON I.—One Universal Covenant.
                     JULY 6, 1907.
                        Questions.
     1. Of what was man formed? Gen. 2: 7.
     2. How did God impart life to man? Verse 7.
     3. Upon what condition was this life to be continued?
Gen. 2 :17.
     4. What shows this was fully understood by Adam
and Eve? Gen. 3: 2, 3.
     5. Did God give man the power of choice? Gen.
2 : 9, 16, 17.
     6. What exercise did man make of this power? Gen.
3 : 6.
     7. What did this act of disobedience bring? Rom.
    12.
     8. From what was Adam shut away by this act?
Gen. 3 : 22, 23.
     9. What conclusions may we draw from these facts?
See Note 1.
       The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                3
  10. Were the angels given the power of choice?
Jude 6.
  11. How did some of them exercise this power? Same
reference.
   12. What is this act of leaving the place assigned them
called 2 Peter 2 : 4.
   13. What is to be the final result to them? 2 Peter
2 : 4 ; Matt. 25 : 41.
   14. What conclusions may we draw from this? Note 2.
   15. Are there other worlds? Heb. 1: 2.
   16. For what does the Lord create a world            Isa.
45 : 18.
   17. What kind of service only will God accept? Eph.
6 : 6, 7.
   18. What conclusions are we warranted in drawing
from these scriptures? See note 3.
                             Notes.
   1. From the foregoing scriptures the following conclusions
may be drawn:
       (a) That God made man a free moral agent.
       (b) That the tree of knowledge of good and evil was a
           test set before man.
       (c) That his continued existence was dependent upon his
           choosing in harmony with God's will.
       (d) That his act of disobedience was known, willing sin.
       (e) That the compact, or covenant, under which Adam be-
           gan his existence was that God promised life only 'on
           condition of Adam 's obedience.
       (f) That Adam fully understood this read "Patriarchs
           and Prophets," pages 48, 49.
   2. We are safe in concluding that the angels were placed on
probation, and that some of them voluntarily left the station as-
signed them. By this act they sinned, and so are destined to
share the fate of sinful men. Hence the angels must have lived
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                    already to harvest."
4          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
under the same covenant as man, namely, "Obey and Live." All
character must be placed under trial. In harmony with this we
read in the "Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 2, page 10: "They
[the angels] were created beings and probationers." And in
"Great Controversy," page 673: "In the cleansing flames the
wicked are at last destroyed, root and branch,—Satan the root,
his followers the branches. The full penalty of the law has been
visited."
   3. "Early Writings," page 32, shows that the inhabitants of
other worlds are on probation, and that the test placed before
them is the same as that placed before us; and that to fail to
endure that, test would be sin, and would bring upon them all the
sad consequences, including death, which the same act has brought
upon man. Thus obedience, or righteousness and life, go together,
while disobedience, or sin and death, are inseparable.


    LESSON 11.—Power of Choice in God's Covenant.
                 JULY 13, 1907.
                           Questions.
     1. Of what is God not the author? 1 Cor. 14 : 33.
      2. Whdt is necessary to a condition of perfect har-
 mony? 1 Peter 3 : 8.
      3. Whose mind must this be? Phil. 2 : 5 ; 1 Cor. 2 :16.
      4. Whose mind, or will, did Christ have? John
6 : 38.
      5. In what is God's will as supreme ruler expressed?
 Ps. 40 : 8.
. 6. What goes with the power of choice?—Responsi-
 bility. Prov. 1: 28-31.
      7. Is God's authority limited by granting the power
 of choice to creatures? Isa. 65 : 12. Note 1.
      8. Does God seek to influence man in making his
 choice? Acts 14 : 16, 17 ; Zech. 7 : 11-13.
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5
    9. What testimony have we that none can take from
man his power of choice? Heb. 11: 35-38. Note. 2.
  10. Is the power of choice or the exercise of the will
placed above, the control of the fleshly nature? Rom.
7 : 21. Note 3.
   It Can one choose to do that which he is not able
in himself to perform? Rom. 7: 18.
  12. What is necessary in order that choice may be
exercised? Deut. 30 : 15, 16. Note 4.
  13. Since God desires harmony, and since he has placed
the choice entirely in the hands of the creature what
must be the penalty for wrong choosing? Isa. 65: 12-15.
   14. To whom must we be in subjection in order to
have eternal life? Heb. 12 : 9.
                              Notes.
   1. God's authority is not limited by the granting of the
power of choice. At the end of the period of choosing God sets
up a judgment in which He calls the creature to account for all
the choices he has made.
   2. Every martyr's death proves that the power of choice is
above the control of all power outside of the individual, since
the extreme to which any power can go in an effort to control
the will is to put to death.
   3. The control of the will is not entirely vested in the char-.
acter of the one choosing, for it is possible to will to do a
thing entirely out of harmony with one's character. Thus an
evil person may will to do a good thing even though unaided
he can not accomplish it.
    4. There can be no choice of the good unless there is the pos-
sibility of rejecting the good, which is to choose evil. God
placed before His creatures the way of righteousness to refuse
which was to choose the way of sin, one way terminating in life,
the other death. Sin must of necessity originate with the first
being who refused to choose the Lord's way. And since harmony
 can exist only when all wills, all choices, are in accord with one
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into his harvest."
6          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
Supreme will, it is apparent that death must be the result to the
one who persists in wrong choosing. Hence the covenant is "obey
and live."


        LESSON 111.—God's Covenant Broken.
                      JULY 20, 1907.
                         Questions.
    1. What is the penalty for the violation of God's
covenant Deut. 30 : 19. Note 1.
    2. What did Adam bring into the world by his dis-
obedience? Rom. 5 : 12.
    3. What then must Adam have transgressed? See
Hosea 6: 7, margin.
    4: In what form is God's covenant expressed to his
creatures in sin? Deut. 4 : 12, 13. Note 2.
    5. How is it expressed affirmatively? Matt. 22 :
36-40.
    6. If we violate one precept, of what are we guilty?
James 2 : 10.
    7. When Adam and Eve broke God's covenant, did
they violate the Ten Commandments? Rom: 5 : 12 ;
1 John 3 : 4.
    8. With which one did their transgression begin?
Gen. 3 : 6; Rom. 7 : 7, last part.
    9. Show how Adam's transgression directly violated
different precepts of the law. See Col. 3 : 5 ; Ex. 20 : 15,
and other scriptures.
  10. How did the angels likewise violate God's cove-
nant? Compare Isa. 14 : 13, 14 and Gen. 8 : 4, 5. Note 2.
"The Advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                       watchword,
           SAM3ATIEL-SCROOL LE8SON` QUARTM/LY                    7
  11. Into what condition did the violation of God's
covenant bring both men and angels? 1 John 3: 15;
2 Peter 2 : 4, 9. Note 4.
                               Notes.
   1. We have found the condition of the covenant between God
and His creatures to be "Obey and live," and that God has
given all, both angels and men, the absolute power of choice.
But this plan involved the idea of ultimate perfect harmony.
That under the power of choice this condition could only be
brought about by the destruction of those who are persistent,
incorrigible, wrong choosers. Hence, death must be the penalty
for, arid consequence of, sin.
    2. Law may be expressed in two forms, affirmative and nega-
tive. Affirmatively, it points out the right, is obligatory, and
shows the path of duty. Negatively, it points out the sin, and
is prohibitory, and shows the forbidden path.
    3. Satan coveted power and position. He exalted himself above
God. Those who followed him and fell with him placed him
above God in their minds. Hence, all fallen angels violated
God's covenant in the same way Adam did.
    4. By those acts of sin both angels and man lost eternal life
and were shut up under condemnation to death.


LESSON IV.—God's Eternal Covenant Renewed in
                  Christ.
              JULY 27, 1907.
                           Questions.
  1. Since the penalty for sin is death, why did not
Adam's life terminate the day he sinned? 2 Peter 3: 9.
Note 1.
   2. In harmony with this what promise was given?
Gen. 3 : 15.
   3. Who is this promised seed? Gal. 4: 4; 3: 16.
   4. Whose place did Jesus take? 1 Cor. 15 : 45, 47.
   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
8          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    5. Did he render the obedience which God required
of Adam? John 15 : 10.
    6. What has God given Christ to be for the people?
Isa. 42: 6. Note 2.
    7. Under God's covenant, to whom was the earth
originally committed? Gen. 1 : 26, 27.
    8. In whom is its dominion to be re-established in
the renewal of this covenant? Isa. 49 : 8-10. Note 3.
    9. Since Christ is our substitute in renewing God's
covenant with us, what does he become to us? Jer.
23 : 6 ; 2 Cor. 5 : 21.
  10. What was the object of this plan of substitution?
2 Cor. 5 : 18-20.
  11. When one is reconciled to God in Christ Jesus,
what condition is restored? Rom. 5: 1.
  12. How extensive is God's plan for re-establishing
peace? Col. 1: 20; Eph. 1 : 10.
  13. What must we conclude from these facts? Ans.
—That God has one eternal, universal covenant, the cen-
ter of which is His law, and also one universal plan for
renewing this covenant when it is broken, in Christ
Jesus, and that is the Gospel of Christ.
                              Notes.
    1. That day the sentence of death passed upon Adam, .and
he did lose eternal life. God permitted him to retain a physical
life, which he had completely forfeited until the plan of sal-
vation could be submitted to him, and he avail himself of its
provisions if he would choose to do so. So every sinner has
forfeited the life he has, and is dead in trespasses and sins; but
God gives time to repent and accept the salvation He has pro-
vided.

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       9
    2. God says He will give Christ for the covenant of the people,
that is, Christ would furnish the people's part of the covenant.
God requires of the people perfect righteousness, but 'all have
failed, so Jesus came to stand in our stead and furnish what we
have failed to furnish, and thus to renew the broken covenant in
Himself and with the people in Him.
    3. If Adam had been faithful to God, the earth with all its
Edenic beauty would have been established in him. Isa. 49:8,
and on, shows that Christ, by performing the people's part of the
covenant, will bring back the condition which always accompanies
perfect righteousness, and thus in the second Adam the renewed
earth will be established by the renewal of the covenant. The
covenant thus renewed is called the new covenant. New in the
Bible often means renewed, as new heaven, new earth, new moon,
new heart, etc. .


   LESSON V.—Steps in Renewing the Covenant.
              AUGUST 3, 1907.
                            Questions.
   1. How was God's covenant broken by Adam? Gen.
2:17; 3:6.
    2. What led Eve to disobey? Heb. 11: 6, 7. Note 1.
   3. What, then, ,must God require of man in renewing
the covenant Mark 1: 15. Note 2.
    4. What was necessary for the life and development
of faith? James 2 : 18-20. Note 3.
    5. What was the means established by the Lord
whereby men might express their faith in His promise?
Heb. 11 : 4.
    6. By what ordinances do we express our faith in
the same promise? Acts 2 : 38 ; 1 Cor. 11 : 23-25. Note 4.
    7. What is done for the person who thus exercises
faith in Jesus? Rom. 3 : 24-26.
We expend sixty per cent. of our efforts upon four per cent, of
                          our field.
10         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    8. When his sins are remitted by faith, what is im-
puted to him? Rom. 4 : 22-24.
    9. How does faith work? Gal. 5: 6.
  10. How do we show that we love God? 1 John 5: 3.
  11. In order that we may keep His commandments,
what has God promised to do in making the new cove-
nant with us? Jer. 31 : 33.
  12. Who is a perfect representation of the new cove-
nant     Ps. 40:7, 8.
  13. Who knows the righteousness, or will, of God?
Isa. 51 : 7 ; Rom. 2 : 18.
  14. After we, by repentance and faith, have yielded
obedience to God, what more must be done for us? Acts
3:19.
  15. Has God promised to do this in the new covenant?
Jer. 31: 34; Heb. 10 :16, 17.
  16. Name the steps on man's part in the renewing
of the covenant? Note 5.
  17. Name the steps on God's part in dealing with each
case? Note 6.
                                  Notes.
     1. Satan deceived Eve and led her to distrust God so that she
fell through unbelief.
     2. Since man fell by a disobedience which was the outgrowth
of a lack of faith in God, it must be evident that man can be
reinstated only by an obedience which is the outgrowth of faith
in God.
     3. Life must find expression, so a living faith must be ex-
pressed in some way. If no expression is given, it will die; but
if it is exercised, it will grow.
     4. Since the covenant is renewed in Christ by faith, we con-
clude that any divinely appointed ordinance which expresses faith
is for the time being a part of the new covenant, or is a step
in the renewal of the covenant. Before the death of Christ,
        The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   11
sacrifices and offerings constituted the appointed way of express-
ing faith in a coming Saviour. So now the Lord's Supper, and
baptism are the appointed ordinances by which we show our faith
in a Saviour who has died, risen, and is coming again; and the
former ceremonies sustained then the same relation to the new
covenant that the latter ceremonies do now. Faith may be ex- I
pressed in other ways, but in no case could these be a substitute
for those appointed by God.
   5. The steps of a man in entering the new covenant are:
        (a) Repentance toward God, including a confession of,
            and a turning away from, sin.
        (b) Faith in Christ as expressed in God's appointed way,
            and thereby receiving the righteousness of God;
        (e) This faith working by love and leading the man to
            obedience.
   6. On God's part, the steps are:
        (a) Accepting man's repentance and faith in Christ, for-
            giving sin, and imputing to him God's righteousness.
        (b) Writing His law in the man's heart by the Holy Spirit
            so that the man can keep His commandments.
        (c) Eventually in the judgment blotting out the record of
            sin from the books of heaven.



LESSON VI.—Letter and Spirit of the New Covenant
                    AUGUST 10, 1907.
                        Questions.
    1. Of what are we made ministers? 2 Cor. 3 : 6.
    2. What two things of the new covenant may be
ministered? What is the result of each ministration
Same reference.
 • 3. Upon what was this ministration of death, or the
letter, written? 2 Cor. a : 7.
    4. What, then, is the letter of the new covenant?
Deut. 4 : 13 ; 10 : 4. Note 1.
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                    already to harvest."
12         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
     5. As co-laborers with Christ in the new covenant,
are we then to minister life or death to the children of
men? Luke 9 : 56.
     6. What is the primary object of the law? Rom.
7 : 10, first part ; 10 : 5.
    7. But what is the law found to be to us? Why?
Rom. 7 : 10. Note 2."
    8. If we are not to minister condemnation and death,
which come by the law, of what use is the law in
preaching the Gospel to sinners? Rota. 3 : 19 ; Matt.
9 : 12, 13.
    9. When men acknowledge themselves sinners, what
can we then minister to them and with what results?
Rom. 8: 2.
   10. What law is this? Rom. 8 : 7 ; John 15 : 10. Note
3.
   11. What will then pass, away? Rom. 8 : 1.
   12. What will be fulfilled in them if they walk after
the spirit? Rom. 8: 4.
   13. What will be condemned in them? Rom. 8 : 3.
   14. Where will that now be written which before was
written on the tables of stone? 2 Cor. 3: 3.
   15. In what covenant will they then be? Heb. 8 : 10.
                              Notes. •
    1. The letter of any covenant is that which defines the terms
of the covenant. The letter of a covenant for the building of a
house is the plans and specifications of the house, together
with the reward or penalty for the compliance or failure. The
letter sets forth that which the contracting parties are to per-
form. To one who has failed to comply, the letter points out
that failure and can only bring condemnation, and under God's
covenant, death. Hence the letter ministers only death to the
sinner.
             Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     13
   2. The object of the law is life; but life can only result from
perfect obedience to it. Prov. 12:28. Hence the law describes
a perfect righteousness. But we have all sinned, so that the law-
which was ordained to life, we find to be unto death. A per-
fect law can only condemn imperfection.
   3. Christ was baptized with God's Spirit (Matt. 3:16), by
whose power He kept for us God's law while here with us in
human sinful flesh. And it is through His obedience we are
enabled by God's Holy Spirit to also keep the same law that
Jesus kept. Then this same law which before ministered death,
becomes the law of life—"the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus." Rom. 8:2.

  LESSON VI-I.—The New Covenant—Covenant of
                   Liberty.
               AUGUST 17, .1907.
                           Questions.

   3. Are there others who promise liberty? What is
their condition? 2 Peter 2: 19.

 covenant of liberty? Jer. 34: 8-11, 18.
   16. When God confirmed His covenant with Abraham,
 what was done? Gen. 15 : 5, 8-10, 17.
   17. What did this divided sacrifice represent? Ans.
 —It represents our Sacrifice who is both Son of God and
•Son of Man, or Immanuel.
   18. How do we find liberty? John 8 : 36; Rom. 8 : 1, 2.
                             Note.
    The bondage is sin or transgression of the law. Christ
alone can save the sinner, and make him righteous or obedient.
When a man assumes by his own works to make himself right-
eous, he is taking upon himself an obligation that he can never
bear. The more one seeks to justify himself by his own acts,
the more he becomes entangled in the yoke of bondage, or
sin. Any theory or system which seeks righteousness by works
is but a yoke of bondage.

19 : 8 ; 24 : 3, 7.
   18. Upon whose promise does the second depend?
Jer. 31 : 33, 34; Eze. 36: 26, 27. Note 4.
   19. What do we learn from these illustrations about
the old covenant? Note 5.
                                Notes.
   1. In Gal. 4:22-28 Paul gives three illustrations of the cov-
enant of bondage; namely, Hagar and Ishmael, Mount Sinai and
the Israelites, and the Jerusalem of Paul's day with its people.
    2. From the illustrations here given we learn:
        (a) That this covenant is after the flesh.
        (b) That it is a substitution of man's works for God's
             works, or man trying to help God fulfil His promise.
        (c) That it is an effort on the part of man to provide for
             his own salvation.
    3. In all the murmuring of the children of Israel there was a
spirit of criticism of God's dealings with them. A murmur always
suggests the idea that the complaining one could suggest an
improvement. "I could do better than that myself" is the
under-current of all complaining. So when they reached Mount
Sinai God endeavored to teach them their weakness by giving
them a chance to show just what they could do.
    4. The promised results are the same in both covenants, but
the compliance on the part of the people in the first covenant
rested upon the promise of the people. "All that the Lord hath
said, we will do and be obedient," was the promise. Man's
promise was not good. But in the second the compliance rests
upon the promises of God. "/ will write the law in your, hearts.
I will take away the heart of stone and give a heart of flesh.
I will give you My Spirit. I will cause you to walk in My
statutes. I will remember your sins no more." These are the
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   17
better promises upon which the second is established, and they
are all good, for they are the promises of God. All we 'Ave to
do is to accept them and we find them to be yea and amen in
Christ Jesus. Notice, also, that the second has the advantage
of the promise of the forgiveness of sin, which does not appear
in the first at all.
    5. From these illustrations we learn:
        (a) That the old covenant is simply man's effort to keep
   •        God's commandments, and
        (b) That man's promises are of no 'avail and only deepen
            the bondage of sin.

LESSON IX.—The Covenant of Bondage (Concluded).
              AUGUST 31, 1907.
                     Questions.
   THIRD ILLUSTRATION—JERUSALEM AND ITS PEOPLE.
    1.. What were the Jews in Paul's day following after?,
Rom. 9 : 31.
    2. Why could they not attain it? Rom. 9 : 32.
    3. Were they earnest in their efforts? What did they
lack? Rom. 10: 2.
    4. Of what were they ignorant? What were they,
trying to establish? Rom. 10 : 3.
    5. At what did they stumble? Why? Rom. 9 : 32,
33. Note 1.

18        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
  10. Who, then, are in the covenant of bondage Ans.
—All who are not justified by faith in Jesus.
  11. When does the covenant of bondage pass away?
2 Cor. 3: 16, 17. Note 4.
                          Notesf
• 1. The Jews were . trying, by their own works, to establish
 their own righteousness, and like all others who trust in morality
 for justification, they were too proud to acknowledge their own
 helplessness, and to submit to receiving righteousness by simple
 faith in Jesus, and so they stumbled. In this illustration we have
 the same fact; namely, man seeking justification by his own
 works, and man seeking to provides his own salvation.
     2. In Cain and Abel we have the first recorded illustration
 of the two covenants. Both brought an offering. One, a tiller
 of the soil, brought the fruits of his labor. The other brought
 an offering in faith. The results show that while man's. work
 left Cain in bondage of sin, faith gave Abel liberty. And so
it is to-day; the child of bondage hated• the child of liberty and
slew him. Would you know why"? Read 1 John 3:12.
     3. If one seek to be justified by works, he must be able
to show that he never has sinned, for just one sin would con-
demn him.
    4. Many think the old covenant of bondage passed away at
the cross. The death of Jesus provides for its passing away,
but it only passes away with the individual when the Spirit of
God enters the heart by faith. Then the covenant of liberty
takes its place. So the ministration of death, or condemnation
of the law in 2 Cor. 3:7. This passes away when the sinner
accepts Christ. The veil of unbelief is taken from the heart
and the heart turns to the Lord (verses 14-16) ; then comes
liberty. Too many expressions in the Scripture are placed at
the death of Christ, when in reality they are matters of Chris-
tian experience, applying at all times in the world's history where
faith is found, so that Abel, Abraham, and the psalmist before
the death of Christ could walk at liberty by faith equally with
Paul, John, and the Christian of to-day; hence, a Jew and a
Gentile before the cross, if both came into Christ Jesus, would
be just as fully and completely one as two such persons in
Christ are to-day.

LESSON X.—Other Names Applied to New Covenant.
               SEPTEMBER 7, 1907.
                            Questions.
   INTRODUCTORY NOTE: We have found that the new covenant
centers in Christ, and to accept Him by faith is to keep the new
covenant. The preaching of Christ is the Gospel, so that by the
preaching of the Gospel, the new covenant is set before men.
    1. What did God set before Abraham? Gal. 3: 8.
     2. Did Abraham believe God? With what result?
Gal. 3 : 6.
     3. In 'whom is the Abrahamic covenant confirmed?
Gal. 3 : 17, first part. How do we become partakers
of the blessing with Abraham? Gal. 3: 9.
     4. Whose children are we if we take hold of Christ
by faith? Gal. 3 : 29, 7. Note 1.
     5. What invitation is given to all? Isa. 55 : 1, 2.
    6. Is this a Gospel invitation? Ans.—Yes, because it
invites men to come to Christ,
     7. What does God say He will make with those who
heed it Isa. 55 : 3.
    8. What is the blood of Jesus called? Matt. 26 : 28.
     9. How is it spoken of in Hebrews 13 : 20, 21?
Note 2.
   10. What is the Gospel sometimes called? Rom. 10: 15.
   11. What comes to one who is justified by faith? Rom.
5 : 1.
   12. Give another name for the children of God. Matt.
5 : 1.
   13. What covenant is connected with God's mercy?
Eze. 34 : 25 ; Isa. 54 : 10.
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."
 20         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   14. When the law is written in the heart so that one
 loves it, what follows Ps. 119: 165. Note 3.
                               Notes.
    1. Since the children of Christ are the children of Abraham
 and partakers of the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, we con-
 clude that the term "Covenant with Abraham" is simply another
 name for the new covenant.
     2. The term "Everlasting Covenant" is only another name for
 the new, or renewed covenant.
     3., Thus we see that these terms are all applied to one and
 the same covenant, but in each one it is viewed from a different
 standpoint. From the standpoint of God and those.beings who
 have never sinned, it is God's everlasting covenant; from the
 standpoint of sinners saved by faith, it is the new or renewed
 covenant; from the standpoint of an Israelite, it is the Abrahamic
 covenant; from the standpoint of the strife and confusion of
 sin, it is the covenant of peace.


        LESSON XL—Confirming the Covenant.
               SEPTEMBER 14, 1907.
                            Questions.

this substitution Col. 1: 19, 20. Note 1.
              CONFIRMED WITH THE SINNER.
    7. In what words was this covenant set before Abra-
ham Gen. 12 : 2 ; 17 : 7, 8.
    8. How was the inheritance to come to Abraham?
Gal. 3 :18.
    9. How did Abraham take hold of this covenant?
Gal. 3 : 6 ; Rom. 4 : 20-22.
  10. How did Abraham manifest his faith? James
2: 22. In order to give strong confidence, how did God
confirm the promise? Heb. 6 : 13-18.
  11. How may all sinners take hold of this covenant

  12. What did God demand of Abraham in renewing
the covenant Gen. 17 : 1, last part.
  13. What did he set before him as the source of his
strength in doing this? Gen.-17 : 1, first part.
   14. As we have found, the renewing of the covenant
calls for the writing of the law in the heart, so as to
lead to obedience ; was this accomplished for- Abraham?
Gen. 26 : 5.
   15. Does the Bible speak of the confirming of this
everlasting covenant with others? Dan. 9 : 27.
   16. What do all become who take hold of Christ?
Gal. 3 : 29.
   17. What will the children of Abraham do? John
8 : 39.
                              Notes.
   1. By these texts it will be clearly seen that Chiist, in counsel
      "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
22        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
with the Father, offered Himself as a substitute for man, that
God accepted this offer, and thus the new, or renewed, covenant
was confirmed of God in Christ by promise; Christ bringing to
man the righteousness man failed to furnish, and meeting the
penalty which man had incurred by sin.
   2. By these texts we see that the new, or renewed, c ovenant
was confirmed between God and Abraham in Christ, by promise
on God's part, and by faith on Abraham's part. In exactly this
way it was, and is, confirmed with every sinner, whether before
or since the cross.



     LESSON X11.—Ratification of the Covenant.
              SEPTEMBER 21, 1,907.
                          Questions.
   INTRODUCTORY NOTE: We have found that the cove-
nant was confirmed of God in Christ ; the Son to furnish
a perfect obedience and to meet the penalty for man.
When this is done, then the covenant must be ratified,
first between the Father and Son, and second, between
the Father and each individual who is found in Christ.
    1. Did Christ lead a sinless life in the flesh? 1
Peter 2 : 22 ; Heb. 4 : 15.
    2. What did He suffer in man's stead? Gal. 3 : 13,
14 ; 4 : 4, 5.
    3. Immediately after His resurrection what homage
did He refuse? Why? John 20 : 17.
    4. For what purpose did He ascend to the Father?
Note 1.
    5. What did He present before God? Heb. 9 : 14.
    6. What was the purpose of this? Note 1.
    7. What incident, upon His return to earth, shows
that the Father had accepted the sacrifice. Matt. 28: 9.
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.

1 John 2 : 6.
    9. How can we thus walk? 1 John 5: 4.
  10. As we thus walk in Christ and overcome the world,
what takes place in our hearts? Heb. 10: 16, 17.
  11. In connection with what event will the final blot-
ting out of sin take place? Acts 3 : 19, 20.
   12. By virtue of what are sins blotted out? Heb. 9
22, 23.
   13. In this act of blotting out sins, what takes place?
What is the condition of the one for whom this is done?
Note 2.
   14. What work will thdn cease? Why? Heb. 8 :11.
   15. What will be the relation thus ratified? Heb. 8 :
10, last part ; Rev. 21: 7.
                               Notes.
   1. "Jesus refused to receive the homage of His people until
He knew that His sacrifice had been accepted by the Father,
and until He had received the assurance from God Himself that
His atonement for the sins of His people had been full and
ample, that through His blood they might gain eternal life. Jesus
immediately ascended to heaven and presented Himself before
the throne of God, showing the marks of shame and cruelty upon
His brow, his hands, and feet. But He refused to receive the
coronet of glory, and the royal robe, and He also refused the
adoration of the angels as He had refused the homage of Mary,
until the Father signifiet-1 that His offering was accepted.
   "He also had a ,request to prefer concerning His chosen
ones upon earth. He wished to have the relation clearly defined
that His redeemed should hereafter sustain to heaven, and to
His Father. His church must be justified and accepted before
He could accept heavenly honor. He declared it to be His will
that where He was, there His church should be; if He was to have
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come,"
:24         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 glory, His people must share it with Him. They who suffer with
 Him on earth must finally reign with Him in His kingdom. In
 the most explicit manner Christ pleaded for His church, identify-
 ing His interests with theirs, and advocating, with a love and
 constancy stronger than death, their rights and' titles gained
 through Him.
     "God's answer to this appeal goes forth in the proclamation:
 `Let all the angels of God worship Him.' Every angelic emn-
 mander obeys the royal mandate, and Worthy, worthy is the
 Lamb that was slain; and that lives again a triumphant con-
 queror! echoes and reechoes through all heaven. The innumera-
 ble company of angels prostrate themselves before the Re-
 deemer. The request of Christ is granted; the church is justified
 through Him, its Representative and Head. Here the Father
 ratifies the contract with His Son, that He will be reconciled to
 repentant and obedient men, and take them into divine favor
 through the merits of Christ. Christ guarantees that He will
 make a man 'more precious than fine gold, even a man that the
 golden wedge of Ophir.' All power in heaven and on earth
 is now given to the Prince of life; yet He does not for a moment
 forget His poor disciples in a sinful world, but prepares to
 return to them, that He may impart to them His power and
 glory. Thus did the Redeemer of mankind, by the sacrifice of
 Himself, connect earth with Heaven, and finite man: with the
 infinite God."—"Great Controversy," (Old Edition) Vol. 3, pp.
202, 303.
     2. When the name comes up in judgment and the sins are
 thus blotted out, there is removed the last vestige of separation
 between God and the sinner. In this act the new covenant is
 ratified between God and the individual. The, covenant relation
 broken by sin is thus fully restored, and the redeemed stand be-
 fore God as though they never had sinned.

                                 Notes.
    1. Abraham asked for a sign by which he might know that
he would inherit the land. God told him to prepare a sacrifice,
which he did, cutting the sacrifice in two and separating the
parts. Then the sign was given in the smoking furnace and the
lamp of fire passing between the pieces,—" symbols of the divine
presence," confirming the covenant with Abraham See "Patri-
archs ad Prophets," page 137. These two symbols represent the
two manifestations of God's power in carrying out the promises
in the new or Abrahamic covenant. First, the "burning lamp,"
representing the work of the Holy Spirit in searching out sin, in
purifying and refining the hearts of men, and thus developing
the true seed who are heirs of the promise. Secondly, " the smo-
king furnace," representing the power of God in the destruction
of sin and sinners, and the cleansing of the earth, thus pre-
paring the possession for the seed.
    A little later God gave Abraham a practical illustration of
the one sign when he beheld the destruction of Sodom, etc.,
and saw the smoke ascend "as the smoke of a great furnace"
which destruction was ever to stand before the world as a type
of the destruction of the wicked; but notice that the righteous
were first saved out of it.
    2. The same day that God made a covenant with Abraham
for the future possession of the whole earth, He also made a
covenant with him that his seed should possess the land of
Canaan, and this was literally fulfilled under the reigns of David
and Solomon when the dominions of Israel were co-extensive with
the description given in Gen. 15:18-21, and extended from the
river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates. Thus this ex-
perience .of the natural seed became an imperfect illustration
(imperfect because of the sins of the natural seed) of the future
possession of the whole earth by the spiritual seed. Thus the
children of Israel did not take possession of the land of Canaan
under the covenant made with them at Mount Sinai, as some
suppose; but under this provision of the covenant with Abraham
concerning the natural seed. This, God fulfilled by giving them
possession of all the land He had promised, and separating them
from all the other nations of earth, and continuing these con-
ditions in spite of their sins, until the promised Messiah appeared.
Then this special phase passed away, and that people was no
longer the separate chosen people of God; and with this phase
ceased all those types, symbols, ordinances, and ceremonies which
in any way prefigure the first advent of Jesus.

    Upon the question of the two promises and the two lands of
promise, read "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 47-2-477.
    3. The renewal of the covenant involved the renewal of man
and his inheritance. When this is done, the covenant will be
fully renewed. Then the renewed, or new, man with the law of
God in his heart, will live in the renewed, or new, earth under
this renewed, or new, covenant throughout eternity.

The Gospel Story Three Times Told
    While the special purpose of these readers is to put the child in
possession of a complete key to English reading, they also fa-
miliarize him with the most important Bible truths. Three times
over they tell of God's plan for the earth in the beginning, the
successive steps in the work of Creation, something about each
of these steps, a sketch of certain selected Bible child biographies
including the life of Jesus, His work and suffering, the plan of
salvation finished, and the new earth.
The First Time:
    In simple language, by attractive pictures, and the best methods
of teaching reading, True Education Reader No. 1 fixes upon the
child's mind in his first school year an outline of the beautiful
Gospel story from Creation to Redemption.
The Second Time:
   Enriched by many illustrations, enlarged by additional topics,
made more interesting by sketches from the lives of insects, birds,
and animals, the incidents in the Gospel story are given the sec-
ond time in True Education Reader No. 2.
The Third Time:
    True Education Reader No. 3 tells it again, and in connection
with it brings in a variety of other matter such as poems,
biographical sketches, Bible selections, our Saviour 's parables,
simple lessons on physiology, geography, and botany, and adapts
it all to the growing intelligence of the child in his third school
year for whose use it is intended.
How the Mind Is Prepared for This Thrice-told Story:
    The oral Bible Lessons which follow the same outline as the
readers are given by the teacher or parent before (perhaps one
or two weeks) the child comes to the subject in his reading, so
when he does come to the lesson in his reading, he recognizes it
and reads with greater interest and understanding.
And Then the Story Is Reviewed:
   The regular text-book for Bible study which is now being pre-
             GOSPEL STORY THREE TIMES TOLD                      31
pared for grades or school years four, five, and six, is developed
from this same outline. Hence the child's fourth, fifth, and sixth
year's work in Bible will be in the nature of a review of the les-
sons, the general features of which he has been made familiar
with during the preceding three years.
An Illustration :
    Suppose a child with his parents takes a trip across the con-
tinent. Before he reaches each point of special interest, he is told
a story concerning it by his parents. When the point is reached
he has developed an interest in it, and is likely to remember some-
thing about it.
    The next year the trip is taken again. The same method is
followed by the parents. More points are, visited, and much more
is learned about those seen the first time.
    The succeeding year he takes the same journey, but with various
side trips, and spends more time at each point. Old memories are
revived and strengthened, new facts concerning familiar places
are learned, and all is vividly impressed upon his mind by the
thrice-told story to which he has listened and the threefold view
he has enjoyed.
The Application :
    This is the kind of a trip and the method of instruction en-
joyed by the child who learns to read by use of the True Educa-
tion Reader Series, books One, Two, and Three.
The Harmony of This Plan :
    So you see the True Education Reader Series harmonizes with
the plans and methods adopted by the Educational Department
of the General Conference in behalf of our church schools.
Description and Prices :
   These books are each durably bound in cloth, and will be. sent
post-paid at the following prices:
         No. 1 contains 204 pages                $0.75
