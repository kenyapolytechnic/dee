       SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         3

    5. What statement concerning creation is made in
Ps. 148 : 5?
    6. What is said of the power and wisdom exercised
in the work of creation? Jer. 10 : 12.
    7. Did the new creation represent the perfect will
of God? Ps. 135: 6.
    8. What will the Lord's word do when hidden in the
heart? Ps. 119 : 11. Note 4.
    9. What is said of the character of the Lord's word?
Ps. 12 : 6.

                           Notes.
   1. An absolute Creator must be able to bring into being that
which before was non-existent. Thus the apostle says, "The
worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is
seen bath not been made out of things which appear." Hell.
11:3, A. R. V.
      ?'lie needs of   the czuse of God are tvgrld-tPtirle.
4       SABBATH-SCHOOL        LESSON    QUARTERLY
    2. God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. The
decree of the Lord, "Let there be," in each step in creation
made it so.
    3. God's Spirit invariably accompanies His word, so that
Jesus could say of that which He declared, "The words that I
speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." John 6:63.
In creation it is said, "the Spirit of God moved upon ["was
brooding upon," margin, A. R. V.] the face of the waters." Thus
"God said, Lt the waters swarm with swarms of living crea-
tures." "And God created the great sea-monsters, and every
living creature that moveth, wherein the waters swarmed, after
their kind." Gen 1:2, 20, 21, A. R. V.
    4. Those who meditate upon God's word day and night, be-
come imbued with the Spirit in the word and are thereby kept
from transgression.

                     OCTOBER 12, 1907.

        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                          5

ment? Eze. 20 : 20. Note 4.

Note 5.
   10. When does the Sabbath begin? When does it
end? Lev. 23 : 32, last part.
   11. What marks the beginning and the ending' of each

   13. Upon what day of the week does the Sabbath

   14. With what sacredness did the Christian women

   15. What day of the week follows the Sabbath "ac-
cording to the commandment"? Luke 24 : 1.
   16. What was Paul's custom regarding the Sabbath?
 Acts 17 : 1-3; 18 : 4.
   17. What was he doing at Corinth during the six
working-days? Acts 18: 1-3.
                              Notes.
   1. Dr. Adam Clarke says, in his' comments on Gen. 2:2, "It
is worthy of notice that the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Sa-
maritan, read the sixth day instead of the seventh; and this should
            Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
6        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
be considered the genuine reading, which appears from these ver-
sions to have been originally that of the Hebrew text."
   2. "The blessing and sanctification of the seventh day were
because that God had rested upon it. His resting upon it, then,
was to lay the foundation for blessing and sanctifying the day."
—"Andrew's History of the Sabbath," page 15.
   3. The Sabbath commandment is very definite. It relates to
a definite day and gives the reasons why this particular day should
be observed. The day to be kept holy is the seventh day which
God made holy by resting upon it and placing His blessing upon
that day.
   4. The Sabbath was designed that man might have a perpetual,
weekly reminder of the power of God to create the world, and
therefore His power and ability to sanctify and save the believer.
The Sabbath is a' sign of sanctification which the Lord has given
to His people.
    5. The heritage of Jacob spoken of in this text is a part in
the new earth—a share with the redeemed people of God in the
eternal kingdom.
    6. At the time when Christ was on the earth the Pharisees
thought it wrong to heal the afflicted on the Sabbath day. They
therefore waited till the setting of the sun, or closing of the Sab-
bath, before bringing the sick to Jesus to be healed.

8       SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
                           Note:
   Our eyes may deceive us, and our ears may fail to correctly
understand, but the prophetic word is infallible and will surely
be fulfilled It is more certain than the seeing of the eyes, or
the hearing of the Oars, for it can not fail. Prophecy shines •
into a dark .place, throwing light upon the future.


LESSON IV.—The Four • Great Kingdoms of Daniel's
                   Vision.

     "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         9

   11. How much of the earth seemed to be devastated
by this kingdom? Verse 23.
   12. How many horns were seen upon the head of the
fourth beast?. Verse 7, last part.
_ 13. What are these horns said to represent? Verse

   14. Following the career of the little horn, what next

   15. What is then established, and where? Verse 27.
   16. Who will have a place in this kingdom? 2 Peter
1 : 4-11.
                             Notes.
   1. In prophecy winds denote war and strife (Jer. 25:32, 33),
and sea or waters denote "multitudes, and nations, and tongues."
Rev. 17 :15. It was through the terrible scenes of war that nations
were overturned, and kingdoms built up. The Lord said of His
people, "I will scatter them with a whirlwind among the nations
whom they knew not." Zech. 7:14.
   2. The kingdom symbolized by the lion with eagle's wings
is Babylon. In the second chapter this same universal kingdom
was represented by the head of gold. Babylon was founded by
Nimrod, of whom it is written, "Also Cush begat Nimrod,
who was the first to be a despot in the earth. He was
an overbearing tyrant in Jehovah's sight; wherefore the saying,
Even as Nimrod the overbearing tyrant in Jehovah's sight."
Gen. 10:8, 9. (Spurrel's translation.) This kingdom came into
the field of prophecy about B. c. 606. Habakkuk, speaking of
Babylon, says, "They shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat."
Chap. 1:8. The plucking of the wings, and receiving. a man's
heart, doubtless denotes its loss of bravery and final downfall.
    3. The second great beast, the bear with three ribs in its
mouth, corresponds to the breast and arms of silver in the dream
recorded in Daniel 2, and symbolizes the kingdom of Media and
Persia. This kingdom is mentioned by name in Dan. 8:20.
The bear raising itself up on one side represents the two lines
of kings, with one, the Persian, becoming more prominent than
the other.

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
10         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    4. The third beast is a symbol of the Grecian kingdom that
conquered the Medes and Persians. The two wings on the lion
being an indication of its rapidity in conquest, the four wings
on the leopard must picture great haste in its warfare of con-
quest. This kingdom is represented in Dan. 8:5 by a swiftly run-
ning goat, which destroyed everything in its course.
    5. Rome is symbolized by this nondescript beast. It bruised
and conquered the Grecian empire. Gibbon, writing concerning the
decline and fall of this empire, uses the following striking language,
" The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in battle, al-
ways victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the Euphra-
tes, the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean; and the images of gold,
or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations or
their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of
Rome."
    Another writer has said: "How accurately it answers to the
beast before us 1 In the dread and terror which it inspired, and
in its exceeding strength, the world has never seen its equal.
It devoured as with iron teeth, and brake in pieces; and it ground
the nations into the very dust beneath its brazen feet."—U. Smith.
    The ten horns upon the head of this beast represent the ten
divisions into which this kingdom was divided. These may be
enumerated as follows: (1) Alemanni, (2) Ostrogoths, (3) Visi-
goths, (4) Franks, (5) Vandels, (6) Suevi, (7) Burgundians,
(8) Heruli, (9) Anglo-Saxons, (10) Lombards. The period of
what may appropriately be called the dissolution, or dismember-
ment, of the empire covered almost one hundred fifty years, from
A. D. 351 to 485.
    6. It is said, "As concerning the rest of the beasts, they
had their dominion taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for
a season and time." Dan. 7:12. But with the dreadful and
terrible beast it was not so. It, in its last and worst phase, was
cast bodily into the burning flame, and consumed. See verse 11.



         LESSON V.—The Papacy, or Little Horn.
                       NOVEMBER 2, 1907.
                            Questions.
   1. While the prophet was considering in vision the
ten horns of the fourth beast, what did he behold coming
     The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       11
up among them? How is this horn described? What
is said of its work? Dan. 7: 8.
    2. Against whom did the little horn make war?
Verse 21.
    3. How long did it continue its wicked course?
Verse 22. Note 1.
    4. What is said of its .treatment of the saints? Verse
25.
    5. What is said of its words? How did it look?
Verse 20.
    6. What is its attitude toward the law of God?
Verse 25. Note 2.
    7. How long did its supremacy continue? Verse 25.
    8. How does the apostle Paul speak of this power?
By what titles does he refer to it? 2 ,Thess. 2
    9. How early was this apostasy working? Verses 6, 7.
   10. What will be the final end of this power, and
when? Verse 8.
   11. What is said in this connection of Satan's filial
 deceptions? Verses 9, 10.
   12. If we reject the truth what will come upon us?
 Verses 11, 12.
   13. What should , be our daily prayer? Ps. 119:
133, 134.
                              Notes.
    1. The prophetic period referred to in verse 25 relates to, and
 covers the time of, papal supremacy, which began in A. D. 538,
 when the last of the three opposing powers (the Vandals, Heruli,
 and Ostrogoths) was plucked up. The Revelator says that this
 power was to continue for a "time, times, and half a time"
"The Advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                      watchword.
12       SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

(Rev. 12:14), or forty-two months. Prophetic time is calculated
on the basis of one day for a year (Num. 14:34; Eze. 4:3-6).
As the period of papal supremacy began in 538 A. D., and was
to continue for a time, times, and the dividing of time, or forty-
two months, or three and a half years prophetic time, it would
reach to 1798 A. D. Precisely at the termination of this period
in A. D. 1798, General Bernier took the pope of Rome prisoner,
and carried him to Valance, in France, where he died in exile.
    2. The Papacy was to think to change, or think itself able to
change, God's law. No human power could change the law of
God.



      LESSON VI.—The Change of the Sabbath.

                     NOVEMBER 9, 1907.

                           Questions.

    1. WhaI inspired statements are made concerning the
enduring character of God's law? Ps. 111: 7, 8; Matt.
5 : 17-19.
   • 2. What did Jesus say regarding His obedience to
His Father's commandments? John 15: 10.
     3. What does the Lord say of the unchangeable na-
ture of His law and word? Ps. 89: 34. Compare Deut.
4:12, 13.
     4. Which day is the Sabbath "according to the com-
mandment"? Ex. 20: 8-11.
     5. How long will the Sabbath remain unchanged?
Ex. 31: 16, 17; Isa. 66: 22, 23.
     6. What did the prophet see coming up among the
ten horns of the fourth beast? Describe this symbol.
Dan: 7:8. Note 1.
      "There shall be delay no longer"--our confidence.
         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        13

    7. Concerning what did the prophet especially ask
for an explanation? Dan. 7 : 19, 20.
    8. What is said in reference to the work of this little-
horn power? Dan. 7 : 25. Note 2.
    9. In what way has this power thought to change
the law of God? Note 3.
   10. When was the first law enacted for the observance
of Sunday? Note 4.
   11. How many will follow this beast power? Rev.
13 : 8.
   12. How may we know that we are servants of the
Lord? Rom. 6 : 16; 1 John 2 : 3.
   13. How may, we know when others are not? Isa.
8 : 20.
   14. What decision should all make without delay?
1 Kings 18 : 21; Joshua 24 : 15.
                              Notes.
     1. This horn which plucked up three other horns in order
 to establish itself, represents Rome in its papal form. Surely
  no better symbol could have been chosen than this. Eyes like
  the eyes of a man, and a mouth which speaks blasphemous things,
  foreshadow with remarkable accuracy the shrewd, cunning, de-
. ceitful work of the man of sin.
      2. The exceedingly wicked character of this power is set forth
  in the most 'forcible manner. He shall "speak great words
  against the Most High," and shall wear out His saints. Witness
  the blasphemous titles, such as "vicegerent of the Son of God,"
  "another God upon earth," and the assumption of papal infal-
  libility, etc. Concerning the persecuting character of this power,
  note the following:
         No computation can reach the numbers who have been put
  to death, in different ways, on account of their maintaining the
  profession of the Gospel, and opposing the corruptions of the

 "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send

  17. What are we bidden to do? Heb. 4 : 16.
                              Notes.
    1. The Lord does not leave without help those who are called
to do an important work. Designing and preparing material for
the sanctuary demanded wisdom from God, and it was given.
Moses was also careful to tell the people of the choice the Lord
had made of workmen, and also to inform them about how they
had been qualified to do the work. This information gave the
people confidence and secured their cooperation. See Ex. 35:30-35.
     2. In Exodus, chapters 25 to 30, is found a detailed description
of the sanctuary and its furniture. All should study those chap-
ters. In brief, the tabernacle was, an oblong building, thirty
cubits in length, ten cubits wide, and ten cubits high. When
pitched, it faced the east, so that the worshipers, on approaching
it, always faced west, and had their backs toward the sun-rising.
This building, which was placed inside of what was called the
court, had boards for its sides and for the west end. It was
divided into two apartments by a veil placed ten cubits from the
west• end, and was closed in front with a veil, or curtain. The
first apartment was ten cubits wide and twenty cubits long. In
this apartment was a golden altar, called the altar- of incense.
             Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
 18       SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 On the south side stood the seven-branched candlestick with its
 seven lamps; on the north, the table of showbread. In the second
 apartment, or holy of holies, was placed the ark, which contained
 the law of God, covered by the mercy-seat, and overshadowed by
 the cherubim of glory.
    3. The glory connected with the sanctuary was especially asso-
 ciated with the inner apartment, or the holy of holies. It was
 there that the sacred ark, containing the law of God, was de-
 posited. At a later date, when the Philistines defeated Israel and
 took the ark of the Lord, it was said, " The glory is departed from
 Israel, for the ark of God is taken." 1 Sam. 4:22.
    4. John had a view of the work of Christ in the heavenly
sanctuary some sixty years after He had ascended to heaven.
He was there seen ministering in the apartment which contained
the seven lamps. This was the first apartment. See Ex. 40:24;
Heb. 9:1, 2.
    5. This view of the opening of the temple in heaven was at
the time when the work of judgment commenced. A view is there-
fore given of that part of the sanctuary where the ark is, which
contains the law of God. This law is the great rule of the
judgment; by it the lives of all men are to be compared.

    5. What offerings were made by the priests for them-
selves on the day of atonement? Verses 6, 14.
    6. What disposition was made of the two goats which

entire yearly round of service?
   11. Unto what did this serve? Heb. 8 : 1, 2.
   12. Is it necessary that the heavenly sanctuary be
cleansed? Heb. 9 : 23.
   13. When is the heavenly sanctuary to be cleansed?
Dan. 8 : 14.
   14. Could the sacrifices offered by the Levitical priests
actually take away sins' Heb. 9: 8-10.
   15. What offering does suffice? Heb. 9 : 11-14.
   16. How is it that Christ has become the Mediator of
the new covenant? For whom does He mediate? Is
He your Mediator? Heb. 9 : 15. Note 4.
                           Notes.
   1. To cleanse from sin was.in the type to make an atonement
for sin. The word atonement signifies at-one-ment. The person
whose sins are atoned for, is "at-one" with the Lord.
We expend sixty per cent. of our efforts upon four per cent. of
                          our field.
20       SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. The people brought their offerings to the sanctuary dur-
 ing the entire year till the day of atonement, or the tenth day
of the seventh month. Those making offerings day after day con-
 fessed their sins upon the head of the sacrifices. The offering
 thus consecrated was then slain, and the priest did with it accord-
 ing to prescribed rites in each case. In some instances the blood
 was taken into the sanctuary, and the body was "burned without
 the camp." In other cases some of the blood was sprinkled on
the horns of the altar of burnt-offerings, and the remainder
 poured out at the bottom of the same altar. The sins thus con-
fessed are represented as defiling the sanctuary. They were lodged
there until the day of atonement, when the sanctuary was cleansed.
    3. The goat chosen by lot as the Lord's goat, represents
Christ. The scapegoat represents Satan. See Lev. 16:8, margin,
" Azazel." This is an ancient name for Satan among Eastern
peoples. As the Lord's goat was slain, and its' blood offered in
the typical sanctuary for the sins of the people, so was Christ
slain, and His blood is offered in the true sanctuary for the sins
of the people. All the sins which had been confessed in connection
with the sanctuary service during the entire year, were, at the
close of the typical day of atonement, laid upon the head of
the scapegoat, which was sent by the hand of a fit man into
the wilderness to perish. This also meets' its fulfilment in the
antitype. Christ is our High Priest. Through the merits of His
blood those who confess their sins are redeemed and washed
from all sin. As the closing act in His work of cleansing the
sanctuary,. He will lay these sins for. which He has atoned
upon the head of their originator—Satan. He will carry them,
not as a Saviour, but as a scapegoat from the sanctuary into
the wilderness—the earth in its chaotic condition—to be des-
troyed when the Lord cleanses the earth by fire from all sin.
    4. Christ in His sacrifice died for all. He is as a lamb slain
from the foundation of the world; therefore, every offering made
by faith from the beginning of the world until the death of
Christ was made as an expression of faith in the one great
offering for sins. That offering is the offering of Christ, made
without the gate (Heb. 13:11, 12). He is now making the
true atonement in the real sanctuary in heaven by virtue of His
own blood. He makes the atonement for the transgressions of
all believers under both the old and the new covenant.

        The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.

             LESSON IX.—The 2300 Days.

                   NOVEMBER 30, 1907.
                          Questions.
  1. When did the heavenly visitants, to whom the
prophet listened in vision, say the sanctuary would be
cleansed? Dan. 8 : 14. Note 1.
    2. Who was appointed to make Daniel understand
the vision? Verse 16. Note 2.
    3. Was the vision fully explained to the prophet at
this time? Verse 27.
    4. How did Daniel search for light? Dan. 9 : 1-3.
Note 3.
    5. In response to his earnest petitions, who was sent
to him with light? Verses 20-23. What was he told to
consider? Note 4.
    6. How did Gabriel begin his explanation of the
vision    Verses 24-27.
    7. From what event are the 2300 days to date?
Verse 25.
    8. When did the decree to fully restore and build

22      SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  12. How were the remaining three and one-half years
fulfilled? Heb. 2 : 3.
  13. When did the days end? Note 8.
  14. What message announcing the beginning of the
judgment, or ending of the 2300 days, was to be pro-
claimed? Rev. 14 : 6, 7.
  15. When the work in the heavenly sanctuary is fin-
ished, what solemn decree will go forth? Rev. 22 : 11.
  16. Who will be able to stand in that day? Psalm 15.
                             Notes.
    1. As the earthly sanctuary was cleansed each year, this must
refer to the heavenly sanctuary, which was to be cleansed at the
end of twenty-three hundred days, or years.
    2. It was Michael, the Son of God, who commissioned Gabriel
to make Daniel understand the vision. Compare Dan. 8 :16
chap. 10:13, 21.
    3. By carefully reading chapter 8, which contains this vision
and the interpretation so far as given by the angel, it will be
seen that all was fully explained except the part referring to the
time when the sanctuary would be cleansed. Daniel sought dili-
gently by prayer and confession of sin for further light.
    4. When the angel came to Daniel, he bade him understand
the vision." He then began at once to explain that part of the
vision of the previous chapter which was left unexplained; viz.,
the noo days.
    5. The Lord has chosen in prophecy to use a day to represent
a year. See Num. 14:34; Eze. 4:4, 5; also with Dan. 7:25 com-
pare Rev. 12:6, 14; 13:5. The twenty-three hundred days there-
fore cover a period of twenty-three hundred years.
    This period began B. c. 457, when the full decree regarding
the building and restoration of Jerusalem went forth. It there-
fore ends A. D. 1844.
    6. Sixty-nine weeks, or 483 full years from B. c. 457, when
the full decree to restore and build Jerusalem went forth (Ezra
7), bring us to A. D. 27. At this very time Jesus was baptized
and anointed by the Holy Spirit for His work. Matt. 3 :13-17 ;
Acts 10:38. After His baptism, He went forth throughout Gali-
lee preaching and saying, "The time is fulfilled." Mark 1:15.
            Prayerfully consider the iinentered fields.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        23
 He no doubt referred to the prophetic time, and to the very
 prophecy we are now studying.
     7. "When the loud cry, 'It is finished,' came from the lips
 of Christ, the priests' were officiating in the temple. It was the
 hour of the evening sacrifice. The lamb representing Christ
_ had been brought to be slain. Clothed in his significant and
 beautiful dress, the pripst stood with lifted knife, as did Abraham
 when he was about to slay his son. With intense interest the
 people were looking on. But the earth trembles and quakes; for
 the Lord Himself draws near. With a rending noise the inner
 veil of the temple is torn from top to bottom by an unseen hand,
 throwing open to the gaze of the multitude a place once filled
 with the presence of God. In this place the shekinah had dwelt.
 Here God had manifested His glory above the mercy-seat. No
 one but the high priest ever lifted the veil separating this apart-
 ment from the rest of the temple. He entered in once a year
 to make an atonement for the sins of the people. But lo, this
 veil is rent in twain. The mose holy place of the earthly sanc-
 tuary is no longer sacred.       •
     "All is terror and confusion. The priest is about to slay
 the victim; but the knife drops from his nervous hand, and the
 lamb escapes. Type has met antitype in the death of God's
 Son. The great sacrifice has been made. The way into the
 holiest is' laid open. A new and living way is prepared for all.
 No longer need sinful, sorrowing humanity await the coming of
 the high priest. Henceforth the Saviour was to officiate as priest
 and advocate in the heaven of heavens. It was as if a living
 voice had spoken to the worshipers, There is now an end to all
 sacrifices' and offerings for sin."—" Desire of Ages," pp. 908, 909,
  Trade Edition.
      8. As the seventy weeks, or four hundred ninety days, literal
  years, were allotted to the Jews, and the covenant was to be
  confirmed with the Jews for one week, the work of Jesus was
  largely devoted to them. He was baptized at the age of thirty.
  His ministry began in A. D. 27, and continued till A. D. 31, when
  He was crucified in the middle of the covenant week. The re-
  maining three and one-half years of the seventy weeks were
  used by the disciples of Christ in preaching the Gospel to the
  Jews'. When this time was fulfilled, the Jews having rejected
  the Gospel, they went everywhere pieaching the word. Thus the
  first 490 of the 2300 years reached to‘,. D. 34, when the Gospel
  began to be given to the Gentiles.
      By subtracting the 490 years from the 2300 years, there re-
  main 1810 years of the 2300 years this side '-of A. D. 34. Adding
  Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

                             Notes.
    1. " It has been Satan's purpose to divorce mercy from truth
and justice. He sought to prove that the righteousness of God's
law is an enemy to peace. But Christ shows that in God's plan
they are indissolubly joined together; the one can not exist with-
out the other. 'Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness
and peace have kissed each other.' "-"Desire of Ages," page

precepts is sin. To change it would destroy its perfection; there-
fore, any attempted change is a transgression of it.
   " In the holiest I saw an ark ; on the top and sides of it
was purest gold. On each • end of the ark was a lovely cherub,
with its wings spread out over it. Their faces were turned to-
ward each other, and they looked downward. Between the angels'
was a golden censer. Above the ark, where the angels stood, was
an exceeding bright glory that appeared like a throne where
God dwelt. Jesus stood by the ark, and as the saints' prayers
came up to Him, the incense in the censer would smoke, and He
would offer up their prayers with the smoke of the incense to
His Father. "—" Early Writings," page 26.

   1. The definite time for Christ's manifestation as the Mes-
siah had been foretold by Daniel the prophet. Dan. 9:24-27.
The nations were sitting in darkness, and but few persons under-
stood the prophecies. Yet some in different nations were looking
for the Messiah to make His appearance.
   2. "As in old time, Cyrus was called to the throne of. the
world's empire that he might set free the captives of the Lord,

                             Notes.
   1. Jesus came "to make reconciliation for iniquity." Dan.
9:24. His mission was to save sinners. He became a servant
and gave His life to ransom many. Matt. 20:28. By sin man
had forfeited life. He took our place, and made Himself an'
offering for sin. The stroke that belonged on us, He voluntarily
took upon Himself.
    2. " Three times has He uttered that prayer. Three times
has humanity shrunk from the last, crowning sacrifice. But now
the history of the human race comes up before the world's
Redeemer. He sees that the transgressors of the law, if left to
themselves, must perish. He sees the helplessness of man. He
sees the power of sin. The woes and lamentations of a doomed
world rise before Him. He beholds its impending fate, and His
decision is made. He will save man at any cost to Himself. He
accepts His baptism of blood, that through Him perishing mil-
lions may gain everlasting life. He has left .the courts of heaven,
where all is purity, happiness, and glory, to save the one lost
sheep, the one world that has fallen by transgression. And He
will not turn from His mission. He will become the propitiation
of a race that has willed to sin. His prayer now breathes only
submission: 'If this cup may not pass away from Me, except
I drink it, Thy will be done.' "—"Desire of Ages," pages
826, 827.
   3. "All heaven was filled with wonder when the prayer of
Christ was offered in the midst of His terrible suffering—' Father,
forgive them; for they know not what they do.' Yet there stood
men formed in the image of God, joining to crush out the life
of His only-begotten Son. What a sight for the heavenly uni-
verse! "—"Desire of Ages," page 913.
   4. "With amazement angels witnessed the Saviour 's despair-
ing agony. The hosts of heaven veiled their faces from the
fearful sight. Inanimate nature expressed sympathy with its
insulted and dying Author. The sun refused to look upon the
awful scene. Its full, bright rays were illuminating the earth at

`Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                    already to harvest."

midday, when suddenly it seemed to be blotted out. Complete
darkness, like a funeral pall, enveloped the cross. There was dark-
ness over all the land until the ninth hour.' There was no eclipse
or other natural cause for this darkness, which was as deep as
midnight, without moon or stars. It was a miraculous testimony
given by God that the faith of after-generations might be con-
firmed."—" Desire of Ages," pages 904, 905.
   5. To save the lost, Christ must die without the presence of
the Father to comfort Him. In this respect, He died as the lost
sinner will die. "He trod the winepress alone." But the - Father
was not far away. "In that thick darkness God's presence was
hidden. He makes darkness His pavilion, and conceals His glory
from human eyes. God and His holy angels were beside the cross.
The Father was with His Son. Yet His presence was not re-
vealed."—" Desire of Ages," page 905.

                             Notes.
     1. Christ could not be holden by death because He was the
Prince of Life. Acts 3:15. Death could not retain dominion
because the eternal Spirit had power over Him. Rom. 8:11. Death
could not hold Him because His righteousness is life. Rom. 8:10.
And as surely as Christ arose from the dead, so certainly will all
the dead who belong to Him come forth from their graves.
     2. "As Christ arose, He brought from the grave a multitude
of captives. The earthquake at His death had rent open their
graves, and when He arose, they came forth with him. They
were those who had been colaborers with God, and who at the cost
of their lives had borne testimony to the truth. Now they
were to be witnesses for Him who had raised them from the dead.
. . . These went into the city and appeared unto many, de-
claring, Christ has risen from the dead, and we be risen with
Him.' —"Desire of Ages," pages 943, 944.
     3. The work of teaching the Gospel to the people of this
     "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
32        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
world is still in progress, and the injunction to pray for the
Holy Spirit is yet an imperative need. "The outpouring of the
Spirit in' apostolic days was the 'former rain,' and glorious was
the result, but the 'latter rain' will be more abundant. All who
consecrate soul, body, and spirit, will be constantly receiving a
new endowment of physical and mental power. The inexhaustible
supplies of heaven are-at their command. Christ gives them the
breath of His own Spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy
Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind.
The grace of. God enlarges and multiplies their faculties, and
every perfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance
in the work of saving souls."—" Desire of Ages," page 993.
    4. It was appropriate that the Redeemer should take some of
the trophies of His victory to heaven with Him when He
ascended. Those who came out of their graves when He arose
were representatives of His kingdom, who had lived in different
ages of the world. Rev. 5:9, 10. •
