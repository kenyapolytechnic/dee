            SENIOR DIVISION

     A Study of the Book of Ezra
                  FIRST QUARTER, 1907


    GENERAL NOTE.—The book of Ezra contains the key to ,a
proper understanding of the message that proclaims the opening
of the investigative judgment in the heavenly courts. Daniel
states that the twenty-three hundred years which mark the be-
ginning of the judgment, would begin with the "going forth of
the commandment to restore and to build ,I.trusaieni ; ' but the
book of Ezra contains the only divine record of the going forth
of that commandment.


          LESSON 1.—Going Out of Babylon.
                     JANUARY 5, .1907.
                          Questions.
   1. What kingdom was ruling at the beginning of
Ezra's record ? Name the king. Ezra 1: 1.
   2. What did the Lord influence the king to do ?
Ezra 1:1. Note 1.
   3. Of what prophecy was this, the fulfilment? Jer.
29: 10. Note 2.
   4. How extensively was the proclamation proclaimed?
Ezra 1: 1.
   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL • LESSON QUARTERLY                   3
   5. From whom did Cyrus say he received his king-
dom? Ezra 1:2.
   6. What reason did Cyrus give for having the temple
built ? Verse 2.
   7. What class of people were called to go up to Jeru-
salem? Verse 3. Note 3.
   8. What help was to be rendered the poor? Verse 4.
   9. Who responded to the call? Verse 5.
  10. How and with what spirit did their neighbors
assist them? Verse 6.
  11. What did Cyrus give them? Verse 7.
  12. Who had taken these vessels from Jerusalem? 2
Chron. 36 : 7, 18.
  13. Where had they kept them? Dan. 1: 1, 2. Note 4.
  14. How many vessels were there? Ezra 1: 9, 10.
  15. After what model had these vessels been made?
Ex. 25 : 40 ; 1 Chron. 28 : 11-13, 19.
  16. Who was placed in charge of them? Ezra 1: 11.
  17. Had they been disturbed during the seventy
years' captivity' Dan. 5: 1, 2.
  18. How did God show His displeasure because of
the insult offered to the sacred vessels? Dan. 5: 5, 26-28.
Note 5.
                             Notes.
   1. Cyrus evidently believed in the god of good and evil much
as the Parsecs of India do to-day, and that the God of the He-
brews was a powerful God, and to secure His favor Would greatly
increase his power.
    2. Daniel was a prominent man in the Persian court, and no
doubt had instructed Cyrus in regard to the prophecy of Jere-
miah, as we find Daniel earnestly studying these prophecies three
years before Cyrus issued his decree. Dan. 9:1, 2.
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    3. The call was to all God's people, and if all had heeded the
call, the work would have gOne forward rapidly.
    4. Nebuchadnezzar respected sacred things and placed these
holy vessels in the best place' he had, viz., in the treasure-house
of his god.
    5. While they were drinking wine from those sacred vessels,
a hand appeared writing upon the wall. Consternation and confu-
sion followed, and while they were in thiS condition the army of
Cyrus entered the city and slew the king and the princes. Dan.
5 : 30, 31; Jer. 51:57. The sacred vessels must _have been scattered
throughout the banquet hall. Who was there with power to gather
them' The last kingly act of Belshazzar was to publicly proclaim
Daniel the third ruler in the kingdom. Dan. 5:29. This gave
Daniel power to command the servants to search carefully for
all the sacred vessels and .restore them to a place of safety.

LESSON 11.—The -First Company to Leave Babylon.

   12. Who dwelt in their cities? Verse 70.
   13. If "all Israel" dwelt in their cities, how many
tribes were represented Acts 26: 7.
   14. For how many tribes were offerings made at the
dedication of the temple ? Ezra 6: 17.
   15. How many tribes will be represented in those that
come out of modern Babylon? Rev. 7 : 4-8.
   16. Will they dwell in a city already prepared for
them ? Heb. 11: 16. See also Rev. 21: 9-26.
                                 Notes.
     1. These cities were substantially built. Many of them had
 been• built by the heathen that dwelt in the land before IS.rael
 came from Egypt. Deut. 6:10; Joshua 24:13. During the seventy
 years' captivity, theSe cities had remained the same and stood
 ready to receive those that returned from captivity.
     Travelers state that in some portions of Palestine the ancient
 cities still remain. Mr. Porter in "Giant Cities of Basilan,"
 speaks of one of these cities as follows:
    " Selcah is one of the most remarkable cities of Palestine.
 It has been long deserted; and yet, as nearly as. I could estimate,
 five hundred of its houses are still standing, and three or four
 hundred families might settle in it at any moment without laying
 a stone, or expending an hour's labor on repairs." If some of
 the cities are still standing, it is easy to understand how Israel
 was so quickly settled in their cities.
     2. At the right and left of the breastplate were two large
 stones of great brillian'cy. These were known as the Urim and
•Thummim. By them, the will of God was made known through
 the high priest. When questions were brought for decision ‘before
 the Lord, a halo of light encircling the precious stone at the
 right was a token of the divine consent or approval, while a cloud
"Lift up your eyes .and look on the Melds; for they are white
                     already to harvest."
•6         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
shadowing the stone at the left, was an evidence of the denial
or disapprobation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, chapter 30.
   3. Only a small proportion heeded this call to "come out
of Babylon." They loved their houses and lands in Babylon
better than the Lord and His temple. Many remain in modern
Babylon to-day for the same reason.



 LESSON I11.—The Foundation of the Temple Laid.
              JANUARY 19, 1907.
                         Questions.

         , SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7
  13. Who was placed in charge of the work? Verse 9.
  14. Describe the service connected with laying the
foundation. Verses 10, 11.
  15. Why did the old men weep? Verse 12.
  16. How did this temple compare with the former one
i n appearance? hag. 2 : 3.
   17. What did the Lord say of this temple? Note 2.

object-lesson? Acts 15 : 13-18.
                             Notes.
   1. The seventh month was an important month in the relig-
ious service. The first day of the seventh month was the day
of blowing of trumpets; the tenth day was the day of atonement.
while the Feast of Tabernacles began in the fifteenth day of
the same month.
    2. If the old men could have known that they were building
a temple, in which, as restored by Herod, the long-promised
Saviour would teach, they, too, would have rejoiced.

character? Ezra 4:4, 5.
    6. How long did they keep up this warfare of spite?

they do? Verse 23.
  18. How long was the work stopped? Verse 24.
                             Notes.
    1. The Samaritans did not love nor fear the Lord; they wished
to help build because they thought if Jerusalem was rebuilt it
would be a wise policy for them to have a part in it. Such
helpers hinder the Lord, and Zerubbabel showed great spiritual
discernment in refusing them. 2 Kings 17:24-34 gives the origin
of the Samaritans.
    2. From the Bible record we have the names of Ahasuerus
and. Artaxerxes, kings reigning between the time of Cyrus and
  The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL .LESSON qTTARTERLY.

Darius the Persian. According to profane history Cambyses, and
Smerdis the Impostor reigned during this time, hence it has been
thought probable that these names refer to the same kings.




          ' LESSON V.—The Work Revived.
                 FEBRUARY 2, 1967. •
                          Questions.

                           our field.
10         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   11. What wonderful message. came from the prophet
Haggai, just three months from the day they resumed the
work upon the, temple ? Hag. 2 : 10-19 ; chapter 1: 15.
   12. What encouraging message came from Zechariah
at this time? Zech. 8: 9-15.
   13. What does James say the work of the Gospel really
is ? Acts 15 : 13-16.
   14. To what period of the world's history •does Paul
apply the words of Hag. 2 : 6, 7 ? See Heb. 12 : 26, 27.
   15. How does the Lord regard ,an individual that will
arise in the time of a crisis and build the work of the
Lord ? Hag. 2 : 23. Note 4.
   16. When was the temple finished? Ezra 6 : 15.
   17. How long was this after the work of building was
resumed? Compare Hag. 1 : 15 with Ezra 6 : 15.
                             Notes.
   1. Haggai began his work in the sixth month of the second
year of Darius the Persian, and Zechariah began to prophecy
two months later. When God raises up a prophet for a special
work God's people are preserved. Hosea 12: 13.
   2. These words of encouragement have strengthened many a
builder in the Lord's work.
   3. The Saviour taught in this temple and His presence there
was more than the glory of the former temple. Zechariah de-
scribes the Saviour's triumphant entry into Jerusalem. Zech. 9:9.
    4. Zerubbabel was an object-lesson to all who arise in the
strength of the Lord and build up the work of the Lord. All
who do this are precious in His sight.'

                FEBRUARY 9, 1907.
                          Questions.
     1. What question was asked by the • governor of the
land? Ezra 5 : 3. Note 1. .

them after this manner, what the names of the men -
were that were making this building." Verse 4, A. R. V.

    14. 'What was the general character of their whole
 letter ?
   15. How does it compare with the letter written by the
 Samaritans ? Ezra 4 : 7-16. Note 5.
    16. Of what scripture was Tatnai's letter an illus-
tration ? Prov. 16 : 7. '
   17.. On receipt of the letter what did Darius do ?
Ezra 6: 1, 2.
   18. Give the principal points in the decree of Cyrus.
-Verses 3-5.
                               Notes.
    1. The Jews were building in direct opposition to a royal
command not to build. Ezra 4:23, 24. This required much faith.
     2. Darius the Persian was known in history as Darius Hy-
staspes. He came to the throne after Smerdis the Impostor.
    3. Their power lay in recognizing God alone as their Mas-
ter. The work of the Lord will always go forward with power when
the workers know of a surety in their hearts that they are "serv-
ants of the God of heaven," and not men-servers, and souls
are of more value to them than wages. Then they can carry
forward the work rapidly and it will prosper in the face of
opposition and discouraging circumstances.
    4. The foundation of the temple was laid in the ,.econd year
of Cyrus. Cyrus reigned five years after the work began. Cam-
byses reigned seven and one-half years, Smerdis six months, and
this was the second year of Darius (Ezra 4:14), making fifteen
years since they had commenced building the temple.
    5. The letter of Tatnai was a fair, open, honorable letter,
stating the facts in their true light; while the letter of the
Samaritans was just the opposite. History repeats itself. The
Samaritans "feared the Lord and served their graven images."
2 Kings 17:41. The cause of God will often receive better
treatment to-day from worldly people, than from half converted,
professed Christians.



 This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world

       2. The decree of Darius was a repetition of the one issued
   by Cyrus and embraced the rebuilding of the temple and the
   establishment of the worship.
       3. By referring to the list of Persian kings given in Note 1,
   under Lesson VIII, it will be seen that seventeen years inter-
   vened between the first year of Cyrus and the second year of
   Darius the Persian.
      4. Artaxerxes made provision for the establishment of the
   government. This was not mentioned by either Cyrus or Darius.
      5. From the second year of Darius the Persian to the seventh
  year of Artaxerxes was sixty-two years. This, with the seventeen
  years between the decrees of Cyrus and Darius, makes seventy-
   nine years covered by the full decree.
      6. Before the captivity, Jerusalem had a government as
  well as a temple and worship, and a decree to restore and to
  build Jerusalem" must include the re-establishment of the gov-
  ernment as well as the worship; therefore, the command could
  not be said to have gone forth until provision was made for
  the establishing of the government. This was in 457 B. c., in
  the decree of Artaxerxes.
      The following taken from an editorial in the Review and
  Herald of April 5, 1906, contains important historical data on
  this question, and should be carefully studied:
      According to the generally accepted chronology, the seventh
 of Artaxerxes was B. a. 457, as is noted in the margin of the
 Authorized Version of the book of Ezra; but, as is the case
 with almost every important doctrine, some have disputed this
 ;late, and have asserted that there was not sufficient proof to
 establish this important position. We have therefore thought it
 might be worth the while to bring forward some historical evi-
 dence bearing upon this question, evidence of such a character
 that it can not be set aside by mere assertion.
     As the extract which we shall quote involves some abbrevia-
 tions and expressions not now in common use in reckoning time,
we will interpret some of them, so that all our readers may have
as clear an understanding as possible of the grounds upon which
the reckoning is based. The expression "An. 1, Olymp. 87"
means "in the first year of the eighty-seventh Olympiad," and
the expression "An. 4, Olymp. 88" means "in the fourth year
of the eighty-eighth Olympiad," and the expression "An. 1,
Olymp. 75" means "in the first year of the seventy-fifth
Olympiad," and the expression " An. 4, Olymp. 83" means " in
the fourth year of the eighty-third Olympiad." The Olympiad
was "the period of four years between any two celebrations of

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     19
the Olympic games," at Olympia in Elis, one of the States of
Greece, the first Olympiad being reckoned from B. c. 776. When-
ever the abbreviation "An. J. P." occurs, it may be interpreted,
"The year of the Julian Period." this was "a chronological
period of 7,980 years, combining the solar, lunar, and indiction
cycles," which was given a theoretical starting-point in B. c.
4713. "The Julian Period was proposed by Scaliger, to remove
or avoid ambiguities in chronological dates, and was so named
because composed of Julian years." The abbreviation "lib."
should be read "book." The expression " Anno Urbis Conditae
273" may be read•" in the two hundred and seventy-third year
from the founding of the city," referring to the founding of
Home in B. c. 754. The other abbreviations will doubtless be
understood by the average reader.
     The quotation to which reference has been made is from
Part I, Chap. 10, of Sir Isaac Newton's work on the _proph-
ecies of Daniel, and reads as follows-:
     The grounds of the chronology here followed [to show that
 the seventh year of Artaxerxes was B. c. 457] I will now set
down as briefly as I can.
     The Peloponnesian War began in spring, An. 1, Olymp. 87
 (s. c. 432), Diodorus, Eusebius, and all other authors agree. It
 began two months before Pythodorus ceased to be Archon
 (Thucyd. 1, 2), that is, in April, two months before the end
 of the Olympic year. Now, the years of this war are most
 certainly determined by the fifty years distance of its first year
 from the transit of Xerxes inclusively (Thucyd. 1, 2), or forty-
 eight years exclusively (Eratosth, apud Clem. Alex.) ; by the
 sixty-nine years distance of its end, of twenty-seventh year, from
 the beginning of Alexander's reign in Greece; by the acting of
 the Olympic games in its fourth and twelfth years (Thucyd. 1, 5) ;
 and by three eclipses of the sun and one of the moon, mentioned by
 Thucydides and Xenophon. Now, Thucydides, an unquestionable
 witness, tells us that the news of the death of Artaxerxes Longi-
 manus was brought to Ephesus, and from thence by some Athenians.
 to Athens, in the seventh year of the Peloponnesian, when the win-
 ter half-year was running, and therefore he died An. 4, Olymp. 88.
 in the end of An. J. P. 4289 .(B. C. 425), suppose a month, or
 two, before mid-winter, for so long the news would be in coming
  Now, Artaxerxes Longimanus reigned forty years, by the con
 sent of Diodorus, Eusebius, Jerome, Sulpitius, or forty-one, accord
  ing to Ptol. in Can., Clem. Alexand. (1. 1), Strom., Chron
 Alexand., Abulpharagius, Nicephorus, including therein the reign
 of his successors,. Xerxes and Sogdian, as Abulpharagius inform
          The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
 20          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  us. After Artaxerxes, reigned his son, Xerxes, two months, and
 Sogdian, seven months; but their reign is not reckoned apart
  in summing up the years of the kings, but is included in the
  forty, or forty-one years' reign of Artaxerxes omit these nine
 mouths, and the precise reign of . Artaxerxes will be thirty-nine
 years and three months. And therefore since his reign ended
 in the beginning of winter, An. J. P. 4289 (B. c. 425), it began
 between midsummer and autumn An. J. P. 4250 (B. c. 464).
     The same thing I gather also thus: Cambyses began his reign
 in spring, An. J. P. 4185 (B. c. 529), and reigned eight years,
 including the five months of Smerdis; and then Darius Hystaspes
 began in spring, An. J. P. 4193 (B. c. 521), and reigned thirty- .
 six years, by the unanimous consent of all chronologers. The
 reigns of these two kings are determined by three eclipses of
 the moon, observed at Babylon, and recorded by Ptolemy; so
 that it can not be disputed.' One was in the seventh year of
 Cambyses, An. J. P. 4191 (B. C. 523), July 16, at eleven at
 night; another in the twentieth year of Darius, An. J. P. 4212
 (B. C. 502), November 19, at 11:45 at night; a third in the
 thirty-first year of Darius, An. J. P. 4223 (B. c. 491), April
25, at 11:30 at. night. By these eclipses, and the prophecies
of Haggai and Zechary compared together, it is manifest that
his years began after the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh
Jewish month, and before the twenty-fifth day of April, and by
consequence "about March. Xerxes, therefore, began in' spring,
 An. J. P. 4229 (B. C. 485), for Darius died in the fifth year
after the battle of Marathon, as Herodotus (lib. 7) and Plutarch
mention; and that battle was in October, An. J. P. 4224 (B. c.
490), ten years before the battle of Salamis. Xerxes, therefore,
began within less than a year after October, An. J. P. 4228
 (B. C. 486), suppose in the spring following; for he spent
his first five years, and something more, in preparations for
his expedition against the Greeks; and this expedition was in
the time of the Olympic games, An. 1, Olymp. 75, Calliade
Athenis Archonte, twenty-eight years after his regifuge and con-
sulship of the first counsel, Junius Brutus, Anno Urbis Conditm
273 '(3. C. 481), Fabio and Furio Coss. The passage of Xerxes'
army over the Hellespont began in the end of the fourth year
of the seventy-fourth Olympiad; that is, in June, An. J. P.. 4234
(B. c. 480), and took up one month; and in autumn, three
months after, on the full moon, the sixteenth day of the month
of Munychion, Was the battle of Salamis, and a little after that
an eclipse of the sun, which, by the calculation; fell, on October
"This Gospel of the kingdom Shall be preached in all The world
  for' a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.'.'
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     21

2. His sixth year, therefore, began a little before June,Ctuppose
in spring, An. J. P. 4234 (B. C. 480), and his first year con-
sequently in spring, An. J. P. 4229 (B. C. 485), as above. Now,
he reigned almost twenty-one years, by the consent of all writers.
Add the seven months of Artabanus, and the sum will be twenty-
one years and about four or five months, which end between
mid-summer and autumn, An. J.'P. 4250 (B. c. 464). At , this time,
therefore, began the reign of his successor, Artaxerxes, as was
to be proved.
    The same thing is also confirmed by Julius Africanus, who
informs us out of former writers that the twentieth year of
this Artaxerxes was the one hundred and fifteen-qv year from
the beginning • of the reign of Cyrus in Persia, and fell in with
An. 4, Olymp. 83. It began, therefore, with the Olympic year
soon after the summer solstice. An. J. P. 4269 (B. c. 445).
Subduct nineteen years, and his first year will begin at the, same
time of the year, An. J. P. 4250 (B. c. 464), as above.
    Thus, by three independent lines of historical proof, Sir Isaac
Newton shows that Artaxerxes began. His reign in B. C. 464, and
" the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king" would consequently be
B. c. 457.

heavenly sanctuary 1844 A. D.
                            Notes.
   1. The seven weeks and sixty-two weeks begin with the com-
mandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, and close with
"Messiah the Prince." John 1:41 (margin), Acts 10:38 with
Luke 3:21, 22 show that Jesus became the Messiah or the
"Anointed One" when He was anointed with the Holy Ghost
at His baptism. Therefore the sixty-nine weeks reach from the
        The weeds of the cause of God are world-wide.
            SABBATH-Kiwi, LESSON        QUARTERLY                23
 going forth of the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem to the
 baptism of Jesus.
     2. Seven weeks would contain seven times seven years, or
 forty-nine years, and sixty-two weeks would contain seven times
 sixty-two, or 434 years. Forty-nine years plus 434 years equal
483 years.
    3. Four hundred and eighty-three years minus 4561A years
 leaves 261A years A. D., or 27 A. D., the date of the baptism
 of Christ.
     4. Seventy weeks or 490 years were determined upon the
 Jews. The sixty-nine weeks ended in 27 A. D. Seven years, or
 one week, added to this brings us to 34 A. D. the end of the
•seventy weeks.
     5. The seventy weeks, or 490 years, taken from the 2,300
 years leaves 1,810 years yet remaining at the end of the seventy
 weeks. The seventy weeks, or 490 years, ended 34 A. D. The
2,300 years ended 1,810 years later, or in 1844.

                              Notes.
   1. It was Ezra's intimacy with the Lord that caused the
king" to grant, all his• requests; "it was according to the , hand ,
of the Lord his God upon him." The same intimacy to-day
will bring like results.
   2. From the record given in Ezra 8:1-14) there were over fifteen
hundred males in the company that went up with Ezra. With
women and children this made a large party.
   3. It was not the safety of the party only, but the: honor
of God that was at .stake. The king had granted every request
and may have offered a guard, but Ezra had told the king of
the power of God to deliver.
   4. The desert was infested with bands of robbers,' then as
now, and it was not safe for a caravan to Cross the desert
without a guard of armed men.

   5. The strictest business policy should be used in dealing with

" Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that lie will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."
  An After-the-fire Story
            By the Book Department Manager




     When the 5 P. M. bell rang Friday, July 20, our
 press-room boys were finishing a twenty-thousand edition
 of "Heralds of the Morning." The plates for the last
 form were still on the preSs.
     Five thousand copies were in process of binding on
 the gathering boards -ancl, around the bindery sewing
 machines.
     Fifty full Morocco prospeetuses were being finished
 for delivery the following Monday to as many anxious
 agents whose old cloth prospectuses were badly worn.
     Two hundred. eleven copies of the complete book,
 new edition, had been delivered to the shipping room
 that afternoon, and had been forwarded to our, Kansas
 City house, with the exception of a sample copy which
 had been sent to the writer's home.
     In the field there were more than one hundred agents
'successfully soliciting orders.
         AND THAT NIGHT THE FIRE CAME
   The most of the following night was spent in counsel
by the Board of Directors, foremen, and others.
   Before ,the: flames,. had died :down, one of our most
experienced men was on a faSt train. bound for the
East, with the sample copy of "Heralds of the Morning,"
and with orders to secure the publication of a large
edition at the earliest possible moment.
   As the plates and engravings were -all gone, this was
no light task.
   So successful was he in his mission that within ten
days after. the fire a ten-thousand edition of the book
had been contracted for with a large Kansas City ffrin;
and typesetting Machines and photo-engrayerS had be
gun work.
   And here came a strange experience. Our agents,
                                                   •
many of them, had poor prospectuses, some of them torn,
others nearly worn out. They pasted in loose leaves,
sewed in ,sheetsof writing-paper for additional names, ,
but they all kept at work.
   Oirls...,.without previous experience took orders for
$50.00, $60.00, $68.50, and then some one jumped up to
$100.00, $150.00, and some experienced „workers up to
$240.00, $255.00, . and finally one man 'took orders •for•
$280.00 worth of this book in a single week.
   Remember, this was done with old prospectuses, and
at a time when the securing of books was somewhat. ques-
tionable.
   It proves, beyond a doubt, that "Heralds of the
Morning" is a book with a mission ; that its mission is
one in' which the people of the World are interested. '
    Wheri, after various delays, books began to be de-
livered, orders had piled up so that almost four thousand
  copies—about four tons—had to be sent by express, at
 mail rates.
       One agent in an almost inaccessible portion of Cali-
  fornia had to have nearly one hundred books sent to him
  by mail. Imagine the surprise of the mail carrier, who
  usually carries three or four pounds of mail, to receive
  a consignment to one party of 200 pounds! But orders
  had been taken and books must be delivered, even though
  Uncle Sam's letter carriers had to be pressed into service.
       It was soon found that the three hundred copies
  being delivered each day were not sufficient, hence the
  following telegram was sent to our Kansas City rep-
  resentative:
.      "Try St. Louis binders for 'Heralds' and Contro-
  versy.' Try make forfeiture contract."
       In a few hours back flashed this message, "Binding
  material all here. Kansas City firm signs penalty con-
  tract to-day. Letter:"
    • • When the letter came it contained copy of a con-
  tract calling for a heavy forfeiture for every day in
   which at least 500 copies of "Heralds of the Morning"
  were not delivered.
       In a few more days this telegram came : " 'Heralds'
  all sold. Shall we print five thousand more ?"
       And, of course, we said, "Yes."
       And now we are preparing for 1907.
       First, "Heralds of the Morning" is being translated
   into German, Swedish, and Danish.
   Secondly, new engravings have been added, together
with chapter on recent calamities.
   Thirdly, a beautiful new prospectus, designed by
those who have been selling the book most successfully,
is being printed.
    Fourthly, a canvass, which, for brevity, directness,
simplicity, and selling points, has seldom, if ever, been
equaled, has been worked out by expert salesmen.
    Fifthly, although in its revised and enlarged form the
book contains nearly 400 pages, we have decided to keep
the price down to $1.75. This applies to the English,
German, Danish, and Swedish editions.
    Sixthly, the plates for the book have been recalled
from Kansas City, and among the first printing to be
done in our new Pacific Press home will be a twenty-
thousand run on "Heralds of the Morning," which we
hope will be the first instalment of a one-hundred-
thousand copy edition to be manufactured and sold
during 1907.
    If you wish to have a part in placing that many
copies of this message-filled book in the homes of the
people, talk with or write to your tract society secretary
nr state agent and ask for the canvass. It's free.
