## Notes 
1. There is now an urgent call for strong young people to take an active part in the work God has given to His people. Not only the youth, but even children will be called upon to bear an important part in _the closing work. See Testimonies, Vol. VI, pages 202, 203.
2. "Those who will not eat and drink from principle will not be guided by principle in other things." — Health. Reformer.
"To make plain natural law, and urge obedience to it, is the work that accompanies the Third Angel's Message to prepare a people for the coming of the Lord."—Testimonies, Vol. III, page 161. "Parents should seek to awaken in their children an interest in the study of physiology. Youth need to be instructed in regard to their own bodies. . . . If parents themselves would obtain knowledge upon this subject, and felt the importance of putting it to a practical use, we should see a better condition of things. Teach your children to reason from cause to effect. Show them that if they violate the laws of their being they must pay the penalty by suffering... Recklessness in regard to bodily health tends to recklessness in morals. Do not neglect to teach your children how to prepare healthful food. In giving them these lessons in physiology, and in good cooking, you are giving them the first steps in some of the most useful branches of education, and inculcating principles which are needful elements in a religious education."—Christian Temperance, page 71
