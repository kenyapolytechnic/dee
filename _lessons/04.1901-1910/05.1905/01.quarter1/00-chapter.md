T      HIS is a book compiled from the writings of Mrs. E. G.
         White, giving in concise form a vast fund of instruc-
         tion and information on the fundamental principles of
health reform. More than a score of her works, as well as
much unpublished manuscript, have been consulted in the
production of this book, and the matter brought together and
arranged in convenient form for ready reference.
    It is not a doctor book in the sense of prescribing reme-
dies, but if one really wishes to live in the truest sense, he
will find on every page and in every paragraph more than the
proverbial ounce of prevention to assist.
    The book contains 324 pages, divided into 42 chapters.
It is thoroughly indexed, giving every Scripture text referred.
to, as well as subjects treated, also a general index referring
to paragraphs.
    A last opportunity is here given to secure a copy of this
valuable little work, as the plates were accidently burned,
and only a limited number of the books are in stock.

           Cloth bound. Price, fifty cents.

                    First Quarter, 1905.

     General Note.—It has been over nine years now since we
 had a series of lessons bearing directly on religious liberty.
 Those who were children only ten or twelve years old then
 are now young men and women. In view of this, and of the
:rapid developments that are being made in the movement
 to restrict religious liberty, which call for intelligent, active,
 and aggressive counter efforts on our part, it seems highly
 proper that a few lessons should again be devoted to this sub-
 ject.

  17; When and by whom will they be delivered? Dan.
12:1.
                            Notes.
    1. Satan's plan is, and ever has been, to bring man into
bondage,—the bondage of sin, the bondage of self, the bondage
of selfishness, the bondage of fear, the bondage of slavery,
the bondage of debt, the bondage of disease, the bondage of
death. How well he has succeeded the amount of sin, self-
ishness, fear, slavery, debt, disease, and death there is and .
 has been in the world testifies.
    2. "God has revealed in His law the principles that under-
lie all true prosperity; both of nations and of individuals.
'This is your wisdom and your understanding,' Moses declared
to the Israelites of the law of God. 'It is not a vain thing
for you; because it is your life.' The blessings thus assured
to Israel are, on the same conditions and in the same degree,
assured to every nation and every individual under the broad
heavens."—Education, page 174.
    3. Debt means bondage. "The borrower is servant to the
lender." Debts are demoralizing, disheartening, discouraging.
The devil knows this, so does al he can to get men and na-
tions into debt. Therefore we are told to "owe no man any-
thing;" and "shun the incurring of debt as you would sb
disease;" that "we should shun debt as we should shun the
leprosy;" and have been instructed to "inaugurate a sound
financial system" in our work, and encouraged in the effort
to release ourselves from debt with the assurance that God
would help us to "roll back the 'reproach" of debt, and that
 if we took hold of the work in the spirit of self-sacrifice for
 the sake of Christ and the truth, it would not be long before
"the jubilee song of freedom" could be sung throughout our
borders.—Testimonies, Vol. VI, pages 211, 217, 477.
     4. "As the decree issued by the various rulers of Christen-
 dom against commandment-keepers shall withdraw the pro-
 tection of government, and abandon them to those who desire
 their destruction, the people of God will flee from the cities
 and villages, and associate together in companies, dwelling
 in the most desolate and solitary places. Many will find
 refuge in the strongholds of the mountains. Like the Chris-
 tians in the Piedmont valleys, they will make the high places
 of the earth their sanctuaries, and will thank God for the
 'munitions of rocks.' But many of all nations, and all

       "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.

classes, high and low, rich and poor, black and white, will
be cast into the most unjust and cruel bondage. The be-
loved of God pass weary days, bound in chains, shut in by
prison bars, sentenced to be slain, some apparently left to
die of starvation in dark and loathsome dungeons. No hu-
man ear is open to hear their moans, no human hand is
ready to lend them help."—Great Controversy, pages 625, 626.


        LESSON 1.I.—The Sabbath and Liberty.
                   JANUARY 14, 1905.
                         Questions.

    1. In their bondage in Egypt, what was it difficult
for Israel to do? Ps. 105:43-45.
    2. Which commandment in particular does it appear
they had difficulty in obeying? Duet. 5:12-15. Note 1.
    3. What complaint did Pharaoh make against Moses
and Aaron? Ex. 5 :4, 5. What against the people? Verse
S. What did he style the instruction which they had re-
ceived through Moses and Aaron concerning the keeping
of the Sabbath? What command did he give in opposi-
tion to it? Verse 9.
    4. What two things, therefore, are intimately asso-
ciated together in Israel's experience in Egypt?—Bondage
and oppressive measures against Sabbath-keeping.
    5. Because the children of Israel after their deliver-
ance from Egyptian bondage oppressed one another, and
did not "proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all
the inhabitants thereof," what did God say He would do
with them? Jer. 34:17.
    6. While disregarding the Lord's instructions for
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                  7

bringing about universal freedom, what divine institution
were they also disregarding? Eze. 22:8, 26.
    7. Upon what condition did God promise that Jerusa-
lem should stand forever? Jer. 17:24, 25.
    8. What did He say He would do if they did not keep
the Sabbath? Verse 27.
    9. When and by whom was this fulfilled? 2 Chron.
36:11-21.
  10. During their captivity, what was the land enjoying?
Verse 21.
  11. How long did God say their captivity should be?
Jer. 25 :8-11.
  12. When the end comes, for how long a time will the
world have been carrying on slavery and oppression, and
disregarding the Sabbath? Note 2.
  13. For how long a time will the whole earth lie deso-
late? Rev. 20:1-4; Isa. 24:1-6; Jer 4:23-27. Note 3.
   14. What will the millennium be to the redeemed?—A
time of freedom and rest from earth's 6,000 years of sin,
slavery, and Sabbath-breaking through which they have
passed.
   15. What even now remains to the people of God?
Heb. 4:1-11.
   16. For what, therefore, does the Sabbath, or seventh
day, stand? Note 4.

                            Notes.
   1. "In their bondage the Israelites had to some extent lost
the knowledge of God's law, and they had departed from its
precepts. The Sabbath had been generally disregarded, and
        The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
8          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

the exactions of their task-masters made its observance ap-
parently impossible. But Moses had shown his people that
obedience to God was the first condition of deliverance; and
his efforts made to restore the observance of the Sabbath
had come to the notice of their oppressors."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page, 260.
    2. "For six thousand years the great controversy has been
in progress. . . . Now all have made their decision; the
wicked have fully united with Satan in his warfare against
God. The time has come for God to vindicate the authority
of His downtrodden law.", "For six thousand years, Satan's
work of rebellion has 'made the earth to tremble.' . . .
For six thousand years his prison-house has received God's
people." "Satan's work of ruin is forever ended. For six
thousand years he has wrought his will, filling the earth with
woe, and causing grief throughout the universe."—Great
Controversy, pages 656, 659, 678.
   3. "The Revelator foretells of the banishment of Satan,
and tffe condition of chaos and desolation to which the earth
is to be reduced; and He declares that this condition will
exist for a thousand years."—Great Controversy, page 658.
    "The great plan of redemption results in fully bringing
back the world into God's favor. All that was lost by sin
is restored. Not only man, but the earth is redeemed, to be
the eternal abode of the obedient. For six thousand years,
Satan haS struggled to maintain possession of the earth.
Now [after the 1,000 years and the destruction of the wicked]
God's original purpose in its creation is accomplished."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 342.
    4. From the study of this and the preceding lesson, it
is evident that the Sabbath, or seventh day, stands for rest
and liberty. On the first seventh day God rested from all
His works, and was refreshed. In the seventh or sabbatical
year the Hebrew servants were' to be released and "go out
free." In the jubilee, or the great sabbatical year, the year
after seven times seven years, universal liberty was to be
proclaimed. And in the great millennial sabbath, the seventh
thousand years, God's people are to be released from all bon-
dage and oppression, and spend a sabbath of rest in the
kingdom of God.

"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the 'world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end 'come."

          LESSON 111.—Sunday and Slavery.
                   JANUARY 21, 1905.
                         Questions.

    1. What is the result of obeying God and keeping
His Sabbath?—Freedom and rest. See lessons 1 and 2,
and Ps. 119 :45 ; Isa. 48 :18 ; 58:1g, 14.
    2. What would we naturally conclude, therefore, would
be the result of worshiping false gods and keeping a
false Sabbath?—Slavery and unrest. Ps. 106:34-36; 107:
11, 12; Isa. 48:22; Rev. 14:11.
    3. What is the most ancient form of idolatry? Job
31:24-28; 2 Chron. 14:2-5 (margin) ; Eze. 8:15, 16.
Note 1.
    4. What 'day was very early dedicated by the heathen
to the sun and to sun worship? Note 2.
    5. What was the beginning of this apostasy? Gen.
11:1-9.
    6. Who was the leader in this apostasy and rebellion
against God? Gen. 10 :8-10. How did he rule? Note 3.
    7. How general was sun worship among the ancient
nations? Note 4.
    8. How generally were slavery and oppression prac-
ticed by these nations? Note 5.
    9. What is Babylon called in Jeremiah 50:23?
   10. What is sun worship?—Idolatry. What leads to
slavery and oppression? —Covetousness, or unlawful de-
sires, which cause men to disregard the rights of their fel-
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."
10        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

low men, and bring them into bondage. And what is
covetousness? Col. 3:5; Eph. 5 :5.
   11. What relic of this most ancient form of idolatry
has come down through the ages to our own time?—The
Sunday.
   12. Is there not, therefore, an intimate relation between
Sunday and slavery? lipte 6.
   13. When the Papacy put dpwn the Sabbath and ele.
vated Sunday in its place, what did it become?—The worst
persecutor of the saints the world has ever seen. Matt.
24:21, 22; Dan. 7:25; Rev. 13 :1-7.
   14. How were church and state united in the early cen-
turies of the Christian era?—Largely through Sunday
legislation.                                                •
   15. Give a brief history of Sunday legislation during the
fourth and fifth centuries. Note 7.
   16. How are those who refuse to receive this mark of
apostasy yet to be treated? Rev. 13 :15-17.
   17. What general conclusion, therefore, may be drawn
from the facts already adduced?—That while the• Sabbath
stands for liberty, rest, and peace, the Sunday stands for
slavery, oppression, and persecution.
   18. In the enumeration of the merchandise of Babylon
the Great, what two things are mentioned last? Rev.
18 :12, 13.
                             Notes.
   1. The most ancient form of idolatry is sun-worship. In
turning from the worship of the. Maker to the worship of the
things that were made, the sun, the most prominent and
powerful agent in the kingdom of nature, with its brilliancy,
largeness of size, and apparently life-giving power, was most
naturally turned to as the first and chief object of worship.
            Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                   11

 Along with sun-worship came the worship of the moon and
 other heavenly bodies. And connected with all was the idea
 of sex, male and female; family relationship, father, mother,
 sons, and daughters; and generations and procreation gen•
 erally. Hence the lewdness and immorality into which this
 form of worship degenerated. It became simply the deifica-
 tion of lust.
     2. The day dedicated to the worship of the sun was the
 day on which light was created,=the first day of the week.
 Being dedicated to the sun, it was naturally called "Sunday,"
 as were• .the days dedicated to the moon, to Saturn, etc., called
 Monday, Saturday, etc. That this was an ancient arrange-
 ment, is shown by the title given to the day in Constantine's
 famous Sunday law, of 321 A. D.,—"the venerable day of the
 sun." The North British Review (Vol. 18, page 409), calls
 it "the wild, solar holiday of all pagan times."
     3. Nimrod was both a tyrant and an idolater. Josephus
 tells us that "he gradually changed the government into a
 tyranny,—seeing no other way of turning men from the fear
 of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence upon
 his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if
 He should have a mind to drown the world again; for that
 he would build a tower too high for the waters to be able
 to reach; and that he would avenge himself on God for
 destroying their forefathers."—Antiquities of the Jews, chap-
 ter 4. Moreover, it seems that by the ancients he was
 directly connected with sun worship. The name by which
 he was known in the Chaldean mysteries was Saturn, and
 as such he was worshiped as the "offspring of the sun."
 —The Two Babylons, pages 269, 270. It is a significant fact
 also that the numerical value of the name Saturn in the
 Chaldee is just 666, the Apocalyptic number of the beast;
 in other words, Nimrod was not only an oppressor, but a
 great prototype in early post-diluvian times of the pope, or
 "man of sin."
     4. Dr. Talbot W. Chambers, in the Old Testament Student
 for January, 1886, correctly styles sun-worship "the oldest,
 the most wide-spread, the most enduring of all the forms of
•idolatry known to man." He adds: "The chief object of wor-
 ship among the Syrians was Baal,—the sun, considered as
 the giver of light and life." "In Egypt the sun was the
 kernel of the state religion." "In Babylon the same thing is
 observed as in Egypt." "In Persia the worship of Mathra, or
 the sun, is known to have been common from-an early period."
 Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
12         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.'

The "Encyclopedia Britannica" says: "Sun-worship was the
primitive form of the Egyptian religion," and Rawlinson adds
that "no part of the Egyptian religion was so much developed
and so multiplex as their sun-worship."—Religions of the
Ancient World, page 21.
    5. As every student of ancient history knows, all these
ancient nations practiced slavery. Slavery was common
among them, and at times, as with Greece and Rome, the
number of slaves equalled and sometimes outnumbered the
number of freemen. Along with sun-worship, this embodi-
ment of human selfishness, slavery, has come marching down
through the ages even to our own time. The two have gone
hand in hand.
    6. The relationship between Sunday observance and slavery
is more close than might at first appear. The most ancient
and wide-spread form of idolatry, sun-worship, led to Sunday-
keeping, and selfishness, or covetousness, which is idolatry, led
to slavery. The two are simply two phases of the same sin,—
that of idolatry; Sunday observance representing the religious
side, and slavery the social side, of this sin. Just as covet-
ousness leads to human slavery, so Sunday observance leads
to the same thing, only in another way. Every Sunday law
is simply an attempt to make men the slaves and servants
of men.
    7., Constantine's Sunday law, the first on record, was en-
acted in 321 A. D. This required judges, townspeople, and
the occupations of all trades to rest on Sunday, but per-
mitted work in the country. In 386, a more strict imperial
law was enacted, forbidding all work on Sunday. Work being
forbidden, the people would attend games, shows, and the
theater on Sunday. In 401, at a convention held at Carthage,
the church bishops petitioned the emperor to forbid all public
shows and the like on Sunday. The desired law was se-
cured in 425.. "In this way," says Neander, "the church re-
ceived help from the state for the furtherance of her ends."
 In the year 800 Charlemagne enacted a law requiring church
attendance on Sunday. See Religious Liberty Leaflets, No. 2,
entitled "Sunday Laws: Their Origin, Nature, and Object."

                          Notes.
                                     •
   1. Seeking to entangle Christ in His talk, the Pharisees
put to Him what, in logic, is called a dilemma,—a proposi-
tion or argument with two or more alternatives, either of
which is equally against the opponent. So the Pharisees
reasoned that, if Christ should say, "Yes, it is lawful to
 pay tribute to Cmsar," He would offend the whole Jewish
nation, and the Sanhedrin would therefore condemn Him to
death. If He should say, "No, it is not lawful," then He
would be opposing Caesar, and the Roman power would con-
demn Him to death. In either case it meant death to Him.
But His answer to render to God and to Caesar each their
own, while it evaded a direct "Yes"• or "No," was so just
and reasonable that His enemies were completely confounded
and put to silence. This has been called "the wisest answer
ever given to a perplexed question." And this was the first
enunciation to the world of the great principle of a separa-
tion of religion and civil government. In all ages idolatrous
and pagan nations have regarded religion and government
as one and inseparable.
   2. Article VI of the Constitution says: "No religious test
shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or

ment says: "Congress shall make no law respecting an es-
tablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise there-
of." The Fourteenth Amendment says: "No state shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any
state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law, nor deny to any person within its juris-
diction the equal protection of the laws."
    3. On the reverse side of the great seal of the United States
is a Latin inscription reading, "Novos Ordo Seculorum," which
means "A new order of things."
    4. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these
rights, governments are instituted among men."—Declaration
of Independence.
    5. "As America, the land of religious liberty, shall unite
with the Papacy in forcing the conscience and compelling
men to honor the false Sabbath, the people of every country
on the globe will be led to follow her example." ,"Foreign
nations will follow the example of the United States. Though
she leads out, yet the same crisis will come upon our people
in all parts of the world."—Testimonies, Vol. VI, pages 18, 395.
    6. The first attempts to induce Congress to pass a Sunday
law were made in 1828 and 1829 over the question of the
 transportation of the mails and the closing of post-offices on
Sunday. The next was in 1888, when the Blair National Sun-
day Rest Bill was introduced. Then came the Breckenridge
Sunday Bill for the District of Columbia, in 1890. All these
in turn were defeated in 1892. But, through threats on the
part of certain church leaders, Congress was finally induced
to pass a measure for the closing of the World's Fair at
Chicago, in 1893, on Sunday. In 1901 it passed another like
measure for the closing of the St. Louis fair, in 1904, on
 Sunday. April 6, 1904, another bill for Sunday closing in
the District of Columbia passed the House of Representa-
tives, but was not brought before the Senate before Congress
adjourned, thus leaving the bill still pending.
    7. The National Reform Association was organized at
 Xenia, Ohio, in 1863. Its office is located at 209 Ninth Street,
Pittsburg, Pa. The American Sabbath Union was organized
 at Washington, D. C., Dec. 12, 1888. Its office address is 205

Broadway, New York. The International Reform Bureau,
styling itself "the first 'Christian lobby' established at our
national capital to speak to government in behalf of all de-
nominations," was organized by Mr. W. F. Crafts, in 1895,
with headquarters at 103 Maryland Avenue, N. E., Washing-
ton, D. C. The chief concern of all these is to secure state,
national, and world-wide Sunday legislation, and the universal
enforcement of Sunday observance by law.
   8. In 1889 this message came to us: "We as a people have
not accomplished the work which God has committed to us.
We are not ready for the issue to which the enforcement of
the Sunday law will bring us. It is our duty, as we see the
signs of approaching peril, to arouse to action. . . . The
peculiar wont of the third angel has not been seen in its im-
portance. God meant that His people should be far in ad-
vance of the position which they occupy to-day. But now,
when the time has come for them to spring into action, they
have the preparation to make. When the National Reformers
began to urge measures to restrict religious liberty, our lead-
ing men should have been alive to the situation, and should
have labored earnestly to counteract these efforts. It is not
in the order of God that light has been kept from our peo-
ple,—the very present truth •which they needed for this time.
Not all our ministers who are giving the Third Angel's Mes-
sage really understand what constitutes that message. The
National Reform movement has been regarded by some as of
so little importance that they have not thought it necessary
to give much attention to it, and have even felt that, in so
doing, they would be giving time to questions distinct from
the Third Angel's Message. May the Lord forgive our breth-
ren for thus interpreting the very message for this time."—

                           Notes.
   1. We should not disparage .the utility or importance of
civil governments. They are a necessity under the existing
condition of things. They became a necessity in consequence
of the fall. To secure men in their persons and property
is a good thing. To check the vicious, and what would other-
wise have been a wild, unrestrained career of crime, civil
government was ordained, the sword was placed in Caesar's
hand, and the law laid down, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed." Gen. 9:6. These govern-
ments may be very imperfectly organized, they may abound
in abuses, and fail often in executing justice; yet, as Macau-
lay says, "It seems reasonable to believe that the worst that
ever •existed was, on the whole, preferable to complete an-
archy." They are needed to protect the good and to punish
the vicious, to define what the well-disposed may do, and
what the evil-disposed must not do. They are ordained "for
the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that
do well." No Christian, therefore, should despise govern-
ment, speak evil of dignitaries, or bring a railing accusation
against rulers. See 2 Peter 2:10; Jude 9; Acts 23:1-5. "The
less we make direct charges against authorities and powers,
        The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                   19

the greater work we shall be able to accomplish, both in
America and in foreign countries." (Testimonies, Vol. VI,
page 395.) The rather should we pray "for kings, and for
all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peace-
able life in all godliness and honesty." 1 Tim. 2:1, 2. As
with the church, Satan does all in his power to pervert civil
governments, and to change them from protectors of the
people to oppressors of the people. But not until civil gov-
ernments have finally and fully taken their stand against
 the law of God, and withdrawn their protection from those
who keep the commandments of God, will they have served
their purpose and finished their usefulness in this world.
     2. Andrew W. Young, in his "Government Class Book,"
page 12, explaining why civil governments are necessary,
says: "Man is by nature selfish, and many would infringe
the rights of others, for their own selfish ends, unless re-
strained. Hence we see the necessity of some fixed rules,
that each one may know what he may do and what he must
not do. These rules for regulating the social actions of men
are called laws. . . . But law can not exist without gov-
 ernment. Law is a rule of action laid down by the supreme
 power, and if there is no supreme power there can be no
 law. Hence we see the necessity of goverhment. It will be
 noticed that the force of this argument all rests upon the
 statement that 'Man is by nature selftsh.' Civil governments
 are a necessity because men are selfish. But God did not
 create man selfish. Selfishness is an evil acquired through
 the fall. Hence civil governments are a necessity because
 of the entrance of sin into the world and the fall from inno-
 cence and obedience to God."
      3. "Obedience is to be rendered to all human governments
 in subordination to the will of God. These governments are
 a recognized necessity, in the nature of the case, and their
 existence is manifestly in accordance with the divine will.
 Hence the presumption is always in favor of the authority
 of civil law. Any refusal to obey must be based on the moral
  conviction that obedience will be sin. The one who proposes
  to disregard human law must be persuaded in his own mind
  that, in that course, he will meet the approval of God. It
  is too obvious to need discussion, however, that the law of God,
  the great rule of life, is supreme, and that in any case of con-
  flict between human law and the divine, 'we ought to obey
  God rather than men.' "—Fairchild's Moral Philosophy, ch. 8.
      4. From all the examples and test cases which have oc-
         The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.

curred from Pharaoh's time on down, it would seem that•the
world ought, by this time, to have learned that it is not
the business of civil rulers to attempt to direct men by force
in matters of religion, and, especially, that it is a wrong and
vain thing for them to command that which is contrary to
God's command. That it has not, shows how slow men have
been to learn God's lessons, and how great and how gross is
the darkness that still covers the earth and the people. Isa.
60:1, 2.


            LESSON VI.—The Final Conflict.
                    FEBRUARY 11, 1905..

 that is to come to the remnant people of God. Note 4.

  Note 9.
                            Notes.
    1. The common experience of God's people down through
 the ages has been that of conflict with the powers of dark-
         "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
22         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

ness and with the rulers of this world. Witness Israel in
Egypt, in Babylon, and under Persian rule. See the Chris-
tians under pagan emperors, under so-called Christian em-
perors, and finally under the papal power. A double object
has been accomplished in all these experiences. By them God
has tried and purified His people, and brought light to those
in darkness.
    2. "A great crisis awaits the people of God. A crisis awaits
the world. The most momentous struggle of all the ages is
just before us. Events which, for more than thirty years, we
have, upon the authority of the prophetic word, declared to
be impending, are now taking place before our eyes."- - es-
timonies, No. 33, page 239. "Fearful is the issue to which the
world is to be brought."—Great Controversy, page 604.
    3. "Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced
as enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral
restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and
calling down the judgments of God upon the earth."—Great
Controversy, page 592. (See, also, pages 590, 591, 614.)
    4. Nebuchadnezzar's decree was in violation of the second
commandment, or a command to worship in a false way. The
decree under Darius was in direct conflict with the first com-
mandment, or a prohibition to worship in the right way. One
decree meant that "you must worship a false god," the other
"you can not worship the true." So in the closing conflict
"the decree will go forth that they must disregard the Sab-
bath of the fourth commandment, and honor the first day,
 or lose their lives,"—Testimonies, Vol. I, pages 353, 354. The
test with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answers to the
requirement that we must keep Sunday, and Daniel's test to
the prohibition to keep the seventh day, the true Sabbath.
    5. "Let a man be what he may—Jew, seventh-day observer
of some other denomination, or those who do not believe in
 the Christian sabbath—let the law apply to every one, that
there shall be no public desecration of the first day of the
 week, the Christian sabbath, the day of rest for the nation.
They may hold any other day as sacred, and observe it; but
that day which is the one day in seven for the nation at
large, let that not be publicly desecrated by any one, by officer
in the government, or by private citizen, high or low, rich
or poor."—Dr. McAllister, in speech at Lakeside, Ohio, July,
1887.
    6. The hand is the symbol of labor. "Whatsoever thy
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will sena
               forth laborers into His harvest."
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                 23

hand findeth to do, do with thy might." Eccl. 9:10. The
mind is that with which we worship. "With the mind I my-
self serve the law of God." Rom. 7:25. To receive the mark
in the hand will be for men, in the last final issue, to cease
to labor on Sunday in deference to the law. To receive it in
the forehead will be to voluntarily and wilfully keep the
day in the face of light and opportunity to know that another
day is the Sabbath of the Lord.
    7. Justinian gave non-believers six months in which to
embrace Christianity, under pain of loss of office and the
right of inheritance. Pope Leo X gave Luther sixty days in
which to recant his "errors," otherwise "to be seized and sent
to Rome to be dealt with as a heretic." In the deciee against
the Jews, King Ahasuerus gave just eleven months to prepare
for the slaughter. Esther 3:12-15. "The decree which is to
go forth against the people of God will be very similar to
that issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews in the time of
Esther."—Testimonies, No. 32, page 206. See "Josephus' An-
tiquities of the Jews," Book XI, ch. 6, on this.
    8. "The Lord of heaven will not send upon the world His
judgments for disobedience and transgression until He has
sent His watchmen to give the warning. He will not close
up the period of probation until the message shall be more
distinctly proclaimed. The law of God is to be magnified;
its claims must be presented in their true, sacred character,
that the people may be brought to decide for or against the
truth. Yet the work will be cut short in righteousness. The
message of Christ's righteousness is to sound from one end
of the earth to the other to prepare the way of the Lord.
This is the glory of God, which closes the work of the third
angel."—Testimonies, Vol. VI, page 19.
   9.
"Sometime when all life's lessons have been learned,
      And sun and stars forevermore have set,
 The things that our weak judgments here have spurned,
      The things o'er which we grieved with lashes wet,
 Will flash before us, out of life's dark night,
      As stars shine most in deepest tints of blue,
 And we will see how all God's ways were right,
      And how what seemed reproof was love most true."

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period!"

    7. When God set His hand to deliver His people, after
their sojourn in Egypt, what were the first provisions

welfare? Num. 21:5.

  10. What meaning has Israel's experience for God's peo-
ple to-day? 1 Cor. 10:11.

"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
   for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                25

  12. What, besides the physical benefits to be received,
was God's object in giving the sanitary restrictions to
Israel? Lev. 20:7, 8, 26.
                           Notes.
    1. In depending upon their own physical senses, instead
of a simple faith in the Word of God, was the weakness of
our first parents. Eve saw that the tree was good, though
God said it was not.
    "Eve was beguiled by the serpent, and made to believe
that God would not do as He had said. She ate, and, think-
ing she felt the sensation of a new and more exalted life,
she bore the fruit to her husband. The serpent had said that
she would not die, and she felt no ill effects from eating the
fruit,—nothing that could be interpreted to mean death, but,
instead, a pleasurable sensation, which she imagined was as
the angels felt. Her experience stood arrayed against the
positive command of Jehovah, yet Adam permitted himself to
be seduced by it."—Christian Temperance, page 42.
     2. "As our first parents lost Eden through the indulgence
of appetite, our only hope of regaining Eden is through the
firm denial of appetite and passion. . . . The controlling
power of appetite will prove the ruin of thousands, when,
 if they had conquered on this point, then they would have
had the moral power to gain the victory over every other
temptation of Satan. But those who are slaves to appetite
will fail in perfecting Christian character. . . . As we
near the close of time, Satan's temptations to indulge appe-
tite will be more powerful and more difficult to overcome."—
 Testimonies, Vol. IV, page 491.
     3. "One of the strongest temptations that man has to meet
 is upon the point of appetite."—Christian Temperance, page
42.
      4. "The inhabitants of the antediluvian world were in-
 temperate in eating and drinking. They would have flesh
 meats, although at that time God had given man no per-
 mission to eat animal food. They ate and drank till the in-
 dulgence of their depraved appetite knew no bounds, and they
 became so corrupt that God could bear with them no longer."
  —Christian Temperance, page 43.
     5. "As men multiplied on the earth after the flood, they

                       watchword.
 26         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

  again forgot God, and corrupted their ways before Him.
  Intemperance in every form increased, until almost the whole
  world was given up to its sway. . . . The gratification
  of unnatural appetite led to the sins that caused the de-
  struction of Sodom and Gomorrah."—Id., page 43.
      6. "When God led the children of Israel out of Egypt, it
  was His purpose to establish them in the land of Canaan, a
  pure, healthy, happy people. . . . He subjected them to
  a course of discipline, which, had it been cheerfully followed,
  would have resulted in good both to them and to their pos-
  terity. . . . It was His purpose to supply them with food
  better suited to their wants than the feverish diet to which
  many of them had been accustomed in Egypt. The perverted
  appetite was to be brought into a more healthy state, that
  they might enjoy the food originally provided for man,—the
  fruits of the earth, which God gave to Adam and Eve in
  Eden."—Christian Temperance, page 118.
      Not only were directions given to Israel regarding diet,
 but the most perfect system of sanitary laws ever written was
 given them, as recorded in Leviticus.
     7. While, as a nation, Israel refused to heed God's voice,
 there were many who gladly listened to the instruction, and,
 either from the standpoint of mere ceremonialism or with
 simple faith in and obedience to God's Word, carried out the
 laws as instituted at Sinai. The story of murmuring and
 disobedience is not the only one left on record.
     The Levites, Daniel and his companions, and John the
  Baptist are notable examples of what obedience to the grin-
' ciples God laid down did for the faithful in Israel; and
 even to-day the Hebrew race is regarded as immune to cer-
  tain diseases due to intemperance and impurity, as a result
 of the more or less rigid obedience to the sanitary laws given
 by Moses.

      6. Relate an experience in the life of the three com-
 panions of Daniel which showed the results of their
 loyalty to principle and' regard for God's Word. Daniel 3.

      8. In these experiences, did they receive a special zeal
 just at the moment which enabled them to stand? Dan.

  14. What testimony is left by the great apostle Paul?
1 Cor. 9:27.
                           Notes.

    1. There is now an urgent call for strong young people
to take an active part in the work God has given to His peo-
ple. Not only the youth, but even children will be called
upon to bear an important part in _the closing work. See Tes-
timonies, Vol. VI, pages 202, 203.           •
    2. "Those who will not eat and drink from principle will
not be guided by principle in other things."—Health. Reformer.
    "To make plain natural law, and urge obedience to it, is
the work that accompanies the Third Angel's Message to pre-
pare a people for the coming of the Lord."—Testimonies, Vol.
III, page 161.
    "Parents should seek to awaken in their children an in-
terest in the study of physiology. Youth need to be instructed
in regard to their own bodies. . . . If parents themselves
would obtain knowledge upon this subject, and felt the im-
portance of putting it to a practical use, we should see a
better condition of things. Teach your children to reason
from cause to effect. Show them that if they violate the
laws of their being they must pay the penalty by suffering.
. . . Recklessness in regard to bodily health tends to
recklessness in morals. Do not neglect to teach your children
how to prepare healthful food. In giving them these lessons
in physiology, and in good cooking, you are giving them the
first steps in some of the most useful branches of education,
and inculcating principles which are needful elements in a
religious education."—Christian Temperance, page 71.

                             Notes.
   1. "John's life was without pleasure. It was sorrowful
and self-denying. . . . His life was lonely. He did not
cling to his father's family, to enjoy their society, but left
them in order to fulfil his mission."—Redemption, by Mrs. E.
G. White (out of print), page 44.
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                       already to harvest."
30         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

    2. "John was to go forth as Jehovah's messenger, to bring
men to the light of God. . . . Such a messenger must
be holy. He must be a temple for the indwelling Spirit of
God. In order to fulfil his mission, he must have a sound
physical constitution, and mental and spiritual strength.
Therefore, it would be necessary for him to control the ap-
petites and passions."—Desire of Ages, page 100.
    3. "John came in the spirit and power of Elijah to pro-
claim the first advent of Jesus. He was to represent those
who should go forth in the spirit and power of Elijah to
herald the day of wrath, and the second advent of Jesus."—
Redemption, by Mrs. E. G. White, page 45.
    4. "In the time of John the Baptist, greed for riches, and
the love of luxury and display, had become widespread. Sen-
suous pleasures, feasting and drinking, were causing physi-
cal disease and degeneracy, benumbing the spiritual percep-
tions 'and lessening the sensibility to sin. John was to stand
as a reformer. By his abstemious life and plain dress he
was to rebuke the excesses of his time. Hence the direc-
tions given to the parents of John,—a lesson of temperance
by an angel from the throne of heaven."—Desire of Ages, page
100.
    5. "It means much to be true to God. He has claims upon
all who are engaged in his service. He desires that mind
and body be preserved in the best condition of health, every
power and endowment under the divine control, and as vig-
orous as careful, strictly temperate habits can make him.
.     . Only those who appreciate these principles, and have
been trained to care for their bodies intelligently and in the
 fear of God, should be chosen to take responsibilities in this
work."—Testimonies, Vol. VI, page 875.
    6; "Through observing our lives, the people of the world
form their opinion of God and the religion of Christ. All who
do not know Christ need to have the high, noble principles
of His character kept constantly before them in the lives of
those who know Him."—Testimony for the Church, Vol. VI,
page 258.
    "Christ is to live In His human agents, and work through
their faculties, and act through their capabilities."—Mount
of Blessing, page 138.

We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                 31


   7. "If man will cherish the light that God in mercy gives
him upon health reform, he may be sanctified through the
truth, and fitted for immortality."—Testimonies for the
Church, Vol. III, page 162.

32        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.


12. Of how great significance is this lesson to us?
Note 6.
13. What is made possible by Christ's victory? Note 7.
14. How 'are we to overcome? Rev. 3 :21.
                           Notes.
    1. "With Christ, as with the holy pair in Eden, appetite
was the ground of the first great temptation. Just where the
ruin began, the work of redemption must begin. As by the
indulgence of appetite Adam fell, so by the denial of appe-
tite Christ must overcome.'=Desire of Ages, page 117.
    2. "When Christ bore the test of temptation upon the
point of appetite, He did not stand in beautiful Eden, as did
Adam, with the light and love of God seen in everything his
eye rested upon; but He was in a barren, desolate wilderness,
surrounded by wild beasts. Everything around Him was
repulsive. With these surroundings, He fasted forty days
and nights, 'and in those days He did eat nothing.' He
was emaciated through long fasting, and felt the keenest
sense of hunger. His visage was indeed marred more than
the sons of men."—Redemption, by Mrs. E. G. White, page S5.
    3. "The Redeemer, in whom both the human and divine
were united, stood in Adam's place, and endured a terrible
fast for nearly six weeks. The length of this fast is the
strongest evidence of the great sinfulness of debased appe-
tite, and the power it has upon the human family."—Id., p..16.
    4. "The demands of appetite were not to supersede strict
faith in and obedience to God's Word. His Word brought
the manna from heaven, and the water from the smitten
rock. It was a perverted appetite which could not be satisfied
by taith in . God's promise 'bread shall be given him; his
waters shall be sure.' "
    5. "Of all the lessons to be learned from our Lord's first
great temptation, none is more important than that bearing
upon the control of the appetites and passions."—Desire of
Ages, page 122.
    6. Read "Desire of Ages," page 122 (next to last para-
graph).
    "Christ was our example in all things. As we see His
humiliation in the long trial and fast to overcome the temp-
tation of appetite in our behalf, we are to learn how to over

        The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                        33
come when we are tempted. If the power of appetite is so
strong upon the human family, and its indulgence so fearful
that the Son of God subjected Himself to such a test, how
important that we feel the necessity of having appetite under
the control of reason. Our Saviour fasted nearly six weeks
that He might gain for man the victory upon the point of
appetite."—Redemption, pages 50. 51.
    7. "And here in the wilderness Christ achieved a victory
in behalf of the race upon the point of appetite, making it
possible for man, in all future time, in His name to overcome
 the strength of appetite on his own behalf."—Redemption,
 page 46: Also, read "Desire of Ages," pages 123 (second para-
graph.)

clude the laws of health."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol.

liness. God is a God of order. He will not sanction slack

timonies, Vol. II, page 66.
   7. "In order to be fitted for translation, the people of

with the Psalmist to exclaim, 'I will praise Thee, for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made.' " "It is best for those who
claim to be sons and daughters of God to avail themselves,
while they can, of the opportunities now presented to gain
a knowledge of the human system, and how it may he pre-
served in health. . . . The Lord will not work a miracle
to preserve any one in health who will not make an effort
to obtain knowledge within his reach concerning this won-
derful habitation that God has given."—Mrs. E. G. White, in
Medical Missionary, Vol. II, page 216.

"PEOPLE SEEM WILLING"
                             "People seem willing,
                           even anxious, to talk
                           about the coming of the
                           Lord," said a careful ob-
                           server to the writer of
                           this note the other day,
                           and we all know he spoke
                           the truth.
                              The fact that the peo-
                           ple are willing to talk on
                           this subject is an indica-
tion of their willingness to read, as well, and what
could be more acceptable to them than the newly
