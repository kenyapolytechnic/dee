## Notes

1. Seeking to entangle Christ in His talk, the Pharisees
put to Him what, in logic, is called a dilemma,—a proposition or argument with two or more alternatives, either of
which is equally against the opponent. So the Pharisees
reasoned that, if Christ should say, "Yes, it is lawful to
pay tribute to Cmsar," He would offend the whole Jewish
nation, and the Sanhedrin would therefore condemn Him to
death. If He should say, "No, it is not lawful," then He
would be opposing Caesar, and the Roman power would condemn Him to death. In either case it meant death to Him.
But His answer to render to God and to Caesar each their
own, while it evaded a direct "Yes"• or "No," was so just
and reasonable that His enemies were completely confounded
and put to silence. This has been called "the wisest answer
ever given to a perplexed question." And this was the first
enunciation to the world of the great principle of a separation of religion and civil government. In all ages idolatrous
and pagan nations have regarded religion and government
as one and inseparable.
2. Article VI of the Constitution says: "No religious test
shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or
public trust under the United States." And the First Amendment says: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The Fourteenth Amendment says: "No state shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any
state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
3. On the reverse side of the great seal of the United States
is a Latin inscription reading, "Novos Ordo Seculorum," which
means "A new order of things."
4. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these
rights, governments are instituted among men."—Declaration
of Independence.
5. "As America, the land of religious liberty, shall unite
with the Papacy in forcing the conscience and compelling
men to honor the false Sabbath, the people of every country
on the globe will be led to follow her example." ,"Foreign
nations will follow the example of the United States. Though
she leads out, yet the same crisis will come upon our people
in all parts of the world."—Testimonies, Vol. VI, pages 18, 395.
6. The first attempts to induce Congress to pass a Sunday
law were made in 1828 and 1829 over the question of the
transportation of the mails and the closing of post-offices on
Sunday. The next was in 1888, when the Blair National Sunday Rest Bill was introduced. Then came the Breckenridge
Sunday Bill for the District of Columbia, in 1890. All these
in turn were defeated in 1892. But, through threats on the
part of certain church leaders, Congress was finally induced
to pass a measure for the closing of the World's Fair at
Chicago, in 1893, on Sunday. In 1901 it passed another like
measure for the closing of the St. Louis fair, in 1904, on
Sunday. April 6, 1904, another bill for Sunday closing in
the District of Columbia passed the House of Representatives, but was not brought before the Senate before Congress
adjourned, thus leaving the bill still pending.
7. The National Reform Association was organized at
Xenia, Ohio, in 1863. Its office is located at 209 Ninth Street,
Pittsburg, Pa. The American Sabbath Union was organized
at Washington, D. C., Dec. 12, 1888. Its office address is 205 Broadway, New York. The International Reform Bureau,
styling itself "the first 'Christian lobby' established at our
national capital to speak to government in behalf of all denominations," was organized by Mr. W. F. Crafts, in 1895,
with headquarters at 103 Maryland Avenue, N. E., Washington, D. C. The chief concern of all these is to secure state,
national, and world-wide Sunday legislation, and the universal
enforcement of Sunday observance by law.
8. In 1889 this message came to us: "We as a people have
not accomplished the work which God has committed to us.
We are not ready for the issue to which the enforcement of
the Sunday law will bring us. It is our duty, as we see the
signs of approaching peril, to arouse to action. . . . The
peculiar wont of the third angel has not been seen in its importance. God meant that His people should be far in advance of the position which they occupy to-day. But now,
when the time has come for them to spring into action, they
have the preparation to make. When the National Reformers
began to urge measures to restrict religious liberty, our leading men should have been alive to the situation, and should
have labored earnestly to counteract these efforts. It is not
in the order of God that light has been kept from our people,—the very present truth •which they needed for this time.
Not all our ministers who are giving the Third Angel's Message really understand what constitutes that message. The
National Reform movement has been regarded by some as of
so little importance that they have not thought it necessary
to give much attention to it, and have even felt that, in so
doing, they would be giving time to questions distinct from
the Third Angel's Message. May the Lord forgive our brethren for thus interpreting the very message for this time."—
