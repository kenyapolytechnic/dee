                            Notes.
    1. "I also know the thoughts that I entertain respecting
you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil to give to
you a happy future and hope." Jer. 29:11, Jewish Version.
     God's purpose for man may be temporarily delayed, but
He will not fail nor be discouraged till judgment is set in
the earth, and man fulfils the object of his creation. Isa.
45:18; 42:4; Rev. 21:1-4.
     2. The endowment of the power to choose life or death,
righteousness or sin, was essential to man's liberty and hap-
piness. To refuse created intelligences the power of choice
would have meant bondage, discontent, and unhappiness;
therefore, Heaven esteemed liberty of sufficient value to be-
stow this great gift upon man, although it involved the pos-
sibility of the fall. It was when the councils of eternity
had decided that man and all other created intelligences
should be free that Christ became man's surety, that the
purpose of God concerning man should not fail.
     3. Purity, the image of God, liberty, dominion, home, and
life were all lost by sin.
     4. "The Son of God redeemed man's failure and fall, and
now, through the work of the atonement, Adam is reinstated
in his first dominion. Transported with joy, he beholds the
trees that were once his delight,—the very trees whose fruit
he himself had gathered in the days of his innocence and
 joy. He sees the vines that his own hands have trained, the
very flowers that he once loved to care for. His mind grasps
 the reality of the scene; he comprehends that this is indeed
Eden restored, more lovely than when he was banished from
 it."—Great Controversy, page 648.

   "Ye have robbed Me." "Return unto Me, and I will return
unto you, saith the Lord of hosts."
                         Questions.
    1. What solemn charge is given to the church of God?
Amos 4:12.
    2. Is the Laodicean church prepared to meet the
Lord? Rev. 3:13-17.
  ; 3. What counsel does the Spirit give this church?
Rev. 3:18.
    4. What does the term. Laodicca signify? Note 1.
     5. By whom, and against whom, is the charge of rob-

                             Notes.
    1. "Laodicea signifies the judging of the people, or, accord-
ing to Cruden, a just people. The message to the church
brings to view the closing scenes of probation. It reveals a
period of judgment. It is the last stage of the church, . . .
while the great day of atonement is transpiring, and the in-
vestigative judgment is going forward upon the house of
God,—a period during which the just and holy law of God
is taken by the waiting church as their rule of life."—Thoughts
on Daniel, page 871. Compare Mal. 3:17 with Rev. 3:13-21.
    2. "The work of God which should be going forward with
tenfold its present strength and efficiency is kept back, like a
spring season held by the chilling blast of winter, because some
of God's professed people are appropriating to tuemselves the
means that should be dedicated to His service. Because
Christ's self-sacrificing love is not interwoven in the life prac-
tices, the church is weak where it should be strong. By its
own course it has put out its light, and robbed millions of
the gospel of Christ. . . . To defraud God is the greatest
crime of which man can be guilty; and yet this sin is deep
and wide-spread."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald,
Oct. 13, 1896.
    :3. "Christ looks upon a vineyard unworked, a world un-
warned, with wickedness increasing on every hand. The sub-
ject of tithes and offerings has not been dwelt upon as it should
have been. Men are not naturally inclined to be benevolent,
but to be sordid and avaricious, and to live for self. I entreat
my brethren and sisters throughout the world to awaken to the
responsibility that rests upon them to pay a faithful tithe.
Do not allow lax principles to lead you to rob God. Keep a
faithful account with your Creator. Realize fully the im-
portance of being just with Him who has divine foreknowl-
edge. Let every one search his heart diligently. Let him
look up his accounts, and find out how he stands related to
God. Let every one of you lay by him in store as God has
prospered him. The poor and the rich, the young men and
women who earn wages,—all are to lay by a portion, for
God claims it."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Southern Watchman,
Feb. 14, 1905.

    for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

        LESSON I11.—The Sabbath and the Tithe.
                       JULY 15, 1905.
                          Questions.
    1. In the beginning, what portion of time did God
set apart for special religious uses? Gen. 2 :1-3.
    2. What definite day was named? Gen. 2:3.
    3. How was man instructed to use this day? Ex.
20 :8-10.
    4. What reserve did God make of one of the trees of
the garden? Gen. 3:1-3. Note 1.
    5. Is the Sabbath still a test of man's loyalty to his
Maker? Eze. 20:12, 20; Ex. 20:10.
    6. What special term is applied to the Lord's Sabbath?
Isa. 58 :13.
    7. What similar term is applied by God 10. the tithe?
Lev. 27:30.
    8. What like expressions are used in the Scriptures
concerning the Sabbath and the tithe? Note 2.
    9. When man uses the Sabbath for secular purposes,
of what law does he become a transgressor? Ex. 20:8-11.
   10. When man uses the tithe of his income for purposes
not permitted of God, what sin does he commit? Mal.
3 :8.
   11. Will the remnant church be tested especially upon
the Sabbath and the tithe? Isa. 58 :1, 2, 12, 13; Mal. 3 :7,
8. Note 3.
   12. How are many of the professed people of the Lord
treating the Sabbath? Isa. 58:1, 12, 13.
'One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."
         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

   13. Has the duty of paying the Lord's tithe been
likewise neglected? Mal. 3:7, 8.
   14. What has God pronounced upon those who turn
unto Him in both keeping the Sabbath and the payment
of the tithe? Isa. 56 :1, 2 ; Mal. 3 :10 ; Rev. 22 :14.
                           Notes.
   1. God reserved holy unto Himself the seventh day of time.
He also reserved one of the fruit-bearing trees of the garden
as a test of man's loyalty, and a recognition of God's owner-
ship.
    Time is essential to man's being. So are the products
of the earth. The former would be of no value to man with-
out the latter; and the bounties of the earth could be of no
profit to man without time. Hence, God brings a test of
character to man touching these essential gifts of God to
man.
    2. Note the similar claim the Lord lays to the Sabbath
and the tithe. "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God." "All the tithe is the Lord's." Both are "holy"
unto the Lord. Lev. 27:30; Ex. 20:10; Isa. 58:13.
    The Sabbath and the tithe are both a test of man's loyalty
to his Maker. The first makes known our Creator and God.
The second is a means of constant acknowledgment that we
receive all earthly blessings from His hands. To disregard
the claims of either is a violation of the holy law of God.
    3. A careful study of the context shows that these scrip-
tures have a special application in the last days. While
Sabbath-breaking and withholding the tithe have always been
 wrong, the Lord will test the world upon these questions be-
 fore the end.

                          Notes.
   1. To compute the unlimited "measure" of the gift of
Christ, will be the science of the world to come. Eternity
alone can unfold the infinite sacrifice of heaven in the gift
of the Son of God.
   2. "Many hold that from the nature of Christ it was im-
possible for Satan's temptations to weaken or overthrow Him;
     "There shall be delay no longer"-our confidence.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                    9
then Christ could not have been placed in Adam's position,
to go over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell; He
could not have gained the victory that Adam failed to gain.
If man has in any sense a more trying conflict to endure than
had Christ, then Christ is not able to succor him when
tempted. Christ took humanity with all its liabilities. He
took the nature of man capable of yielding to temptation,
and with the same aid that man may obtain, He withstood
the temptations of Satan, and conquered the same as we may
conquer. . . . He assumed human nature, being the in-
firmities and degeneracy of the race. It is not true that
humanity has trials to bear which the Son of God has not
experienced."—Special Testimony.
    "In the Saviour's expiring cry, 'It is finished,' the death-
knell of Satan was rung. The great controversy which had
been so long in progress was then decided, and the final
eradication of evil was made certain."—Great Controversy,
page 503.
    3. "But what do we give up, when we give all?—A sin-
polluted heart for Jesus to purify, to cleanse by His own
blood, and to save by His matchless love. And yet men think
it hard to give, up all! I am ashamed to hear it spoken of,
ashamed to write it."—Steps to Christ, page 55.


           LESSON V.—The Lord's Witnesses.
                       JULY 29, 1905.

and Satan? Luke 4:5-7. Note 1.
    2. What claim does the Lord make as to the owner-
ship of the world and all therein? Ps. 50 :10-12.
    3. Whom did Moses proclaim to the wicked Pharaoh
as the rightful owner of the earth? Ex. 9 :29.
    4. What acknowledgment did King David make as
to the ownership of the earth? 1 Chron. 29 :11717.

    5. What testimony does the apOstle Paul bear in this
controversy? 1 Cor._ 10 :26.
    6. To whom does the gold and silver belong? Hag.
2 :8.
    7. Who multiplies the gold and silver for man?

    S. Can the Lord, who gives food and raiment to man,
also withhold the same? Deut. 10 :17, 18; Hosea 2 :8, 9.
    9. From whom does man obtain power to get wealth?
Deut. 8:17, 18.
   10. How much do we bring into the world, and how
much can we take away with us? 1 Tim. 6 :7.
   11. How can we use the goods entrusted to our care here
so that they will stand to our credit in the world to come?
Luke 12:32-36.
   12. What position does a man occupy in handling the
things of this world? Luke 16:12.
   13. Is it possible for us to make a theoretical profession
of a truth that we deny in practice? Titus 1 :16;'2 Peter
2:1. Note 2.
                           Notes.
   1. Satan disputes the right and title of Christ to this
world. Just before the coronation of the Son of God, after the
wicked dead are raised, true to his text, Satan's last effort
to deceive is upon the same question of the rightful owner-
ship of this world. "Yet true to his early cunning, he does
not acknowledge himself to be Satan. He claims to be the
prince who is the rightful owner of this world, and whose
inheritance has been unlawfully wrested from him. - He repre-
sents himself to his deluded subjects as a redeemer, assuring
them that his power has brought them forth from their graves,
and that he is about to rescue them from the most cruel
tyranny."—Great Controversy, page 663. It is worthy of note
that Satan causes the most of strife and carnage among men
          Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.

and nations to arise over questions of ownership, or title,
to the things of this world.
    2. On which side of this controversy do you stand, my
brother and sister? What is your confession of faith and
practice upon this vital question? The Lord has reserved to
Himself the tithe of all the products of the earth, and of that
produced by the mind or muscle of man, as a constant test
and acknowledgment from man that Christ is the rightful
owner of all. This Satan denies. This is a practical question
that will decide the destiny of souls. Says Christ, "Who-
soever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before
My Father which is in heaven." Matt. 10:33.


            LESSON VI.—Trying the Heart.
                       AUGUST 5, 1905.

    1. Of what must man give a faithful account to God?
Matt. 25:14, 15, 19.
    2. In what manner does the Lord require of man a
constant acknowledgment of His ownership? Lev.
27:30-32. Note 1.
    3. What is said concerning Abraham's faithfulness in
the payment of the tithe? Gen. 14:18-20.
    4. In what way was Abraham especially honored? 2
Chron. 20:7; James 2 :23; Rom. 4:11, 17.
    5. Will faithfulness now receive the same recognition
from God? Rom 4:12; Gal. 3:9.
    6. When Jacob became a converted man, how did he
at once recognize the Lord's ownership? Gen. 28 :20-22.
    7. How did Moses and the children of Israel teach the
divine ownership of the tithe? Ex. 9:29; Num. 18 :26.

   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
12        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

    8. In what words does Christ teach the same obliga-
tion of paying the tithe? Matt. 23 :23.
    9. What specific instruction has the Lord given con-
cerning the support of the gospel ministry? Heb. 7:5;
1 Cor. 9:13, 14. Note 2.
   10. What indictment is brought against those who do
not follow the Lord's instruction for the support of the
gospel? Mal. 3:8, 9.
   11. What blessing is pronounced upon those who follow
the Lord's plan? Mal. 3:10.
   12. What experience is recorded for our encourage-
ment? 2 Chron. 31:4-10. Note 3.
                              Notes.
    1k "The system of tithes and offerings was intended to
impress the minds of men with a great truth, that God is
the source of every blessing to His creatures, and that to Him
man's gratitude is due for the good gifts of His providence."
"Thus the people were constantly reminded that God was the
true proprietor of their fields, their flocks, and herds, that
He sent them sunshine and rain for their seed-time and har-
vests, that every thing that they possessed was of His crea-
tion, and they were simply stewards of His goods."—Mrs. E.
G. White, in the Review and Herald, Sept. 10, 1889)
    2. "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy
things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait
at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the
Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live
of the gospel." 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.
    "And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the
tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they
serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Num. 18:21. When the apostle therefore says that "they
which minister about holy things live of the things of the
temple," he has special reference to the tithe. "Even so hath
the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should
live of the gospel." Webster defines "even" and "so" "in an
equal, or precisely similar manner, precisely the same, ex-
        The needs of the cause of God are world-wide,
          SARBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                     13
actly, likewise," etc. The word "ordain" he defines, "to ap-
point; to decree," etc. Cruden says the word means "to com-
mand, or enjoin, to appoint, or designate to a certain end, or
use," etc. With these definitions before us, let us read 1 Cor.
9:13, 14, supplying the definitions for these terms. "Do ye
not know that they which minister about holy things live of
the wings of the temple? .           . In precisely a similar man-
ner hath the Lord appointed, decreed, and enjoined that they
which preach the gospel shall live of the gospel."
     None deny that Christ's ministers were supported by
the tithe during the Levitical priesthood; but it does not end
there; for we have seen that it is a decree of God that those
who preach the gospel should be supported in a precisely
similar manner as were the Levites. And as we are now under
the same Melchisedec priesthood (Heb. 5:5, 6; 6:20) that
Abraham was under, it is evident that the tithe has been

                           Notes.
   1. No intimation is here given that the tithing system
originated at this time. The record shows that Abraham and
Jacob recognized its binding obligation upon them, and fol-
lowed the instructions previously given by Gocrto return the
tithe of all that the Lord gave to them. It is worthy of re-
mark that new institutions, originating from Abraham's time
onward through the Bible history, have their origin plainly
brought to view, the command given requiring their observ-
ance, and the circumstances and rites connected with them.
For example, circumcision, the Passover, the ceremonial sab-
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                   already to harvest."
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                  15

baths and feasts; and, in the New Testament, baptism, the
Lord's Supper, and the ordinance of humility. But the origin
of the tithing system reaches back to the beginning, when it
became necessary because of the fall of man, and the promise
of hoe was offered to a lost world.
    2. The tithing system did not originate with the He-
brew . From the earliest times the Lord claimed the tithe
as His, and this claim was recognized and honored. Abraham
paid tithes to Melchisedec, the priest to the Most High God.
Jacob, when at Bethel, as exile and wanderer, promised the
Lord, 'Of all that Thou shalt give me, I will surely give the
tenth unto Thee.' As the Israelites were about to be estab-
lished as a nation, the law of tithing was reaffirmed as one of.
the divinely ordained statutes, upon obedience to which their
prosperity depended."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and
Herald, Sept. 10, 1889.
   7i. In Heb. 5:6, Ch ist is said to be a "priest forever after
the order of Melchisedec." That order of priesthood existed
trom the fall of man till the introduction of the Levitical
order of priesthood; and then contemporaneously with the lat-
ter, and since the Levitical order ceased (at the cross), the
Saviour has been a priest according to the Melchisedec order,
ministering in behalf of mankind, and offering His own blood
before the Father, to make reconciliation for all who accept
Him as their substitute, regardless of the age of their so-
journ in the earth.
    The tithing system was contemporaneous with the Mel-
chisedec priesthood, prior to the Levitical priesthood (see
Gen. 14:16-20; 28:11-22); it continued during the Levitical
order of priesthood (Lev. 27:28-33; Num. 18:21), and will
ever remain binding as long as the present order of Mel-
chisedec priesthood exists (Heb. 5:6; 7:1-9; 1 Cor. 9:11-14).
Therefore, as the Melchisedec priesthood is contemporaneous
with the gospel, and the tithing system is contemporaneous
with the Melchisedec priesthood, the tithing system is con-
temporaneotis with the gospel, founded upon moral principles.
and is co-existent with and inseparable from the gospel.
     Another consideration, showing how ancient and general
 the custom of tithing was, is the fact that it was well known
among the heathen. Cruden says: "The most barbarous
 nations, and the heath-en Greeks and Romans, out of a prin-
ciple of religion common to all men, have often dedicated their
 tithes to their gods. Some have made it a standing obliga-
 tion; others have done it on particular occasions, and by the

16.        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

 impulse of a transient devotion. Lwrtius says that when
 Pisistratus, tyrant of Athens, wrote to Solon to persuade him
 to return to Athens, he told him 'that every one there pays
 the tithe of his goods for the offering of sacrifice to the gods.'
 —Laert., Lib. I. Pliny says that the Arabian merchants who
 traded in spices durst not sell any till they had paid the tithe
 to their god, Sabes. And Plutarch, in more places than one,
 mentions a custom of the Romans of offering to Hercules the
 tithe of what they took from their enemies."
     It is evident that the heathen nations retained this much
 of the form of the gospel and the true worship of God, al-
 though their worship had been turned from the true God to
,false gods. Their devotion should be a standing rebuke to
 professed Christians who refuse to honor Christ in the pay-
 ment of the tithe. We talk of the precious gift of Christ,
 the costly purchase He made for man, of our faith, of our
 hope of heaven, and yet, to the shame and confusion of many,
 the heathen will rise up in the judgment to condemn them.


LESSON VI11.—The Tithe Reserved for the Support of

who believe? 1 Cor. 1:21.
   2. What high position do Christ's ministers occupy?
2 •Cor. 5:18-20.

"The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                       watchword.

to God for the results of his time and labor? Heb. 13:17.
   .7. To whom should these ambassadors of Christ look
for support? Num. 18:21; 1 Cor. 9:13, 14. Note 1.

to Christ the tithe? 1 Chron. 31:4, 5; Neh. 13 :10-12.
Note 2.

prayers for many more laborers to enter the great harvest-
field? Luke 10 :2; Mal. 3 :10.
   10. With what is the minister of God to feed the peo-
ple? Acts 20:28; Matt. 24:45.
   11. Will there come a time when it will be too late to
use our means to give the bread of life to the people?
Jer. 8:20-22; Amos 8:11, 12. Note 3.
   12. What use will men have for their hoarded gold and
;jiver in that day? Zeph. 1 :18; Isa. 2:19-21.
                              Notes.
   1. The tithing system was not given to man for the prime
object of the support of the ministry, but above this there are
moral obligations growing out of man's relations to Christ
as Creator and Redeemer, which involve principles which
our first parents disregarded in Eden, and on which the
loyalty of all other worlds is being tested the same as the
inhabitants of this world.
    Who shall not say "Amen" to the words of the apostle,
"Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the
gospel should live of the gospel"?
    2. "The work of God which should be going forward with
tenfold its present strength and efficiency is kept back, like a
spring season held by the chilling blast of winter, because
some of God's professed people are appropriating to themselves
the means that should be dedicated to His service."—Mrs. E.
G. White, in Review and Herald, Oct. 13, 1896. It is not only
laborers that are kept out of the ministry because of this
sin, but the church itself is paralyzed by her selfish indiffer-
   -p        ^l'or-s'of Christ.
            Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.

    3. "I saw that if any held on to their property, and did
not inquire duty of the Lord, He would not make duty known,
and they would be permitted to keep their property, and in
the time of trouble it would come up before them like a
mountain to crush them, and they would try to dispose of
it, but would not be able. I heard some mourn like this:
'The cause was languishing, God's people were starving for
the truth; and we made no effort to supply the lack; now our
property is useless. 0, that we had let it go, and laid up
treasure in heaven.' I saw that a sacrifice did not increase,
but it decreased, and was consumed. I also saw that God had
not required all of His people to dispose of their property at
the same time, but if they desired to be taught, He would
teach them, in a time of need, when to sell, and how much
to sell. Some have been required to dispose of their property
in times past to sustain the Advent cause, while others have
been permitted to keep theirs until a time of need, then, as
the cause needs it, their duty is to sell."—Early Writings,
page 48.


LESSON IX.—What Is the Tithe? When and Where
            Should it Be Paid?
                     AUGUST 26, 1905.

    1. What is a tithe? G-en. 14:20 ; Heb. 7 :2. Note 1.

Lord His own? Note 2.
    3. What instruction does the Lord give concerning the
use of our substance? Prov. 3:9.
    4. From what portion of our substance should the
tithe be taken? 2 Chron. 31:4, 5. Note 3.
    5. Does the Lord's arrangement recognize a treasury,
and a systematic plan for distributing the tithe to the
laborers? 2 Chron. 31:11-15. Note 4.
      "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                    19

    6. Will the Lord hold men responsible to Him for
strict integrity, justice, and faithfulness in their ap-
pointed work? 2 Sam. 23:3, 4; Micah 6:8.
    7. For what purpose should the tithe be used? Num.
18:21. Note 5.
    8. How should the church regard the aged servants
of God? Lev. 19 :32 ; Ps. 71:9, 13. Note 6.
    9. What special promises are made to the ambassadors
of Christ? Matt. 28 :18-20.
                              Notes.
   1. The tithe is one-tenth of all man's income. What is
the meaning of the word "income"? Webster defines it as
follows: "That gain which proceeds from labor, business, or
property of any kind; the produce of a farm; the rent of
houses; the proceeds of professional business; the profits of
commerce or of occupation; the interest of money or stock
in funds, etc.; revenue; receipts; especially the annual receipts
of a private person or corporation from property; as, a large
income, a limited income."
    This is a very different word from "increase," which means
to "become greater in bulk, quantity, number, degree, value,
intensity, authority, reputation, etc.; to grow; to augment; to
advance."
    The definition of income is very clear. Man's income is
what comes in as gain from all sources, rents, labor, business,
or property, interest, proceeds of stock, salary, etc. One-tenth
of all that income God claims as His own, with which He
 proposes to sustain His ministers.
    2. Some think it a difficult matter to determine just
 what is the tenth of their income. Suppose you should rent
 your farm for one-half of all its produce, the renter to have
 the one-half for his labor in working the farm, and you the
 other half. Would you consider it a hard task to determine
 what your share of the proceeds of that farm were? The
 renter who would not think carefully enough to divide the pro-
 ceeds of your farm with you, according to the contract, in
 every item of its products, you would soon judge unworthy
 to act as a steward of your goods, and he would be asked to
 vacate. It is true that we can not enter into a single trans-

20        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

action or enterprise that brings into our hands gain but
what God is to be considered in the dividends. This is one
of the blessed fruits of tithing.
     But many think they are paying a tithe when they are
coming far short of doing so. They freely consume the prod-
ucts of the farm, and simply pay a tithe on what they sell.
This is not tithing. Jacob said: "Of all that Thou shalt give
me, I will surely give the tenth unto Thee." Our living is to
come out of the nine-tenths, after the tithe has been taken out
for God. Not only does God ask for a tithe of the grain,
cattle, horses, sheep, fruit, vegetables, but of honey, oil, etc.
—a tithe of all. See Matt. 23:23; Lev. 27:30-33; 2 Chron.
31:5, 6. It may be hard to know the cash value of the garden,
the fruit, milk, butter, etc., that we daily eat from the farm.
We have known brethren to estimate the value of their garden
from ten to sixty dollars, according to its size. If the garden
is worth twenty dollars in the support of the family, we can
easily find what the tithe would be. We have known the sis-
ters to test by weight the amount of butter and milk used
in the family for a few weeks, and then pay a tithe on the
same amount for each week during the year.
     3. Not only does the Lord ask the tenth, but this tenth
is to be taken from our income as the first-fruits. Few per-
sons. who do not keep a strict account of all they receive are
aware of how much they have had during the year. When
they neglect to pay their tithes till the last of the quarter,
or the last of the year, Satan makes them often feel very
poor, and often they give much less than the tithe. Upon
the receipt of means, the tithe should always be taken out
 first, and laid aside as sacred to the Lord, and as soon as
possible sent to the treasury.
     4. "Great objects are accomplished by this system. If
one and all would accept it, each would be made a vigilant
and faithful treasurer of God; and there would be no want
of means to carry forward the great work of sounding the last
message of warning to the world. The treasury will be full
if all adopt this system, and contributors will not be left the
poorer."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, page 389.
     5. "The portion that God has reserved for Himself is not
to be diverted to any other purpose than that which He has
specified. Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe to use
according to their own judgment. They are not to use it
for themselves in any emergency, nor to apply it as they see
-One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."

fit, even in what they may regard as the Lord's work."—Mrs.
E. G. White, in, Review and Herald, Nov. 10, 1896.
    6. The counsel of the servants of God of long experience
should be cherished by those of less experience; for it is in-
valuable to the cause of God.


LESSON X.—The Spirit of Sacrifice Is an Essential Part
                 of Acceptable Worship.
                   SEPTEMBER 2, 1905.
                        Questions.
   1. What instruction is given concerning bringing an
offering to the Lord when we come into His courts to
worship? Ps. 96 :7-9. Note 1.
   2. How did the offerings made on the Sabbath compare

Mark 12 :41-44.
    4. What did David say concerning making an offering
to God? 2 Sam. 24:24.
    5. What class of persons will the Lord receive into His
kingdom? Ps. 50:3-5.
    6. Why has Christ warned His people against covetous-
ness? Luke 12 :15 ; 1 Tim. 6:9-11. Note 3.
    7. What solemn charge is made to those who have been
prospered in the things of this world? 1 Tim. 6:7-19;
Luke 12:33-37.
    8. According to what should each person give? 1 Cor.
16 :1, 2.
    9. Beside the tithes, in what have the people robbed
the Lord? Mal. 3 :8. Note 4.
   The   offerings for this quarter go to the most nt,edy fields.
22        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.
   10. What offerings did the Lord anciently require of
His people?—Trespass offerings, peace offerings and thank
offerings . Lev. 5 :5-7 ; 2 Sam. 24 :25; 2 Chron. 29 :31.
   11. Are those living in this age of special gospel light
under less obligations than those of a former age to make
liberal offerings to God? Luke 12:48. Note 5.
   12. What instruction did the Saviour give the young
ruler who desired to know what he must do to have eternal
life? Luke 18 :18-23.
   13. What did Jesus say concerning others who are sit-
uated like this young man? Verses 24-27.
                             Notes.
   1. The spirit of heaven is to give. All that man is, hopes
to be, or may possess of life and happiness, is a gift from
God. It is Godlike to give; for it is of love, for love gives
and gives. Therefore, true worship loves and gives. This is
seen in Noah and family as they came forth from the ark, their
hearts swelling with gratitude that they could set their feet
on earth again. It was not enough that this righteous man
should lift his voice in thanksgiving for his deliverance, for
past mercies and blessings, but he must there give more
tangible evidence of his gratitude than words could express.
He must make a burnt offering of a seventh part of the clean
animals unto the Lord, as it is written: "And Noah builded
an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and
of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar,
and the Lord smelled a sweet savor." Gen. 8:20, 21.
    2. The Sabbath offerings connected with the sanctuary
service were twice as much as on other days. There are about
sixty thousand Seventh-day Adventists in North America. If
each of these brought to the Lord a weekly Sabbath offering
as the Lord had prospered, we would have at least:-
     1,000 giving $2.00 each Sabbath; for
                                       it

   None would be the poorer for this offering, nor would this
affect their tithe.
   3. "I saw that Satan bade his angels lay their snares espe-
cially for those who were looking for Christ's second appear-
ing, and keeping all the commandments of God. Satan told
his angels: . . . `Go, make the possessors of lands and
money drunk with cares. . . . They may profess what they
please, only make them care more for money than for the
success of Christ's kingdom or the spread of the truths we
hate. Present the world before them in the most attractive
light, that they may love and idolize it. We must keep in
our ranks all the means of which we can ,gain control. The
more means the followers of Christ devote to His service, the
more will they injure our kingdom by getting our subjects.
As they appoint meetings in different places, we are in danger.
Be very diligent then. Cause disturbance and confusion if pos-
sible. Destroy love for one another. Discourage and dis-
hearten their ministers; for we hate them. Present every
plausible excuse to those who have means, lest they hand it
out. Control the money matters if you can, and drive their
ministers to want and distress. This will weaken their courage
and zeal. Battle every inch of the ground. Make covetous-
ness and love of earthly treasures the ruling traits of their
character. As long as these traits rule, salvation and grace
stand back. Crowd every attraction around them, and they
will be surely ours. And not only are we sure of them, but
their hateful influence will not be exercised to lead others to
heaven. When they shall attempt to give, put within them a
grudging disposition, that it may be sparingly.' "—Early Wri-
tings, pages 128, 129.
    4. "Upon what principle can it be said that we rob God
in 'offerings,' if God has given to man nine-tenths of his
income, and has only reserved the tithe as holy to Himself?"
God has not specified any particular amount that man should
give in offerings; yet if we do not recognize the obligatien
we are under to God for what He has done, and is doing for
us in the gift of Jesus Christ, we show the basest ingratitude.
When our friends have bestowed upon us some valuable gift,
we look about us to see what we can. do to reciprocate the
favor. The greater the gift bestowed, the greater the sense
of obligation and gratitude. If the trifling favors hesto we
upon man by their fellows can call forth a return of "gifts"
according to the receiver's ability, how much more should the
"gift" of lire and redemption call forth from man constant

recognition of his obligations and gratitude to his Redeemer?
    5. "Every blessing bestowed upon us calls for a response
to the Author of all our mercies. The Christian should often
review his past life, and recall with gratitude the precious
deliverances that God has wrought for him, supporting him in
trial, opening ways before him when all seemed dark and for-
bidding, refreshing him when ready to faint. He should
recognize all of them as evidences of the watchcare of heav-
enly angels. In view of these innumerable blessings, he should
often ask, with subdued and grateful heart, 'What shall I
render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me?' Our
time, our talents, our property, should be sacredly devoted
to Him who has given us these blessings in trust. Whenever
a special deliverance is wrought in our behalf, or new and un-
expected favors are granted us, we should acknowledge God's
goodness, not only by expressing our gratitude in words, but,
like Jacob, by gifts and offerings to His cause. As we are
continually receiving the blessings of God, so we are to be
continually giving."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 187, 188.

                             Note.
     In Isa. 33:15, speaking of him that will "dwell" and not
be consumed amid the everlasting burnings that cleanse the
earth from sin and sinners (2 Peter 3:7), the Revised Version
reads: "He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly;
he that despiseth the gain of fraud," etc. "To defraud God
is the greatest crime of which man can be guilty; and yet this
sin is deep and wide-spread. Through the prophet Malachi,
God says: 'Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed Me
. . . in tithes and offerings."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review
and Herald, Oct. 1.3, 1896.

                              Notes.
      1. The responsibility of the parent can never be lightly
 turned over to others. God uses the teacher in the Sabbath-
 school, church school, in our academies and colleges, in help-
 ing to train the youth; but the most important school, and
 the one that•has the most,,to do in deciding the 'destiny of our
 "Children, iis the home school. The greatest responsibility of
 chi.u-training God has placed upon the parent.
     .4j. We are to acknowledge the Lord in all our ways. We
 are to teach our children to acknowledge Christ as the One
 that has bought us with His own precious life. To Him we
 should render a tithe of all our income as a confession of
 His ownership and our loyalty to Him. The children should
 be taught at an early age to be helpful in the home, and an
 opportunity should be given to the child, by some means, to
 earn something. He should be taught to lay aside the tithe
 unto Christ, and, by practicing self-denial, to make offerings
 to the cause. The amounts may be small, but the results
 of this training will be great. The children should be repre-
 sented in the quarterly and annual report of the tithe received
 by the treasurer of the church.
       "Not only does the Lord claim the tithe as His own, but
  He tells us how it should be reserved for Him. He says:
  `Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first-fruits
 of thine increase.' This does not teach that we are to spend
 our means on ourselves and bring to the Lord the remnant
  even though it should be otherwise an honest tithe. Let
  God's portion be first set apart. The directions given by the
  Holy Spirit through the apostle Paul, in regard to gifts, pre-
  sent a principle that applies also to tithing. 'On the first day
  of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store as God
  has prospered him.' Parents and children are here included.
  Not only the rich, but the poor are addressed. 'Every man ac-
  cording as he purposeth in his heart -"through the candid
  consideration of God's prescribed plan], so let him give, not
  grudgingly or of necessity; for the Lord loveth a cheerful
• giver.' The gifts are to be made in consideration of the great
  goodness of God to us."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and
  Herald, Nov. 10, 1896.
       2 "As the children sang in the temple courts, 'Hosanna!
  Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,' so in these
   last days children's voices will be raised to give the last mes-
   sage of warning to a perishing world. When heavenly in-
 "One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."

telligences see that men are no longer permitted to present
the truth, the Spirit of God will come upon the children, and
they will do a work in the proclamation of the truth which
the older workers can not do, because their way will be
hedged up."—Testimony Vol. VI, pages 202, 203.
     4. Were our children taught to be as self-sacrificing and
loyal to the kingdom of Christ as many of the children of
this world are to earthly rulers, the church would soon accom-
plish her warfare in triumphant victory.
     5. "The Lord has not left the disposal of the tithe to you,
to be given or withheld as your inclination may dictate. He
has placed the matter beyond all question, and there has been
great neglect on the part of many of God's professed people
to fulfil the requirements of His Word in regard to tithing.
. . . It is the duty of the elders and officers of the church
to instruct the people on this important matter, and to set
things in order. As laborers together with God, the officers
of the church should be sound upon this plainly-revealed ques-
tion. The ministers themselves should be strict to carry out
to the letter the injunctions of God's Word. Those who hold
positions of trust in the church should not be negligent, but
they should see that the members are faithful in performing
this duty."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, Dec. 17,
1889.
    The church treasurer holds one of the most responsible
positions in the church. Each member should be visited, or
written to, by the treasurer at least once each quarter. To
the distant members, a kindly reminder of the sacred and
blessed privileges of co-operating in the work of God in the
faithful payment of the tithes and offerings, with other words
of cheer, will accomplish great results. The treasurer should
never feel it too much trouble to write a receipt for a child,
or any one for the smallest amount. Great results come from
faithful labor done by church treasurers. They need to
pray much over their work. The church should uphold the
hands of the officers in doing faithful work.
     6. Moses, having been raised from the dead (Jude 9), is •
chosen to represent the character of all that will come out of
the grave to receive immortality at the first resurrection.
Elias is the chosen example of all those who will be trans-
lated. These two characters are types of all that will ever
enter heaven. We should study their lives, for they are set
forth as examples.

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that We will sena
               forth laborers into His harvest.-

                             Notes.
    1. On the day of Pentecost, the disciples were endued with
power from on high. This wonderful refreshing and baptism
of the Holy Ghost was the "early," or "former rain." A similar
outpouring of the Holy Ghost will fall upon the remnant peo-
ple of God. This is called the "latter rain." This latter re-
freshing will be as wonderful in power and results as the
early rain was on the day of Pentecost. This is the burden
of Joel's second chapter. In verse 1, the prophet says: "Blow
ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy moun-
tain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day
of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand." In verse 12, the
Lord pleads, "Turn ye even to Me with all your heart," and in
verse 23 He gives the result.
    2. The inheritance and the promises are to the obedient.
In these days, we may ask in assurance for the gift of the
Spirit only as we endeavor to walk in every command and
ordinance of God. In Malachi 3:10, the Lord makes faithful-
ness in rendering His own to Him the test of readiness to
receive the fulness of blessing. This is but one obligation,
of course, but the waiting church must not be found wanting
in any wise, and many will be cheated out of the blessings
of the latter rain by neglect to heed God's Word concerning
tithes and offerings. It is the divinely appointed means for
carrying the last message to the world as the final harvest
is ripened. There is a reason for lack of power, and for
dearth of means to enter the mission fields:—
    "Upon what ground may we claim the full and rich prom-
ises of God? We can claim them only when we have ful-
filled the conditions prescribed in His Word. Have you robbed
God in tithes and offerings? What treasure have you been
laying up in heaven by giving to the Lord His own? Look
at the days and weeks and months of the past, and see if your
life service has not been one long, complicated robbery of
God, because you have failed to remember Him, and have
left eternity out of your reckoning.
    "Great objects are accomplished by this system; for if one
and all accept it, each is made a vigilant and faithful treasurer
for God; and there would be no want of means to carry for-
ward the great work of sounding the last message of warning
to the world. The treasury will be full if all adopt this sys-
tem, and contributors will not be the poorer."—Testimonies
 for the Church, No. 24, pages 83, 84.
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers in4o His harvest."
