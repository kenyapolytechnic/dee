        The Conflict Between
         Capital and Labor
         This new book, by E. T. Russell, treats upon
    a subject concerning which every one should become
    intelligent. The various organizations are reaching
    out and rapidly embracing all classes of people, trades
    and professions, and sooner or later we must meet
    the question face to face. Then we must know
    where to stand and how to stand.
         The author candidly considers both sides of this
    great question, setting forth not only facts and figures,
    but divinely revealed principles to guide us right.    A
    good book for your friends and neighbors.

              LESSON I.—Nature of Man.
                       APRIL 1, 1905.
                          Questions.
   1. In whose image was man created? Gen. 1:26, 27.
   2. How was man created? What was given him?
Gen. 2 :7.
   3. Was this "breath of life" limited to man alone?
Gen. 7:21, 22; Eccl. 3:19.
   4. To what was man given free access? Gen. 2:16, 17.
   5. From what did sin separate him? Why was he
shut away from the tree of life? Gen. 3 :22-24. Note 1.
   6. What is man by nature? Job 4:17; Rom.. 5 :12.
   7. To what is his life compared? James 4:14.
   8. Who only has immortality? 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; 1:17.
Note 2.
   9. How has immortality been brought within the
reach of man? 2 Tim. 1 :9, 10.
  10. What is necessary on the part of man to obtain

   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.

  11. When will it be received? 1 Cor. 15:51-53.
Note 3.
  12. What was the mission of Christ to this earth?
John 10:10. Note 4.
  13. Who only have eternal life? John 3 :36.
  14. To whom must we come for life? John 5 :40 ;
6:68.
  15. What is this eternal life called in Rom. 6 :23?
  16. In the immortal state, to what will man again
have free access? Rev. 2 :7 ; 22 :14.
                             Notes.
   1. God did not purpose to perpetuate sin throughout eter-
nity, therefore when man sinned be was shut away from the
tree of life. None of the human family has ever passed this
cherubim and flaming sword sent to guard the way to the
tree of life, so there is not an immortal sinner on earth.
    2. The words from which "soul," "spirit," etc., are translated
occur some seventeen hundred times in their different forms
in the Bible; but not in a single instance do we find it stated
that the soul is immortal, or never-dying. Immortality is
an attribute inherent only with God, who dwells in light
unapproachable.
    3. Note that it is through the Gospel that both life and
immortality are brought to light. We are exhorted to lay hold
of life. 1 Tim. 6:12. The believer has life now through faith.
John 3:36. But the life we receive by faith we retain by faith.
If we lose our faith, we lose this life also. The gift of im-
mortality will be bestowed upon the overcomer at the resur-
rection of the just.
    4. The mission of Christ to this earth was to bring life to
man, who, by reason of transgression, had been shut away
from the tree of life. He offers to become a tree of life to
all who will believe. Nothing could more effectually rot
the Son of God of His glory than to teach that man possesses
by nature an immortal soul, and is capable of an eterna
existence independent of faith in a Redeemer. Were thif
so, the mission of Christ to give life would have been in vain
We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent o
                         our field.

         LESSON 11.-The State of the Dead.
                        APRIL 8, 1905.

6         SARBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

  15. Under whose dominion are the dead held? Jer.
31 :15-17 ; 'John 5:28, 29.
  16. When will the righteous be gathered home? John
14:1-3; Matt. 24:31.
                            Notes.
   1. The Lord warned man that the penalty for sin was
death. Satan plainly contradicted the word of God by stating
that man would not die, but be "as God, knowing gooa and
evil." The doctrine therefore of consciousness in death has
its origin wholly from this declaration of Satan in Eden.
To make good his statement, "Ye shall not die," he has filled
the world with the false idea of an immortal soul which sur-
vives the stroke of death, and continues to live separate
from the body.
    2. The statement concerning Abraham that he was "gath-
ered to his people" could not mean that he went to be with
them in a conscious state of existence, for his ancestors were
all idolaters. Josh. 24:2.
    3. At creation, the Lord breathed into the man whom He
had made the breath of life. In death the process is re-
versed. The Lord takes from every living creature that which
was given at creation, viz., the breath, and death results. Ps.
104:29. But that which the Lord takes from man at death
was not a conscious entity prior to the time man received it;
neither is it after death.

    2. What precious promise is made to those who sleep
in the grave? Hos. 13:14; Isa. 26:19.
    3. How certain is the resurrection? 1 Cor. 15:13-16.

of the righteous dead? Verses 17, 18.

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

John 11 :23, 24. What does He proclaim Himself to be?
Verse 25.
    5. How many will hear His voice? John 5 :28, 29.
    6. How many general resurrections are brought to
view in the Word? Luke 14 :13, 14; Acts 24 :14, 15 ;
Rev. 20:5. Note 2.
    7. What period of time will elapse between these two
resurrections? Rev. 20 :5.
    8. When will the righteous dead be raised? 1 Thess.
4 :13-16.
    9. With what body will they come forth? 1 Cor.
15:42-44, 51-54.
   10. After what will it be fashioned? Phil. 3 :20, 21.
Note 3.
   11. Who will gather them into the garner of heaven?

   12. With what are those who mourn to be comforted?
1 Thess. 4 :16-18 ; Jer. 31 :15-17 ; Matt. 2:16-18.
   13. When will the wicked be raised? Rev. 20 :5, 7, 8.
   14. With what bodies are they raised? Note 5.
   15. When the righteous saints awake, what will they
do? Isa. 26 :19 ; 1 Cor. 15:55.
   16. What will be their happy condition? Ps. 17:15.
                           Notes.
   1. This promise is one Jesus has sent back to death-
stricken humanity since He ascended to the throne of His
Father. How comforting the thought that though Satan may
lock our loved one within the portals of his prison-house,
the tomb, the key is in the hands of our Redeemer. Jesus
went into the stronghold of the enemy and conquered, bring-
ing in triumph from the tomb the key of death, and thus
assuring deliverance to every believing captive.
       The needs of the cause of God are world-wide.
8         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

    2. The first resurrection is that of the just, the holy and
righteous only. None of the wicked dead will have a part
in this resurrection. They live in the second resurrection.
    o. Eze. 37:1-14 should he studied in connection with this
subject. While this scripture perhaps primarily applies to
the condition of ancient Israel, it is no doubt also a portrayal
of the final resurrection of the righteous.
    4. "Caught up to meet the Lord in the air." In life, angels
ever attend God's people. Ps. 34:7. When the Lord comes,
all the holy angels will come with Him. His voice will pierce
the silent tomb and awake to immortality the righteous dead.
As they come from their dusty beds, the angels will "gather"
them for the garner on high. How glorious indeed will it
be to be "caught up" by an angel escort to meet the Life-
giver in the air. This is the Christian's hope.
    5. "Then Jesus and all the retinue of holy angels, and all
the redeemed saints, left the city. The angels surrounded
their Commander, and escorted Him on His way, and the
train of redeemed saints followed. Then, in terrible, fearful
majesty, Jesus called forth the wicked dead; and they came
up with the same feeble, sickly bodies that went into the
grave. What a spectacle! What a scene! At the first resur-
rection all came forth in immortal bloom; but at the second
the marks of the curse are visible on all."—Early Writings,
page 151.

Note 3.

31; Rev. 20:9.

10        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

                              Notes.
    1. The wicked are "alienated" from the life of God, and,
consequently, without hope. Having chosen death, their names
have no place in the "book of life." The life of God is
eternal, and this is the life upon which all are earnestly ex-
horted to lay hold of by faith. 1 Tim. 6:12.
    2. The fire which consumed the cities of the plains is
said to be "eternal," not because burning forever, but because
its effects are eternal. It wrought an everlasting destruction
upon these cities. They will appear no more forever..
    3. Ti the burning of the "fat of lambs," In connection
with the sanctuary service, the children of Israel had an
object lesson of what will be the final end of sin.
    4. The wicked are not now being punished. They will
not receive their reward until after the final, investigative
judgment. At the close of the 1,000 years, they will receive
the wages of sin which they have chosen. A careful study
of the services connected with the cleansing of the sanctuary,
and the placing of sin upon the head of the scapegoat, will
shed much light upon the auestion of when sinners will re-
ceive their reward. See Leviticus 16.
    5. There will not exist throughout the unnumbered ages
of eternity a seething lake of fire and brimstone in which
millions of lost souls will suffer unspeakable torture and blas-
pheme God forever. No such terrible blot will remain to mar
the handiwork of God. The lost will receive that which they
have chosen—death. Every rebel voice will be stilled in the
realms of the second death, and not a discordant note be
heard thiliugh the eternal ages to mar the universal harmony
of heaven.

        LESSON V. Some Questions Considered.
                   APRIL 29, 1905.
    Note.—From the Scripture studied in previous lessons, it is
very clear that man is mortal. Being shut away from the tree
of life, and alienated from the life of God, his only hope rests
in the resurrection of the dead, and the gift of immortality
when the Life-giver comes. This is the united testimony of
the Bible. There are a few texts, however, which, to the
casual student, may seem to conflict with the general tenor
of inspiration. One lesson is devoted to a study of a •few of
these texts, that the complete harmony of the Word may be
clearly seen.
             Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.

                         Questions.
    1.  What  request  did  the thief make on the cross?
When did he ask to be remembered? Luke 23 :42.
    2. What reply did Jesus make? Verse 43.
    3. When will Jesus come in His kingdom? Matt.
25 :31.
    4. When will the saints enter the kingdom? Matt.
13:40-43; 24:30, 31. Note 1.
    5. What is said of the fire which consumes the wicked?
Matt. 3 :11, 12.
    6. Must a fire which is unquenchable necessarily burn
forever? Jer. 17:27. Note 2.
    7. What other figure is used to denote the extinction
of the wicked? Mark 9 :43-48. Note 3.
    8. Into what kind of punishment will the wicked go?
Matt. 25 :46.
    9. What is the reward of sin? Rom. 6:23. Note 4.
  10. For whom was the lake of fire originally prepared?
Matt. 25 :41.
   11. How will it be kindled? What will be its effect
upon the wicked? Rev. 20 :9, 10. Note 5.
   12. To whom does the spirit return at death? Eccl.
12 :7. Note 6.
   13. Does the fact that Elijah appeared on the mount
of transfiguration denote a conscious existence in death?
 Matt. 17:1-9. Note 7.
                             Notes.
   1. Note the faith of the dying thief. In this dark hour he
saw in the One who was hanging on the cross the Redeemer
of men; he saw Him as a King. He looked by faith into
the future, and saw the Saviour a victor over every foe and
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
12        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON OUARTERLY.

in possession of His glorious kingdom. The thief asked that
at that time, and not on the day upon which he made the
request, he might not be forgotten.
    That he was not with Christ the day he was crucified
is apparent for several reasons. (1) Jesus did not ascend
to Paradise that day (John 20:19). (2) There is no proba-
bility that the thief died that day, for Pilate marveled that
Jesus was so soon dead (Mark 15:43, 44), and the legs of
the thieves were broken for the purpose evidently that they
might not escape when taken from the cross, which would
have been unnecessary if they had been already dead. An
error in punctuation which appears in the text, placing the
comma before, instead of after, the word "to-day," is responsible
for any apparent contradiction of other scriptures. Properly
punctuated, the text would read as follows: "Verily I say
unto thee to-day, thou shalt be with Me in Paradise." The
following excellent note, taken from Rotherham's translation
of the New Testament, in favor of this punctuation, makes
the matter clear: "It is left for the reader to determine
whether the words 'this day' should be joined (a) with the
former part of the sentence, or (b) with the latter. In
favor of (a) may be urged: (1) The fact that semeron, 'this
day,' does not always stand first in the clause to which it
belongs (see Luke 2:11; 5:26; 22:34; Acts 20:26; 22:3; 24:21;
26:29); (2) that being essentially a demonstrative word, it
will bear any reasonable stress which may be laid upon it,
whether it be placed before or after the words which it quali-
fies; (3) that it is far from meaningless if regarded as be-
longing to the opening words of asservation, 'Thou dost ask
to be remembered then; verily thou art assured now. As
on this day of My weakness and shame, thou hast faith to
ask, I this day have authority to answer;' (4) that the latter
part of the verse is thus left free to refer to the very matter
of the supplicant's request, 'Thou dost ask to be remembered
when I come in My kingdom; thou shalt be remembered then,
and with distinguished favor; thou shalt be in My kingdom;
shalt be with Me in the very Paradise of My kingdom, in
the garden of the Lord."
    2. It is not stated that the fire will burn to all eternity,
but simply that it is "unquenchable," a term used to signify
only destructive fire. Being kindled by Jehovah, no power
can extinguish it. It will burn until that upon which it
preys has been consumed
    3. The expression, "worm dieth not," is a figure expressive
            Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                   13
of the most complete destruction. The word translated "hell"
in the passage is from the Greek word gehenna, which is de-
fined by Greenfield as follows: "Gehenna, the Valley of Hin-
nom, south of Jerusalem, once celebrated for the horrid wor-
ship of Moloch, and afterwards polluted with every species.
of filth, as well as the carcasses of animals and dead bodies
of malefactors; to consume which, in order to avert the pesti-
lence which such a mass of corruption would occasion, con-
stant fires were kept burning."
    That which the fire did not consume, the worm would
seize upon and devour. The figure here used is borrowed
from Isa. 51:6-8; 66:24. Dr. Boothroyd translates Isa. 51:6-8
as follows:—
    "Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the
earth beneath; .for the heavens shall, vanish away like smoke,
and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that
dwell therein shall die like an insect; but My salvation shall
be forever, and My righteousness shall not be abolished. Fear
ye not the reproach of men, and be not afraid of their re-
vilings, for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and
 the worm shall eat them like wool, but My righteousness
shall be forever, and My salvation from generation to genera-
 tion." The figure here used denotes complete destruction
and extinction of being.
     4. The wicked truly will receive everlasting punishment.
 It will continue as long as the reward of the righteous. But
 the punishment is death, not eternal torture. We frequently
 speak of "capital punishment," meaning death. Their pun-
 ishment will be the second death, a death from which there
 is no resurrection.
     5. Note that this fire "devours," literally "eats up," the
 wicked. The terms "for ever and ever" here employed in no
 way contradict this. That they are sometimes used to denote
 absolute eternity there is no doubt. There is as little doubt
 that they are as frequently used to denote limited duration.
 See Jonah 2:6; Ex. 21:1-6; 1 Chron. 28:4; 2 Kings 5:27.
     6. The spirit, or breath, of all, both righteous and wicked,
 are here said to return to God. If this meant a conscious
 existence, it would place all, both righteous and wicked, around
 the throne of God, which would be universal salvation. The
 spirit returns to God in the same sense in which it came from
 Him, and is no more a conscious entity after returning than
  before being received by man.

of those who will be translated into the kingdom at the com-

peared as a representative of all who will be raised from
the dead at the appearing of Christ. The Saviour here gave

30, 31; 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
                            Notes.
   1. Through a belief in the immortality of the soul, many
have been led to believe that angels are the spirits of the
dead. That this belief is erroneous is evident from the fact
that angels existed before man, or even this world, was created.
   2. "I have seen the tender love that God has for His
people, and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints
with their wings spread about them. .bach saint had an at-
tending angel. If the saints wept through discouragement,
or were in danger, the angels that ever attend them would
fly quickly upward to carry the tidings, and the angels in
the city would cease to sing. Then Jesus would commission
another angel to descend to encourage, watch over, and try
to keep them from going out of the narrow path; but if
they did not take heed to the watchful care of these angels,
and would not be comforted by them, but continued to go
astray, the angels would look sad and weep. They would
bear the tidings upward, and all the angels in the city
would weep, and then with a loud voice say, Amen. But
if the saints fixed their eyes upon the prize before them,
and glorified God by praising Him, then the angels in the
city would touch their golden harps and sing with a loud

voice, Alleluiah! and the heavenly arches would ring with
their lovely songs."—Early Writings, pages 31, 32.
    3. As heavenly angels attend us all through life, though
unseen to us, they doubtless make a faithful record of all the
acts of our lives, and in the judgment will be there minister-
ing unto Him who sits as Judge. The very angel who made
the record of your life will be there to bear witness to its
truthfulness.

those who yield to their influence? Luke 4:33, 35, 41;

                            Notes.
   1. Satan was one of the covering cherubs, created for
this very position, and stood next to Christ in position and
power. He was the leader of the heavenly choir ("Spirit of
Prophecy," Vol. 1, page 28). He allowed pride to enter into
his heart, and, becoming jealous of Christ, and dissatisfied
with the position given him by the Creator, he sought to
exalt himself above God. It is impossible to explain or fully
understand how sin entered into his heart; this is the mystery
of sin. But the fact remains nevertheless. Having whispered
his disaffection among the angelic host, he succeeded in lead-
ing almost one-third of the loyal angels into rebellion (Rev.
12:4), who with him were cast out of heaven ("Spirit
of Prophecy," vol. 1, page 22). These angels, under the lead-
ership of that master mind who led them into ruin, are all en-
gaged in deceiving souls. As the end grows nearer, they be-
come more active in their warfare, till all the world, except
a remnant whose names are in the book of life, comes at
last under their control.
   2. Note that Satan began his work of rebellion against
God in this earth by questioning what Jehovah has said,
and creating doubt in the mind as to the faithfulness of
His Word. His method had in no way changed. Every sug-
gestion, no matter from what source it may come, which
tends to in any way weaken faith in God's Word, is inspired by
Satan, who well knows that his attacks are vain so long
as we hold fast to the Scriptures of truth.
"Lift up. your eyei and look on the fields; for they are white
                      already to harvest."

    1. To what will many seek in the last days? 1 Tim.
4:1; Isa. 8:19.
    2. What name is given to this so-called communica-
tion with the dead?-Spiritualism or Spiritism. Note 1.
    3. Can the dead communicate with the living? Eccl.

    4. What deceptive agency is at work? 2 Car. 11:14;
Rev. 16:14. Note 2.

2 Tim. 3:8. Note 3.

to be attributed? Rev. 16:14.
    7. Was Spiritualism seen in ancient times? Lev.
19 :31.
    8. How did the Lord regard those who allied them-
selves with it? Lev. 20:6.
    9. What severe penalty was executed against spirit

he go? 1 Sam. 28 :6-11.
   12. Give an account of this ancient spiritualistic
seance. Verses 11-20. Note 4.
  13. How did the Lord regard this? 1 Chron. 10 :13, 14.
   14. How is the manner of Satan's working at the time
      The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.

of the coming of Christ described? 2 Thess. 2:8-10.
Note 5.
  15. Wherein is our only safety? Acts 20:29-32; Ps.
119:105.
                              Notes.
    1. Spiritualism is defined as follows:—
    "The belief that the spirits of the dead in various ways
communicate with and manifest their presence to men, usually
through the agency of a person called a medium."—Standard
Dictionary.
    "The very central truth of Spiritualism is the power and
possibility of spirit return, under certain conditions, to com-
municate with those in the material form."—N. F. Ravlin,
Spiritualist lecturer.
    2. The Lord told Adam that the penalty for eating of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil was aeath. Gen.
2:17. Satan contradicted this statement, and said, "Ye shall
not surely die." Chap. 3:4. But as a consequence of man's
transgression, death entered into the world (Rom. 5:12), and
Satan's lie was unmasked. But Satan, to make appear true
his falsehood uttered in Eden, instilled into the mind of man
the idea of inherent immortality and consciousness in death.
Through a belief in his statement, he has caused it to be
taught that what seems to be death is not death, but merely
transition; that the soul—the real thinking man—lives right
on. Then, in the Spiritualistic seance, fallen angels, trans-
formed into angels of light, appear, and claim to be the spirits
of the dead from the world of light, and thus aid on the
great deception.
     3. When Moses and Aaron appeared before Pharaoh by
direction of the Lord, and with a special message, a miracle-
working agency was brought forward to resist their work.
The sorcerers and magic ans (the spiritual mediums of that
 time), two of whom were Jannes and Jambres, were called
in, and by satanic agency wrought an apparent .   -miracle. This
same miracle-working agency will appear in the earth in the
last days to hinder the message of God. Error ever seeks to
entrench itself behind forms, and produces, as proof that it
 is right, some supernatural manifestation. Truth sets forth
 as the credentials of its divine origin the plain statements
 of the Bible, and is ever willing to trust alone in these.
        The needs of the cause of God are world-wide,
20        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

    4. Samuel was dead and buried at Ramah (1 Sam. 28:3),
and, consequently, could not be present on this occasion.
That no heavenly being was present is clear from the fact
that, because of his rebellious course, the Lord had refused to
answer Saul (verse 6), and with this dark seance of Satan
he could have nothing to do. One of the fallen angels, trans-
formed into an angel of light, appeared, personating the aged
prophet. In modern seances tne same scenes are again en-
acted.
    5. "I saw the rapidity with which this delusion was spread-
ing. A train of cars was shown me, going with the speed
of lightning. The angel bade me look carefully. I fixed
my eyes on the train. It seemed that the whole world was
on board; that there could be none left. Said the angel,
`They are binding in bundles ready to burn.' Then he showed
me the conductor, who looked like a stately, fair person, whom
all the passengers looked up to and reverenced. I was per-
plexed, and asked my attending angel who it was. Said he,
'It is Satan. He is the conductor, in the form of an angel
of light. He has taken the world captive. They are given
over to strong delusions, to believe a lie, that they may be
damned. This agent, the next highest in order to him, is
the engineer; the other of his agents are employed in different
offices as he may need them, and they are all going with
lightning speed to perdition.' "—Early Writings, page 4 (sup-
plement).


             LESSON IX.—The Holy Spirit.
                       MAY 27, 1905.

away? John 16:7.
   2. What is Its work? Verse 8; John 14:26. Note 1.

27; John 3:1-8.
   4. What is the condition of those who are without
the Holy Spirit? Rom. 8:6-9.
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future iieriod."

   7. What were the disciples bidden to do? Luke 24:49.
   8. How long did they wait? Acts 2:1-4. Note 2.
    9. What marvelous manifestations were seen as a re-

  10. Of what was this a fulfilment? Verses 12-21;
Joel 2:28, 29.
  11. Will there be another such season of spiritual re-
freshing? Joel 2:23.
  12. What comes with the endowment of the Holy
Spirit? Acts 1 :8 ; Eph. 3 :16.
  13. Name the fruits of the Spirit. Gal. 5 :22, 23.
  14. What admonition is given? Eph. 4:30.
                            Notes.
   I. Some conscientious souls are in distress at times, fear-
ing that because of sin the Spirit of God has been grieved
from them forever. But notice that the first work of the
Holy Spirit when It comes to the heart is to bring conviction
of sin. Those who feel a real sorrow and conviction for sin
may rest assured that the tender Spirit of God is still striv-
ing with them.
   2. "All who were fully identified as disciples of Christ and
associated with the apostles as evangelists, assembled together
at Jerusalem. They put away all differences. They con-
tinued with one accord in prayer and supplication, that they
might receive the fulfilment of the promise of the Holy
Spirit; for they were to preach the Gospel in the demonstra-
tion of the Spirit and in the power of God. . . . This is
the very course that should be pursued by those who act
a part in the work of proclaiming the coming of the Lord
in the clouds of heaven; for a people are to be prepared to
stand in the great day of God."—Gospel Workers, page 370.

         LESSON X.-The Gifts of the Spirit.
                 JUNE 3, 1905.
                         Questions.
    1. Concerning what are we admonished to not be igno-
rant? 1 Cor. 12:1.
    2. What did the Lord give to men when He ascended?
Eph. 4:8.
    3. Where did He place these gifts? 1 Cor. 12 :28.
    4. Will these gifts ever cease? 1 Cor. 13 :8.
    5. When will they cease? Verses 9, 10.
    6. Are all the gifts of the Spirit the same? 1 Cor.

    7. Name these gifts. 1 Cor. 12:8-10; Eph. 4:11.
    8. How will these gifts affect the church? Eph.
4:11-16.
    9. To what is the church, with all these gifts doing
their work, compared? 1 Cor. 12:22-27.
   10. Does the Bible recognize any difference in these
gifts? 1 Cor. 12:31.
   11. What is a most important gift? 1 Cor. 14:1, 39.
Note 1.
   12. Whom is the gift of prophecy especially to bene-

          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                  23
                             Notes.
    1. The gift of prophecy is important because it teaches
God's will, and all the other gifts in their fulness are de-
pendent upon its reception. Only as the Spirit of prophecy
is confirmed in us may we hope to have all the gifts. 1 Cor.
1:4-8.
    2. So long as the Spirit of God is in the earth, the gifts
of the Spirit will be seen in a greater or less degree. In the
closing days of earth's history, when the power of Satan will
be manifested in no ordinary manner, it is reasonable, as
well as scriptural, that the operations of the Holy Spirit will
be witnessed in a special manner, and the gifts of the Spirit
be revealed in the church. ' God placed these gifts in the
church "for the perfecting a the saints, unto the work of
ministering unto the building up of the body of Christ,"
and they will remain there until the church militant becomes
the church triumphant. Note that among other gifts in the
church is that of prophecy. As this is the greatest gift
 (1 Cor. 14:1, 39), we may expect that it will be the leading
gift.


          LESSON X1.—The Gift of Prophecy.
                       JUNE 10, 1905.
                          Questions.
   1. How did the Lord communicate with man before
the fall? Gen. 3 :9.
   2. How has He communicated with man since the
fall? Heb. 1:1, 2.
   3. How does the Lord reveal Himself to those who
have the prophetic gift? Num. 12 :6.
    4. Against what are we cautioned? Deut. 13 :1-3 ;
Matt. 24:24. Note 1.
    5. How may we distinguish the true from the false?
Matt. 7 :16-20.
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."
24        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

    6. According to what will a true prophet speak?
Isa. 8 :20.
    7. What is the condition of a true prophet in vision?
Num. 24:4, 16; Dan. 10:8-11, 16, 17. Note 2.
    8. How did the prophets of old speak? 2 Peter
1:20, 21.
    9. How did they communicate to the people that which
was revealed unto them? Dan. 7:1; Jer. 51 :60, 61.
   10. When there is no vision, how are the people af-
fected? Prov. 29:18; Lam. 2;9.
   11. To whom did Israel anciently go for counsel?
Judges 4:4, 5.
   12. What signs will follow believers till the end?
Mark 16:17, 18.
   13. Will there be an exercise of the prophetic gift in
the last days? Joel 2 :28, 29.
   14. Were there prophets in the early church? Acts
11:27, 28; 13 :1; 21:8, 9.
   15. Will the gift of prophecy be in the remnant church?
Rev. 12:17; 19:10. Note 3.
   16. What cheering promise is made to those who be-
lieve the Lord's prophets? 2 Chron. 20: 20.
                              Notes.
   1. Counterfeit money being in circulation in no way dis-
counts the genuine currency; neither will the fact that false
prophets are in the earth in any way affect the work of the
true prophets. The fact that we are warned against false
prophets is evidence that the manifestations of the genuine
will be in the earth. If all were to be counterfeit, the Lord
could have said, "Beware of prophets."
   2. in vision the prophet of the Lord loses his own strength.
His breath also is taken away. In this condition, under the
"This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                 25
direct control of the Holy Spirit, are made such revelations
as the Lord is pleased to make. They speak as they are
moved by the Holy Spirit. True prophets in vision always
have their eyes open.
   3. In the life and work of Mrs. E. G. White, whose labors
have been identified with this message from its rise, we have
the clearest evidence that there is manifested the gift of
prophecy as truly as in servants of the Lord in the past.
The gift stands every scriptural test, and, through all the
perplexities which have attended our work, this gift has been
present to direct and point out the right way. Read care-
fully the chapters written especially upon this subject in
"Rise and Progress of Seventh-day Adventists," by Elder J.
N. Loughborough.

claim? Verse 36. Note 2.
  14. What reply did Philip make? Verse 37.
  15. Where was the rite performed? Verse 38.
  16. How should those walk who have been baptized?
Col. 3:1, 2; Rom. 6:4.
                             Notes.
    1. Many observe the first day of the week as the sabbath
to commemorate the resurrection of Christ. There is no
scriptural authority for this practice. The divinely-appointed
memorial of the resurrection is baptism. Having become dead
to sin, the repentant sinner is buried in the watery grave, and
raised again to walk in newness of life, thus showing his
faith in the One who says, "I am the resurrection and the
life."
    2. The eunuch doubtless knew nothing concerning baptism,
except as Philip revealed it in preaching Christ unto him.
From this it is clearly seen that to fully preach Christ is to
preach baptism and immediately upon receiving Him into
our hearts there will spring up a desire to be buried with
Him in baptism.

                            Notes.
    1. "There was a strife among them, which of them should
be accounted the greatest. This contention, carried on in
the presence of Christ, grieved and wounded Him. . . .
The request of James and John to sit on the right and left
of Christ's throne had excited the indignation of the others.
That the two brothers should presume to ask for the high-
est position, so stirred the ten that alienation threatened.
. . . When the disciples entered the supper room, their
hearts were full of resentful feelings. Judas pressed next
to Christ on the left side; John was on the right. If there
was a higher place, Judas was determined to have it, and
that place was thought to be next to Christ. And Judas was
a traitor."—Desire of Ages, pages 643, 644.
    2. "When the Saviour's hands were bathing those [Judas')
soiled feet, and wiping them with the towel, the heart of
Judas thrilled through and through with the impulse then
and there to confess his sin."—Id., page 645.
    3. "This ordinance is Christ's appointed preparation for
the sacramental service. While pride, variance, and strife
for supremacy are cherished, the heart can not enter into
fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the
communion of His body and His blood. Therefore it was
that Jesus appointed the memorial of His humiliation to be
first observed."—Id., page 650.
     4. Note the solemn import of the words, "I will not
drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when
I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." The
Saviour has not tasted the wine since that sad hour in the
upper chamber. Neither will He, until at the marriage supper
when He has His redeemed family all home. Then, seated
at that table which is "miles in length," He will gird Himself
and serve them, and drink with them the new wine of the
kingaom. Jesus is looking forward to this time with joy-
ful anticipation, and when He sees His ransomed ones all
safe from the power of sin, then will He indeed "see of the
travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied." Isa. 53:11.
     5. "Nothing corrupted by fermentation, the symbol of sin
and death, could represent the Lamb without blemish and
without spot!"—Desire of Ages, page 653.

                        SPIRITUALISM
     Miracles and Delusions.—The writer of this work believes in the
divine miracle-working power in our day, but discerns also a delusive
false power which is working with cunning subtlety to deceive the un-
wary. The false and the true are coming into keen rivalry, and we
must know the true. This little book tells us how we may try the
spirits, and be saved from every deception.

                  SPIRIT OF PROPHECY
    The Prophetic Gift in the Gospel Church.—This pamphlet of
120 pages, by J. N. Loughborough, treats the subject of the Spirit of
prophecy in the church in a very comprehensive and satisfactory manner.
In Part One is shown how God spake to His people in ancient times,
and also in apostolic times, and how as the result of apostasy in the
church, there has been a lack of the manifestations of His Spirit.
In Part Second is a consideration of facts respecting a manifestation of
the gift of prophecy as connected with the Great Threefold Message
of Revelation 14. Many Bible rules and tests are given by which we
may prove the true.

                             ANGELS
    Angels, Their Nature and Ministry.—We find in the world
to-day indefinite and vague ideas of the character and work of angels,
many believing them to be the spirits of the dead. The object of this
treatise is to show who they are, their character and work.   Part Two
deals with the interesting subject of the Origin and Destiny of Satan.

                   THE HOLY SPIRIT
    Power for Witnessing.—One of the books that is ever fresh and
refreshing to the reader is the one with the above title, because within
its pages are told the actual, live experiences of the work and power of
the Holy Spirit in humanity. It is not so much a work on theory as
of practice, endeavoring to show why we need the Holy Spirit, how it
works and what it will do for us.
    Its two hundred pages are filled with just the practical, hopeful,
and encouraging instruction and experiences that will bring good
cheer and comfort to your heart, and not only fit you for living but
also doing.
