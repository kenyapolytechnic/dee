            LESSON I.—The Rich King.

  11. Give Memucan's answer. Verses 16-20:
  12. What was the result.? Verses 21, 22.
 ,13. With what duty were they evidently acquainted?
Gen. 3 :16 ; Eph. 5:22.
  14. With what duty were they unfamiliar? Eph. 5 :25.
  15.. Give a sure remedy for all dissension between
husband and wife. Eph. 5 :33.
                             Notes.
    r. The visions of the tenth and eleventh chapters of Daniel
were given in the "third year of Cyrus, king of Persia." Dan.
so :s. Therefore, when Gabriel said, "There shall stand up
yet three kings of Persia and the fourth shall be far richer
than they all," he referred to those that followed Cyrus ; namely,
(r) Cambyses, (2) Smerd is, the Impostor, (3) Darius Hys-
taspes, (4) Xerxes the Great.
   2. That Ahasuerus is Xerxes there is sufficient proof. The
two names are identical, the latter being but the Greek form of
the Persian name. Second, the characters of the two men are
alike. Both were impulsive and impassionate. When Xerxes in-
vaded Greece, he scourged the sea for breaking his bridge, and
put to death the engineers because their work did not stand the
storm. In a similarly impulsive manner, Ahasuerus repudiated
his queen, Vashti, because she would not violate the decorum of
her sex. and ordered the massacre of the whole Jewish people
to gratify the malice of Haman. In the third year of the
reign of Xerxes was held an assembly to arrange the Grecian
war. In the third year of the reign of Ahasuerus was held a
great feast and assembly in Shushan the palace (Esther 1 :3).
In the seventh year of his reign, Xerxes returned defeated
from Greece, and consoled himself by the pleasures of the
harem. In the seventh year of his reign, fair, young virgins
were sought for Ahasuerus, and he replaced Vashti by marrying
Esther. The tribute he "laid upon the land and upon the isles
of the sea" (Esther I0:0 may well have been the result of
the expenditure and ruin of the Grecian expedition.

upon which according to oriental fashion, they reclined while

feasting.i•The drinking cups were of gold, although thousands
were given wine, every cup was different in design.
   4. In oriental countries it was not customary for virtuous
women to appear in public unveiled, hence, the command was
unjust. By her refusal, Vashti revealed nobility of soul ; for
she chose to forfeit her position, and perhaps her life, rather
than sacrifice her modesty.


       LESSON IL--Effect of Home Training.
               OCTOBER 14, 1905.
                          Questions.

    1. What measures were taken to secure a queen in
Vashti's place? Esther 2:1-4.
    2. Give Mordecai's place of residence and genealogy.
Verse 5. How long had his people been in captivity?
2 Kings 24:14, 15. Note 1.
    3. Who was. Esther? Esther 2:7.
    4. How was she favored more than the other
maidens? Verses 8, 9.
    5. In what way did Esther show regard for Mor-
decai's .counsel? Verse 10.
   6. In what way did Mordecai show his character as a
foster-father? Verse 11. Note 2.
    7. How was Esther's character shown when her time
came to go before the king? Verse 15. Note 3.
    8. What honor was conferred upon Esther? Verses
17, 18.
    9. What position did Mordecai hold? Verse 19.
Note 4.

We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.

  10. Was Esther subject to her foster-father after she
became queen? Verse 20. Note 5.
  11. Of what was this the fulfilment? Prov. 22 :6.
  12. Mordecai's experience was a fulfilment of what
text? Prov. 29 :17.
  13. How was Mordecai able to save the life of the
king? Esther 2:21-23.
  14. Did Esther take the honor to herself? Verse 22.
                            Notes.
    t. From Mordecai's living in a palace, we might infer that
he occupied some place of trust at this time. The marginal
date for the book of Esther is incorrect. It was formerly thought
that Ahasuerus of this book was Darius I. and the marginal
date was made to correspond. The reign of Xerxes was
between 486 atid 465 B. c. The third year of his reign would
therefore begin in 483 B. c. 'Mordecai was the great grandson
of Kish, the Benjamanife who had been carried away into cap-
tivity by Nebuchadneziar. (
   2. Mordecai realized his obligation as a father to care for
Esther. He did not throw off responsibility when Esther was
taken to the palace, but for one whole year every day, he went
to the palace to inquire "how Esther did, and what should
become of her."
   3. In this, Esther revealed her home training; her wants
were simple; she was content with what was given her. Oh,
that all maidens could only realize that there is no ornament
to compare with youthful beauty, when combined with grace of
character! Esther's beauty was consecrated. Beauty of the
face and person is a valuable ornament, and aids in one's use-
fulness when it is consecrated to God. Consecrated beauty
never makes the possessor vain.
    4. The "gate" was an official seat, a court where decisions
were rendered, as shown by the following quotations : "Execute
the judgment of truth and peace in your gates." Zech. 8 t16.
"They hate him that rebuketh in the gate. .          . They take
a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their

"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

right. . .     [But God said] Hate the evil, and love the
good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the
Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph."
Amos 5 :to-15. See Ruth 4          ; Job 31 :21 ; Prov. 1 :21 ;
22 :22, etc.
   5. Mordecai taught Esther to obey when she was a child,
and being "trained," when old she continued to obey. A father
that has wisdom to properly train his child will ever be her
best counselor.



    LESSON 17I.—The History of Haman's _Family.
                     OCTOBER 21, 1905.
                          Questions.

   1. To what family did Haman belong? Esther 3:1.
   2. Who was Agag? 1 Sam. 15:8.
   3. What relation was Amalek to Esau? Gen. 36 :12.
   4. How was the character of the Amalekites shown
by their attack upon Israel? Dent. 25:17, 18.
   5. How does this compare with Christ's treatment of
the fainting, tired ones? Isa. 40:11; Matt. 9:36
(margin).
   6. Is God's wrath kindled against all who afflict the
weak and feeble? Ex. 22:22-24.
   7. Against whom did the Amalekites raise their hand
when they oppressed the weak? Ex. 17:16 (margin).
   8. What punishment did the Lord pronounce against
Amalek? Ex. 17:14-16.
   9. When were they to receive the punishment? Dent.
25:19.

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON OHARTERLY.

  10. Whom did the Lord commission to destroy the
Amalekites? 1 Sam. 15:1-5. Note 1.
  11. Before attacking the Amalekites, what word was
sent to the Kenites? How did their conduct compare
with that of the Amalekites? 1 Sam. 15 :6.
  12. In destroying only the vile and refuse, did Saul
obey the Lord? .1 Sam. 15 :9-11.
  13. How strong were the Amalekites twenty-three
years later? 1 Sam. 30:1.
  14. Would Haman, the Agagite, ever have lived if
Saul had carried out the command of God?
                           Notes.
   The Lord was lone-suffering, and gave the Amalekites
over four hundred years to reform before He commanded Saul
to destroy them; but they clung to the same nature. They
were ever ready to raise their hand against the poor and weak.
Hainan inherited all the evil tendencies of his race, and
developed the most diabolical scheme of which we have any
record. If God Himself had not interfered in behalf of His
people, every child of God would have been destroyed in one
fatal day. Esther 3.13.


           LESSON IV.—Christian Integrity.
                    OCTOBER 28, 1905.

   1. What position did Haman fill? Esther 3 :1.
   2. What was required of all the king's servants?
Verse 2.
   3. What course did Mordecai pursue? Verse 2.
Note 1.
"The advent message to all the world in this generation"—our
                        watchword.
8         SABBATH-SCUOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.


   4. What question was asked Mordecai? Verse 3.
   5. Of whom was Mordecai a representative? Note 2.
   6. What reason did Mordecai give for not bowing to
Haman? Esther 3 :4. Note 3.
   7. How did Mordecai's conduct affect Haman?
Verse 5.
   S. How will the apostate Protestant world feel toward
those who honor God by keeping His Sabbath? Rev.
13:14, 15. Note 4.
   9. What did Haman determine to do? Esther 3 :6.
  10. Who was the author of the scheme? John 8 :44.
Note 5.

Note 6.

Esther 3 :7. Note 7.
  13. Is their a similar work being carried on to-day?
Note 8.
  14. How many, and what are the reasons Haman
presented to induce the king to consent to the cruel
deed? Esther 3 :8.
  15. Will men in high position unite with the opposers
of God's law in the conflict before us? Ps. 2 :2, 3.
Note 9.
                            Notes.
    T. In all probability, Mordecai showed the usual respect
to the king. Joseph, Daniel, and Nehemiah, all held high posi-
tions in earthly governments, and showed proper respect to their
sovereigns; but Mordecai could not bow to Haman without
dishonoring God; for God had declared "war with Amalek

      "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                     9

from generation to generation." Ex. 17 :16. He also told His
peOple not to "forget it." Deut. 25:19. The evil nature of
Haman would naturally lead him to require more than other
men. He required "reverence." Mordecai "refused to show
him reverence, which belongs only to God."
    2. "The Protestant world to-clay see, in the little company
keeping the Sabbath, a Mordecai in the gate."
    3. This is the first record of Mordecai revealing his nation-
ality. In view of the texts given in Note 1, the fact that
Mordecai was a Jew was sufficierit reason for not bowing to
Haman.
    4. "Satan will excite indignation against the humble minority
who conscientiously refuse to accept popular customs and
traditions."
    5. "Satan instigated the scheme in order to rid the earth
of those who preserve the knowledge of the true God."
    6. "The same masterful mind that plotted against the faithful
in ages past, is still seeking to rid the earth of those who fear
God and keep His law."
    7. According to custom, lots were cast to determine the time
for the destruction of the Jews. The lots were cast in the first
month of the year to select, according to their superstitious
ideas, a propitious and fortunate day for the massacre of the
Jews. While Hainan no doubt would have been glad to have
their destruction take place at an earlier date, he thought him-
self bound to submit to the "Pur" or lot. Perhaps this was a
providence of God in delaying the execution of the Jews, and
give a chance for the nature of the plot to be learned and a
counter-edict issued.      .
    8. "Church and state are now making preparations for the
 future conflict. Protestants are working in disguise to bring
Sunday to the front, as did the Romanists. Throughout the
land, the papacy is piling up her lofty and massive structures
in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions are
to be repeated." "While men are sleeping. Satan is actively
arranging matters so that the Lord's people may not have mercy
or justice. The Sunday movement is now making its way in
darkness. The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many
who 'unite in the movement, do not themselves see whither the
current is tending."

                        watchword.
10        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

   9. "Men of position and reputation will join with the lawless
and the vile to take counsel against the people of God." To
secure popularity and patronage, legislators will yield to the
demand for a Sunday law."
   All the quotations in the above notes were taken from "Tes-
timonies for the Church," Vol. 5, pages 449, 452.

zens? Esther 3 :8.
    2. How will those who honor the Bible Sabbath be
regarded? Rev. 12:17. Note 1.
    3. How widely were the Jews scattered in Haman's
day? Esther 3 :8.
    4. How widely will commandment-keepers be scat-
tered? Rev. 14:6, 9-12.
    5. What special offer caused the king to give his
consent to Haman's decree? Esther 3:9. Note 2.
    6. Will men of wealth give of their means to accom-
plish the destruction of God's people in the near ftiture?
Note 3.
    7. Of what was Haman a type? Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor.
10:11. See lesson 4, note 2.
    8. What union was formed between the king and
Haman? Esther 3:10, 11.
    9. What union in our day will soon be formed?
Note 4.

decai? Esther 3 :12.
  11. Will there be a similar decree used in the last days?
Note 5.
  12. What gave force to the decree in Mordecai's time?
Esther 3 :12 (last clause).
  13. Will the United States government follow the
example of Ahasuerus, and unite with the church in
issuing a decree against God's people? Rev. 13 :14, 15.

   15. How much of the earth was included in the decree?
Esther 3:12.
                            Notes.

   1. "Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as
en mies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints
of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down
the judgments of God upon the earth."—Great Controversy,
page 592.
   2. The value of the Hebraic, Assyrian, and Babylonian talent,
according to the Century and Standard dictionaries, was from
$1,550 to $2,000. Estimating on this basis the sum of "ten
thousand talents of silver" offered by Haman would be from
$15,5oo,000 to $20,00o,000. The above authorities state, how-
ever, that "reliable authorities differ greatly as to all talent
values."
   3. "Wealth, genius. education, will combine to cover them
 (Sabbath-keepers) with contempt."—Testimonies for the
Church, Vol. 5, page 450.
   4. "The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe.
persuade or compel all classes to honor the Sunday."—Great

God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against
the Jews in the time of Esther."—Testimonies for the Church,
Vol. 5, Page 54o.
   6. "By the decree enforcing the institution of the papacy,
in violation of the law of God, our nation will disconnect her-
self fully from righteousness . . . this apostasy [will] be
a sign to us, that the limit of God's forbearance is reached,
that the measure of our nation's iniquity is full, and that the
angel of mercy is about to take her flight, never to return."
—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, page 451.

a crisis? Gen. 45 :4-8.
  14. What expression shows that Mordecai had the
victory before he sent this message to Esther? Esther
4:14.
  15. Give another instance where the victory was gained

from those who honor the law of God, there will be, in differ-
ent lands, a simultaneous movement for their destruction. As
the time appointed in the decree draws near, the people will
conspire to root out the hated sect. It will be determined in
one night to strike a decisive blow, which shall entirely silence
the voice of dissent and reproof."—Great Controversy, Chap.
40, first paragraph.

  15. Give the advice of Zeresh and his friends. Verse
14 (first clause).
  16. What did Haman do? Verse 14 (last clause).
                            Notes.
   i. The Jews had been praying for Esther, and in answer
to their prayers, Esther was led to defer her request until
the Lord had prepared the way for her request to be granted.
   2. An invitation to Esther's banquet meant much. In Ori-
ental countries it is very unusual for ladies to dine with any
man, except those of their own faMily. Haman had reason
to be proud of receiving an invitation to the queen's banquet.

destruction of Haman's family by the Jews? Esther
6:13.
                             Notes.
    i. Haman was like the wicked in the last days. "In some
places, before the time for the decree to • be executed, the
wicked rushed upon the saints to slay them; but angels, in the
form of men of war, fought for them."—Early Writings,
page 143.
    2. Haman, filled with shame and hatred, could but see in
it the beginning of his downfall. Mordecai, meekly and humbly
trusting God, must have taken it as an evidence that God had
answered prayer for the deliverance of the Jews.
    3. Mordecai was not filled with pride; he humbly returned, to
his post of duty at the king's gate; but Haman,' unfitted for
business, returned to his home.
         The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.

couches while dining.
   2. Faces of criminals are,covered, and the servants in cov-
ering Haman's face, pronounced his doom. He had covered his
own head in shame in the morning. Esther 6 :12.
   3. It is possible that Harbonah was the same chamberlain
that had been sent to Haman's house to call him to the ban-
quet, and the great gallows, 75 feet high must have attracted
his attention, and caused him to inquire why it had been
built. Hence his suggestion to hang Haman thereon.

                             Notes.
    T. "In every quarter, companies of armed men, urged on by
hosts of evil angels, are preparing for the work of death."—
Great Controversy, Chap. 40, paragraph 2.
   2. "I saw the saints leaving the cities and villages, and
associating together in companies, and living in the most sol-
itary places. . . . I saw a writing, copies of which were scat-
tered in different parts of the land, giving orders that unless the
saints should yield their peculiar faith, give up the Sabbath,
and observe the first day of the week, the people were at
liberty, after a certain day, to put them to death."—Early
Writings, Time of Trouble, page 143.
   3. "As the saints left the cities and villages, they were pur-
sued by the wicked, who sought to slay them. But the swords
that were raised to kill God's people broke and fell as power-
less as a straw. Angels of God shielded the saints."—Early
Writings, page 145.
   4. "It is at midnight that God manifests His power for the
deliverance of His people. . . . The voice of God is heard
from heaven declaring the day and hour of Jesus' coming and
delivering the everlasting covenant to His people." Isa. 3o:
27-30; Great Controversy, pages 636, 640.
. 5. "Their faces, so lately pale, anxious, and haggard, are
now aglow with wonder, faith, and love."—Great Controversy
page 639.
   6. When God's voice declares the hour of Jesus' coming,
and turns the captivity of His people, it will be too, late for
any to repent, but the wicked will acknowledge that God is just,
and His people righteous. When the decree of Mordecai turned
the captivity of the Jews, there was an opportunity for repent-
ance, and many became Jews. But before God's final deliverance
of His people, the destiny of every soul will have been fixed.
Rev. 22:11.

                     DECEMBER 23, 1905.
                            Questions.
   1. Name two errors that Satan is using to bring the
people under his power. Gen. 3 :4 ; Rev. 13 :14. Note 1.
  The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
22         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

    2. What is accomplished by the first? What by the
second?

16:13, 14. Note 2.

people? Isa. 33:16. Note 3.
    5. How may we know when to leave the cities?
Note 4.
    6. Have we an example of this in the past? Luke
21 :20, 21.
    7. What should be our attitude? Luke 12:35, 36.
    8. What will those who are ready for the Lord have
done, prior to His coming? Luke 12:33. Note 5.
    9. What evil does the Lord behold? Eccl. 5 :13, 14.
  10. What is one object of Satan? What warning is
given? 1 Tim. 6:9-11. Note 6.
  11. Notwithstanding the severe persecution before the
people of God, need they be discouraged? Ps. 91 :1-11 ;
Rev. 3 :10.
  12. What will befall the wicked? Isa. 8:21, 22 ; Ps.
11 :6 ; Jer. 25 :29-33.
  13. Will the reversal of the positions of Haman and
Mordecai he repeated in the experience of the righteous
and the wicked in the last days?
  14. Was Haman exposed to the view of all, as he
hung on the gallows? Esther 5 :14 ; 7:10. What will
be the fate of the devil and his followers? Eze. 28 :17, 18.
  15. How was Mordecai honored? Esther 10: 2, 3.
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He zerill send

Will the faithful ones out of the last generation be given
a place near the king? Rev. 14:4; 7:15.
                             Notes.
   i. "Through two great errors—the immortality of the soul,
and Sunday sacredness—Satan will bring the people under his
deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of Spiritual-
ism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome."—Great
Controversy, page 588.
   2. "The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in
stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of
Spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands
with the Roman power, and under the influence of this three-
fold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome, in
trampling on the right of conscience."—Great Controversy,
Page 588.
   3. "The time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples,
we shall be forced to seek a refuge in desolate and solitary
places."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, page 464.
   4. "As the decree issued by the various rulers of Christendom
against commandment keepers shall withdraw the protection of
government, and abandon them to those who desire their
destruction, the people of God will lice from the cities and vil-
lages. and associate together in companies, dwelling in the most
desolate and solitary places."—Great Controversy, pages 625, 626.
Also read Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, pages 464, 465.
   5. "The members of the church should individually hold
themselves and all their possessions upon the altar of Goa. Now,
as never before, the Saviour's admonition is applicable: 'Sell
that ve have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax
not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not.' . .    Those
who are fastening their means in large houses, in lands, in
worldly enterprises, are saying by their actions, 'God can not
have it : I want it for myself.' They have bound up their one
talent in a napkin and hid it in the earth. There is cause for
such to be alarmed."—Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5,
page 465.
    6. "Satan will, if possible, prevent them (the people of God)
from obtaining a preparation to stand in that day. He will so
arrange affairs as to hedge up their way. entangle them with

to return to Jerusalem. Ezra I:I-11. Only 50.000 returned at

chose to remain there, rather than face difficulties in rebuilding
the work of the Lord.
    2. "The love of Christ does not seem to constrain those who
profess His name for a death-like slumber is upon the human
agents. and the work is hindered by failure of the human to

                An Open Letter
Dear Fellow-workers:---1
   At the last General Conference, careful attention was given
to the continuation of the missionary campaign entered upon
last year. As a result, the following recommendations were
unanimously adopted:—
                      MISSIONARY CAMPAIGN
   "Realizing that multitudes are       the valley of decision,'
and that the time has fully come when the Master pleads with
every child of His •to 'go out quickly into the streets and
lanes of the city,' and 'into the highways and hedges,' to bid
the hungry and perishing to the marriage feast,—
   "63. We recommend, That the great missionary campaign
entered upon last year be strengthened, deepened, and enlarged
into a mighty movement for the promulgation of the Third
Angel's Message.
   "To avoid confusion, and to economize effort, we recom-
mend the following:.—
             GENERAL PLAN FOR NORTH AMERICA
   "1. That the effort to plate the Review and Herald in every
Sabbath-keeping home be continued, especially through the
camp-meeting season and early fall.
   "2. That a general campaign in North America for our
missi nary periodicals be entered upon October I.
   "3. That beginning in early November special efforts be
made by conference workers and church officers to interest
our people in the sale of our forty per cent books.
   "4. That the interest aroused by this work be developed by—
   "(a) The liberal use of our message-filled tracts.
   "(6) Securing subscriptions for our periodicals.
   "(c) Holding Bible-readings and cottage meetings.
   "(d) Missionary carrespondence.
   "5. That missionary conventions be held October 7 and
November IS in all our churches to study local needs and to
organize for service.
                           SUPPLIES
   "64. We approve of the plan to publish four special numbers
of the Signs of the Times and the Watchman, two special issues
of Life and Health, and such issues of the foreign papers as
their publishers may deem best.
    "6$. We look with favor upon the plan of setting aside cer-
28        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.

tain small, easy-selling books for the use of those who wish
to canvass in their own neighborhoods.
    "66. We also approve of the steps being taken in the publi-
cation of the 'Signs of the Times Leaflets,' to furnish our
ministers and people with inexpensive literature for general
circulation.
                        ORGANIZATION
   "67. We recommend, That the General Conference Com-
mittee appoint a missionary campaign committee to co-operate
with conference officers in carrying out these recommendations.

               Missionary Supplies
    That you may have detailed information as to prices and
where to secure the various missionary supplies, the Missionary
Campaign Committee, appointed by the General Conference, takes
this opportunity of writing you.
    I. Review and Herald.—We suppose every one knows the
price of our good church paper, and yet there may be some who
do not; hence we give it. Address Review and. Herald, 222
North Capitol St., Washington, D. C.; .price $1.50 a year;
75 cents, six months ; 40 cents, three months.
    2. Message-Filled Tracts.—The following are some of the
tracts here referred to: "Gospel Message for To-day," 8o cents
per hundred ; "Waymarks to the Holy city," 8o cents per
hundred; "Elihu on the Sabbath," 8o cents per hundred; "Top-
ical Bible Studies," $5.20 per hundred ; "Heralds of His Corn-
ing, $5.20 ,per hundred; "Is Man Immortal," 8o cents per

    3. Special Gospel Message Series of Signs of the Times.—
The following statement concerning this series from the editor
will be of interest right here :—
                  OUR FOURTHCOMING SPECIALS
    The Signs of the Times is set for the purpose of giving
the last gospel message of Revelation 14 to the world. And
it gives it week by week, number by number. Yet that message
is so broad, so comprehensive, that it is impossible to scarcely
more than touch it in one issue. In fact it takes an entire
volume of the paper to develop that great message at all
adequately.
    Yet there are many who wish it presented in its various
phases briefly. To do this, we propose to issue, beginning with
