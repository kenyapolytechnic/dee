       LESSON I.—The Founding- of the Church.

Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace.
  (I) Now when they had passed through Amphipolis. and
Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue
of the Jews: (2) and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto
them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from
the Scriptures, (3) opening and alleging that it behooved the
Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this
Jesus, whom, said he, I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.
(4) And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with
 Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude,
and of the chief women not a few. (5) But the Jews, being
moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of
the rabble, and gathered a crowd, set the city on an uproar:
and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them
forth to the people. (6) And when they found them not, they
dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the

                               Notes.

  1. It is generally agreed that the earliest epistle written by the
apostle Paul was the first to the Thessalonians, about A. D. 52,
the second epistle from one to two years later. The burden of
the first epistle is the reception and power of the gospel message,
the second coming of Christ, and the necessity of holiness and
watchfulness. In the second epistle the apostle corrects wrong
views obtained regarding the time of Christ's coming, foretells
the great apostasy, and exhorts to practical godliness. Both
epistles are eminently present truth to the people of God now.
In the study of the lessons, above all things else study the epistle,
and receive it, as it is in truth the Word of the Lord.
  2. "Silvanus" is identical with Silas, a shorter form of the
same word. He was a leading man and prophet in the church
in Jerusalem (Acts 15:22, 23), his name indicating that he was
a Grecian Jew. He was chosen by the apostles to accompany
Paul, to bear the message of the first council to the churches.
Acts 15. Afterwards he labored with Paul, and was with him
in some of his greatest trials. After Paul's imprisonment, he
seems to have joined 'Peter. Timothy's father was a Greek, and
his mother a Jewess of Lystra. He was converted under Paul's
preaching, and proved a faithful soldier of God.
  3. Thessalonica was an important city of Macedonia. It was
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than, ten dollars
               will be at some future period."
6            THESSALONIANS AND EPI-IESIANS.

named after Alexander's sister by Cassander, her husband. In
Paul's time it was a free city of the Roman's, the capital of one
of the four Roman divisions of Macedonia. Like other ancient
cities, it was full of idolatry. It is now known by the abbrevi-
ated name Salonika. Its commerce is extensive with many
nations. The population is about 8o,000, of whom 30,000 are
Jews and to,000 Greeks. It contains many churches and schools
of different denominations, and ought to be a good missionary
center.
  4. The burden of Paul's preaching always was what is ever
the only remedy for man's great need,—Jesus Christ crucified
and risen.
  5. The word "rulers" is in the original "politarchs," not else-
where found in the New Testament ; but the word is found on
the ruins of a triumphal arch in the city, and the names of seven
politarchs given, an undesigned coincidence witnessing to the
truth of the epistle.



           LESSON 11.—Preacher and People.

   (r) Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace.
  (2) We give thanks to God always for you all, making men
tion of you in our prayers; (3) remembering without ceasing
your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in
our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; (4) know-
ing, brethren beloved of God, your election, (5) how that our
gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as ye
know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you
for your sake. (6) And ye became imitators of us, and of the

Lord, having received the Word in much affliction, with joy
of the Holy Spirit; (7) so that ye became an ensample to all
that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. (8) For from you
hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Mace-
donia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward
is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything. (9) For
they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering
in we, had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols,
to serve a living and true God, (so) and to wait for His Son
from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus, who
delivereth us from the wrath to come.

                         Questions.

    I. What message does Paul with his colaborers bear
to the church of the Thessalonians? Verse I.
    2. For whom did the apostle give thanks and pray ?
Verse 2.
    3. What did he remember? In whom and before
whom was this work wrought? Verse 3. Note I.
    4. Of what was the apostle assured? Verse 4.
    5. How did the gospel come to them? What did the
brethren know ? Verse 5.
    6. Of whom did they become imitators? Under what
circumstances and how did they receive the Word?
Verse 6.
    7. What did this fit them to be? Verse 7.
    8. What was the effect of their faith?- Of what did
believers elsewhere bear witness concerning Paul's work?
Verse 8. Note 2.
    9. What did they say of the church? Verse 9.
   io. For whom were they looking? Verse 10.
        The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
            THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.

                           Notes.
  I. True faith—there is no other—always works. Love born
of God labors cheerfully, joyfully; it must labor. And hope
endures steadfast to the end. Faith works in love, hoping to
the end. Love believeth all things, hopeth all things. . Hope
endures as seeing Him who is invisible.
  2. Every true believer must be a missionary. Faith, living
faith, must show itself. It must tell the story of its love to
others. It must proclaim the Word of life. If it fail to find
utterance and free utterance and free course, it will die. He
who thinks to cherish in his own heart God's living gospel and
not tell it to others, commits double crime: he holds from the
starving the bread of life, and he commits self-murder. The
bread he has eaten becomes poison; his righteousness becomes
sin. God gives that we may give.



      LESSON LIT—The Manner of the Preacher.
                          APRIL 18.
                      I THESS. 2:I-12.
  (i) For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you,
that it hath not been found in vain: (2) but having suffered
before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi,
we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of
God in much conflict. (3) For our exhortation is not of error,
nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: (4) but even as we have been
approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak;
not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts. (5) For
neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as
ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness; (6) nor
seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when
we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ. (7) But
we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth

       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
             THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.                      9

her own children: (8) even so, being affectionately desirous of
you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel
of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become
very dear to us. (g) For ye remember, brethren, our labor
and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden
any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. (so) Ye
are witnesses, and God also, how holily and righteously and
unblamably we .behaved ourselves toward you that believe:
  s) as ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a
father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging
you, and testifying, (s2) to the end that ye should walk worthily
of God, who calleth you into His own kingdom and glory.
                           Questions.
    i. What could be said of Paul's preaching to the
Thessalonians ? Verse 1. Note I.
    2. Did his treatment at Philippi discourage him un-
der like circumstances at Thessalonica? Verse 2.
    3. Of what three things did his teaching not partake?
Verse 3. Note 2.
    4. Of what had he been made steward ? How did
he fulfil his trust ?• Verse 4.
    5. What did he not use in respect to them? What
did he not have to conceal ? Before whom had he ful-
filled his mission? Verse 5.
    6. What did he not seek? What did he not assume
when he had the right? Verse 6. Note 3.
    7. What was his manner toward them ? Verse 7.
    8. How dear were these souls to the apostle?
Verse 8.
    9. What did he call to their remembrance ? How
earnestly did he labor?'. Verse 9.
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
I0           THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.

  Jo. What example did he set? Verse 1o.
   1. How did he deal with them? Verse 11.
  12. To what object did he testify? To what had God
called them? Verses II, 12.
                              Notes.
   r. When the grace of the gospel of God came to the apostle
Paul, it came "not in vain." It was revealed not only to -him, but
in him. Gal. 1:16. The proof that it was not in vain was the
service he rendered for God: "I labored more abundantly than
they all ; yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
   Cor. 15:10.
   2. These things in the negative imply their positives. His
exhortation was not of error; it was therefore of truth. It was
not of uncleanness. It was unlike the teaching of paganism,
in which licentiousness and lewdness were taught as a part of
its abominable nature worship, and which is ever regarded lightly
by carnal man where the rays of the gospel have not shown.
He taught purity of motive, of heart, of thought, of word, of
life. He was without guile. He did not hide the principles of
God's truth; he did not need 10. The blessed things of Chris-
tianity are not a cloak to deceive, a fair thing to hide something
which will not bear the light. Paul did not teach thus, though
he was so charged with doing. He shunned not to declare the
whole counsel of God.
   3. That they who preach the gospel shall live of the gospel, is
apostolic and divine. Paul brought to the Thessalonians the
higher life; surely he had a right to partake of their things
which supported the physical man. But he did not do it. He
did not seek glory from them or from others, nor was he bur-
densome. His course was an example of unselfishness, and it
demonstrated that he did not break from traditional Judaism
and become a Christian for gain. But it is the duty of the
church to remedy this by supporting the servants of God
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
            THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.                     II

The unselfishness of the servant of God should not develop
unhospitable, selfish churches.



    LESSON IV.--The Reception of His Message.
                           APRIL 25.
                     I THESS. 2 :13-20.
  (13) And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing,
that, when ye received from us the word of the message, even
the word of God, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but,
as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you
that believe. (14) For ye, brethren, became imitators of the
churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: for ye also
suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as
they did of the Jews; (15) who both killed the Lord Jesus and
the prophets, and drove out us, and please not God, and are
contrary to all men; (i6) forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles
that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the
wrath of God is come upon them to the uttermost.
  (17) But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short
season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the -more exceed-
ingly to see your face with great desire: (1.8) bcause we would
fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan
hindered us. (19) For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of
glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at His
coming? (20) For ye are our glory and our joy.

                           Questions.
  T. How did the apostle preach the gospel to the Thes-
salonians? See last lesson.
  2. How did they regard his message ?—They "received
the word of the message." Whose word was it? How
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."
I2           THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.

did they accept it? How did it affect them? Verse 13.
Note 1.
  3. Of whom were they imitators? What similar ex-
perience did they have? Verse 14. Note 2.
  4. What does he say of these Jewish persecutors?
Verse 15.
  5. What did they forbid? Why ? In what would
such conduct result? What came upon them in conse-
quence?, Verse 16.
  6. Over what did Paul mourn? What did he greatly
desire? Verse 17.
  7. What did he purpose to do? Who hindered?
Verse 18.
  8. What question did he ask? With what question
did he answer it? Verse 19.
  9. What positive reply did he make? Verse 20.
                             Notes.
   1. The Word of God received as the word of men is nothing.
It is as the touch of Jesus by the curious, careless crowd. The
word of men accepted as the word of God is nothing, and worse
than nothing. It leads to deification of the human, to slavish
tyranny, to fanaticism. It is not faith to receive men's words;
it is credulity. It is faith, and it is necessary to salvation, to
receive the message of God as the Word of God, letting it have
free course in our lives, and then only will its creative poWer
effectually work wonders.
  2. It is worthy of note that this church in Thessalonica became
imitators, followers of the church of God in Judea. It is ad-
mitted by all candid students that the churches in Judea were
Sabbath-keepers. Of course, well-instructed Christians must be.
 "The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                       watchword.
              THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.                      13

But it is expressly said that these Christians from among the
Gentiles were in all their persecutions followers of the faithful
in the very primitive, churches. They were therefore Christian
Sabbath-keepers.
   3. Only Jesus Christ can understand the true minister's burden
for the souls of those for whom he labors. There is coming to
be a belief, and it is evident in practise, that plain preaching of
the truth, mere formal requests put in mere nominal belief, and
conventional visiting are all that is required of the minister of
Christ. It was not so with Paul. He not only preached a full
gospel, but he labored, travailed, night and day in tears and
prayers for souls. His very life went out in soul anguish for
them. He had no hope unless they were saved. Any crown
given him would be a lie, unless he had conquered Satan in souls,
the strongholds of sin. He could not be partaker in the joy
of Christ if souls were not saved. His glory, his joy, his crown,
at Jesus' coming were all to be wrought out here in his labor
 for souls. All who know Christ are ministers of His; and no
soul will go alone into glory.



    LESSON V.—Comforted in Their Faithfulness.
                              MAY 2.
                        I 'MESS. 3:I-13.
   (r) Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought
it good to be left behind at Athens alone; (2) and sent Timothy,
our brother and God's minister in the gospel of Christ, to
establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith; (3)
that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know
that hereunto we are appointed. (4) For, verily; when we were
with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer afflic-
tions; even as it came to pass, and ye know. (5) For this
cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might

  know your faith, lest by any means the tempter bad tempted
  you, and our labor should be in vain. (6) But when Timothy
  came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings
  of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance
  of us always, longing to see us, even as we also to see you;
  (7) for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in
  all our distress and affliction through your faith; (8) for now
  we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. (9) For what thanks-
  giving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy
. wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; (so) night

                             Notes.
  i. "All that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer per-
secution." It may seem otherwise, but there is no exception.
There may be no outward persecution to many. Life may flow
on smoothly. Friends and neighbors may be kind, and perhaps
of the same faith. Oh, how many content themselves in such
circumstances to drift on, doing really nothing which demands
sacrifice! They pay tithe; yes, but that is less than they have
paid to maintain evil habits in sin. They know no burden of
soul, no sacrifice of time or money. To live godly is to do as
Jesus Christ did,—labor for others, give life for others. And
he who does this, though he may meet with no human perse-
cution, will meet the power of the adversary. But better the
persecution and affliction with Jesus than a life of ease without
Him.
  2. Every humble man of God wants human Company in his
labors. It is God's plan to send men out at least "two and two."
Greater strength and confidence are gathered in prayer and coun-
sel. One shall chase a thousand; but two shall put ten thousand

to flight. Yet Paul was willing to labor alone in the great,
strange city for awhile, so that the new converts might not be
 left too long. When he had left them, he was forced to flee
from them. Now he did not wish them to become discouraged
by his afflictions or their own.
   3. David said in the Spirit, "What shall I render unto the Lord
for all His benefits to me?" Paul counted the conversion of
these souls and their steadfastness in God as benefits which God
had granted him.
   4. "Abound in love one toward another." Oh. how much need
there is of it! We can not abound toward others if not our
brethren. Love grows by cultivation, by doing, by giving. He
who shuts himself from ministry to his brethren can not love
them.
   5. "At the coming of our Lord Jesus." Literally at His
personal presence, for so the word means. See 2 Cor. 7:6, 7;
to:ro. He is here now by His ambassadors, and by His Spirit;
but not in the sense of His promise. John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-if.
That promise will not be fulfilled until He comes in His own
personal presence. Then we shall see Him as He is, this "same
Jesus.' That is the hope of the church.

                       I TRESS. 4:I-12.
  (I) Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the
Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk
and to please God, even as ye do walk,—that ye abound more
and more. (2) For ye know what charge we gave you through
the Lord Jesus. (3) For this is the will of God, even your
sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication; (4) that each
one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in

sanctification and honor, (5) not in the passion of lust, even
as the Gentiles who know not God; (6) that no man transgress,
and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an
avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and
testified. (7) For God called us not for uncleanness, but in
sanctification. (8) Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not
man, but God, who giveth His Holy Spirit unto you.
  (9) But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need
that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God
to love one another; (to) for indeed ye do it toward all the
brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you,
brethren, that ye abound more and more; (it) and that ye
study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work
with your hands, even as we charged you; (12) that ye may
walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have
need of nothing.
                           Questions.
    1. What general exhortation does the apostle give as
to conduct? What admonition is there to continued prog-
ress ? Verse 1. (See Micah 6:8; Phil. 3 :13, 14; 1 :9 ;
2:12.)
    2. Of what does he remind them ? Verse 2.
    3. What great general truth does he express? What
specific prohibition grows out of this ? Verse 3.
    4. What further instruction does he give? Verse 4.
    5. Who should not be an example? Verse 5. Note 1.
    6. What solemn warning does he utter? Verse 6.
    7. To what has God called us ? Verse 7.

love ? Should they be satisfied with this ? Verse io.
Note 2.

II
   12. 'What twofold result would accrue from such con-
duct? Verse 12.
                           Notes.
    i. All man-made religions, all perversions of the true religion,
 fostered or in some way excused the sins reproved in this
 lesson, making it easier for the natural heart to indulge them.
 The religion of Jesus Christ, the gospel of God, takes all these
 things from the heart and life if it is truly received. In these
 days the wickednesses of Sodom are being repeated on a much
 larger scale. The words of the Christian man should be pure
and clean words.
   2. We must never be content with present effort. The fruits
of our work may have reached to the confines of our country ;
an apostle may have commended our work of faith, our labor of
love, our patience of hope; our praise may be in all the churches;
but all the past will prove a curse if it be not made a foundation
for broader, better work. The rule always, if we would not die,
is to "abound more and more."

in Jesus will God bring with Him. (15) For this we say unto
you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are
left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in nowise precede them
that are fallen asleep. (16) For the Lord Himself shall descend
from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and
with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;

them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
and so shall we ever be with the Lord. (18) Wherefore comfort
one another with these words.

   6. For what has God given these words to the sor-
 rowing? Verse IS.
                             Notes.
  1. Dark and devious as are all sin's ways, of the final out-
come there need be no doubt to the child of God. Satan has
endeavored to blind the world to the nature of death, to make
         The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
20            THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.

 men believe that it is something which it is not. To the child
 of God it is a dreamless sleep, which were it not for Christ's
 power, would know no waking. To those who know not Jesus,
 whom the apostle here calls ''the rest,"—those outside the fold
 of Christ,—there is no hope of seeing again those who have
 died. But over the cloud of His people's sorrow God hangs
 the covenant-bow of hope in Him.
   2. As surely as Jesus died and rose from the dead, just so
surely -will those who sleep in Him arise. As God brought again
 from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great "Shepherd of the
sheep," so will He bring the sheep with the Shepherd. Heb.
13:20; 2 Cor. 4:54. Christ, the Head, is not complete without
His body, the church. But when He was raised from the dead,
His people were in promise raised with Him, and when they
are brought from the grave in fact, they are still brought "with
Him" in the fulfilment of the promise.
   3. Among the erroneous theories everywhere prevalent con-
cerning our Lord's second coming is that one of the Greek
words rendered coming (parousia) is said to mean a secret
coming, the "secret rapture of the saints," when Christ will
manifest Himself to the elect among His people, and not to
the world. But verse 16 of this lesson forever settles as to
what shall be the manner of Christ's coming (parousia, verse
is). "The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven, with a
shout," with mighty voice, with trumpet. The whole thought
of the text is that of grandeur, glory, noise, commotion. It is
an event that all the earth shall witness. He shall come "with
all the holy angels" (Matt. 25:31), illuminating the whole
heavens from the east to the west (Matt. 24:27). And "every
eye shall see Him." Rev. 1:7. It will be "the Lord Himself,"
and not another, "this same Jesus," and not a representative.
It will be His own personal, bodily presence; for so the original
word means. See 2 Cor. 7:6, 7, where the word is applied to
the bodily coming of Titus; and to Stephanas           Cor. 16:17),
and to Paul (Phil. 5:26). In all cases it refers to a inanifestecl,
bodily, personal presence.
       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
             THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.                        21

  "Archangel" means chief angel. This is Michael, meaning
"who-is-like God," another name of our blessed Lord. Com-
pare Dan. to:21; 12:1; Jude 9. Christ is chief over all the
heavenly host (Joshua 5:13, 14), and He holds the keys of
death and the grave (Rev. 1:18; John 5:28, 29).
   The righteous dead do not arise from the grave, then to be
judged and changed. They come up immortal (1 Cor. 55:52),
showing that judgment has already passed upon their cases,
and that they are counted worthy to obtain a resurrection out
from among the dead ones (Luke 20:35). The thought in the
text is not that the dead in Christ      rise first, that is, before
the dead out of Christ arise, though that is true, but that the
dead in Christ arise before the living are caught up to meet
the Lord.
   4. Our Lord at His coming does not touch the earth. As
it rolls to meet Him in the air, it brings all His captive dead,
escorted by angels of light. These He takes to the glorious
mansions on high (John 14:3), where they reign with Him a
thousand years in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 20:4). At the end
of that time, Jesus comes, and all the saints with Him.
Zech. 14:5. Then His feet will rest upon the earth, a place
will be prepared for the holy city (verse 4), sin and its fruits
will be forever destroyed, and the long, blest reign of God's
people will begin, never more to end.

                        I THESS. 5:I-11.

  (5) But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye
have no need that aught be written unto you. (2) For your-
selves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
thief in the night. (3) When they are saying, Peace and safety,
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
22           THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.

then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
woman with child; and they shall in nowise escape. (4) But
ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake
you as a thief: (5) for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the
day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness; (6) so then let
us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.
(7) For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are
drunken are drunken in the night. (8) But let us, since we are
of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and
love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
  (9) For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtain-
ing of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, (so) who died
for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together
with Him. (is) Wherefore exhort one another, and build each
other up, even as also ye do.

                              Notes.

   1. The day of the Lord does not open with Christ's com-
ing. It begins with the pouring out of the plagues and the
awfully solemn declaration of God that mankind by the accept-
ance or rejection of the gospel of God's grace have passed that
line of fixed character beyond which there is no change. Zeph.
1 :14, 15; Rev. 14:9, to; 15:1 ; 22:11, 12. That day will not be
ushered in by heavenly trumpet or heavenly glory; the careless
sin lover will not know when it comes, even as the careless house-
holder knows not 'the approach of the thief. 2 Peter 3:1o. But
the waiting, watching, faithful child of God will know. See
Rev. 3 :5.
   2. "When they shall say." Note that it is not a prediction of
peace and safety to come; it is proclaimed to be present. See
Isa. 2 :3-5; Rev. 18:7.
   3. The children of light are those who are by faith begotten
of Christ Jesus the Light of the world, born of the Spirit of light,
filled with the Light of the world, and are shining for God,
witnesses of the glory of His goodness. See John 12:36; 8:12;
   John I :7; Ps. 119:105; 2 Peter 1 :19; Matt. 5:16.
   4. The earth is in the darkness of the night of sin. And even
as in t'he physical world, it is a time of revelry, drunkenness, and
stupid slumber. While God's people as pilgrims are passing
through this dark world, God gives them light. They carry the
clay with them. When darkness covered Egypt, there was light
in the Israelites' dwellings. So when spiritual darkness settles

_upon the people of the earth, there will be a light within and
 upon the faithful of God. See Isa. 6o:1, 2.
   5. The breastplate of faith and love is the same as the shield
 of faith and the breastplate of righteousness. Eph. 6:14, 16.
 The hope of salvation is placed in the helmet, over the brain,
 the seat of the mind, not over the heart, the organ of feeling or
 emotion. God would have His children possess an intelligent
 hope.
   6. Most precious assurance does God give His children. He
 has not appointed us to wrath. If we reap wrath, it will be be-
 cause we have chosen it. He has appointed us to salvation.
 Nothing in all the universe will prevent its consummation but
 our own choice. Living, we may be His. Dying, we may be.
 Sleeping or waking, dying or living, if we are His, we are safe.
 The love of Christ covers all else but the sin that we love.
 Rom. 8:38, 39. The child of God who would be discouraged
 because of death has here a message of hope and cheer. Jesus
 Christ lives; in Him is all our hope.

Verse 28.
                              Notes.

   I. "At peace." There are turbulent spirits in this world of sin
who can be at peace with no one, and above all with Christians.
Yet as much as possible consistent with truth and righteousness,
the child of God should live at peace with these. Rom. 12:18.
But there is absolutely no reason why the children of the God
of all peace should not be at peace among themselves, at peace
with even the admonisher and reprover.
  2. "Despise not prophesyings;" that is, do not consider them
as of no account. There will be in the last days prophesyings
many, false and true. Both are of vast account, the one in
leading to death- and destruction, the other to light and duty
and life./"Prove all things," not by studying the false, but by
knowing the true,—God's Word. Measure all voices by having
God's voice written in your heart, your life attuned to its prin-
ciples.

aboundeth; (4) so that we ourselves glory in you in the
churches of God for your patience and faith in all your perse-
cutions and in the afflictions which ye endure; (5) which is a
manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end
that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for
which ye also suffer; (6) if so be that it is a righteous thing
with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you
(7) and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation
of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power
in flaming fire, (8) rendering vengeance to them that know not
 God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jests;

the face of the Lord and from the glory of His might, (io)
when He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be
 marveled at in all them that believe (because our testimony
 unto you was believed) in that day. (ii) To which end we also
 pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of
 your calling, and fulfil every desire of goodness and every work
 of faith, with power; (52) that the name of our Lord Jesus may
 be glorified in you, and ye in Him, according to the grace of
 our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

  1. The second epistle to the Thessalonians was written a year
or more after the first. Its great theme is the coming of Christ.
  The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
             THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS:                     29

Both epistles were given not alone for those to whom they are im-
mediately addressed, but for all in all time. The second epistle
corrects some erroneous ideas the brethren had obtained, namely
that the coming of Christ then impended. The apostle tells
them that other events must intervene before Christ comes.
He shows them, however, the importance of that coming to
His people in all ages; for at that time all will receive their
reward, both good and evil.
  2. According to God's grace does He give; according as we
appropriate it by faith will we receive and grow.

            LESSON XI.--The Lawless One.
                            JUNE 13.

                       2 THESS. 2:1-12.
  (I) Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto Him;
(2) to the end that ye be not. quickly shaken from your mind,
nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle
as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand; (3) let
no man beguile you in any wise: for it will not be, except the
falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son
of perdition, (4) he that opposeth and exalteth himself against
all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sitteth
in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God. (5) Remem-
ber ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
things? (6) And now ye know that which restraineth, to the
end that he may be revealed in his own season. (7) For the
mystery of lawlessness doth already work; only there is one that
restraineth now, until he .be taken out of the way. (8) And
then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus
shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and bring to naught
by the manifestation of His coming; (9) even he, whose corn-

ing is according to the working of Satan with all power and
signs and lying wonders, (m) and with all deceit of unright-
eousness for them that perish; because they received not the
love of the truth, that they might be saved. (ii) And for this
cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should
believe a lie: (52) that they all might be judged who believed
not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

work? How is he thus permitted to work for these?
Verses 9, 10.
  10. What follows the rejection of the love of the truth?
What are men permitted to believe ? What will be the
consequence? Verses II, 12. Note 6.
                               Notes.

   1. "The falling away" is noticed in 2 Peter 2 :1-3 ; I Tim. 4:1-5,
and elsewhere. "The man of sin." Not a man of sin, nor a
sinful man, but the aggregation of forces of sin organized and
used by the enefoy _ for the express purpose of the overthrow
of righteousness, a system of which a man is at the head, stand-
ing for the very thought of the transgression or perversion of
God's law. i John 3:4. "Son of perdition" means devoted to
utter destruction. The wages_ of sin is death. These are not
titles which this power adopts, but are names indicative of its
character as God sees it.
   2. Not against God alone does the man of - sin exalt himself,
but against all that opposes him. He assumes to be the true God.
He places himself in the church of God (i Cor. 3 :16 ; Eph.
2:19-22) as its director. The one power which has done this
pre-eminently is the Papacy; and in whomever it is done in a
limited degree, the same spirit rules.
   3. God would not permit the development of this power in His
church till the time came when the church refused to be longer
 guided by Him. Then it would be the time of the Papacy, "the
 lawless one." See a fuller description in Dan. 11:36-39.
   4. Iniquity is always at work in the natural heart of carnal
 men. It is born and stays with them till they are regenerated
 by divine grace. We do not wonder at its working there; we
 expect its workings and fruits. The great secret of iniquity is
 when it insinuates itself in the church of God, and is there given
 place. See Acts 20:29, 30. It will be seen that its center is self,
 self-admiration, self-sufficiency, self-aggrandizement, self-worship,
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
32            THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.

as opposed to the self-denial and self-effacement of Christ Jesus.
 "One that restraineth." The body of the individual is designed
 to be a temple of God, filled with His Spirit. i Cor. 6:19, 20.
 No lesser power can keep man from sin and preserve him from
 the power of the enemy. Gal. 2:20. This is as true of the
 church as it is of the individuals who compose the church.
 As long as Christ reigns within, so long as His Word is the
 law, His Spirit the sanctifier, no power can set its throne there
 or have any control over the life. And as long as faith bids
Christ dwell in the heart in a sufficient number of His people,
the lawless one will be 'restrained in the church. Not until
the heart shall say, I prefer my way to God's way, not until
Christ is shut out, taken out of the way, can the lawless one—
of whom the highest type is Satan—reign in the place of God.
"Keep thy heart above all keeping."
   5. When the Spirit of Christ is bidden to depart by our choice
of His rival, then the lawless one will be revealed in person and
church. That fullest development has not yet been seen.
Within the fold of mystical Babylon there have always been
protesting and faithful ones. When Babylon shall become
wholly filled with the power of the enemy, when Christ's peo-
ple shall have been called out (Rev. 18:1-4), then Jesus Christ
shall appear in His glory. With the breath of His mouth shall
He slay the wicked one, and by the forthshining of His pres-
ence bring him to nothing. His presence destroys sin; and the
lawless one with all his horde has identified himself with sin.
   6. God sends no arbitrary punishment, no delusion to destroy;
it is Satan who seeks to destroy, and not until men reject every
means of salvation does God give them over to Satan's delusions.
But that soul who receives the love of the truth can never be
deceived to destruction.   •

             LESSON X11.—Chosen of God.

                            JUNE 20.
                  2 THESS. 2 :13-17; 3 :1-5.
    (13) But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you,
 brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the
beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief
of the truth: (14) whereunto He called you through our gospel,
to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. (i5) So
then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.
   (i6) Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father
who loved us and gaire us eternal comfort and good hope
through grace, (17) comfort your hearts and establish them in
every good work and word.
   (I) Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord
may run and be glorified, even as also it is with you; (2) and
that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men;
for all have not faith. (3) But the Lord is faithful, who shall
establish you, and guard you from the evil one. (4) And we
have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
and will do the things which we command. (5) And the Lord
 direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience
of Christ.
                            Questions.

  i. What did the apostle always feel bound to do?
Why? To what were they chosen? In what? Verse
13.
  2. Through what did He call them? Unto the obtain-
ing of what did He call them? Verse 14.

  4. What feeling have Christ and the Father toward
Their children ? What have They given us ? Through
what? In what will They establish and comfort us?
Verses 16, 17. Note 2.
  5. What is one of the final exhortations the apostle
makes ? Why does he wish the prayers of the brethren ?
Chapter 3, verse I. Note 3.,
  6. From whom did he wish to be delivered ? What
reason does lie give? Verse 2.
  7. What witness does he bear to the Lord? What will
the Lord do for His people? Verse 3.
  8. What confidence had the apostle in the brethren?
What prayer did he make for them ? Verses 4, 5.

                              Notes.

  I. "Stand fast and hold." Stand fast for service; hold faithful
to the orders. The word "tradition" does not mean a body of
laws or instructions handed down from generation to generation,
with no other authority behind it than age and what men have
said. The word is used in its literal meaning, "delivery, handing
over; what is transmitted, intrusted 10." By word or epistle, Paul
committed or intrusted to the Thessalonians the word of the
gospel. It was their duty to hold it to the end.
  2. There is no difference in the disposition, attitude, and feel-
ing toward us of the Father and the Son. Both love us. Both
give us eternal comfort and good hope. Both do it through
grace, unmerited favor. Both will comfort and establish in
every good word or work./But in Their love to us They must
permit the unrest and instability when our work is of self and
evil.
  3. "Pray" not simply for ourselves, but for the servants of
God; "pray" that God's Word may go freely, swiftly, mightily,
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
             THESSALONIANS AND EPHESIANS.                      35

and be glorified by fruit; "pray" that other souls may be searched
out and saved, even as it searched you out. Thus does God
speak to all His children. Thus will His Spirit lead us to do.



         LESSON X111.—Important Instruction,
                            JUNE   27.
                        2 THESS. 3 :6-18.
   (6) Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every
brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition
which they received. of us. (7) For yourselves know how ye
ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly
among you; (8) neither did we eat bread for naught at any
man's hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day,
that we might not burden any of you: (9) not because we
have not the right, but to 'make ourselves an ensarnple unto
you, that ye should imitate us. (so) For even when we were
with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither
let him eat. (i s) For we hear of some that walk among you
disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies. (I2) Now
them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus
Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
 (i3) But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing. (i4) And if
any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man,
that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may
be ashamed. (i5) And yet count him not as an enemy, but
admonish him as a brother. (i6) Now the Lord of peace
 Himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be
 with you all. 07) The salutation of me Paul with mine own
 hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. (i8) The
 grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

   t. This is the word of the Lord, and that church which fails to
heed it will suffer. But it is worth while to study what it does
not mean. It does not mean ill treatment_ of the person,' nor
 rhif r;1 ry action in his absence, nor voting hint out of the church
without labor, nor leaving our responsibility of his soul to others,
nor sympathizing with him in his wrong when some one has
Faithfully admonished him. It does not mean.that any unchrist-
like course should. be pursued toward him. It does not mean
that we should stand with him in the wrong, but should labor
to show him the wrong, and the whole intent of the labor
should not be in any way to please ourselves, but to please
God by the conversion of the wrong-doer, if possible. Read
Matt. 18:15-17; Romans 14; Gal. 6:1, a; James 5:19, 20. After
all gospel means are exhausted, then,.for the sake of Christ's
cause, take the ultimate action of withdrawing from him, yet
standing ever ready to help him.
  2. Yet the apostle had the right to partake of their substance.
Ile had given them spiritual food; surely they should be glad
that he had the• right to . partake of their temporal food. See
  Co r. a1 4-18. And yet in this very respect the apostle intimates
Ilia lie did wrong in not teaching 'the church to hear hardens.
I f a Minister of God or .a parent bears too many burdens, in the
fulness of his heart, the children or members are strangely made
selfish and thoughtless. For the best interests of all, it is good
that each one learn to bear the yoke in his youth. There are
Some burdens which ought to be blessings to the children of God.
Sec i Mess. 5 :12, 13.
   3. -What a God is our God! It is grace and peace at the begin-
ning; it is grace and peace at the close. The first word and the
last word are a message of His goodness to the undeserving:
and all the intermediate words are instruction, which, if heeded,
will yield us all the blessings of His grace. Do not let the
study of these epistles stop with these lessons.
