HELP FOR AFRICA
   We are giving an opportunity to the
 children to help the cause in Africa by
 taking subscriptions for the Little Friend.
    Instead of the full 5o cents received from them for a new
 yearly subscription being appropriated by us to pay for the
 paper, we propose to send 20 cents of it to Africa.
     Parents can not send their small children to foreign lands to
 be missionaries, but all can train them to be missionaries at
 home. Thousands of new subscribers can be obtained by the
 children if this special offer is brought to their attention, and
 thus a liberal sum be raised to help in carrying the gospel to
 the Dark Continent.
     Parents, leaders in the young people's work, teachers of
 the children in the Sabbath-school, and any others coming in
 contact with the children of our people, this plan needs your
 co-operation to be a real success. Then, can we not depend
 upon you to help in bringing the plan to the attention of
 the children?
     We want the names of all children who will try to carry out
 the plan, as we wish to write them, giving them general in-
 structions regarding it. We wish also to send them copies of
 the Little Friend to use as samples.
     Then, please write early to Our Little Friend, Oakland,
 Cal., telling of your interest in the plan, and giving the names
 of some to whom you have spoken about the matter and who
 wish to help.

GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD
                     FOR SENIOR CLASSES
               Fourth <Quarter, 1903


                      Introductory Note.
  The lessons, as outlined for study, should be considered simply
as a framework. Let the texts of Scripture cited be read, •
studied, and, as far as possible, committed to memory. Next,
get the- logical connection of these texts clearly in mind. Then
let the practical and spiritual truth of each lesson—the coming
of the promised Seed to restore this world to its rightful King—
become a part of our personal experience. We shall then pray
from the heart, "Thy kingdom come." He will then see in us
"His seed." We shall then be fully "translated out of the king-
dom of darkness, into the kingdom of His dear Son."


LESSON 1 — Adam as Sub - Ruler in God's Kingdom.

                        OCTOBER 3, 5903.
  Memory Text.—"For God is the King of all the earth; sing
ye praises with understanding." Ps. 47 :7.
                           Questions.
  I. To whom and how fully was the dominion of this
earth given? Gen. 1:26.

   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
4           GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.

   2. What commission was given to Adam and Eve?
 How much of the earth were they to subdue? Gen. 1 :28.
   3. What object lesson did the, Lord give them of
 what He designed the whole earth .should become?
 Gen. 2:8.
   4. What did the Lord cause to grow in this garden?
 Gen. 2 :9.
   5. By obedience to what command was man to ac-
 knowledge that God was the supreme Ruler of the
world? Gen. 2:16, 17.
  6. By acknowledging God's claim to this one tree,
what would man have acknowledged concerning every-
thing which the Lord had made?
   7. What was the first insinuation of doubt, received
into the human heart, concerning the goodness and
love of God? Gen. 3:1.
  8. This doubt, cherished in the heart, prepared the
way for what more bold assertion by the tempter?
Gen. 3:4. Note I.
  9. What character did that statement attribute to
God?
  io. Whose character was thus attributed to God?
John 8:44.
    I. By what still stronger statement did the serpent
misrepresent the character of God? Gen. 3:5.
  12. What did the woman then see? Gen. 3:6.
  13. What enabled the woman, and what enables
others, to see that which does not exist? 2 Cor. 11:3.
We expend ixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.
            GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                      5

  14. To what state of wickedness did this first act of
disobedience lead? Gen. 6:5.
  15. What did the Lord then say He would do? Verse

16. What promise had He already made? How
much was included in that promise? Gen. 3:15. Note
2.
                             Notes.
  i. Temptation is not sin, but the moment we allow an insinua-
tion of doubt to find a lodging-place in the heart, and begin to
parley with the tempter,—begin to reason that, perhaps, the
wicked thing is right,—we are on the enemy's ground; and by
his cunning and deception, practised for six thousand years, he
will make wrong appear right. The Lord has given us one sure
and safe weapon with which we can successfully meet every
temptation of Satan, "It is written." That weapon of defense
has been tested and proved by One who met and conquered in
every temptation that can ever come to humanity.
  2. The whole plan of human redemption, which is revealed in
the Bible, and which "will be the song and the science of the
redeemed throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity," is included
in the promise of the seed which was to bruise the serpent's
head. Adam had gone into bondage to Satan, and had forfeited
to him all the rulership and dominion with which he had been
entrusted. This promise of the seed is a pledge to the universe
that God will never relinquish His kingship of this world. That
kingship, perpetuated through the promised Seed, will be the
central thought running through this quarter's lessons.

LESSON IL —Noah as Sub-Ruler in God's Kingdoni.
                      OCTOBER 10, 1003.

  Memory Text.—"For the Lord most high is terrible; He is a
great King over all the earth." Ps. 47:2.
                         Questions.
   I. What position did Satan gain by his usurpation
of the rulership and dominion given to Adam? John
12:31, 14:3o, i6:11. Note 1.
   2. When the usurper of God's kingdom in this world
had so far succeeded in his work of ruin that it became
necessary to drown the world by a flood, what pro-
vision did the Lord make for its perpetuation through
the promised Seed? Gen. 6:7, 8.
   3. How is the condition of the earth at that time
described? --Verses II, 12.
   4. What declaration did the Lord make to Noah?
Verses 13, 17.
   5. What provision did the Lord instruct Noah to
make for the preservation of himself and family? Gen.
6:14, 15.
   6. In this provision, what was the Lord establishing
with Noah? Verse 18. Note 2. •
   7. After the flood, what rulership and dominion was

  8. What command was repeated to Noah and his
sons? • Gen. 9.1. (Compare Gen. 1:28.)

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
             GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                        7

       By whom did Satan seek to organize a govern-
ment in this world after his own mind? Gen. 1o:8-11.
Note 3.
    t. What plan was organized with the intent of over-
throwing God's purpose that the whole earth should
be peopled? Gen. I i :1-4. (Repeat verse 4.)
  12. HOW did the Lord make this effort to defeat His
purpose the means of its accomplishment? Gen. II:5-8.
(Repeat verse 8.)
  13. How fully did the world again depart from God
and go into apostasy and idolatry? Joshua 24:2. Note

                              Notes.
   I. "Of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
 bondage." 2 Peter 2:19. Through the sin of Adam and Eve, the
 whole human race was involved in bondage to Satan. "Who-
 soever committeth sin is the servant of sin." John              By
 bringing Adam into bondage to himself, and usurping his ruler-
 ship and dominion, Satan gained the position of "prince of this
 world." God had not given to Adam an absolute rulership of
 this world, and, as Adam could forfeit to Satan only that which
  had been entrusted to him:, the great controversy through all the
'ages of sin has been, and will be till the close, between God and
 Satan as to whose rulership of this world will ultimately prevail.
 And as it was to be through the promised Seed that the rightful
 kingship was to be perpetuated in this world, the controversy
 has been directly between Christ and Satan.
   2. The covenant which the Lord established with Noah, in
 preserving him alive to perpetuate the race, when he was about
 to destroy all flesh, was that recorded in Gen. 3:15, that "the
  Seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
   3. The Revised Version makes the meaning of verse II clearer:
         The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
8             GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.

"Out of the land he [Nimrod] went forth into Assyria, and
builded Nineveh."
  4. The statement (Joshua 24:2) that Terah, the father of
Abraham, dwelt on the other side of the flood, and the state-
ment in verse 3, that Abraham was taken from the other side
of the flood, should be understood as meaning the other side of
the River Euphrates. The Revised Version renders it, "Your
fathers dwelt of old time beyond the river." See also Joshua 1:4.


          LESSON 111.—The Call of Abraham.
                       OCTOBER 17, 1903.
    Memory Text.—"For the Lord is our defense; and the Holy
One of Israel is our King." Ps. 8g :18.
                         Questions.
  I. After the flood when the whole world had again
departed from God, and had gone into idolatry and sin,
why could not the Lord again destroy the world by a
flood? Gen. 9:9-17. (Repeat verse 11.)
  2. What provision was then made for the fulfilment

the serpent's head? Joshua 24:2, 3.
  3. From whom, and to what place, was Abraham called.

  4. How did he respond to this call? Heb. II :8.
  5. How was the promise made to Adam, that the
Seed of the woman should bruise the - serpent's head,
repeated to Abraham, and enlarged upon? Gen. 12:2, 3.
  6. What was comprised in this covenant made with
Abraham?" Gen. 13:14-16.
  7. What was "His oath unto Isaac?" Gen..26 :3, 4.
         The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
             GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                       9
   8. How was this covenant "confirmed to Jacob for
a law"? Gen. 28 :to-Is. (Repeat verses 13, 14.)
   9. How was it- "confirmed to Israel for an everlasting
covenant"? Gen. 35:9-12.
   10. Repeat 1)§. 105:8-12.
    1. Who were associated with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, in the promise?
   12. Who is the Seed referred to in all these promises?

   14. Tell the wonderful story of the trial of Abraham's
faith. Gen. 22:1-18.
   15. Repeat Heb. 11:17-19.


      LESSON IV.—Israel' s Mission as a Nation.
                        OCTOBER 24, 1903.
 ,Memory Text.—"And He said, It is a light thing that thou
shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to
restore the preserved of Israel; I will also give thee for a light
to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be My salvation unto the end

            Prayerfully consider the unenlered fields.
 IO          GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.

     4. What besides the boundary limits of every nation
. has been predetermined? Acts 17:26.
     5. What decides the time limit of every nation that has
  existed, or that ever will exist? .Acts 17:27. Note 2.
     6. What did the Lord fix as the boundary limits of
  the nation which He promised to make of Abraham
  and his seed? Rom. 4:13.
     7. What did He establish as the time limit of that
  kingdom? Ps. 81:13-15. Note 3.
     8. What did the Lord design the nation of Israel

  49:6; Acts 13:46, 47; Deut. 4:67: Note 4.
    9. What did the Lord foretell Abraham would be-
  fall his posterity? Gen. 15:13.
         What did the Lord promise Abraham should take
  place at the end of that period? Gen. 15:14.
      t. Did the Israelites go out of Egypt at the right
  time to fulfil this promise? •Ex. 12:41. Note 5.
                             Notes.
  i. "He sets the bounds of the people [nations] according to the
number of the children of Israel." God has always had Israel
in mind. All who will he saved from this world will constitute
the Israel of God, the exact number that was in "His eternal
purpose," "which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world
began." God's one and only purpose in the existence of nations
in this world is that that number which will constitute Israel
shall be gathered out.
  2. "That they might seek the Lord." Whenever a nation
reaches that point in its history that men can no longer have the
" This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
             GOD'S KINGDOM' IN THIS WORLD.                     II


opportunity of seeking the Lord, the Lord has no further use for
that nation, and it comes to its end.
   3. "But their time should have endured forever." All Who
 study these lessons closely will see that the Lord made every
 provision, first, that His kingdom in this world might haire been
 eternally established, with Adam as _its head; second, Adam
 having failed, after the flood provision was made for the estab-
 lishment of the kingdom, with Noah as head; third, up to this
 time there had been no organized kingdom in- the world, and
 the controversy was between God and Satan as to who should
 he king, and if the subjects of the rightful Sovereign had proved
 true and loyal to Him, His kingdom would have prevailed;
 fourth, under Nimrod; Satan endeavored to set up his form of
 organized government in the world, and the overthrow of that
 effort was the origin of nations as they have existed in this
 world; fifth, in the nation of Israel, with God Himself as
 King, the Lord sought to set up His form of organized govern-
 ment, in territory usurped by Satan; sixth, if the nation of
 Israel had been true and loyal to God and kept His command-
 ments, He would have subdued every enemy, given them the
 whole earth, and "their time should have endured forever;"
 seventh, in God's eternal purpose provision was made, through
 the promised Seed, to meet every emergency and every failure
'on man's part, "to the end the promise might be sure to all the
 seed." When the plan is all worked out, God will set up His
 throne on this earth, and every subject who shall have proved
 true and loyal to the principles of His government will then
 "possess the kingdom under the whole heaven."
  4. As Christ is the light of the world, so His church is set to
be the light of the world. The Lord designed, through the
nation of Israel, through the principles of His government, to
reveal His character to all other nations in the world. 'If Israel
haebeen true to God and His government, they would have shed

   Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."
12           GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.

the light of the glory of God upon all the world, and would
have unmasked the character of Satan and his government.
  5. Abraham went down to Egypt 2921 B. C. (Gen. ra:ro, see

to 1491. Not only did they go out in that year, but on the
"selfsame day of that year." Ex. 12:41, marginal date. "Like
the stars in the vast circuit of their appointed path, God's pur-
poses know no haste and no delay. Through the symbols of the
great darkness and the smoking furnace, God had revealed to
Abraham the bondage of Israel in Egypt, and had declared that
the time of their sojourning should be four hundred years.
`Afterward,' He said, 'shall they come out with great substance.'
Against that word all the power of Pharaoh's proud empire
battled in vain. 'On the selfsame day,' appointed in the divine
promise, 'it came to pass that all the hosts of the Lord went out
from the land of Egypt.'"—Desire of Ages, page 35.

             GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                      15

their own land? How complete and lasting might that
restoration have been? Ps. 81:13-15. Note 5.
                             Notes.
  1. In the year 6o6 B. C., Nebuchadnezzar carried the children
of Israel to Babylon as captives.
  2. "The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia."
In His providence, Daniel held a high position in the king's
court. Having knowledge that the seventy years were expiring,
and having influence with the king, Daniel, no doubt, not only
informed him that the prophecy indicated that the seventy years
were fulfilled, but that God had foretold that Cyrus himself was
the man who "shall perform all My pleasure; even saying to
Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy founda-
tion shall be laid." Isa. 44:28.
' 3. Under this proclamation of Cyrus, 42,360 of the Jews are
said to have returned. But a careful study of that decree
(Ezra 1:1-4) shows that ample provision was made that every
Jew on the face of the earth might have hastened his steps
toward his own land. Any Jew, living in any part of Cyrus'
dominion, which was "all the kingdoms of the earth," who was
too poor to go to Jerusalem, was to be provided, by "the men
of his place," with all the money he needed for the journey, and
sufficient to make an offering to the house of God when he got
there.
   4. The answer to Daniel's prayer involved some action on the
part of the king of Persia. The enemies of Israel were attempt-
ing to frustrate God's purposes. "Ah, how little do we realize
what is going on in the unseen world in relation to human
affairs! Here, as it were, the curtain is for a moment lifted, and
we catch a glimpse of the movements within. Daniel prays.
The Creator of the universe hears. The command is issued to
Gabriel to go to his relief. But the king of Persia must act
before Daniel's prayer is answered, and the angel hastens to the
 Persian king. Satan, no doubt, musters his forces to oppose.

   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.
I( •         GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.

They meet in the royal palace of Persia. All the motives of
selfish interest and worldly policy which Satan can play upon
he doubtless uses to the best advantage to influence the king
against compliance with God's will, while Gabriel brings to bear
his influence in the other direction. The king struggles between
conflicting emotions. He hesitates, he delays. Day after .day
passes away, yet Daniel prays on. The king still refuses to yield
to the influence of the angel; three weeks expire, and, lo, a
mightier than Gabriel takes His place in the palace of the king,
and Gabriel appears to Daniel to acquaint him with the progress
of events."—Daniel and Revelation, page 218.
  5. The latest prophecy concerning the return of the Jews to
their own land was spoken in B. C. 487. In B. C. 445, forty-two
years this side the latest prophetic utterance concerning their
return, they were fully restored to their own land, and every
promise made to that people was fulfilled on the Lord's part.
Every promise made to that people was on condition of their
keeping His commandments. If they had fulfilled their part,
the promise would have been fulfilled to them that "every place
whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours. . . .
There shall no man be able to stand before you; for the Lord
your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
all the land that ye shall tread upon, as He hath said unto you."
Deut. 11 :24, 25 ; Ps. 81 :13-15.

   2. In order for that nation to shed its light and bless-
ing upon all the surrounding nations, what position

   3. So long as Israel occupied her God-given position,
what would other nations say of her? Deut. 4:6-8.

would have published to all the world, brought to Neb-

ward make to all the world? Dan. 3:28, 29.

"Cme dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars

    14. What testimony did Joshua bear, at the time of
  his death, concerning God's faithfulness in all that He
  had promised to do for Israel? Joshua 23:14; 21:43.
  45. Note 4.
                               Notes.
      I. In order that they might be a light to all the world, God
   called His people to occupy a position high above all other
   nations. In their efforts to be like the nations around them,
   they sank far below, and became the despised of all nations.
   From the position to which they had fallen, it was impossible for
   them to shed light upon the world, even if they had light.
     2. When God's own chosen people fell from that high position
   to which they had been called to give the light to the world,
   He had to choose a heathen king, whom He designates as
   "Nebuchadnezzar My servant." He placed Nebuchadnezzar in a
   position of world-wide influence; above all other nations. He
   brought some of His own people who were true to Him to
   Babylon as captives, that they might give the light to Nebuchad-
   nezzar to publish to the world, as he was the only man in the
   world who was in a position to be listened to by all people.
     3. What has been said concerning Nebuchadnezzar, king of
  Babylon, is also true of Cyrus, king of Persia. The Lord gave
   all the kindoms of the world into the hand of Cyrus—set him
  upon the throne of universal dominion in this world—and
  caused him to publish the name and character of the true God
  to all the world.
     4. At the time of Joshua's death God had planted His people
  in Canaan, the center of the world. He gave them that land, with
  the promise that just as fast as they could multiply and fill the
  whole world every place where the soles of their feet should
  tread should he theirs, and that not an enemy in all the world
 could stand before them. Just as the Lord had given Adam
• the Garden of Eden, with the promise that, at the touch of his
 hand, the whole earth would become like that sample, so He
 Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour•.
             GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                    19

gav'e His people the land of Canaan, a land flowing with milk
and honey, with the promise that the whole earth would become
like that goodly land. All was on condition of their obedience.
Just as Adam, through the fall, lost what the Lord had given
him, so Israel, through their fall, lost what the Lord had given
them. Some people talk about the "return of the Jews,". as
though God were under obligation to that nation to do for them
 what he promised to do. On the authority of God's word, we
can say, as did Joshua, that "not one thing bath failed of all
the good things which the Lord spake; all are come to pass, and
not one thing bath failed."
  All that the Lord would have done through that nation, if they
had been what God designed them to be—a spiritual kingdom—
He will yet accomplish through the true Israel of God. When
He finds a people of whom He can say, "Here are they that
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus,"- the
condition upon which all those promises were based, all these
blessings will overtake that people.

weighing the gains and treasures of a- world; but as Christ
 looked upon Jerusalem, the doom of a whole city, a whole na-
tion, was before Him; that city, that nation, which had once been
the chosen of God, His peculiar treasure. . . . Looking down
the ages, He saw the covenant people scattered in every land,
`like wrecks on a desert shore.' In the temporal retribution
about to fall upon her children, He saw but the first draught
from that cup of wrath which at the final judgment she must
drain to its dregs. Divine pity, yearning love, found utterance
in the mournful words, '0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill-
est the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee;
how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a
 hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!
Oh, that thou, a nation favored above every other, hadst known
the time of thy visitation and the things that belong unto thy
peace! I have stayed the angel of justice, I have called thee to
 repentance, but in vain. It is not merely servants, delegates,
and phophets whom thou hast refused and rejected, but the
Holy One of Israel, thy Redeemer. If thou art destroyed, thou
alone art responsible. 'Ye will not come to Me, that ye might
have life.' "—Great Controversy, page 21.
   2. "Christ saw in Jerusalem a symbol of the world hardened
 in unbelief and rebellion, and hastening on to meet the retrib-
 utive judgmenti of God. The woes of a fallen race, pressing
 upon His soul, forced from His lips that exceeding bitter cry.
 He saw the record of sin traced in human misery, tears, and
 blood; His heart was moved with infinite pity for the afflicted
 and suffering ones of earth; He yearned to relieve them all.
 But even His hand might not turn back the tide of human wde;
 few would seek their only source of help. He was willing to
 pour out His soul unto death, to bring salvation within their
 reach; but few would come to Him, that they might have life."—

cessors sit upon? i Chron. 29:23.
   2: Upon what condition, and how long, did the lord
promise that the throne of David should continue?
Jer. 17:24, 25.
   3. Who was the last king to sit upon the throne of
David? Eze. 21 :25, 26. Note i.
   4. How long ckd the Lord say it would he before
that throne would again be occupied? Eze. 21 :27.
   5. What prophecy was spoken concerning David's
throne? Amos 9:11.
   6. When was that prophecy given, and when might
it have been fulfilled? Note 2.
   7. Since the disobedience of the nation of Israel de-
ferred the realization of the prophecy, what does In-
spiration say as to its fulfilment? Acts 15:13, 16.
Note 3.
   8. What was the origin of the term "Israel," as ap-
plied to that nation? Gen. 32:27, 28.
   9. What is it then to be an Israelite, in God's esti-
mation?
   io. What is the character of a true- Israelite? John

possess that character? Rev. 14:1-5. Repeat verse 5.
  12. When such people are found, who will be seen
coming? Rev. 14:14.
  13. Who will then be the rightful heir to David's
throne? Luke 1:32, 33. Compare Eze. 21 :27.
                             Notes.
   I. Prophecy has declared that the scepter should not depart
from Judah until Shiloh should come. Gen. 49:1o. While, be-
cause of rebellion against God, the throne was to remain vacant,
the kingly line was still preserved in Judah until Shiloh came.
   2. The prophecy of Amos 9:11 was spoken nearly two hundred
years before the reign of Zedekiah. It would have been ful-
filled literally to that people if they had been true Israelites.
   3. Note the argument of the apostle. He says that taking out
of the Gentiles a people for His name agrees with all that the
prophets have spoken on that subject. He then quotes the
prophecy of Amos 9:11 as a sample of what the prophets have
spoken concerning the re-establishment of David's throne.

Revelation 14 call mankind? Note 7.
  16. What then must be the great test in the closing
message, to prepare a people for the closing hour of
God's judgment and the coining of the Lord? Eccl.
12:13, 14; Rev. 14:12.
                              Notes.
   i. "Adam and Eve received knowledge through direct com-
munion with God, and they learned of Him through His works.
All created things, in their original perfection, were an expression
of the thought of God. To Adam and Eve, nature was teeming
with divine wisdom. But by transgression man was cut off from
learning of God through direct communion, and, to a great de-
gree, through His works. The earth, marred and defiled by sin,
reflects but dimly the Creator's glory."—Education, page 16.
   2. "Adam had learned from the Creator the history of crea-
tion; he himself witnessed the events of nine centuries, and he
imparted his knowledge to his descendants. The antediluvians
were without books ; they had no written records, hut, with their
great physical and mental vigor, they had strong memories, able
to grasp and retain that which was communicated to them, and,
in turn, transmit it unimpaired to their posterity. And for hun-
 dreds of years there were nine, generations living upon the earth
contemporaneously, having the opportunity of consulting together
and profiting each by the knowledge and experience of all.
   "The advantages enjoyed by men of that age to gain a knowl-
 edge of God though His works have never been equaled since.
And, so far from being an era of religious darkness, that was an
age of great light. All the world had opportunity to receive
 instruction from Adam, and those who feared the Lord had also
 Christ and angels for their teachers. And they had a silent
 witness to the truth in the garden of God, which for so many

 centuries remained among them. . . . Of Enoch it is writ-
 ten that he lived sixty-five years, and begot a son. After that
 he walked with God three hundred years. During these earlier
 years, Enoch had loved and feared God and had kept His com-
 mandments. He was one of the holy line, the preservers of the
 true faith, the progenitors of the promised Seed. From the lips
 of Adam he had learned the dark story of the fall, and the
 cheering one of God's grace as seen in the promise; and he relied
 upon the Redeemer to come. . . . Enoch became a preacher
of righteousness, making known to the people what God had
 revealed to him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 83-86.
   3. "We beheld His glory." God's glory is His character; in
other words, it is just what He is. Jesus Christ came to this
 world and took humanity upon Him, that He might reveal the
character of God, which had been entirely misrepresented in the
territory usurped by Satan.
   4. "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power
thereof." God's power is inseparably connected with His char-
acter. It is impossible to speak of one without speaking of the
other. Therefore to deny the power of God is simply to deny
His character. And to deny His character is not to know Him.
With nature studied in the field of science, with the Bible in
every home, and Christ preached about in every pulpit in the
land, the character of God is wholly misunderstood.
   5. This great threefold message is a gathering up of every
ray of gospel light ever shed upon this world, and focusing that
light upon the last generation of mankind. It is a revelation
of Jesus Christ set forth in His Word and in the lives of His
believing children—"Christ in you the hope of glory." In
Christ's church the last generation of men is to see revelled the
glory of His character and His power to save.
   6. "Fear God and give glory to Him." This is an appeal .to
all who would be living when the light of these messages was
about to be unfolded to continue to walk in that light. When
the westering sun ,Of light and truth was shedding its last beams
upon the Jewish nation, God sent a similar message and appeal
      " There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
            GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                   27

to that people. "Give glory to the Lord your God, before He
cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark
mountains, and, while ye look for light, He turn it into the
shadow of death, and make it gross darkness." Jer. 13:16.
  7. "Worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
and the fountains of waters." Here is clearly an appeal to the
fourth commandment of the decalogue, calling attention of man-
kind to the downtrodden law of God as the great testing truth
for the world..

LESSON XL—The Second Angel's Message—The Fall
                of Babylon.

                      DECEMBER 12,   1903.
  Monory.:Tezt.—"We would have healed Babylon, but she is
not healed; . . . for her judgment reacheth unto heaven,
and is lifted up even to the skies." Jer. 51 :9.

28             GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.

   6. What is the advent message to accomplish? Isa.
4o:3, 4; 62:10, 1 I.
   7. From what way did the people stumble in Jere-
miah's day? Jer. 18:15.

    I. To what special reform as regards the law of God
does the final message call men? Isa. 56:1, 2, 6.
   12. As the continued rejection of the warning appeal
of the first message causes still greater darkness, how
is the message of the second angel emphasized? Rev.
18:1-3. Note 5.
   13. What cry from heaven is to be carried to all the
world in this generation? Rev. 18:4, 5.
                               Notes.
   i. Babylon Means confusion. The term originated at the time
of the building of the tower of Babel, when the language of
mankind was confounded. Babylon stands not only for confu-
sion, but for self-exaltation and all the spirit of the world. As
old Chaldea led in perverting God's truth, nearly all the false
doctrines that have cursed the world have their roots in Babylon
of old. The Papacy succeeded to the place of old Chaldea as
the power ruling over the minds of men, and, through it, human
traditions and the spirit of self-exaltation have permeated Chris-
tendom. Modern Babylon sums up the whole spirit of worldli-
ness, carnality, and the substitution of man's way for God's way
     The offerings for This quarter go to the most needy fields.
              GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                      29

that to-day is found in the world. Out of this the Lord calls
His people. Rev. 18:1-5.
   2. The result of rejecting light is a moral fall into darkness
and error. As noted in last week's lesson, the message of Rev-
elation 14 is a gathering into one great system of truth all the
 light of past ages. It was also noted that the great testing truth
 of this message is the fourth commandment of the decalogue.
Therefore the fall of Babylon must be a fall from the principles
and teaching of that law ; not from the outward formal recogni-
tion of the law merely, but from the living principle,—the law
in Christ Jesus within the heart. "The first angel's message of
Revelation 14, announcing the hour of God's judgment, and call-
ing upon men to fear and worship Him, was designed to separate
the professed people of God from the corrupting influences of
the world, and to arouse them to see their condition of worldli-
ness and backsliding. In this message God had sent to the
church a warning, which, had it been accepted, would liave cor-
rected the evils that were shutting them away from Him."
   "If God's professed people would receive the light as it shines
upon them from His Word, they would reach that unity for
which Christ prayed, that which the apostle describes, 'The
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.' There is,' he says,
one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of
your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism.' Such were
the blessed results experienced by those who accepted the Ad-
vent message. . . . If this doctrine did this for the few who
did receive it, it would have done the same for all, if all had
received it."
   3. The ten commandments are many times referred to as the
Lord's way. Note a few other expressions: "They also do no
iniquity; they walk in His ways." "Make me to understand the
way of Thy precepts." "I will run the way of Thy command-
ments." ''Teach me, 0 Lord, the way of Thy statutes." "Make
me to go in the, path of Thy commandments." "But they also

have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of
the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong
drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way
through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judg-
ment."
   4. The Inv of God is a great wall of protection to those who
walk therein. A breach has been made in that law. The Sab-
bath has been torn from its place in the bosom of the law, and
the "man of sin" has built up a wall of Sunday-keeping in its
place. Others have daubed this wall with "untempered mortar"
by trying to bolster up an unscriptural institution for which
there is no "thus saith the Lord."
   5. When Jerusalem of old rejected the light sent by the Lord's
prophets, it was declared, "As a cage full of birds, so are their
houses full of deceit; therefore they are become great, and waxen
rich." Jer. 5:27. And the call came to come out of her: "0 ye
children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst
of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa." Jer. 5:27; 6:1.
So also the rejection of light in the days of Christ and the apos-
tles led to a moral fall that filled Jerusalem again with every evil,
and brought upon it swift doom. Those times find their parallel
in the last days. As Jesus wept over Jerusalem's rejection of
light, looking down to the last generation, he "saw the world
involved in deception similar to that which caused the destruc-
tion of Jerusalem. The great sin of the Jews was their rejection
of Christ; the great sin of the Christian world would be their
rejection of the law of God, the foundation of His government
in Heaven and earth. The precepts of Jehovah would be de-
spised and set at naught. Millions in bondage to sin, slaves of
Satan, doomed to suffer the second death, would refuse to listen
to the words of truth in their day of visitation. Terrible blind-
ness! strange infatuation !"—Great Controversy, page 23.

LESSON XII—The Third Angel's Message—The

                       DECEMBER 19, 1903. •

  Memory Text.—"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled

    1o. When the seven last plagues are poured out, upon

     1. Who will escape these plagues? Rev. 15 :1, 2.
    12. What song will then be sung? Rev. 15:3. Note

                              Notes.
    1. The beast of Rev. 13:1-10 is a symbol of Rome, at the time
 when the religion of Rome became professedly Christian, or
 what we call the Papacy. "He that leadeth into captivity shall
 go into captivity." Rome, during the reign of the Papacy, led
 the people of God into captivity. In A. D. 1798 that power,
 which had held sovereignty over the kings of earth for 126o
 years, herself' went into captivity, and received a deadly wound.
 In that year the pope was taken prisoner by the French, and,
 for a time, some thought that the end of the papal power was
 at hand.
   2. The whole question of the change of the Sabbath will be
 studied later, so we notice it but briefly here. The following
 from Doctrinal Catechism, page 174, shows the claims of Rome:
"Question.—Have you any other way of proving that the church
has power to institute festivals of precept?" Answer.—Had she
not such power, she could not have done that in which all mod-
ern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted
the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the
observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which
there is no scriptural authority."
   3. The Papacy went into captivity in A. D. 1798. At that
time John saw this other power "coming up out of the earth."
Other symbolic beasts of prophecy had been seen coming up from
the sea, denoting their rise as the result of war and conquest
among the nations and peoples of the earth. This one coming
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
            • GOD'S KINGDOM IN THIS WORLD.                       33

up out of the earth indicates that about the year 1798 we should
look for a nation just coming into prominence, not among the
nations of the world, but occupying new territory. The nation,
and the only one in the world, meeting these and other specifi-
cations of the prophecy is the United States of America. The
influence of this nation for the first hundred years of its history,
standing as it did for the great principles of religious freedom,
held in check religious intolerance in the nations of the old
world. But when this nation repudiates those principles herself,
then it will be that by her influence she will say "to them that
dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast."
  4. Men will be threatened with death by an earthly power for
refusing to worship the beast; while, on the other hand, the
Lord threatens the seven last plagues and eternal death upon all
who do render such worship. The choice will then be between
the worship of the true God, as revealed in this great threefold
message, or the worship of Satan, as revealed in the beast and
his image.
  5. Wrath without mixture of mercy has never as yet fallen
upon the inhabitants of this world. Such can never be the case
until Christ, our great High Priest, steps down from the media-
torial throne.
  6. "The song of Moses" was a song of mighty deliverance of
God's people, when, from a human point of view, there was no
escape from death at the hand of Pharaoh and his proud hosts.
That song was one of experience, and can only be sung by those
who pass through a similar experience.

            "The ungodly cities of our world are to
       be swept away by the besom of destruction.
       In the calamities that are now befalling im-
       mense buildings and large portions of cities,
       God is showing us what will come upon the
       whole earth."
            As I recently rode down the Kansas River
        Valley and walked through some of its ruined
       towns, the above quotation from the Spirit of
       Prophecy came to my mind again and again.
        The question that followed it was, "How can
       I help show those with whom I have to do,
       that this is one of the signs of the limes and
       that others will soon follow." The answer
       came clear and plain, "God has an appointed
       pioneer periodical which has been given us for
       this very purpose—THE SIGNS OF THE
       TIMES."
           My brother, my sister, I am going to
       use this paper as never before. Will you
       unite with me?
