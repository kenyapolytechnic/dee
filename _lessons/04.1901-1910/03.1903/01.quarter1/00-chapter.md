     LESSON I.—The Greatness of Jehovah.

                        JANUARY 3.

                 •   PSALM 104 :1-12,
    •
 Bless Jehovah, 0 my soul.
0 Jehovah my God, Thou art very great ;
 Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
 Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment ;
 Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain ;
 Who layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters;
 Who maketh the clouds His chariot;
 Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
 Who maketh winds His messengers ;
 Flames of fire His ministers ;
 Who laid the foundations of the earth,
 That it should not be moved forever.
 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;
 The waters stood above the mountains.
 At Thy rebuke they fled ;
 At the voice of Thy thunder they basted away       _
 (The mountains rose, the valleys sank)—'     --
 Unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them.
 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
 That they turn not again to cover the earth.

 The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy.fields.
4                STUDIES IN THE PSALMS. '

    He sendeth forth springs into the valleys;
    They run among the mountains;
    They give drink to every beast of the field;
    The wild asses quench their thirst.
    By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation;
    They sing among the branches.
                          Questions.
    I. With what exhortation does this psalm open?
    2. What general statement is then made concerning
the being of Jehovah?
    3. With what is Jehovah arrayed?
    4. What serves as a robe for Him?
    5. What has He done to the heavens?
    6. Where has He built His chambers?
    7. To what use does He put the clouds?
    8. Upon what does He walk?
    9. What does He use as His messengers?
        What does He use as His ministers?
    1. How permanently has He founded the earth?
  12. With what was the earth at one time covered?
  13. How high did the waters stand?
  14. What caused the waters to recede?
  15. For what reason did they speedily retire?
  16. What changes took place in the surface of the
earth?
  17. What disposition was made of the waters?
  18. How are they held in their appointed place?
  19. What are they thus prevented from doing?

forth?

                         our held.

  21. Where do they wend their way?
   22. What need of the animal kingdom is thus sup-
plied?
   23. What animals are thus able to quench their thirst?
                             Notes.
   This psalm sets forth the greatness of Jehovah the Creator,
the Provider, and the Ruler of the world. Its purpose is "to
make man bow in lowly faith before God's boundless wisdom,
believing that He, whose power created, and whose providence
rules, the whole order of nature, is no less wonderful in His
governance of the moral world. He never mistakes."
   "The whole natural world is designed to be an interpreter of
the things of God. . . . As the works of God are studied,
the Holy Spirit flashes conviction into the mind. It is not
the conviction which logical reasoning produces ; but, unless
the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye too dim
to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning
is grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the written Word
are impressed on the heart. . . . God has, in the natural
world, placed in the hands of the children of men the key to
unlock the treasure-house of His Word. The unseen is illus-
trated by the seen; divine wisdom, eternal truth, infinite grace,
are understood by the things that God has made."
   With verse 2 compare i John i :5; Gen. t :2, 3; 2 Cor. 4 :6.
   Observe the use made of verse 4 in Heb.
   There is undoubted reference to the flood in verses 6-9. Al-
though the record states that "the fountains of the great deep
[were] broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened,"
and that the waters were assuaged by a wind which passed
over the earth, yet it was none the less directly the personal
act of God which brought the flood, and it was at His rebuke
 that the waters fled. The so-called operations of nature are in
 truth the operations of God, and the so-called laws of nature

"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."
 6               STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

 are but the habitual methods of God's working. By studying
 the things which God has made, and observing the working
 of His power in upholding and caring for them, we may become
 acquainted with that power which is the essential feature of
 the gospel. Rom. I :16-2o.

                              Pfr



           LESSON 11.—The Great Provider.
                        JANUARY 10.

                     PSALM   104:13-24.
      He watereth the mountains from His chambers ;
      The earth is filled with the fruit of Thy works.
      He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
      And herb for the service of man ;
      That He may bring forth food out of the earth,
      And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
      And oil to make his face to shine,
      And bread that strengtheneth man's heart.
      The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture,
      The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;
      Where the birds make their nests ;
      As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
      The high mountains are for the wild goats ;
      The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
     He appointed the moon for seasons;
     The sun knoweth his going down.
     Thou makest darkness, and it is night,
     Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
     The young lions roar after their prey,
     And seek their food from God.
     The sun ariseth, they get them away,
     And lay them down in their dens.
     Man goeth forth unto his work
     And to his labor until the evening.
     0 Jehovah, how manifold are Thy works !
     In wisdom hast Thou made them all ;
     The earth is full of Thy riches.

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

                        Questions.
    i. What part of the animal kingdom find a home

    7. What purpose is carried out by this working?
    8. What is thus supplied to gladden man?

8                 STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

  21. What do these animals do at the dawn of day?
  22. For whom has the day been appointed as the sea-
son of labor?
  23. What is said of the works of Jehovah? How
have they been wrought?
  24. With what is the earth filled?
                             Notes.
  Although the ground was cursed on account of the sin of
man (Gen. 3:17), yet the power of God is working through it
to supply His creatures with food. This is a revelation of the
power of the cross of Christ in overcoming the curse.
  From verses 14, 15, we may learn that food, both for man
and beast, is the gift of God. Read John 6:5-12, 27, 32-35, and
note the explanation thus given of the annual miracle of multi-
plying the loaves to feed the world.
  Before sin came into the world and brought so many artificial
conditions, man was in much closer touch with his Maker. "The
sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they were clothed with
a covering of light and glory such as the angels wear. So long
as they lived in obedience to God, this robe of light continued
to enshroud them." "It was the work of Adam and Eve to
train the branches of the vine to form bowers, thus making for
themselves a dwelling from living trees covered with foliage
and fruit." Although the animal creation has been involved
in the suffering consequent upon sin, yet the trees still consti-
tute a home for the birds, the mountains for the goats, and the
rocks for the conies.
  When the young lions roar after their prey, God regards it
as a call upon Him for food. Work was not imposed upon man
as a punishment for sin. The Father and the Son are both
workers. John 5 :17. The experience of weariness and of
wearing out while working is, however, one of the results of sin.
  With verse 24 compare Prov. 3:19, 20 and Jer. 10:12. There

       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
                STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.                    9
is creative power in divine wisdom and true knowledge. "The
true higher education is what makes students acquainted with
God and His Word, and fits them for eternal life."




     LESSON 111.—God's Care for His Creatures.
                        JANUARY 17.
                     PSALM 104 :25-35.
Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
Wherein are things creeping [moving] innumerable,
Both small and great beasts [living creatures].
There go the ships;
There is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to play therein.
These wait all for Thee,
That Thou mayest give them their food in due season.
Thou,givest unto them, they gather ;
Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
Thou hidest Thy face, they are troubled;
Thou takest away their breath, they die,
And return to their dust.
Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created;
And Thou renewest the face of the ground.
Let the glory of Jehovah endure forever;
Let Jehovah rejoice in His works;,
Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;
He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live;
I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
Let my meditation be sweet unto Him;
I will rejoice in Jehovah.
Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.
And let the wicked be no more.
Bless Jehovah, 0 my soul.
Praise ye Jehovah.
                           Questions.
    I. What description is given of the sea?
    2. What are found in it?
           Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
Id                STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

    3. In what way does the sea serve the purposes of
commerce?
    4. What sea-monster sports in the water?
     5. What is the attitude of all these creatures
toward their Creator?
    6. What do they expect from Him?
    7. What part does God act in the matter?
    8. What part do these living creatures act?
    9. How fully does God supply the needs of His
creatures?
   10. What brings His creatures into distress?
   I 1. What causes their death? To what do they then
return?
   12. By what agency are they recreated?
   13. What change is thus made in the condition of the
earth?
   14. What desire is expressed concerning the glory of
Jehovah?
   15. How much satisfaction is it desired that Jehovah
shall take in His works?
   16. How much power is there in a look of Jehovah?
   17. How much power is there in His touch?
   18. What vow does the psalmist make to Jehovah?
  19. To what does he say that his whole life shall be
devoted?
  20. What desire does he express concerning his
meditation?
  21. What does he declare shall be the basis of his
rejoicing?

"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
                 STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.                     II

  22.   What experience awaits the sinners?
  23.   What will become of the wicked?
  24.   What exhortation is now repeated?
  25.   What significant word closes the psalm?
                            Notes.
  Still the psalmist sings of the eternal mercies of God and His
wonderful providence. Now he shows that divine care is over
even the innumerable forms of life beneath the broad expanse
of the ocean. All wait upon God, and not one is forgotten.
Luke 12:6, 7, 24. But that which is given, "they gather." Busy
activity is the law of life for all creatures.
  "The Lord shall rejoice in His works." See Ps. 147:11 ;
Zeph. 3:16, 17. The earth itself is represented as responding
to a look from the Creator. This sensitiveness of all creation
to the touch of God leads the psalmist to declare his purpose .
to meditate on God's care and glory continually. The advent
idea pervades the psalms. Here is the divinely-inspired prayer
for the blotting out of sin, which mars creation. It is the same
prayer that closes the book of Revelation. Rev. 22:20.




LESSON IV.—An Exhortation to Make Known the
          Wondrous Works of God.
                         JANUARY 24.
                      PSALM 105 :1-13.
Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon His name ;
Make known among the peoples His doings.
Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him ;
Talk ye of all His marvelous works.
Glory ye in His holy name;

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
               forth laborers into His harvest."
12                STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
Seek ye Jehovah and His strength ;
Seek His face evermore.
Remember His marvelous works that He hath done,
His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,
0 ye seed of Abraham His servant,
Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
He is Jehovah our God;,
His judgments are in all the earth.
He hath remembered His covenant forever,
The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
The covenant which He made with Abraham,
And His oath unto Isaac,
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute,
To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
The lot of your inheritance;
When they were but a few men in number,
Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
And they went about from nation to nation,
From one kingdom to another people.
                          Questions.
      1. With what urgent appeal does this psalm open?
      2. What are we asked to make known?
      3. How is praise to Jehovah to be expressed?
      4. What is to be kept before the mind?
      5. In what is all boasting to be done?
      6. What brings rejoicing to the heart?
      7. What are to be always sought?
      8. What are to be called to mind?
      9. How are these works specially mentioned?
     io. Who are first called upon to do this?
      1. How are they further designated?
     12. What relationship is declared between us and God?
     13. Where are His judgments to be found?
 "The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                       watchword.
                  STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.                        13

  14. What has God never forgotten?
  Is. How is this covenant defined?
  16. With whom did He make this covenant?
  17. What is it called as renewed to-Isaac?
  18. How was it renewed to Jacob?
  19. What is it next declared to be?
  zo. What gift was promised in this covenant?
  21. How is this gift defined?
  22. Under what circumstances was this promise made?
  23. What experience did the people have even after
this promise was made?
                              Notes.
   Continuing the subject of the previous lesson, the psalmist
exhorts us to call upon the name of the Lord, giving thanks
to Him. He would have this done intelligently, and so suggests
that the deeds of the Most High be made known among the
people, both in song and in conversation with our associates.
This, followed out, would work reform in many ways.
   We in these last days are especially to consider the dealing of
God with His children in olden times. Isa.            ; Ps. 44:1-3.
   Notice the promise to Abraham (Gen. 13 :14-17), oath con-
firmed to Isaac (Gen. 26:2-5), and then to Jacob (Gen. 35:10-12).
It is the promise of the inheritance and everlasting life through
faith. Gal. 3:29.


        LESSON V.—God's Care for His People.
                           JANUARY 31.
                       PSALM I05:14-25.
      He suffered no man to do them wrong;
      Yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,

       "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
14               STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

      Saying, Touch not Mine anointed ones,
      And do My prophets no harm.
      And He called for a famine upon the land;
      He brake the whole staff of bread.
      He sent a man before them;
      Joseph was sold for a servant;
      His feet they hurt with fetters;
      He was laid in chains of iron,
      Until the time that his word came to pass,
      The word of Jehovah tried him.
      The king sent and loosed him;
      Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
      He made him lord of his house,
      And ruler of all his substance;
      To bind his princes at his pleasure,
      And teach his elders wisdom.
      Israel also came into Egypt;
      And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
      And He increased His people greatly,
      And made them stronger than their adversaries.
      He turned their heart to hate His people,
      To deal subtly with His servants.
                         Questions.
    I. To what extent did God protect His people in their
j ourneyings?
    2. Did He show respect of persons in this matter?
    3. What warning did He give to the enemies of His
people?
    4. What experience did He bring upon the sojourners
in the land of promise?
    5. What support did He remove from them?
    6. How did He provide for their deliverance?
    7. In what way did the deliverer enter the land of
Egypt?
    8. Through what experience did Joseph pass?
"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                     already to harvest."
                 STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.                      15
    9. To what test was He subjected? For how long
a time
   1o. At whose command was he released?
    1. On whose authority was he restored to freedom?
   12. To what position was Joseph now elevated?
   13. What control did he have over the king's property?
   14. What power did he have over other persons of
high rank?
   15. What was his standing as a teacher?
   16. Who then came into the land of the Pharaohs?
   17. Where did he become a sojourner?
   18. What did God then do for His people?
   19. How great did their power become as compared
with their enemies?
   20. What change did God make in the feelings of their
adversaries toward them?
   21. What did He lead their adversaries to do?
                             Notes.
  The Lord promises. to care for those who do the right and
trust Him. See Gen: 35:5 : Ps. 34:7; Exodus 24.
  Over and over,' in the story of reform and missionary effort,
God's invisible hand has restrained, and His voice said to savage
hearts, "Touch not Mine anointed." In the Story of his life
among the South Sea cannibals, John G. Paton says of one
occasion :—
  "A club was raised to follow the blow of the 'killing-stone,
but God baffled the aim. They encircled us in a deadly ring,
and one kept urging another to strike the first blow, or fire
the first shot. . . . The host of armed men also ran along
on each side with their weapons ready; but, leaving everything
to Jesus, I ran on as if they were my escort. If any reader

wonders how they were restrained, much more would I, unless
I believed the same Hand that restrained the lions from touch-
ing Daniel held back these savages from hurting me."
  The Lord sent Joseph into Egypt, overruling the evil purpose
of his brethren. God uses even the wrath of men to praise
Him, and, whatever men do to us, we are in His hands. That
which Jacob thought against him (Gen. 42:36) was being worked
for him by God.
   Notice that it was the blessings God gave Israel in Egypt that
turned against them the hatred of the people of the land.




LESSON 171.—God's Power Manifested in Deliverance.
                          FEBRUARY 7.
                      PSALM 105 :26-38.
     He sent Moses His servant,
     And Aaron whom He had chosen.
     They set among them His signs,
     And wonders in the land of Ham.
     He sent darkness, and made it dark;
     And they rebelled not against His words.
     He turned their waters into blood,
     And slew their fish.
     Their land swarmed with frogs
     In the chambers of their kings.
     He spake, and there came swarms of flies,
     And lice in all their borders.
     He gave them hail for rain,
     And flaming fire in their land.
     He smote their vines also and their fig trees,
     And brake the trees of their borders.
     He spake, and the locust came,
     And the grasshopper, and that without number,
     And did eat up every herb in their land,
     And did eat up the fruit of their ground.

We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.

  He smote also all the first-born in their land,
  The chief of all their strength.
  And He brought them forth with silver and gold;
  And there was not one feeble person among His tribes.
  Egypt was glad when they departed;
  For -the fear of them had fallen upon them.
                         Questions.
    1. Whom did God send to lead out His people?,
    2. Who was associated with him in the work?

deliverance?

  15. Did God's people depart empty-handed from the
land of bondage?
  16. What was their physical condition?
  17. How did their oppressors feel about their depart-
ure?
  18. What led to this changed condition of things?
                               Notes.
   Read also Ps. 78:43-52.
   Moses' preparation for service deserves more than casual
study. That decree which brought sadness and gloom into the
 homes of the Hebrews was used by the Lord to fit the man
 whom He had chosen to lead His people out of Egypt when the
 .ulness of the time should come.
   The circumstances which would not permit Moses' parents to
 rear him in their own home led to his being placed where he'
could receive the training and education that would fit him to be
Israel's future leader.
   Note Moses' fidelity to God when the crisis came in his life
 (Heb. 55:23-26); read also Ps. 84 :11; and the hope which
buoyed him up in these trying hours (Heb. II :26, 39, 4o).
   But Moses' preparation was not complete when he had served
in the Egyptian court. Forty years were spent in the solitude
of the mountains, where he could become acquainted with God.
Read "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 251.
   Do not fail to observe the practical lessons in the life of Moses.
   A study of the plagues reveals the fact that they seemed to
be designed to destroy the confidence of the Egyptians in the
power and protection of their idols. Note 5 in the Appendix to
"Patriarchs and Prophets" will throw some light on this sub-
ject. By reference to the history itself (Exodus 7 to 13), we
find that some of the Egyptians did have their faith shaken in
their idols, and saw in these things the finger of God. See also
"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 279.

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.
                 . STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

  "The plagues upon Egypt were similar in character to those
more terrible and extensive judgments which are to fall upon
the world just before ]the final deliverance of God's people."
Ps. 91:1, 10. Now, while Jesus still intercedes for us, the prepa-
ration must be made that will enable us to stand in the trying
times before us.

    LESSON VIL—God's Purpose in Deliverance.
                          FEBRUARY 14.
                      PSALM 105 :39-45.
He spread a cloud for a covering,
And fire to give light in the night.
They asked, and He brought quails,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock, and waters gushed out ;
They ran in the dry places like a river.
For He remembered His holy word,
And Abraham His servant.
And He brought forth His people with joy,
And His chosen with singing.
And He gave them the lands of the nations;
And they took the labor of the peoples in possession;
That they might keep His statutes,
And observe His laws.
Praise ye Jehovah [Hallelujah].
                       PSALM 106 :1-5.
Praise ye Jehovah.
Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for He is good;
For His loving-kindness endureth forever.
Who can utter the mighty acts 'of Jehovah,
Or show forth all His praise?
Blessed are they that keep justice,
And He that doeth righteousness at all times.
Remember me, 0 Jehovah, with the favor that Thou bearest
      unto Thy people ;
Oh visit me with Thy salvation,
That I may see the prosperity of Thy chosen,
That I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation,
That I may glory with Thine inheritance.

         The needs of the cause of God are world wide.

  22. What is the first expected result of a favorable

                             Notes.

   Ps. 78:14; i Cor. 10:1, 2; Ps. 84:11 should be studied with
verse 39.
  "By day the cloud directed the journeyings, or spread as a
canopy above the host. It served as a protection from the burn-
ing heat, and by its coolness and moisture afforded grateful
refreshment in the parched, thirsty desert. By night it became
a pillar of fire, illuminating their encampment, constantly assur-
ing them of divine presence." Read Isa. 4:5, 6. "Here refer-
ence is made to the pillar of cloud and of fire to represent God's
care for His people in the great final struggle with the power
of evil."
  The cloud that flooded the entire encampment of the Hebrews
with the radiance of day was a wall of darkness to the , Egyp-
tians. Read with this Ps. 77:17, 18, R. V. and "Patriarchs and
Prophets," page 287. The way that God marks out for His
people will be flooded with light, although the unbelieving will
not see it.
   The manna was a type of Jesus, the Bread of life. John
6:48-51. Read also Rev. 2:17; 1 Cor. 1o:3.
   With verse' 41 read Ps. 78:15, 16. "Moses smote the rock,
but it was the Son of God who, veiled in the cloudy pillar, stood
beside Moses, and caused the life-giving water to flow." Ps.
65:9; Rev. 22:1; I Cor. 10 :4; John 4:13, 14; 7:37, 38.
   Verse 42; Gen. 15:12-14, and Acts 7:6, 7, record the covenant
with Abraham. For the blessing of this covenant to Abraham's
seed and heirs according to the promise, see Heb. 6:11-20.
   Verse 43, with Ps. 116:12, s3•, Psalm 33.
   God brought forth His people that they might observe His
statutes and keep His laws. The same is true in regard to
His people to-day.
   In all these experiences God designed to teach His people
their utter dependence upon Him, and not merely on the man
Moses, who was their leader.

     LESSON VI11.—Experiences of Israel for Our
                    Learning.
                         FEBRUARY 21.

                      PSALM 106 :6-20.
We have sinned with our fathers,
We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Our fathers understood not Thy wonders in Egypt;
They remembered not the multitude of Thy loving-kindnesses,
But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake,
That He might make His mighty power to be known.
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;
So He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
And the waters covered their adversaries;
There was not one of them left.
Then believed they His words;
They sang His praise.
They soon forgat His works ;
They waited not for His counsel,
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
And tempted God in the desert.
And He gave them their request,
But sent leanness into their soul.
They envied Moses also in the camp,
And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
And covered the company of Abiram.
And a fire was kindled in their company;
The flame burned up the wicked.
They made a calf in Horeb,
And worshiped a molten image.
Thus they changed their glory
For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.

"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

  28. In what way did they express their estimate of
their Deliverer?
                             Notes.
   This psalm opens with an exhortation to praise and thanks-
giving and the acknowledgment that God's people to-day are
repeating the history of His chosen people in the wilderness.
   Verse 7. Observe how extensively this experience is being
repeated in the lives of the majority of professed Christians.
How rarely the multitude of God's mercies are recounted! This
is the source of strength, the means by which Satan will always
be defeated.
   Verse 8. God is now gathering out a people for His name.
Acts 15:14. We may not only be among that people, but we
may share in gathering them, with this closing message, from
every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Through this people
God will make known His mighty power; for He will vindicate
His righteous character before the universe. This is the highest
reason that can be assigned for God's great love in pardoning
and saving sinners. Compare Eze. 36:22, 32; Isa. 43:25; 48:9;
Jer. 14:7; Ps. 6:4; 23:3; 25:11; 31:16.
   The song of Moses (Ex. 15:1-16) does not belong to the
Jewish people alone. It points forward to the final victory, when
the Israel of God will sing not only the song of Moses, but the
song of the Lamb (Rev. 15:2, 3). Those who will sing that
song of triumph then must learn to sing it now.

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His. harvest."

  Ps. 5o :23 ; 67 :5 ; 146 :2.
  "The history of the wilderness life of Israel was chronicled
for the benefit of the Israel of God to the close of tinie. The
varied experience of the Hebrews was a school of preparation
for their promised home in Canaan. God would have His
people in these days review with a humble heart and teachable
spirit the trials through which ancient Israel passed, that they
may be instructed in their preparation for the heavenly Canaan."

     LESSON IX.—Experiences in the Wilderness.
                         FEBRUARY   28.

                      PSALM I06 :21-33.
They forgat God their Saviour,
Who had done great things in Egypt,
Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
And terrible things by the Red Sea.
Therefore He said that He would destroy them,
Had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach,
To turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them.
Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
They believed not His word,
But murmured in their tents,
And harkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
Therefore He sware unto them,
That He would overthrow them in the wilderness,
And that He would overthrow their seed among the nations,
And scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,
And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Thus they provoked Him to anger with their doings ;
And the plague brake in upon them.

  "The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                         watchword.
26              STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;
And so the plague was stayed.
And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,
Unto all generations forevermore.
They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah,
So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes ;
Because they were rebellious against His Spirit,
And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

     I. How far did God's people neglect Him?
    2. What reason had God given them for remember-
 ing Him?
    3. What was the character of the works He had

them?
    I. What would become of their seed?
   12. How would He bring an end to their national
existence?
   13. In what way did they show their complete apostasy

      17. What was the result of his action?
      18. What permanent blessing did the mediation of

      20. What influence did this have upon the experience

      2I. .How did the people treat Moses?
      22. What did this lead him to do?

                                 Notes.
       Unsanctified memory is a treacherous thing. Notice how con-
    tinually the peoplejorgot God and His deliverances, and remem-
    bered the trials and difficulties. They remembered the leeks
    and onions of Egypt, but forgot the bitterness of their bondage.
    Let us count the mercies, and forget not the. Lord's benefits.
       When Moses plead with God for the people, he based his
    plea for pardon upon the covenant with Abraham (Ex. 32:11-13),
    the promise of forgiveness and righteousness by faith in Christ.
       Many of the people, as they journeyed, lost sight of the aim
    of the movement, and did not believe the promise of an inherit-
    ance, hence the murmuring by the way. Now, with the in-
    heritance just before us, let no one murmur in his tent. There
    is where it usually begins,—in the home.
       At Baal-peor they ate the sacrifices that had been offered to
    the dead, joined in the heathen rites of ancient Spiritualism.
    As ancient Israel had to contend with this delusion, so in these
    last days the deceptive doctrines of spiritualism, theosophy, and
    such like, are spreading abroad to ensnare souls. But the very
    increase of Satan's deceptions is evidence that the time is short.

         LESSON X.—The Result of Disobedience.
                             MARCH 7.
                        PSALM 106 :34-48.
They did not destroy the peoples,
As Jehovah commanded them,
But mingled themselves with the nations,
And learned their works,
And served their idols,
Which became a snare unto them.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
And shed innocent blood,
Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;
And the land was polluted with blood.
Thus were they defiled with their works,
And played the harlot in their doings.
Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against His people,
And He abhorred His inheritance.
And He gave them into the hand of the nations;
And they that hated them ruled over them.
Their enemies also oppressed them,
And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Many times did He deliver them;
But they were rebellious in their counsel,
And were brought low in their iniquity.
Nevertheless He regarded their distress,
When He heard their cry;
And He remembered for them His covenant,            '
And repented according to the multitude of His loving-
      kindnesses.
He made them also to be pitied
Of all those that carried them captive.
Save us, 0 Jehovah our God,
And gather us from among the nations,
To give thanks unto Thy holy name,
And to triumph in Thy praise.
Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
From everlasting even to everlasting.
And let all the people say, Amen.
Praise ye Jehovah.

  23. What response are the people to make?
  24. What significant word closes the psalm?
                              Notes.
  The book of Judges is the story of repeated apostasy and
rebellion and deliverances. The second chapter shows how
compromise with the world caused the troubles of the people.
A precious lesson for times of distress is that in Judges 6:12-14.
  The prayer of the psalmist in verse 47 is especially appropriate
for these days, when God is gathering out His people from
among the nations to triumph in His praise. There is triumph
in praise, as there is defeat in murmuring. In the gathering
of His people in these last days, we are to see again His power
to deliver and save as in ancient days. Jer. 16:14, 15; Isa.
II :10-12. Review the whole psalm, and see how much mur-
muring and apostasy would have been saved had people but
trusted God. The psalm begins and ends with the same cry,
"Hallelujah." It is the battle-cry of Christian warfare.

          LESSON XL—Deliverance from Sin.
                           MARCH 14.
                     PSALM 107 :1-16.
0 give thanks unto Jehovah; for He is good;
For His loving-kindness endureth forever.
Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so,
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."
                StUIMES IN THE PSALMS.                   t
Whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
And gathered out of .the lands,
From the east and from the west,
From the north and from the south.
They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way ;
They found no city of habitation.
Hungry and thirsty,
Their soul fainted in them.
Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He delivered them out of their distresses,
He led them also by a straight way,
That they might go to a city of habitation.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men !
For He satisfieth the longing soul,
And the hungry soul He filleth with good.
Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
Being bound in affliction and iron,
Because they rebelled against the words of God,
And contemned the counsel of the Most High; •
Therefore He brought down their heart with labor ;
They fell down, and there was none to help.
Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He saved them out of their distresses.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
And brake their bonds in sunder.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men !
For He hath broken the gates of brass,
And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
                        Questions.
   1. With what exhortation does the psalm open?
    2. What is the first reason given for this? The
second?
    3. What class is urged to bear this testimony?
   4. From whom have they been redeemed?
    5. Whence have they been gathered?
   6. From what parts of the earth have they been
brought?
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

   7. Where have the people wandered?
   8. What were they unable to find?
   9. What was their condition? How did this affect
their courage?
  io. Upon whom did they then call?
   1. How did He answer their petition?
  12. How did He save them from their wanderings?
  13. For what purpose did He direct their course?
  14. What are men exhorted to do? For what rea-

  Is. How does He deal with the longing soul?
  16. What does He do for the hungry soul?
  17. What class of persons is next introduced?
  18. How strongly is their bondage represented?
  19. What has brought them into this condition?
  20. How has Jehovah disciplined them?
  21. What was their experience?
  22. Upon whom did they then call?
  23. How did He answer their petition?
  24. From what did He deliver them?
  25. How did He deliver them from their bondage?
  26. What are men exhorted to do? For what reasons?
  27. With what power has He wrought to deliver from
captivity?
                           Notes.
  We are not merely to think it, but to say it, that the Lord is
good. The more the redeemed of the Lord say it, the deeper
sense of His goodness will they have. It is wonderful how
much help one may receive by the earnest effort to tell others
how good the Lord is. Let us open our mouths and say it out.
Heb. 13:15.
        The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
                  STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.                       33
  God led the people forth "by the right way." The ways of
the Lord are -right. In Christ, the. Way, we have deliverance
from sin, from the power of the enemy. See the song of
Zacharias. Luke i :68-75. The record of the deliverances of a
whole people is but the history of the work of God in our
own hearts, the defeats, the victories, and the leadings in indi-
vidual experiences.
  Rebellion (verse II) is the cause of our troubles. Jesus, our
example, received teaching and discipline, and was not rebellious.
Isa. 50 :4-10.
  When they fell down and there was none to help, then came
deliverance, as they called on God. What assurance of victory
in verses 12-14 of this psalm! Not a soul should pass this les-
son, surely, without accepting deliverance; for every bond is
loosed and every bar cut asunder.




  LESSON X11.—A Saviour from Sin and Distress.
                           MARCH 21.
                      PSALM 107 :17-32.
Fools because of their transgression,
And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Their soul abhorreth all manner of food;
And they draw near unto the gates of death.
Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He saveth them out of their distresses.
He sendeth His word, and healeth them.
And delivereth them from their destructions.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness.
And for His wonderful works to the children of men !
And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
And declare His works with singing.
They that go down to the sea in ships.
That do business in great waters;
These see the works of Jehovah,
And His wonders in the deep.
        The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
34              STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

For He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They mount up to the heavens,
They go down again to the depths;
Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
And are at their wits' end.
Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
And He bringeth them out of their distresses.
He maketh the storm a calm,
So that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad because they are quiet ;
So He bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!
Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,
And praise Him in the seat of the elders.
                          Questions.
    1. What brings suffering upon foolish people?
    2. How does this affect their desire for food?
    3. To what extremity are they brought?
    4. Upon whom do they then call?
    5. How does He answer their petitions?
    6. Through what instrumentality does He save them
from disease?
    7. To what extent does He save them?
    8. What are men exhorted to do? For what reasons?
    9. What sacrifice are they urged to offer?
   1o. How should they make known His deeds?
    r. How is the life of seafaring men described?
  12. What do they have the opportunity to observe?
   13. What is the direct cause of the storm wind?
   14. What effect does the wind have upon the water?
   15. Through what trying experiences do the sailors
pass?
          Prayerfully consider the unentered fields.
                 STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.                       35

  16. What effect do these experiences have upon them?
  17. How does the roughness of the sea affect their
gait?
  18. To what extremity of trouble are they reduced?
  19. Upon whom do they then call?
  zo. How does He answer their petitions?
  21. What change does He at once bring about?
  22. What state of mind prevails among the sailors be-
cause of this?
  23. How does their voyage end?
  24. What are men exhorted to do? For what reasons?
  25. How public should this acknowledgment of God's
goodness be?
  26. Where should praise be offered?
                             Notes.
  With verse 19 many illustrations may be drawn from Old and
New Testament history, showing God's speedy deliverance when
His people sought Him. Jacob, the children of Israel .      before
the Red Sea, Daniel, the three Hebrews in Babylon, Hezekiah,
Peter, Paul, and many other instances, will suggest themselves.
  The power of His Word (Ps. 33:6-9) heals the sick. With
verse 30, read Matt. 8:8; Luke 7:7; Ps. 103:2-4; Isa. 53:4, R. V.,
margin.
  The experience recorded in Mark 4:36-40 is an excellent com-
ment on verses 23-30. He who created the sea can speak peace
to its troubled waters. But still more precious is the promise
of peace to the troubled soul that calls upon Him. John 14:27;
16:33; Rom. 5:I ; Phil. 4:6, 7. There is power in His Word to
perform that which He speaks. "All His biddings are enab-
lings."
   The last verse of the lesson makes clear the obligation to
speak God's praise in the public congregation. Mal. 3:16-18.
This is especially enjoined upon those who see the end approach-
ing. Heb." 10 :25.

  "The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                        watchword.

     LESSON XI11.—The Wisdom of the Righteous.
                          MARCH 28.
                     PSALM 107 :33-43.
He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
And water-springs into a thirsty ground;
A fruitful land into a salt desert,
For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
And a dry land into water-springs.
And there He maketh the hungry to dwell,
That they may prepare a city of habitation,
And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
And get them fruits of increase.
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
And He suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Again, they are diminished and bowed down
Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
He poureth contempt upon princes,
And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no
      way.
Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction,
And maketh him families like a flock.
The upright shall see it, and be glad;
And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Whoso is wise will give heed to these things ;
And they will consider the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah.

                          Questions.
     T. What change is God able to make in the flowing
streams?
    2. What change can He make in the springs?
    3. Into what is He able to turn productive land?
    4. What leads to such a reversal of the usual order
of things?
    5. What change can God make in the desert? In
dry ground?
       "There shall be delay _no longer"—our confidence.
                 STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.                       37
    6. For whom is a dwelling-place thus provided?
    7. What will they prepare?
    8. What labor will they undertake? With what
result??
    9. What blessing is bestowed upon their homes?
   10. What temporal blessing is also bestowed upon
them?
    I. What different experience is brought upon them?
Through what means?
   12. Flow is the vanity of human greatness made
apparent?
   13. How are men of high rank shown that their way
is not in themselves?
   14. What blessing is bestowed upon the needy?
   15. What blessings come to them in their home life?
   16. How will the righteous regard these experiences?
   17. What effect will they have upon evil-disposed
persons?
   18. How will the wise treat these lessons?
   19. What will they observe in these dealings of
Jehovah with men?
                             Notes.
  While verses 33 to 37 show God's marvelous power to- pro-
vide for His people, even in solitary places, an experience which
awaits every faithful child of God before the final triumph of
His work, there is no doubt that they also refer to the wondrous
provision He has made for His people in the new earth, when
the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. Isaiah 35; also
65 :17-25.

"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white
                    already to harvest:"
38                   STUDIES IN THE PSALMS.

  Verses 38 to 42 are a wonderful commentary on that familiar
verse, Roin. 8:28. Everything is in the hands of God. If there
is prosperity, it conies from Him; if there are reverses, He
permits them. God deals with man in the best way that will
cause him to recognize his Creator. The righteous see these
things, and rejoice now, and the time is coming when' even the
mouth of the wicked will be led to acknowledge the wisdom of
God. Then it will be too late to accept His mercy, which is still
offered. "To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your
hearts." "Behold, now is the day of salvation." This Sabbath
should be the time when we submit our all to God, if we have
not done so before, accepting everything that He sends as from
the hand of a loving heavenly Father. The result, verse 43. See
also I Cor. 13:12.

lands, written by those who are or have been there. These
articles will be made doubly interesting by the appropriate

nection with each will be described and illustrated. Light,
air, water, salt, paper, flour, coal, etc., are among the sub-
jects which "Uncle Ben" will consider in his happy way.

    Different writers will contribute interesting stories about
strange and familiar animals and birds. Numerous illugtra-
tions will also serve to make these sketches most profitable
