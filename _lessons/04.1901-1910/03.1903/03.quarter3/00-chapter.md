          DO YOU HAVE
         THE LESSON HELP

     A     SERIES of very helpful studies on the wonderful
           Epistle to the Ephesians has been prepared by the
            writer of the lessons contained in this pamphlet.
     fhese studies will be printed from week to week in the
     Signs of the Times, and will be so combined with the
     lessons themselves, which will also appear, as not only to
     make them of special help to teachers and students, but
     exceedingly interesting to the general reader.
          An opportunity is thereby afforded to make the Signs
     serve at least two purposes,—as an important help in the
     preparation of the Sabbath-school lessons, and as a power-
     ful agent in missionary work.

 The Scripture text printed in this lesson quarterly is from the Standard
American Edition of the Revised Version, published by Thomas Nelson & Sons,
New York, which firm publishes the only editions authorized by the American
Committee of Revision.

                     JULY    I TO SEPTEMBER 30.

    Introductory Notes.—I. With the exception of the first les-
son, this entire study is on the epistle of Paiil to the Ephesians
 and to us.
   2. Three months is too short a time to devote to this won-
derful book, unless it is studied diligently, prayerfully. There-
fore so study its wonderful message.
   3. Seek to know what the book says and means, not what
the lesson writer may mean. His earnest desire is to open
the book to all. Therefore study the book.
   4. Read it through carefully at one sitting. Do this fre-
quently. Get familiar with its parts and proportions. It is one
epistle, not six.
   5. Read the lesson one or more times every day. Try the
asking of your own questions. Many more may be asked
than those printed.
  6. In questioning the class, do not ask all the questions in a
paragraph at once. Each question stands by itself.
  7. Above all things, make the instruction personal, receive
its message, appropriate its blessings, and use them to God's
glory. "It is better to give than to receive," comes to us
through Ephesus. Acts 20:17, 18, 35•
   The offerings for this quarter go to the most needy fields.

              LESSON I.—Blessings of God.
                        JULY 4.
                     EN'. 1 :1-12.
   (I) Paul, an apostle.of Christ Jesus through the will of God,
 to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ
Jesus: (2) Grace 'to you and peace from God our Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ.
   (3) Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
who bath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heav-
enly places in Christ: (4) even as He chose us in Him before
the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and with-
out blemish before Him in love: (5) having foreordained us
 unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto Himself, accord-
ing to the good pleasure of His will, (6) to the praise of the glory
of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:
(7) in whom we have our redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His
grace, (8) which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom
and prudence, (9) making known unto us the mystery of His
will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in
Him (to) unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to
sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the
things upon the earth; in Him, I say, (H) in whom also we
were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to
the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel
of His will; (f2) to the end that we should be unto the praise
of His glory, we who had before hoped in Christ.
                            Questions.
    I. By whom is this epistle- written? What does he
 call himself? Through what is he an apostle? To
.whom is the epistle written? Verse I. Note I.
    2. With what greeting of benediction does he address
 them? From whom? Verse 2. Note 2.
We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.

   3. To whom does he ascribe blessing? With what
has God blessed us? In whom? Verse 3.
    4. In accordance with what has God blessed us?
When did He choose us? What did He elect that we
should be? By whose standard? Verse 4. Note 3.
    5. In what did He foreordain us? (Read the last
two words of verse 4 with verse 5, "In love having or-
dained us." See margin.) Unto what are we fore-
ordained or marked out? Through whom? According
to what? Verse 5. Note 4.
    6. To the praise of what are we marked out? How
and when and in whom has He freely bestowed His
grace? Verse 6. Note 5.
    7. What have we in the Beloved? What does that
redemption bring us? According to what? Verse 7.
Note 6.
  --8. How has His grace abounded? Verse 8.
    9. What has He made known? According to what?
In whom is His good pleasure purposed? Verse 9.
   Io. Unto what is His good pleasure purposed? To
what end? Verse 1o.
    1. What are we made in Him? By what means?
 According to what? What assurance have we of the
fulfilling of His purpose in those who believe? Verse i I.
  12. What is the object of the Lord in all these pur-
poses and blessings? Verse 12.
                              Notes.
   i. The epistle is written not only to the saints, the faithful
2:t Ephesus, hut to the faithful in Christ Jesus everywhere.
It is therefore an epistle to us.
"One dollar now is of more value to the work than ten dollars
              will be at some future period."
                          Ertl EstANS.

  2. God is one, not in person, but in character, in purpose,
in Spirit. The grace and peace are equally from our Father
and our Elder Brother.
  3. He has blessed us in accordance with His choosing. He
chose us that we might be holy and without blame—both
negatively and positively good. He has blessed sufficient to
make us all He has chosen us to be. Note also that these are
present blessings.
  4. To predestine, or foreordain, means to mark out, to
define or determine beforehand. God has the one standard
character of holiness, the one ever all-glorious example, His
Son Christ Jesus, reflecting always all the fulness of the light
of His righteousness. God also in the beginning chose char-
acters for His heritage, each character righteous in the right-
eousness of God, yet having its own individuality, manifesting
one or more of the many beauties of Him in whom all fulness
dwells, even as each color in the rainbow reveals some of the
special beauties of the light. God chose these characters
before the foundation of the world. The names of those char-
acters were written in the Lamb's book of life. Rev. 13:8.
He has called, and is calling to those characters, and His
blessing is sufficient for every soul -to meet the call and attain
the character to which he is called.
  5. Every work is to the praise or dispraise of its maker.
God's work among sinners will be, when finished, to the praise
of the glory of His grace. It is by grace, His unmerited
favor, freely shed on us, that the work is wrought. This is
preeminently an epistle of grace and glory. Twelve times is
the grace bestowed mentioned,—"the glory of His grace," "the
riches of His grace," "the exceeding riches of His grace;"
and eight times does it speak of His "glory" to us-ward.
  6. "According 10." Oh, what a message of hope is this to
the sinner ! Not according to our deserts does God forgive,
else would we never hope again. Not according to our con-
ception, not according to any measure man can conceive, but

Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

  according to "the riches of His grace." And that is as bound
   less as infinity, as endless as eternity. It is all free, if we will
   but take it—"grace to cover all my sin," "abounding in all
   wisdom and prudence." He does not throw it away, but it is
— 'hlways all-sufficient.


         LESSON 11.—The Fulness of His Power.,
                               JULY 11.
                        CHAPTER 1:13-23.
    (13) In whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth,
 the gospel of your salvation,—in whom, having also believed.
 ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, (14) which
 is an 'earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God's
 own possession, unto the praise of His glory.
    (i5) For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the
 Lord Jesus which is among you, and the lOve which ye show
 toward all the saints, (16) cease not to give thanks for you,
 making mention of you in my prayers; (17) that the God of
 our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto
 you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
 Him; (i8) having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that
 ye may know what is the hope of His calling, what the riches
 of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, (i9) and what the
 exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe,
 according to that working of the strength of His might (20)
 which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the
 dead, and made Him to sit at His right hand in the heavenly
 places, (21) far above all rule, and authority, and power, and
 dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
 world, but also in that which is to come: (22) and He put
 all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him to be
 head over, all things to the church, (23) which is His body,
 the fulness of Hini. that filleth all in all.
         The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
8                        E.PliESIANS.

                          Questions.
  i. What word has come to us in Christ Jesus?
What does belief bring to us? Verse 13.
  2. Of what is the Holy Spirit an earnest or pledge?
Unto what two things are we sealed by the Spirit?
Verse 14. Note I.
  3. What two things did Paul couple with God's pur-
pose to us? What did it lead him to do? Verses 15, 16.
Note 2.
  4. To whom did he pray? For what did he pray?
Verse 17.
  5. What did he desire to have enlightened? What
three things did he wish us to know by this enlighten-
ment? Verses 18, 19.
  6. What example does he give of the measure of the
power God has for those who believe? Verses 19, 20.
Note 3.
  7. Where did that power place Christ? How highly
did it exalt Him? Verses 20, 21.
  8. What did the Father put under Him? What did
the Father give Christ to be? Verse 22.
  9. What is the relation of the church to Christ? Of
what is it the expression in this world? Verse 23.
                            Notes.
  i. Two mistakes are made in the lives of many who profess
to be Christians. Either they believe that_ all good is enjoyed
here, that the climax of all blessings is enjoyed in this sin-
blasted earth, and hence they have no longing, no joy, no
faith, in the exceeding riches of God's grace to be revealed:
or they place all blessings in the life beyond, and hence fail
       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.
                         EPTit81.AN.                          9

in appreciate them here. All that God gives us here is the
pledge of something better to come. Be glad and rejoice in
His blessings in all the fulness that can be appreciated, but
also know that, glorious as they are, they are only the earnest,
the pledge, the first small payment, so to speak, of the far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The eternal in-
heritance, the redemption of the entire universe, freed from
sin and its results, are all to be shared by the believers in
Christ Jesus.
   2. "For this cause" includes' the great purpose of God to
make all things which man has subjected through sin to the
praise of His glory. With this as a matter of thanksgiving
Paul joins the faith arid the love of believers.
   3. These long sentences of the apostle need much study.
It is one sentence from verse 3 to verse 14 inclusive. Verses
15 to 23 are also comprehended in one sentence. We shall
need to study them as a whole and in partS. Every clause
has its weight, every word its meaning. Note in verses 18
and 19 that it is not mere intellectual knowledge which is
desired, for God's people, but that the eyes of the heart—the
seat of the emotions, affections, will, and thought—may be
illuminated, enlightened, that we may see and know beyond
mortal vision and mortal knowledge. And all this knowledge
is summed up in "the hope of His calling," "the riches of the
glory of His inheritance," and "the exceeding greatness of His
power to us-ward who believe,"—power over sin, and, hence,
power over death. To know these is to know all that is worth
knowing.


             LESSON I11.—Living in Christ.
                           JULY 18.
                      CHAPTER 2:1-10.
  (1) And you did He make alive, when ye were dead through
your trespasses and sins, (2) wherein ye once walked accord-
ing to the course of this world, according to- the prince of the
           Prayerfully consider the uncntcred fields.
 TO                       EPHESTANS,

 powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons
of disobedience; (3) among whom we also all once lived in
the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the
mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the
rest:—(4) but God, being rich in mercy, for His great love
wherewith He loved us, (5) even when we were dead through
our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace
have ye been saved), (6) and raised us up with Him, and made
us to sit with Him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus:
(7) that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding
riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:
(8) for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; (9) not of works,'
that no man should glory. (so) For we are His workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore
prepared that we should walk in them.

                           Questions.
   I. Whom did Christ, the head of the church, make
alive? From what condition? Verse I.
  2. In what did we once walk? According to what?
According to whom? In whom does this spirit espe-
cially work? Verse 2.
  3. How many do "the sons of disobedience" include?
In what did we live? What did we do? What were
we by nature? Verse 3.
  4. Who interposed to save from wrath, and why?
What moved Him to act? When did He act? and what
did He do? By what means? Verses 4, 5.
  5. With whom are we made alive and raised up?
Where are we made to sit? With whom and in whom?
Verse 6.
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
  for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
                         EPHESIANS.                          II

   6. What is it God's ultimate purpose to show us?
Through what period? In whom? Verse 7.
   7. By what are we saved? Through what? From
whom does this salvation not come? From whom does
it come? Verses 8, 9. Note.
   8. Whose workmanship are we? How did we be-
come so For what were we created? Whose good
works? Verse
                             Note.
  Through God's favor alone are we saved. Naught that
we can do or suffer, naught that we are or can be, entitles
us to the salvation of God. He has purchased the salvation,
and it awaits every soul who will believe. Faith—acceptance,
yielding to do, or be, or have, choosing God's way—is the
channel of the salvation; but we are saved by grace. Of course,
God gives all good things, and so from Him come the grace
and the power to believe; but these are not the gift of this
text; grammatical construction forbids such application. The
salvation, the saving, is the gift of God.



         LESSON IV.—The Household of God..
                           JULY 25.
                     CHAPTER 2:11-22.
  (11) Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in
the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called
Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; (12) that ye were
at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the com-
monwealth of Israel. and strangers from the covenants of the
promise, having no hope and without God in the world. (i3)

"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He will send
              forth laborers into His harvest."
12                       IEPliES1AN S.

But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made
nigh in the blood of Christ. (i4) For He is our peace, who
made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,
(15) having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law
of commandments contained in ordinances; that He might
create in Himself of the two one new man, so making peace;
(i6) and might reconcile them both in one body unto God
through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: (i7) and
He came and preached peace to you that were far off, and
peace to them that were nigh: (i8) for through Him we
both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father. (zp)
So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are
fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
(20) being built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the chief corner stone;
(21) in whom each several building, fitly framed together,
groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; (22) in whom ye
also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.

                           Questions.

   1. What were these believers once? What were
they called, and by whom? Verse 11. Note I.
   2. From whom were they then separated? From
whom alienated? To what strangers? In what condi-
tion? Without whom? Verse 12.
   3. In whom are the separated brought nigh? In
what? Verse 13.
   4. What is Christ to us? What has He made?
What did He break down? By what means? in what
was the enmity manifest? Where was the enmity
abolished? Why has Christ done this? What would
He thus make? Verses 14, 15. Note 2.
 "The advent message to the world in this generation"—our
                          watchword.
                          EPHESIAN S.                         13

   5. Into what are both Jew and Gentile brought?
Through what means, and how? Verse 16.
   6. To whom did He preach peace? Verse 17.
   7. Through Him what do all classes have? Verse
18. (See also Rom. 10:11-13.)
   S. In Him what are we, then, no longer? What are
we in Him? Verse 19.
   9. Upon what foundation are we built? Who is the
chief corner stone? Verse 20. Note 3.
  10. Built upon Him, to what do all grow? Verse 21.
  11. For what purpose are we . builded 'together?
Verse 22.
                             Notes.
  t. The word Gentile comes from a Greek word (ethnos)
meaning "race," "nation." The meaning in the Old Testa-
ment is the same. The Revised Version almost invariably
renders it "nation." It is the same word in the Septuagint
as in the New Testament Greek. It generally refers to the
nations outside of Israel, nations invariably pagan, without
hope and without God. It also refers, as in this entire pas-
sage, to those who know not Christ; for such, not belonging to
God's "holy nation," are classed with the nations without.
In the fullest, deepest meaning, Gentile and Israel denote
spiritual conditions. To be a Gentile, ignore or reject Christ;
to be an Israelite, accept Him. The uncircumcision and the
circumcision were terms used by the Jews to denote the two
classes; but to them it was a mere outward matter. To the
instructed child of faith, circumcision was a seal of the right-
eousness of God. See Rom. 2:28; 29; 4:11; Phil. 3:3. It was
not itself a saving ordinance; it was a sign of a saved condition.
  2. In the -study of the "enmity" do not omit Rom. 8:7.
There we are clearly told what it is. "The mind of the flesh is
enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God
       "There shall be delay no longer"—onr     confidence.
14                       EPHESIANS.

neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh can
not please God." See also verse 16 of lesson. On ordinances
study Col. 2:14, 15, 20-23. The enmity .is that which sepa-
rated both Jew and Gentile from God; and the only thing
which separates from God is sin. Sin takes away all peace
of mind. Sinning is warring with God. Jesus Christ is not
alone our peacemaker, but He is our "peace," even as He
was our "sin." 2 Cor. 5:21. He abolished sin by becoming
sin and dying to sin. Rona. 6:1o. He became sin for us. By
faith we accept the offering for our sin, accept the abolition
in His flesh for our flesh, His crucifixion as ours, His'life of
righteousness as ours, and so He is our peace. "Reckon ye
also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in

mystery, as I wrote before in few words, (4) whereby, when ye .
read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of
Christ: (5) which m other generations was not made known
unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto His
holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; (6) to wit, that the
Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and
fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the
gospel, (7) whereof I was made a minister, according to the
gift of that grace of God which was given me according to
the working of His power. (8) Unto me, who am less than the
least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the
Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; (9) and to make all
men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for
ages hath been hid in God who created all things; (io) to the
intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the
heavenly places might be made known through the church
the manifold wisdom of God, (If) according to the eternal pur-
pose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; (12) in
whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our
faith in Him. (13) Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at
my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
                           Questions.

whom? Verse I. Note I.
   2. What does he imply that these Gentiles had heard?
Verse 2. Note 2.
   3. How had this mystery of God been made known

 (See Rom: 16 :25, 26.)
     6. In what special thing has larger, clearer light been
 criven? Verse 6.

     7. What was Paul's relation to this? According to
 what two things was he a minister? Verse 7.
     8. What opinion did he have of himself? What was
 God's purpose in bestowing upon Paul this grace of
 ministry? Verse 8.
     9. What would such preaching accomplish? What
 does the apostle say of the age of this mystery? Verse 9.
    10. Who are interested in this work? What is made
 known to them through the church? According to
 what? In whom is it all wrought? Verses 1o, I I.
     1. What is given us in Christ? Verse 12. (See
 Rom. 5 :2.)
    12. In view of this, what did he ask of them? What
 were those tribulations to them? Verse 13.
                             Notes.
  1. "For this cause" includes what he has revealed of Christ's
work for them. Following: the first verse is a parenthetical
expression which extends to verse thirteen inclusive, when the
subject introduced in the first verse is resumed.
  2. "Dispensation" means "stewardship." Paul's stewardship
which he was to dispense was the gospel of the grace of God.
  3. By "revelation" was the gospel made known to Paul. By
revelation it comes to us. We may study the sublimest themes
in a perfunctory surface way, and know little more than at
the beginning. But when we are yielded to God wholly, His
Spirit will in times of need reveal to us the great truths of God.
We expend sixty per cent of our efforts upon four per cent of
                         our field.

  (I) For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in
behalf of you Gentiles.
  (14) For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, (15)
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, (t6)
that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
that ye may be strengthened with power through His Spirit in
the inward man; (u) that Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith ; to .the end that ye, being rooted and grounded
in love, (t8) may be strong to apprehend with all the saints
what is the breadth and length and height and depth, (19) and
to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye
may be filled unto all the fulness of God.
   (2o) Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly
above all that we ask or think, according to the power that
worketh in us, (2t) unto Him be the glory in the church and
in Christ Jesus unto all generations forever and ever. Amen.

                          Questions.

  1. What did God's saving power to His children, as
revealed in chapter 2, lead Paul to say? Verse 1.
  2. How did he resume this, after the parenthesis of
verses 2 to 13? Verse 14.
  3. Unto how many is God the Father? Verse 15.

might be strengthened? According to what did he ask
that this strength might be granted? Verse 16.
  5. Whom did he desire to dwell in our hearts? How
can Christ dwell in our hearts? What would this do
for us? Verse 17. (See Gal. 2 :20.)
  6. To what end did he desire Christ to dwell in our
hearts? What are we to be strong to apprehend?
With whom? What does he desire to know? What
does he say of the love of Christ which he desires us to
know? What would knowing that love do? Verses
17-19. Note 2.
  7. What is God able to do? According to what is
this ability? What is this power? (Chap. I :19-21.)
Verse 20.
  8. What ascription of praise does he offer to Him?
In what and for how long? Verse 21.
  9. Can you join in the response?
                             Notes:
  s. God is the Father of every family, or "fatherhood." The
word means more than a household. It means the fatherhood
of a world, of every world. All are named after the great
eternal Father, so that every one in the universe are brothers,
members of the same family in our God.
  2. "Be strong . . . power . . . might."—Vincent
well remarks that it is "an interesting study" to note the
apostle's use of words for power, might, strength, etc., in this
epistle. He uses every Greek word used in the New Testa-
ment save one. Eight different terms are used, among them
"dunamis," from which comes our "dynamite," the explosive;
but not so named from similarity of working, but from the
force or power exercised; "energeia," from which comes our

"energy." The one Word not used is "bia," meaning "vio-
lence." God's Spirit does not operate or work that way, and
yet His power is stronger than all violence.

                          AUGUST 15.

                      CHAPTER 4:I -1o.

  (I) I therefore, the prisoner in the. Lord, beseech you to
walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called, (2) with
all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one
another in love; (3) giving diligence to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace. (4) There is one body, and one
Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;
(5)- one Lord, one faith, one baptism, (6) one God and Father
of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all. (7) But
unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure
of the gift of Christ. (8) Wherefore He saith, When He
ascended on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
men. (9) (Now this, He ascended, what is it but that He also
descended into the lower parts of the earth? (io) He that
descended is the same also that ascended far above all the
heavens, that He might fill all things.)

  I. In view of all that has gone before, what does the
apostle entreat God's children to do? Verse I.

How many baptisms? How many supreme ones? Who
is our God? Verses 5, 6. Note
   6. What is given to each one of the children of God?'
According to what? Verse 7.
   7. What scripture does he quote to prove this? What
did Christ give to man? Verse 8.
  8. What did Christ do before He ascended? How
far down did He go? Verse 9. Note 2.
  9. What difference existed between the One whoi
ascended and the One who descended? In thus ascend
ing from the lowest, what did He accomplish? Verse Jo..
                              Notcs.
   t. "One baptism."—The baptism of the believer, or water
baptism, is the outward act representing all other things which
may be termed baptism, such as the baptism of suffering
 (Mark 10:38; Luke 12:5o), and the baptism of the Spirit (Matt.
3:11). Baptism stands for death to sin and life in God, for
suffering, dying, consecration, living, and so comprehends all
other so-called baptisms. "One God."—God is one, not in
person, but in character and spirit and purpose. The Father:
is here mentioned in contradistinction to the Son. He is over
all, and through all, and in all, by His ever-present Spirit.
   2. Christ came from the very highest heavens to the very.
lowest,—a grave in this sin-cursed earth. He emptied Him .
self absolutely. There was no place for existence which He
did not touch, no class of fallen beings which He did not
reach in that wonderful sacrifice. And then He ascended to
lift all with Him who would to the eternal heights of holiness
and happiness and life, to be children of God forevermore.
       The Son of God beggared Himself to enrich us.

    LESSON VI11.—The Gifts and Their Purpose.

                           AUGUST 22.

                      CHAPTER 4:11-24.

   (55) And He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets;
and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; (12)
for the perfecting of the saints, un10. the work of ministering,
unto the building up of the body of Christ: (i3) till we all
attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the
Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ; (hi) that we may be no longer
children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind
of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles
of error; (15) but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all
things into Him, who is the head, even Christ; (so) from whom
all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which
every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure
of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the
building up of itself in love.
   (ii) This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no
longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their
mind, (58) being darkened in their understanding, alienated
from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them,
because of the hardening of their heart; (59) who being past
feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all un-
cleanness with greediness. (20) But ye did not so learn
Christ; (25) if so be that ye heard Him, and were taught in
Him, even as truth is in Jesus; (22) that ye put away, as con-
cerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth
corrupt after the lusts of deceit; (23) and that ye be renewed
in the spirit of your mind, (24) and put on the new man, that
after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of
truth.

What is the inevitable tendency of the "old man" when
retained? Verse 22.
  13. What change must take place? Verse 23.
  14. What should the believer put on? Verse 24.

                             Notes.
   T. "He gave sonic." Not all of the gifts of the Spirit are
mentioned in any one passage of Scripture. It is only by
studying all the Scriptures relating to them that we obtain
an understanding of their exceeding fulness. The gifts here
mentioned,—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers,—
are especially necessary in building tip the church, and are also
representative of other gifts. (See i Corinthians 12; Rom.
12:3-5; Matt. 25:14, .15; Luke 19:12, 13.) The talents and
pounds are identical with the gifts. They are given by the
same one to the same persons, for the saine time, and for the
same purpose.
   2. "Till we all attain." This scripture, together with the
parables of the talents and pounds, show conclusively that
God designed that spiritual gifts should continue in His church
till His coming. Then His church will be complete, "not having
spot or wrinkle" (Eph. 5:27), lacking in "no gift" (I Cor. I :7).
Then prophecy will fail, for the "perfect" will then have come.
   Cor. 13:9, 10.
   3. "Alienated from the life of God" means to be estranged
away, to be non-participant in; compare chapter 2 :12, "sepa-
rate from Christ," "without God." Such have the life common
to all animal creation, but the life of God, given by His Spirit,
nourished by His Word, enabling the receiver to overcome, the
unbelieving do not know or possess. The ignorance which de-
stroys comes from the hardening of the heart in sin.

                 CHAPTER 4 :25-32 ; 5:I, 2.
   (25) Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth
each one with his neighbor: for we arc members one of an-
other. (26) Be ye angry, and sin not : let not the sun go down
upon your wrath: (27) neither give place to the devil. (28)
Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor,
working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may
have whereof to give to him that bath need. (29) Let no
corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is
good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace
to them that hear. (3o) And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption. (31) Let
all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing,
be put away from you, with all malice: (32) and be ye kind one
to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God
also in Christ forgave you.
  (I) Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children:
(2) and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave
Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an
odor of a sweet smell.
                         •Questions.
    I. What should the Christian put away? What
should he speak? What reason is given for dealing
truly? Verse 25. Note 1.
    2. What indignation only is admissible? What is
said of retaining wrath? Verse 26.
   3. To whom should we give no place? Verse 27.
Note 2.

    4. What should he not do who has taken that which
did not belong to him? What high motive should ani-
mate his labor? Verse 28.
    5. What should not be clone as regards speech?
What should be the character of our words? Verse 29.
    6. What should we not grieve? What danger is
there in thus doing? Verse 3o. Note 3.
    7. What various and specific things should forever
be put from us? (Study the meaning of these sepa-
rately.) Verse 31. Note 4.
    8. What spirit should we manifest toward those who
wrong us? What should be the measure of our for-
giveness? Verse 32.
    9. Of whom should we be imitators? As what?
Chap. 5 :1.
   10. How should we walk? As whom? What mani-
festation of love did He give? Verse 2.
                             Notes.
  I. Note the "wherefore." It is based on the scripture of the
last lesson. If the "old man" has been put off, if the "new
man" has been put on, then there should follow these fruits
of godliness: truth, gentleness, honesty, purity, faithfulness,
should be manifest.
  2. He who holds anger in his heart against persons gives
all the place to the devil that anger occupies. "Anger resteth
in the bosom of fools." He who harbors it, harbors an
enemy to his own soul, and this is true of any other sin. One
sin cherished, or given place in the heart, will open the door to
the devil.
  3. "Grieve not." God's Spirit will not always strive with roan.
 Gen. 6:3. But when the Spirit leaves us it will be because

       "There shall be delay no longer"—our confidence.
26                         EPHESIANS.

we have refused to receive it, and we refuse to receive it when
we refuse its warnings against sin, its admonitions to do right.
As long as there is sin in the heart, the Spirit is grieved.
  4. "Bitterness" ("picra," the name of a bitter drug), a
bitter frame of mind; "wrath," irritation, exasperation, not so
enduring as anger; "anger," violent outbreak; "clamor," out-
ward manifestation of wrath or anger in brawling; "railing,"
blasphemy, reviling, calumny, evil speaking in general; "malice,"
a malevolent disposition towards one's neighbor, giving rise
to all the other evils named above.

   (3) But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let
it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; (4) nor
filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting;
but rather giving of thanks. (5) For this ye know of a surety,
that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who
is an idolator, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ
and God. (6) Let no man deceive you with empty words: for
because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the
sons of disobedience. (7) Be not ye therefore partakers with
them; (8) for ye were once darkness, but are now light in
the Lord: walk as children of light (9) (for the fruit of the
light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), (m)
proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord; (II) and have
no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
even reprove them; (T2) for the things which are done by them
in secret it is a shame even to speak of. (i3) But all things
when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for

                             Notes.
   1. How easy it is to spread the news of scandal! God says,
"Let it not once be named among you." it does no good,
and every repetition more deeply engraves its image on your
mind. Next to the above sin, what a temptation it is to tell
questionable anecdotes or indulge in lewd jokes. Doddridge
renders for jesting, "lewd turns," a common thing. All these
things are not befitting, not becoming. Let the speech be
pure; control the tongue by letting Christ live in the heart.
  2. Notice that verse 9 is parenthetical, thrown in, to show
that genuine light will bear fruit. Verse to connects with
verse 8: "Walk as children of light, . . . proving what is
well-pleasing unto the Lord;" not proving it to Him, but in
ourselves and to others. Compare with Rom. 12:1, 2, proving
the acceptable "will of God." "If any man willeth to do His
will, he shall know." John 7:17.
  3. If it is a shame to speak of the evil things done by the
wicked in secret, is it not a shame to visit them?, It is quite
fashionable in some religious circles to "go slumming." Of
ourselves and to others. Compare with Rom. 12:1, 2, proving
wisely." "Who is blind, but My Servant? or deaf, as My Mes-
senger that I send? who is blind as He that is at peace with
Me, and blind as Jehovah's Servant? Thou seest many things,
but Thou observest not; His ears are open, but He heareth
not." Isa. 52:13; 42:19, 2o. Seeing the evil does us no good,
at the best, and it may do untold harm.

but as wise; (IC) redeeming the time, because the days are

one'to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, sing-
ing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; (20)
giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; (25) subjecting your-
selves one to another in the fear of Christ.
   (22) Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as
unto the Lord. (23) For the husband is the head of the wife,
as Christ also is the head of the church, being Himself the
Saviour of the body. (24) But as the church is subject to
Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in every-
thing. (25) Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also
 loved the church, and gave Himself up for it; (26) that He
 might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with
the Word, (27) that He might present the church to Himself
a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. (28)
 Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their
 own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself.
                            Questions.
    I. What admonition is given the Christian? As. •
what? Verse 15.
    2. How should we regard time or opportunity?
Verse i6, margin. Note i.
    3. What should we not be? What should we under-
stand? Verse 17.. Note 2.
    4. With what should we not be drunken? With what
is it always safe to be filled? Verse 18.
    5. How should the Spirit be manifest? Verse 19.
    6. To whom, in whose name, for what, and when
should we give thanks? Verse 20.
"One dollar now is of snore value to the work than ten dollars
               will be at some future period."

   7. What should be our conduct with respect to each
other? In whose fear? Verse 21. Note 3.
   8. What instruction is • given to wives? Why?
Verses 22-24.
   9. What instruction is given to husbands? Verse 25.
  io. What has Christ done for the church? Verses
25-27.
    I. What lesson should the husbands learn from this?
Verse 28, first part.
                              Notes.
  s. The word "time" does not mean duration. Duration
Past can never return. "Opportunity" is the better word; and
opportunity to work for Christ can be purchased by sacri-
ficing the things of the world, of self, and of sin. ,
  2. We may, nay, more, we should, understand the will of the
Lord. But we can not do this by mere study. Such knowl-
edge is always superficial. The only true understanding comes
to the doer. John 7:17.
  3. Note that the instruction to the wife is not to the husband,
nor to the wife through the husband; it is from the Lord to
the wife. The instruction of the husband is not to the wife,
nor to the husband through the wife; it is from the Lord to
the husband. If these simple facts be remembered, there
will be no trouble, but much gain.

                 CHAPTER 5 :29-33 ; 6 :1-9.
  (29) For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth
and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; (3o) because
we are members of His body. (31) For this cause shall a
Nine-tenths of the women of India never heard of a Saviour.

man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;
and the two shall become one flesh. (32) This mystery is
great; but 1 speak in regard of Christ and of -the church.
(33) Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own
wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her
husband.
   (I) Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is
right. (2) Honor thy father and mother (which is the first
commandment with promise), (3) that it may be well with
thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. (4) And, ye
fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them
in the chastening and a3monition of the Lord.
   (5) Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the
flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness
of your heart, as unto Christ; (6) not in the way of eyeservice,
as menpleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of
God from the heart; (7) with good will doing service, as
unto the Lord, and not unto men: (8) knowing that whatso-
ever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive
again from the Lord, whether he be bond or free. (9) And,
ye masters,, do the same things unto them, and forbear threat-
ening: knowing that He who is both their Master and yours
is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.

                           Questions.
    I. How ought husbands to love their wives? What
is said of him who loves his wife? Verse 28.
    2. What did man never hate? What does he do for
his flesh? Of whom is this an illustration? Verse 29.
    3. Why does Christ nourish and cherish the church?
Verse 30.
    4. How strong is the true marriage bond? Verse 31.
    5. What does the apostle say of this union? To
what does he particularly apply it? Verse 32.
        The needs of the cause of God are world wide.
32                      EPHESIANS.

   6. Yet, notwithstanding the application, what should
the husband and wife do? Verse 33. Note.
   7. What instruction is given to children? How
should they obey? . Why? Chap. 6 :1.
   8. What commandment does he quote in part? What
does he say of this precept? Verse 2.
   9. What promise is given in connection with the law?
Verse 3.
  io. What negative instruction is given to fathers?
What should the father do as regards his children?
Verse 4.
   1. What duty does the Lord enjoin upon serv-
ants? How should they be obedient? As unto whom?
Verse 5.
  12. How should they not serve? As whose servants
should they do their duty? Verses 6, 7.
  13. Of what may they be certain? Verse 8.
  14. What instruction is given the masters? What
should the masters forbear to do? What should they
ever recognize? How does God regard classes of men?
Verse 9.
                           Note.

  Both husband and wife will obtain the greatest benefit
from this and the previous lesson by each one seeking to
know his or her duty. Let the husband seek to know not .
what God asks of the wife, but what God requires of him,
and then let him do it. Let the wife seek to know not what
God requires of the husband, but what He requires of her, and
then let her do it. The same principle applies to parent and
child, to servant and master. Let each one seek to know and
do his own duty.

   (to) Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of
His might. (Ft) Put on the whole armor of God, that ye
may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. (t2) For
our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the
principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of
this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the
heavenly places. (t3) Wherefore take up the whole armor of
God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and,
having done all, to stand. (t4) Stand therefore, having girded
your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of
righteousness, (rs) and having shod your feet with the prepa-
ration of the gospel of peace; (t6) withal taking up the shield
of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts
of the evil one. (t7) And take the helmet of salvation, and
the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God: (t8) with
all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit,
and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication
for all the saints, (t9) and on my behalf, that utterance may
be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with
boldness the mystery of the gospel, (20) for which I am an
ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I
ought to speak.
   (as) But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychi-
cus, the .beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord,
shall make known to you all things: (22) whom I have sent
unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and
that he may comfort your hearts.
   (23) Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from
