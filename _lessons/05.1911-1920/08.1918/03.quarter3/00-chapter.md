FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE
                   Bible Year
  The reading of the Bible through each year has
become a regular feature of Missionary Volunteer
work, and is becoming more and more general among
the older people as well. For the encouragement of
those who are following this plan, the Young
People's Department has prepared assignments, and
a series of notes of a very helpful and interesting
character, which have been published in book form.
The book contains 152 pages, and is bound in cloth,
price 65c.

   Senior Standard of Attainment Manual
   The Standard of Attainment is a mark of pro-
ficiency in Bible doctrines and denominational his-
tory which our Missionary Volunteers are asked to
reach. This "Manual" by Elder MacGuire presents
the various Bible doctrines in a series of statements
supported by proof texts, and will hereafter form
the basis of the examination questions. It contains
72 pages, and is bound in cloth, price 50c.


                  Little Stories     -
  The Young People's Department has selected some
of the very choicest stories that have appeared in
Our Little Friend for several years past, as the
Primary Reading Course book for 1918. These
stories form a volume of 208 pages, attractively
bound in cloth, price 85c. "Uncle Ben's Cloverfield,"
the 1917 Reading Course book and the first in the
Primary Series, ought to be read in connection with
Little Stories. It contains 295 pages, price $1.00.

 Studies in the Revelation
     SENIOR DIVISION, THIRD QUARTER, 1918
                     Introductory Note
    This remarkable book of prophecy is often called "the
Apocalypse," a word meaning revelation, disclosure, unfold-
ment. As the opening words say, it is a revelation of Jesus
Christ, given Him by God, and transmitted through the angel
to the prophet John.
    WRITER: John the beloved apostle.
    TIME: Probably A. D. 96 or 97.
    PLACE: The visions were given on the barren, rocky is-
land of Patmos, about fifteen miles in circumference, in the
JEgean Sea, which the Roman empire used as a place of ban-
ishment, and where John had been exiled by the emperor

 4 .       SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
Domitian "for the word of God," and "the testimony of
Jesus Christ."
   The great prophecies of the Old Testament are supple-
mented and illuminated by the Revelation. Here the symbols
of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah live and move
again before our eyes. Here the great typical figures of the
Old Testament find place in greatly enlarged antitypes.
Former prophecies and visions of the sufferings, the tri-
umphs, and the glory of Christ, with the fruitage of all
the seed-sowing of the centuries, are more graphically,
clearly, and gloriously portrayed in the Apocalypse of Jesus
our Lord.

                            Notes
    1. God's general way of revealing His truth is here given:
(1) the eternal Father; (2) our Lord, the Word; (3) His
angel; (4) His servant, the inspired penman or Spirit-filled
teacher; (5) through His people to the world. But not
always thus. God talked to Moses "mouth to mouth." See
Num. 12:8. "His angel" is evidently Gabriel. See Dan.
8:16; 9:21; Luke 1:11, 19.
    2. To reveal, disclose, unroll the vital past, the living
present, the great future, with its fearful trials and perse-
cutions, even then beginning.
    3. It is ever God's purpose that His children, His serv-
ants, should bear witness, or testify in life and word, of the
word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Rotherham's trans-
lation reads: "Who bare witness to the word of God, and
the witness of Jesus Christ,-whatsoever things he saw."
The world should see the power of the Word transmuted into
human character. We are to reveal to it just what Christ
is. Jesus said, "As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even
so have I also sent them." John 17: 18. "Ye are My wit-
nesses." Isa. 43: 10.
6          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    4. "The time is at hand." The developments of early
Christianity were already beginning. The power of the
gospel had reached all lands. The incipient stages of the
great apostasy were present. The time was at hand, for
the great revelation was then unfolding. How infinitely more
important it is to us to give heed now, when "the time is at
hand" that the great drama is about to close!
    5. "To the seven churches which are in Asia." These
seven churches in Asia represent the seven great dominat-
ing conditions in the church during the period between the
two advents. Vincent, in his "Word Studies in the New
Testament," says: "Not all the churches in Asia are meant,
since the list of those addressed in the Apocalypse does not
include Colossi, Miletus, Herapolis, or Magnesia. The
seven names are chosen to symbolize the whole church. . . .
We have in these seven a representation of the church
universal." In each church, there was that named which
was typical of the conditions of the period it represented.
    6. The second coming of our Lord is not a "secret rap-
ture," but open, glorious, attended by clouds of angels, whom
all the earth will see.
                       Supplementary
   1. Note how God's servants the angels cooperate with
God's servants among men. No soul can be truly credited
for all of any work done.
   2. What does the last clause of verse 3 mean to us?
   3. Does God always reveal His truth in the same way.?

                          Notes
   1. John does not boast of the honored position to which
God called him. The presence and the partaking of God's
glory make for humility. He is the Lord's "servant" (verse
1) and our brother and companion. The word "tribulation"
comes from the Latin tribulum, a threshing instrument used
to beat out the grain. The Greek word means pressure,
squeezing, affliction, distress. Once John wished an exalted
place in Christ's work. Jesus asked him if he could endure
the baptism. See Mark 10: 35-45; Matt. 20: 20-23. John
was now experiencing the baptism. Tradition tells us that
he was cast into a caldron of boiling oil, out of which God
saved him. Then Satan thought to quench the torch lighted
of God by banishing the prophet to Patmos; but the gloom
of John's captivity was dispelled by the glory of God, and
the rocky, sea-girt island became a gate of Paradise, an au-
dience chamber of heaven. All tribulation is to separate the
chaff from the wheat, a part of life's discipline. In tribu-
lation, but also in the kingdom and patience (steadfastness)
8          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
of Jesus Christ, our anointed Saviour. "Beloved, now are
we the sons of God." Our Lord is in control. See Rom.
5: 1-5.
    2. We do not need to speculate as to what day of the
week that Lord's day was, if we take for our guide that
word of God for loyalty to which John was banished. The
Spirit of Christ speaking through the prophet calls the
Sabbath "My holy day." Isa. 58: 13. Jesus says, "The Son
of man is Lord also of the Sabbath." Mark 2: 28. And
the eternal, immutable law of God declares, "The seventh
day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20: 10. That
seventh-day Sabbath immediately precedes the first day of
the week. Mark 16: 1, 2. Therefore, according to the Lord's
word, the Lord's day is identical with the Lord's Sabbath.
The Bible knows no other Sabbath. It is the day designated
of God to honor the Creator and the Redeemer, for creative
power is equally demanded in both. The memorial of crea-
tion became a window of heaven. "In the Spirit" clearly
means, as the context shows, "in vision."
    3. The candlesticks are not themselves light, but recepta-
cles, mediums, by which Christ, the Light of the world, il-
luminates the earth. When He dwells in His church, His
people become the light of the world. Matt. 5: 14; Phil.
2: 15, 16.
    4. The long robe, and the girdle around the breast, indi-
cate royal dignity, the kingly priesthood of Christ. Josephus
tells us that the robes of the high priest were girded at the
breast. See Isa. 11: 5; Eph. 6: 14. "White wool" sym-
bolizes not age or decay, but perfect purity. Dan. 7: 9;
Mark 9: 3. "Eyes as a flame of fire," piercing, penetrating,
discovering iniquity, searching motives, both good and evil.
Rev. 19: 12; Jer. 17: 10. His feet have passed through the
furnace of affliction. "Fine,"—"burnished," "molten" brass,
tested. "As many waters,"—harmony, fullness, majesty,
power. Ezek. 1: 24. "Right hand,"—authority, power, skill.
"Two-edged sword," the Word. Eph. 6: 17; Heb. 4: 12; Rev.
19: 15. The literal "sun shining in strength" will not be
known till the veil of sin is removed. Then the sun will
be seven times stronger than now. Isa. 30: 26. The glory
of the unveiled face of Christ is like a sevenfold sun at mid-
day; no wonder that John fell at His feet as dead.

    NOTE.—The seven churches cover the entire time between
the first and the second advent of our Lord. Conditions in
the actual church at Ephesus, where Paul labored and tradi-
tion says John lived, were representative of the apostolic
age, say to about 100 A. D.; Smyrna, the time of the pagan
persecution, to about 312 to 328, the times of the emperor
Constantine, who professed Christianity; Pergamos, the
time of the "conversion" of the empire, to the establishing
of the papacy, in the days of 533 to 538; Thyatira, the time
of papal supremacy, during the long Dark Ages, and to a
limited extent to the end; Sardis, the period following the
papal supremacy, 1798 to 1833; Philadelphia, from the rise
of the advent movement, about 1833 to 1844; and Laodicea,
from the opening of the judgment hour in 1844 to the end.
These conditions do not always begin and end abruptly by
definite dates; they telescope or overlap, one blending into
another.
                           Questions
                            EPHESUS
, The word "Ephesus" means "desirable." The church
in this period—in the days of apostolic labor—had en-
joyed the doctrine of Christ in its purity; also the bene-
fits and blessings of the Holy Spirit received.

                          Notes
   1. Very true and loyal was the early church. Devoted
to God and having no fellowship with evil, she suffered trial
for His name's sake, and did not grow weary. Ephesus also
hated the works of the abominable Nicolaitanes, reputed to
have held that the flesh could indulge its passions without
contaminating the soul. They were strong antinomians,
or no-law advocates.
   2. The first love, the warmth of affection experienced
when the Saviour was first received and the hope of the mes-
sage first dawned upon the mind, had faded out somewhat
in process of years, under cares and trials. "Lord, is it I?"
The first love must be renewed by a turning to Jesus for the
forgiveness of all sin, the full surrender of the heart; and
then, constrained by the love of Jesus for others, the new
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     11
convert, though perhaps old professor, will have a new ex-
perience to tell, a new song to sing, even praise to God.
Then missionary work of all kinds will not be a duty alone,
but a joy; yet a duty to which the believer must sternly
hold himself against all the tendency of the flesh to become
careless. Just here was the failure of the early church.
   3. He who suffered, died, and rose again comes to en-
courage the suffering ones in Smyrna.
    4. Think of the approval,—"tribulation," "poverty,"
"riches." "Jews" is used in the sense of the true children
of God. See Rom. 2: 28, 29. God knows, as He knows all
the churches. How much better that He know our faithful-
ness in suffering for Him rather than our unfaithfulness in
prosperity!
    5. Fear not though there is suffering even to death. The
"ten days" are ten literal years, 302-312, the bitter trials
under Diocletian, the last great pagan persecution.
    6. The promise fits the trial. Death may await the per-
secuted, but there is life forevermore beyond.

                         THYA'TIRA

Note 8.
                          Notes
    1. The sharp two-edged sword is the word of God in
judgment that cuts out the sin from the heart or destroys the
sinner with the sin. In the Pergamos condition, many in the
church were departing from the word of God to human
doctrines, human philosophy, human tradition. Jesus would
emphasize the one standard of the Word. This lesson is for
all time, and for us.
    2. In Pergamos was a shrine of Esculapius, the symbol
of whom was a living serpent, an object of worship. The
time was a period of rapid development of the papacy. At
the bottom of all this corruption was the devil, of whom the
serpent was the symbol. Antipas was perhaps an unknown
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                13
martyr, or a type of a class opposed to the growing assump-
tions of the papacy; anti, against; pas, father, or pope.
Truly there were faithful ones in Pergamos.
   3. It was "one thing" against the church in Ephesus,
but "a few things" against the church in Pergamos. Ephe-
sus hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes; Pergamos tolerated
them, as she did also those who taught for worldly popularity
and gain, as did Balaam. See Num. 31: 16; 2 Peter 2: 15.
   4. Against the unreal, visible charms and amulets of a
superstitious age, God places the invisible yet real manna,
14         ,SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
"the corn of heaven," given by miraculous power, the type
of Christ. John 6: 33, 48-51. It is hidden only to unbelief ;
the mystery is unfolded to the child of faith. 1 Tim. 3: 16;
Col. 1: 26, 27. The white stone represents God's choice for
us. It refers to the pebble used in ancient voting,—black,
if against; white, if favorable. Our Lord casts for us a
white stone, upon which is a new name representing charac-
ter. Jacob in the victory became Israel. Gen. 32: 28. Our
new name will be the sum of all our victorious experiences
in Christ, which we are spelling out day by day under hard
labors and severe trials, often making blunders, yet under
the Master making progress. We see only the little present.
God sees for us the finished name. He spells it out with us,
and hence knows it; but no other earthly being does, be-
cause no other has had the experience. It is the secret be-
tween each overcomer and his Lord.
    5. The feet of burnished brass (see Rev. 1: 15) are evi-
dence that Jesus still walks the fiery furnace of trial with
His loved ones.
    6. Jezebel was the daughter of Ethbaal, the sun-wor-
shiping king of Sidon. Ahab, contrary to God's law, married
this devoted sun worshiper and upholder of licentious wor-
ship. See 1 Kings 16: 30-33; 18: 19, 4, 13. Under the in-
fluence of Jezebel there was utter separation from God.
Jezebel is a fit type of the great apostasy under the papacy,
brooking no opposition, tolerating no dissenting opinions,
persecuting to death those who dare oppose. She seduces
God's people. The word planan, translated "seduce," says
Vincent, "never means mere error, as such, but fundamental
departure from, the truth." So the papacy has assumed to
change the royal law of God and put man in the place of
Christ.
    7. Power, authority, over the nations is a fitting promise
to those who have suffered under nations that were misled
by papal principles. In God's plan there will be a reversal.
He has shared with His people in their persecutions; they
will share with Him His triumphant glory.
    8. Hear, all hear, what the Spirit saith to the churches.
The eternal principles of God which held in the past will
still hold. The perversion of good which wrought evil in the
past will, if permitted, do it again. Our safety is to hear
His voice, let His blood wash away our sin, and His presence
live in us.

                         Questions
                           SARDIS
   "Sardis" means "song of joy," or "that which re-
mains." Sardis represents the conditions in the churches
that grew out of the Reformation.
   1. How does our Lord address Himself to Sardis?
Rev, 3: 1, first part. Note 1.
   2. How does He reprove that church? Verse 1, last
part. Note 2.

  9. What special assurance is given Philadelphia?
Verse 10. Note 4.
10. What hope and exhortation are given? Verse 11.
11. What is the promise to the overcomer? Verse 12.
                         LAODICEA
  "Laodicea" signifies a "judging of the people." From
1844 to the close of probation is the hour of God's judg-
ment. After this work of judging the people, the Lord
will come. The message to the world in this judgment
hour is the threefold message of Rev. 14: 6-12, the com-
mandments of God, and the faith of Jesus, which has
brought out this Seventh-day Adventist people.
  12. How does our Lord greet Laodicea? Verse 14.
Note 5.
  13. What sad condition is Laodicea warned against?
Verses 15-17. Note 6.
  14. What are those in that condition counseled to do?
Verse 18.
  15. What evidence of His love does He cite? In view
of this, what should those addressed do? Verse 19.
Note 7.
  16. How earnest is He in His love? Verse 20. Note 8.
  17. What promise is given to the overcomer? Verse 21.
  18. To how many are these instructions to all the
churches given? Verse 22.
                          Notes
   1. "I will put upon you none other burden," was the
promise made at the close of the preceding period of the
church. Rev. 2: 24. For nearly eighteen centuries the church
had felt the hand ofpersecution laid heavily upon her, and
many millions had fallen in death. At the close of the
Thyatira period, the church was never again to pass through
like scenes. This is truly a cause for rejoicing.
   2. The Reformation movement began by lifting up the
Bible as the rule of faith, but soon creeds and customs pre-
vented growth in the advancing light of truth. Those who
have started in reform and then ceased to grow must take
fresh hold of principles already learned and go on to fuller
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 17
knowledge and experience in the truth. The fatal weakness
in the reformed churches was the tendency to stand still
where the first reformers left them. Growth is the law of
spiritual life. See Prov. 4: 18; John 12: 36.
    3. The key to the application of the prophecy of this
church is found in the introduction. It is the Royal Priest
of the tribe of Judah, of the seed of David (Isa. 22: 22, 23),
beginning the last stage of His priestly work in the sanc-
tuary on high. He is about to cease His ministry in the holy
place; He is about to enter the most holy place for the final
putting away of the sins of His people. To those who looked
and longed for His coming and were disappointed, who be-
came the butt and jeer of thousands, the Lord declares, "Be-
hold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can
shut it." And the opened door means the light and truth
of God's last message, explaining the darker past and re-
vealing the entrance to greater truth. Disappointment
dimmed hopes and sapped power; but the faithful Phila-
delphians did not wholly relinquish the hand of power, nor
did they deny Christ.
    4. It will be noted that there is no reproof in the Lord's
letter to Philadelphia, unless it is implied in the "little
strength." The advent spirit is the spirit to continue to the
end. "Philadelphia" means "brotherly love." All the story
of the early advent movement, leading up to the autumn of
1844, at which time the advent people expected to meet their
Lord, shows that believers were bound together in ties of
fellowship and love like that which reigns in heaven, which
they expected soon to enter. Coming out from various
churches and the world, they were made one by the "blessed
hope."
                 "Blest be the tie that binds
                    Our hearts in Christian love;
                  The fellowship of kindred minds
                    Is like to that above."

    Now, with the ministry in the heavenly sanctuary almost
finished and the coining of the Lord at the very door, all
hearts must again let in the love of heaven and the spirit of
1844, which will make the true believers one and fit them
to live with the angels.
    5. It is the Amen, the Firm, the Faithful, the True to
the end, the faithful Witness from the beginning, the Author,
the Beginner of God's creation, that gives the counsel. He is
the Author and Finisher. Heb. 12: 2. He witnessed .true
to Ephesus in the first period; He is the same to Laodicea
in the last.
    6. The True Witness testified to the blessed condition
of Philadelphia expecting to meet with the Lord. He wit-
 18          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  nesses as truly to the 'deadly peril of drowsiness and formal-
  ism in the Laodicean period of waiting. He pleads that in
  the hour of the closing judgment work, not a soul may be
  lukewarm, assuming riches in the possession of the form of
  the truth, while lacking the real experience of the power of
  the truth. That is the special peril of the last days. Yet
  God loves the souls in this condition. Therefore He rebukes
  and chastens them, and calls for repentance. "Repent when
  one does not feel like it?"—Yes, repent. Confess all the sin,
  plead before God till the hard heart softens, and the stub-
  born will breaks, and the soul is no longer indifferent. There
  is no other way.
      7. The real experience is necessary to the giving of the
  message of the Judgment now due. The specific Philadelphia
  period of the church brought us to the autumn of 1844, when
  the long period of the 2,300 days ended, and the work of the
• Judgment was opened in the most holy of the heavenly
  sanctuary. "I was shown that . . . the time for the com-
  mandments of God to shine out with all their importance,
  and for. God's people to be tried on the Sabbath truth, was
  when the door was opened in the most holy place in the
  heavenly sanctuary, where the ark is, in which is contained
  the Ten Commandments. This door was not opened until
  the mediation of Jesus was finished in the holy place of the
  sanctuary in 1844. Then Jesus rose up and shut the door
  of the holy place, and opened the door into the most holy,
  and passed within the second veil, where He now stands by
  the ark, and where the faith of Israel now reaches. I saw
  that Jesus had shut the door of the holy place, and no man
  can open it; and that He had opened the door into the most
  holy, and no man can shut it (Rev. 3: 7, 8) ; and that since
  Jesus has opened the door into the most holy place, which
  contains the ark, the commandments have been shining out
  to God's people, and they are being tested on the Sabbath
  question."—"Early Writings," old edition, pages 34, 35.
      8. Open the door; invite the Guest. Let Him make the
  room of your heart ready, and cleanse the soul. Spread be-
  fore Him all you have, sorrows, temptations, weaknesses,
  and let His presence transmute them into joys, faith,
  strength, and power in God. Then become His guest. Sit
  at His table. Partake of all the delectable things of heaven.
  There is no promise in all the Word more precious than that
  in Rev. 3: 20. Christ will give the needed grace to every
  soul that heeds His counsel in this time when the church
  must keep ready to meet its coming Lord.

  14. What did the prophet hear as to the grand sequel
of the opening of the book? Verse 13. Note 5.
  15. What response was there to this? Verse 14.
                            Notes
   1. "After this" does not mean that what John relates in
chapter 4 came after all the events of the seven churches,
but that the view of chapters 4 to 8 was a new vision of other
events. These events cover the same period as the churches.
The door was opened; it had once been closed. It was not a
20         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

door opening into heaven, but a door in heaven that was
opened. Subsequent revelations show that this was our
Lord's entrance upon His priesthood in the heavenly sanc-
tuary after His ascension. See Heb. 9: 8.
    2. God has a throne as surely as He has a kingdom. He
is a personal God. Although everywhere present by His
Holy Spirit, the great Father is somewhere as He is nowhere
else. See 1 Kings 22: 19; Isa. 6: 1; Dan. 7: 9; Ps. 103: 19.
    3. John looked for the Lion, and found a Lamb in the
midst, that is, within the circle of the rainbow. Not by
force or power or fear did Christ prevail, but by sacrifice
and gentleness. In the Lamb is greater potency than in all
the armies and greatness of the universe. The Lamb was
slain in purpose from the foundation of the world. 1 Peter
1: 19, 20. The climax was reached in the actuality of the
purpose on Calvary. The Lamb takes the book; He is
worthy.
    4. The angels join in the mighty chorus. The rebel
Lucifer was conquered. His power over the closed graves
was broken by the Lamb; and the sevenfold ascription to the
Lamb of "power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
honor, and glory, and blessing" ascends to the highest
heaven. He is worthy.
    5. The mighty power of God's love eventually reaches
and renews all creation, blots out all sin, and the universe
ascribes to both Father and Son "blessing, and honor, and
glory, and power, . . . forever and ever." "Affliction shall
not rise up the second time." Nahum 1: 9. "There shall be
no more curse."

    General Note.—In the vision of the seven churches, we
studied the spiritual history of the church of Christ as de-
veloped in seven successive eras, or periods, from apostolic
days to the end of time. The seven seals naturally suggest
a. line of prophecy covering the same general period, bring-
ing out additional phases of history. The series of the seven
churches gives a view of the church of Christ in the midst
of apostasy and through the experiences of the latter days.
This series of the seven seals gives a view of the falling
away, and the history of the apostate church in alliance
with the world, to the long years of papal supremacy. While
the sixth in the series of the seven churches brings us to the
advent movement of 1833-44, and to the generation that is
to see the coming of the Lord, the sixth seal in this series
slow to be studied, by an abrupt change from symbolic to
literal prophecy, deals with the signs of the second advent
and the scenes of the end. Thus there is a distinct parallel
in the idea of the approaching advent in the sixth stage of
each series, while the seventh in each touches eternity.
                           Questions
  1. What occurred when the first seal was opened?
Rev. 6: 1.
   2. What did the prophet see? Verse 2. Note 1.

   6. What followed the opening of the third seal?
Verse 5.
   7. What was a voice heard to say? Verse 6. Note 3.
   8. What did John hear when the fourth seal was

   9. What did he then see? Verse 8, first part.
  10. What power was given the rider? Verse 8, last

  11. What did John see when the fifth seal was opened?
Verse 9.
  12. What were the souls represented as saying? Verse

  13. What was done in response to this call for justice?
Verse 11. Note 6.
                             Notes
    1. The rider on the white horse, going forth to conquer,
fitly symbolizes the apostolic church going forth in the con-
quering power of Christ, with the gospel in its purity. See
Acts 8: 4. Compare Rev. 2: 2, 3, the message to the apostolic
church in the prophecy of the seven churches. In the study
of the messages to the seven churches, we found that, while
the principles involved in each message have lessons for
all time, the specifications applied particularly to distinct and
successive eras. So, while the symbolism of each of these
seals teaches lessons applicable in all time, they too have a
specific application to the same successive eras in the history
covered by the prophecy of the seven churches.
    2. The symbols of the second seal fitly represent the fall-
ing away of the great body of the church from primitive
purity after apostolic days. "Errors began to arise, worldli-
ness came in. The ecclesiastical powers sought the alliance
of the secular. Troubles and commotions were the result."
See the reference to the apostate professors in this second
era of the church, in the message to the loyal ones in Rev.
2: 9. Worldliness and compromise and dependence on fleshly
power must ever work the same. Note that the principles in-
volved in each stage of the great controversy are living issues
for all time.
    3. In the third era of the church, say from Constantine's
days (A. D. 323) to the full establishment of papal supremacy
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 23

(533-538), we found in the message to the third, or Perga-
mos, church, that the believers were in great peril because
of Satan's very seat in their midst. The church of the
apostasy had fully joined the world. Black is the fit symbol
of this stage. See Matt. 6: 23. As worldliness and com-
mercialism came in, the oil and wine of the Spirit's grace
leaked out. The price of a measure of wheat indicates
scarcity—a famine of the word of the Lord.
   4. Compare this with the description of the apostate in-
fluences under which the loyal believers suffered in the
fourth, or Thyatira, stage of the seven churches. Rev. 2:
18-20. The apostate church is there described as the per-
secuting Jezebel, and the teachings as the doctrine of Satan.
In this fourth seal, the symbolism scarcely needs interpre-
tation, so vividly does it picture the dark days of papal
supremacy. "Hell" or "hades" (R. V.) means the grave.
See Dan. 7: 25 for a description of how this power sent the
saints of God to death and the grave.
    5. Here the fifth seal plainly suggests the blood of the
martyrs and of the faithful of past ages crying out to God




to end the long reign of apostasy and sin. While the dead are
unconscious, the Bible represents the blood, or life, of those
wronged crying to God for justice to be rendered. Compare
Gen. 4: 10; Heb. 11: 4. When great Babylon is dealt with,

glorified by the death of some who study this lesson.

                            Notes
    1. The great earthquake, that of Lisbon, November 1,
1755, destroyed the city of Lisbon, then having 30,000 houses
and a population of 200,000. That mighty temblor reached
its fingers far into Africa, covered the continent of Europe,
and extended unknown distances at sea. Its area was "about
4,000 miles one way, and 2,000 the other; so that considering
its duration [it lasted two minutes], extent, and mischievous
effects, it seems to be one of the greatest calamities that has
befallen the world in almost any age." The sensitive seismo-
graphs of to-day would probably have recorded it as uni-
versal.
    "The Dark Day" occurred May 19, 1780. Matt. 24: 29;
Mark 13: 24. "The whole moon" (A. R. V.), the full moon,
was darkened the following night. Whenever it appeared on
that memorable night, it had the color of blood.
    The falling of the stars, the most notable meteoric shower
of history, occurred November 13, 1833.
    2. The Greek word rendered "departed" means separated.
The atmospheric heavens separate and roll back. This will
be followed by the great shaking when God speaks. Joel
3 : 16.
    3. The silence in heaven occurs when all the angels come
with our Lord to gather His children home. Matt. 16: 27;
25: 31. This shows that the prophecy of the seals reaches
to the end.
    4: The sealing work comes within the sixth seal, but it
is not related till its close. Its chronological setting in the
main prophecy is between verses 13 and 14 of chapter 6, but
26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
a view of this important work is not given till after the regu-
lar events of the sixth seal are noted. It is as if a traveler
were giving an account of his journey in various stages, and
after finishing a certain stage, goes back and relates an im-
portant event connected with that time.
    5. The blowing of four winds of war would produce the
"whirlwind" of Jer. 25: 32, 33, and would involve the whole
earth. So at a time when it would certainly seem that such
would be the case, another angel cries to hold until God's
work is done. (See "Early Writings," pages 30, 31, old
edition; new edition, pages 38, 39.) "The Most High" rules,
and His work must be done.
    6. The seal of "the• living God" carries with it the au-
thority of the living God, tells who He is, and the extent of
His dominion, and must be connected with His law. Of
that royal law, the Decalogue, four of its divisions tell us who
the Lawgiver is—"Jehovah thy God" (A. R. V.), the eter-
nally self-existent Deity. But there is only one—namely,
the fourth commandment—that tells who this great Jehovah
is, the basis of His authority, and the extent of His do-
minion,—the Maker of heaven and earth and all things
therein. The Sabbath is therefore the memorial of His
creative power (Ex. 20: 8-11), the memorial and sign of
creative power in' redeeming love (Deut. 5: 15), and the con-
stant living sign of the exercise of that same power in the
sanctification of His people forever (Ex. 31: 13; Ezek.
20: 12). When that power is grasped by faith, when God's
Sabbath is thus received, the character of God, the name of
God, is stamped upon His•child. He is sealed with God's
seal, labeled for eternity with the all-prevailing name. (See
Rev. 14: 1; 3: 12.) No one can thus receive the Sabbath
and not equally receive all God's commandments.
    7. The Scripture is clear: the Sabbath is the seal; the
Holy Spirit is the Sealer, or the one who impresses the seal.

28         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                             Notes
    1. "Wonder," better translated "sign," that which sig-
nifies, a token, or symbol.
    "In heaven." It is in the spiritual realm that the great
controversy of the chapter is waged. So both the church
and her foes are by the apostle spoken of as in "the heavenly
places." See Eph. 2: 6; 6: 12, margin.
    2. A pure woman in prophecy represents the true church.
"I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate
woman." Jer. 6: 2. "I have espoused you . . . as a chaste
virgin to Christ." 2 Cor. 11: 2. The woman seen in heaven,
upheld by the power of God, is therefore the symbol of the
people or church.
    Jesus is the "Sun of righteousness." He clothes the
church in His glory. See Isa. 61: 10; Rev. 19: 8 ; Ps. 45: 13.
The sun fitly represents the glory of the new dispensation,
while "the moon under her feet" represents the sacrificial
system, which had borrowed its light from Christ, the "Sun
of righteousness," and had now passed away.
    The "crown of twelve stars" would indicate victory, and
the number would naturally symbolize the twelve tribes, and
the twelve apostles, who at last rule over the twelve tribes.
See Matt. 19: 28; Rev. 21: 14.
    3. The church of God came into outward organized ex-
istence at the Exodus. As long as they were faithful, they
prospered. The climax was reached in the days of Solomon.
Then came decline, added transgression, and greater de-
cline, till the throne, the city, the center of worship, were
destroyed, and the church with no king was taken captive
to Babylon. 2 Chron. 36: 14-21. Then began the travailing
for the Deliverer, the Man-child. Ps. 137: 1-4. "0 that the
salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!" Ps. 14: 7.
For about six centuries, the church was longing for her De-
liverer.
    4. The dragon was seen "in heaven," indicating a spiritual
conflict. The color red is a symbol of war and bloodshed.
See the red horse of Rev. 6: 4. The meaning of the symbol
in this chapter is explained. The dragon is expressly called
"that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan, which de-
ceiveth the whole world." Here he is working through pagan
Rome to destroy the Deliverer. Rev. 12: 9.
    5. The third part of the stars means the angels who re-
belled in Lucifer's rebellion in heaven. See Jude 6; 2 Peter
2: 4. Jesus met these fallen spirits in His ministry as un-
clean, malevolent demons. Their work, their warfare, lies
in the spiritual world. Satan is "prince of the power of
the air."
    6. "Stood before the woman," waited through ail her
time of longing, waited through the reign of Babylon, of
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                29
Medo-Persia, of Greece. He sought to slay the royal seed and
the church through Babylon; through Medo-Persia, by
Haman; through Greece, by Antiochus Epiphanes; through
pagan Rome, by Herod and Pilate, under the reign of the
former of whom Jesus was born, and under the latter He
died. Knowing that the Son of God whom he hated in
heaven would come in the likeness of sinful flesh, the devil
resolved to destroy the race, the universe, at one fell blow,
by destroying the One who had undertaken the vindication
of God's character of love and the salvation of sinners. He
read the promises to the seed through Abraham, Isaac, Ja-
cob, Judah, David, and their seed.
     7. The 'Child is born in lowly Bethlehem, according to the
very prophecy which predicted Zion's travail. Micah 5: 2.
We can trace Satan's planning in the full inn, that the
mother might be exposed in the cold, open night; in the
jealousy of Herod when he slays the children, calculating to
destroy the infant Redeemer. The devil plotted destruction
of His character, plotted the destruction of His life, and
finally, through the power of pagan Rome, accomplished it
under Pilate, a Roman governor, on a Roman cross, and
shut Him in a rock sepulcher under a Roman seal.
   ' 8. Jesus was caught up to God and to His throne in His
resurrection from the dead.
     9. The combatants show that this warfare which began
in heaven above was now continuing in "heavenly places"
 (that is, the spiritual realm). "Michael" means, "who is •
like God." Jude 9; 1 Thess. 4: 16; John 5: 28, 39; Dan. 12: 1,
show this Archangel to be identical with the Son of God
among the angels, even as He was Jesus the Son of God
among men. And this conflict was waged from the time of
sin's entrance till "the Word became flesh."
     10. "Prevailed not." Thank God that in all the conflicts,
the devil and demons "prevailed not." Righteousness was
stronger than sin; love stronger than hate; truth stronger
than a lie; right stronger than might. God was vindicated
by His Son every step of the way.
   - "Neither was their place found any more in heaven."
 Until that mighty demonstration of God's justice and wis-
dom and lovethe crucifixion—even the angels of God were
on probation, perplexed over Satan's charges, yet loyal to
the Master. They did not, could not understand what it all
meant. Until the great question was settled, God in some
 way had allowed the fallen ,angels certain privileges of ap-
 proach that were not now to be longer granted. Job 1: 6.
 When the vindictive hate of the devil and his angels com-
 passed the death of Infinite Love, and when, by the power
 of an endless life, Jesus had triumphed over death, all the
 powers of darkness were cast down yet again.

  13. What further manifestation was there of satanic

  14. What are the characteristics of the remnant of

                            Notes
    1. "A great voice." The message is more important than
the messenger. It may have been Gabriel's voice, or a voice
from the elders, but that matters not to us; it gave a great
message. The mighty John the Baptist was content to be
"a voice" for God "crying in the wilderness."
    2. "Now" was the NOW for which ages had waited.
At this time, the hosts of evil were hurled against Christ with
all their cruel, baleful, deceptive devices, that God's charac-
ter might be marred, and that He might fail. But He did
not fail. Forward He pressed to the very cross of Calvary,
ever revealing the Father, and vindicating the truth of His
promise and precept, triumphant even in death. For that
"NOW" the universe had waited.
    "NOW is come salvation;" it is eternally assured—the
immutable promise and oath to Abraham (Heb. 6: 17, 18),
 by the life and death and resurrection of our Lord. He
"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
 But in worse case than any follower can be called to meet,
 He met and conquered. He can help all, save all, and in
 all who receive Him, conquer all. Heb. 2: 18; 7: 25. He
 won eternal salvation.
     "And strength." His power of righteousness is resur-
 rection power. "In the way of righteousness is life." His
 resurrection demonstrated Him to be the Son of God with
 power. Rom. 1: 3, 4. That is the power which comes to
 us by faith in Jesus. Eph. 1: 19-23.
     "And the kingdom." It is assured, for the King has con-
 quered supremely. When He triumphed over death, then
 was sung the song of triumph in Ps. 24: 7-9. The King was
 ready. He waits till His subjects are gathered, then will He
 claim His own.
     "And the power of His Christ." Authority succeeds
 power. Earthly rulers often claim authority without power.
 Authority—power—did not come to Jesus till He visibly
 merited it. Not till after His resurrection did He say, "All
 power [authority] is given unto Me in heaven and in earth."
 Salvation, power, kingdom, authority, are ours, in Him.
     3. The accuser met Jesus on the mount of temptation;
 in men and women, sinful and diseased; in demon-possessed
 souls; in ambitious, worldly men; in the Garden of Geth-
32          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
semane; in his hellish hate on the cross of Calvary. Yet
Jesus conquered; the accuser was cast down. No more
would he enter the assembly of the sons of God (Job 1: 6),
there to accuse God of partiality, or God's children of selfish-
ness. He is cast down; his eternal defeat is manifested
openly to all the universe.
    4. The heavens may well rejoice; for no more will there
be an accuser at heaven's gates, to attribute false motives
to God's servants.
    5. Woe to the earth; the devil is here. He could not
conquer the heavenly King; he will strive against that King's
earthly subjects. Desperate, failing in his great attack, he
will do all in his power to destroy others. Take home to
heart the warning, and know that the power to conquer
awaits you in Jesus.
    6. Note that in this chapter, the dragon, the devil, is
the primal persecutor, because he is the deceiver. It will
give us more charity for his human tools and agents and
dupes if we will appreciate his evil lordship. As far as we
have influence, we should labor to save them from the snares
of his evil principles and devices.
    The church militant is still left to struggle against the
mighty foe, to fail if she forgets her Lord, to triumph if her
faith abides in Him. The persecutions began immediately,
but reached their worst under the long papal period of per-
secution; but behind both pagan and papal was the devil.
    7. The period referred to in Rev. 12: 6, 14 is the 1,260
years of papal supremacy.
    8. "Water as a flood" fitly represents the armies sent to
destroy the faithful followers of Christ.
    9. In mountain fastnesses, believers found refuge; and
finally the very nations of earth revolted against the perse-
cutions. France, "the eldest daughter of the church,' was
in the throes of revolution and infidelity. Austria, a strong
Catholic country, through her empress, Maria Theresa, issued
a modified decree of toleration in 1776; and in the New World,
a haven of refuge opened for those oppressed for conscience'
sake.

    1. The sea here, as in Dan. 7: 1, 2, refers to "peoples, and
multitudes, and nations, and tongues." Rev. 17: 15. Like the
beasts mentioned by Daniel (Dan. 7:2, 3), this also arises
out of the sea, denoting an organization among the nations.
    2. The seven heads and the ten horns connect this beast
with the dragon. That the beast is religious is shown by
the names of blasphemy. One of the definitions of blasphemy
is, claiming the attributes of God.
    3. The "leopard," Grecia; the "bear," Medo-Persia; the
"lion," Babylon; the "ten horns," Rome ..(Dan. 7: 3-7), show
this beast of our lesson to be the composite of all four of
Daniel. Daniel sees them as four distinct, successive em-
pires. John sees them as one great system, culminating in
Rome papal, represented in Daniel's vision by the little horn
of chapter 7. Note the parallels between the first beast of
Revelation 13 and the little horn power. (Compare Rev.
13: 2, 5, 6, 7, 10 and Dan. 7: 8, 20, 21, 25, 26.) It must not
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 35

be ignored that the mouth of the beast was the mouth of
the lion, the symbol of Babylon. It is the mouth that
speaks; and the utterances of the beast, so far as God or
His people are concerned, all had their origin in the world-
wide apostasy of Babylon. The beast is primarily a Baby-
lonian beast; and the system for which the beast stands is
Babylonian in origin and character, rebellious, perversive, op-
pressive, assumptive, and blasphemous.
    4. The dragon, remember, is "that old serpent, called the
devil, and Satan." Rev. 12: 9. He has been back of the
whole Babylonian beast system. In fact, Lucifer is the
primal king of Babylon. See Isa. 14: 4, 12-14. He has
molded and used all the various forms under which that
system has existed from Babylon down. When Babylon
passed away, Medo-Persia succeeded, then Greece, then Rome;
and the old religious mysteries,—perversive, oppressive, as-
sumptive, and blasphemous,—were manifest in them all. It
was through Rome pagan that Rome papal succeeded to
empire.
    5. In the events of the French Revolution, the papacy
 received a deadly wound. The healing of that deadly
wound has been going on rapidly in our times. When it
is fully healed, we shall see the world admiring, won-
 dering, worshiping; and to worship the agent is to wor-
 ship the principal.
    6. "Forty and two months," "a thousand two hundred
 and threescore days," "time, and times, and half a time,"
 are all the same period, and at thirty days to the month,
 the Bible reckoning (compare Gen. 7: 11; 8: 5 with Gen.
7: 24; 8:4), make 1,260 days. A day in prophecy sym-
 bolizes a year (Ezek. 4: 4, 6), making 1,260 years for
 the domination of the papal head. This period is re-
 peated again and again in Scripture, which shows its im-
 portance. The supremacy began in that eventful period
533-538, and ended in an equally important period, 1793-
1798. Justinian, emperor of -Rome, decreed that the
 bishop of Rome should be "head over all the holy
 churches," and "true and only corrector of heretics," in
533; and the victory over the Arian Ostrogoths in 538
 cleared the way before the papacy. At the end came the
 French Revolution in 1793, and the capture of Pope Pius
 VI in 1798. The power of the papacy to define heresy and
 punish heretics was broken. These were the days of papal
  supremacy, or spiritual domination.
     7. The papacy declares that its priests have power_ to
 absolve from sin, to change the wafer into the real hod?
  and blood of Christ, to change the times and law of God.
  (Dan. 7: 25.)
36         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   8. Surely the papacy has made war with the saints,
whom she denominated pernicious heretics. She does not
deny the punishment of heretics. She holds that they are
the enemies of both church and state, and therefore ought
to be punished with death if need be.
   9. The one who took many captive was taken captive.
The beast that slew by the sword was itself slain by the
separation of the two essential elements, church and state,
which made it what it was. Our lesson leaves us at the
end of the 1,260 years, with the papal supremacy broken.
  10. Note the difference between God's people here and
in the days preceding Christ's coming. Here they are
called saints, and have patience and faith. Many things
were hidden from them. In the end (Rev. 14 : 12) , they
have patience and faith, and keep the commandments
of God.

                             Notes
    1. Note first that the prophet saw not the same beast,
or a part of the same, nor a beast on the same territory,
but "another beast," in another territory, "the earth."
The first came up from the sea, waters being the symbol
of multitudes and nations (Rev. 17: 15). The second, "an-
other beast," was seen coming "out of the earth," a new ter-
ritory in the prophetic field. The prophecy indicates the
time of its arising, when the other beast was going into cap-
tivity, in the days of 1792-1798; the place is new territory
in the prophecy, a ,practically uninhabited land; the manner
of his "coming up' indicates a growing up, peaceably, as a
plant grows. There was no power of prominence rising in
the world at that time save the United States of America.
G. A. Townsend, in "New World Compared with the Old,"
page 462, speaks of America as "coming forth from vacancy;"
and on page 635, referring to America, he says, "Like a
silent seed it grew into an empire."
    2. "Two horns like a lamb." This is eminently repre-
sentative of two fundamental principles upon which the new
 republic was founded. These principles are, first, the equality
of man; second, freedom of conscience in religion, to choose
or to refuse. These principles are in Christianity alone of
all religions, and were set forth in those times in the organic
 documents of the United States alone of all governments.
 Therefore the prophecy points to the United States alone, as
 coming up at the specified time and bearing the specified
 characteristics.
    To speak as a dragon is to enact oppressive, pefsecuting
 laws, as the dragon did. Rev. 12: 13, 15. This is an after
38          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
development. The power was to belie its high profession and
to become a persecutor.
    3. Not "before him" in the sense of time, but "in his
sight," "in his presence." That is, the two-horned beast
exercises in his own domain all the authority that the first
beast did and does in his domain.
    4. As the first beast compelled the worship of the dragon
by enforcing his principles, so the two-horned beast causes
the worship of the first beast by enforcing the principles of
that beast. Note also that it is the restored first beast, for
his "deadly wound was healed."
    5. Modern spiritualism had its rise in the western re-
public. By this deception, the devil works and will work
in the last days "with all power and signs and lying won-
ders." 2 Thess. 2: 9, 10. Under this government will be
counterfeited Elijah's great miracle of bringing down fire
out of heaven. See 1 Kings 18: 36-39. Men have witnessed
some of these wonders. More will be seen. All these are
wrought to deceive.
    6. The first beast, the papacy, in the fullness of its power,
is an ecclesiastical organization bringing the power of the
state to the enforcement of religious observances. An image,
or likeness of this must be the use of civil power for en-
forcement of religious observances under religious organiza-
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 39

tions, not organically of the papacy itself, working in har-
mony with papal principles.
    7. The mark of the beast must be the distinguishing
characteristic of the beast and his worshipers, and that which
will distinguish them from the worshipers of God. God's
mark, or seal, is His holy Sabbath, the seventh day. See
lesson 8. The mark, therefore, must be the false sabbath,
which the apostasy has substituted for the Sabbath of the
Lord. Says the Kansas City Catholic of February 9, 1873,
"The Catholic Church of its own infallible authority created
Sunday a holy day to take the place of the Sabbath of the
old law." "Abridgment of Christian Doctrine," a Catholic
work, says: "Question.—liow prove you that the church hath
power to command feasts and holy days? Answer.—By the
very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protes-
tants allow of." Various organizations and societies, like the
American Sabbath Union, the National Reform Association,
the Federal Council of Churches, and others, have sought for
years to secure laws enforcing the national observance of
Sunday as a test of religious life. Read these characteristic
utterances: "It [Sunday] is the test of all religions."—Dr.
W. W. Evarts. "When the people through their representa-
tives legalize the first day of the week as a day of rest and
worship for those who choose to observe it, it is the sign of
a Christian nation."—Christian Oracle, January 12, 1903.
     The Rev. J. G. Lorimer calls "Sunday a mark of the
American religion."
     There is a multitude of evidences which clearly indicate
 that the nation will fulfill the prophecy and enforce the mark
 under penalty of the boycott applied on religious test.
     8. "Six hundred threescore and six." The bishop of
 Rome claims to be the vicar of the Son of God—in Latin,
 the language of the Roman Church, Vicarius Filii Dei. Five
 of these letters in the Roman notation have numerical values
 —I, V, L, C, D; and the sum of their use is as follows: V--=5,
        C=100, 1=1, U (same as V)=---5, 1=-1, L=50, 1=1,
1=1, D=--500, 1=  -1: total, 666.
