  11. Who acts as mediator in this creative work by

2 : 5. Note 6.
  12. In what language is the original creation repre-
sented as a birth? Ps. 90: 1, 2. Note 7.
  13. In what teaching did Jesus emphasize the necessity
of a new birth? John 3: 3. Note 8.
  14. Through what agency is this new birth effected?
1 Peter 1: 23. Note 9.
                            Notes
    1. Only the eternal Son, one with the Father, could reveal
God. The Son is "the image of the invisible God."
    2. All things and all beings owe their existence to the
working of God through Jesus Christ.
    3. The Word who "was God" is the eternal Son. Rev.
19: 11-13. Compare Heb. 1: 2.
    4. By virtue of His personal relation to the Father, the
Son of God was the agent through whom the original act of
creation was performed, and the mediatorial principle is
inherent in the very nature of His being. He was and is
the mediator between the Father and all His created works.
    "The restriction of the thought of mediatorship and sac-
rifice to the gracious intervention of the eternal Son on behalf
of fallen and sinful man has narrowed and thrown out of
its proper proportion our thought of the dignity and the glory
of the Son, and of the grandeur of His work.. . . The stand-
ing truth, that, from the first instant of creation, there has
been a mediator between the Father and creation, one through
whom, necessarily, creation came into being, renders it easier
for us to apprehend alike the necessity, and (such is the love
of God) the probability, of an atoning mediator who should
undo the mischief of sin; and, this being so, the impossibility
that it can be any other than the untreated mediator, through
whom and for whom were all things made, the eternal Son."—
"The One Mediator," P. G. Medd, page 69.
    "We use the term 'mediator' . . . in its strictly proper and
derivative meaning of 'one who is a means of intercourse be-
tween two other parties, and through whom action passes
from either to other,' a meaning much wider than its too
commonly restricted application to Christ as the atoning and
reconciling mediator between man, as fallen and sinful, and
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     5
God his maker. Mediation in this latter sense, as exercised
by the eternal Son, however specially necessary and unspeak-
ably precious, is still a part of a larger whole. It is a special
function of a larger office, a result of a wider mediatorial re-
lation in which He stands to unfallen as well as to fallen
natures, indeed, to all created existence."—Id., page 19.
    5. In both of these texts, the margin of the Revised Ver-
sion suggests "creation" in place of "creature."
    6. The eternal Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was the
mediator in the original creation, is necessarily the mediator
in the new creation. Only He who mediated in the material
creation can be the mediator in the spiritual creation, since
both require the same manifestation of the same infinite
power. This excludes all created beings from acting in a
mediatorial capacity, and is an all-sufficient answer to the
claims in behalf of the Roman Catholic priesthood.
    7. Instead of "hadst formed" in verse 2, the margin of
the Revised Version suggests "gayest birth 10." Another
translation reads, "Before the mountains were born.",
    8. Compare 1 Cor. 15: 8, where the apostle Paul speaks
of himself as "one born out of due time."
    9. The word was the channel through which the eternal
Son revealed the power for the original creation, or birth
 (Ps. 33: 6, 9) ; and through the same word, the same Son
reveals the same power for the new creation, or birth.

    This lesson teaches that-
   1. There is only one mediator.
    2. That mediator is the eternal Son of God.
    3. The mediatorial work of the Son in the gospel is a
necessary consequence of His wider mediatorial relationship
to the Father in respect to all things.
    4. The success of the Son as mediator in creating and
upholding all things is the guarantee of His success in re-
creating and upholding fallen man.
    5. Any system of human mediation—such as the Roman
Catholic priesthood—is a counterfeit of the true, and cannot
accomplish the necessary work—a new creation.

Note 4.
  15. What privilege is conferred upon all sinners
through the work of our great High Priest? Rev. 1: 5, 6.
Note 5.
                          Notes
   1. The relation is a necessary one. Only He who was
Himself the Son of God could, by His ministry as priest,
restore the privilege of sonship to those who had lost it.
See Gal. 4: 4, 5.
   "In the early beginnings of human history and under the
earliest dispensations, priesthood was connected with primo-
geniture. The first-born was the priest. This primeval ordi-
nance was the earthly and human reflection of the divine pre-
rogative of the Son of God."—"The One Mediator," P. G.
Medd, page 71.
    In the first chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, the book
especially devoted to the exposition of the priesthood, the
exalted nature of the Son of God is set forth as furnishing
the root idea of His office as priest. Heb. 1: 2, 5, 8.
    2. The Son of God became the Son of man. Divinity and
humanity met in Him, and He thus formed the meeting place
between God and man.
    3. It is interesting to notice that through the mediation
of the eternal Son, before sin came into the world, the original
creation was accomplished by means of ten creative command-
ments. Gen. 1: 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28. Man, who
was created in the image of God, lost that image through
8           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
disobedience. Through the mediatorial work of the same
eternal Son as High Priest, the image of God is restored in
man by the writing of the Ten Commandments upon his heart,
which became "the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus."
    4. The ministry of Christ, the eternal Son, in the heavenly
sanctuary opens the way for those who have been separated
from God by sin to draw near to Him. Compare Eph. 2: 13.
    Christ declared Himself to be "the way." Through His
mediatorial relation to God the Father, He is God's way out
to all that is outside of Himself; through His mediatorial
relation to man, He is the "new and living way" for man
back to God.
    5. One of the fundamental doctrines of Protestantism is
the priesthood of all believers as opposed to the priestly caste
in the Roman Catholic Church.

   5. As the result of sin, what verdict does the law pro-
nounce upon "all the world"? Rom. 3: 19.
   6. What is required, but cannot be conferred, by the
law? Gal. 2: 21.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     9
   7. What prophecy teaches that there would be an ad-
vocate or priest upon the throne to administer the law?
Zech. 6: 12, 13.
   8. What price has been paid in order to redeem us
from the curse of the law? 1 Peter 1: 18, 19. Compare
Acts 20: 28; Gal. 3:13.
   9. How will the righteousness required by the law be
 upplied? Rom. 3: 24, 25.
  10. On what basis are we invited to come into court
to answer before a broken law? Isa. 1: 18. Note 3.
  11. What is required in order to escape condemnation?
John 5:24. Compare John 3: 18 and Rom. 8: 1.
  12. What will be the result in the case of those who
do not accept the services of the heavenly Advocate?
Nahum 1: 3.
  13. What gracious offer, is still extended? Isa. 55: 7.
                             Notes
   1. That the advocate with the Father is Jesus, our great
High Priest, is plain from the following considerations: the
advocate is our propitiation for sin; the Son of God is the
propitiation (1 John 4: 10) ; the Son became "a merciful and
faithful High Priest" in order that He might "make propiti-
ation" for sin. The connection between the advocate and the
priest is further indicated by the fact that the word rendered
"propitiation" is the same as is used in the Septuagint ver-
sion of the Old Testament for the mercy seat which formed
the cover of the ark of the covenant.
    2. It is "on the right hand of the throne of the majesty
in the heavens" that our Advocate serves as minister of the
heavenly sanctuary.
    3. This call is phrased in legal language, as if in a court of
justice. Compare "Let us come near together to judgment."
Isa. 41: 1. Lowth's rendering of Isa. 1: 18 is, "Come on
now, and let us plead together." It is the Advocate's encour-
agement to the sinner, who has no standing at court.

Heb. 8 : 1, 2; Dan. 8: 14.
                             Notes
   1. As is plainly shown by Ex. 25: 8, the term "sanctuary"
signifies a holy or sacred place, a dwelling place for the
Most High.
   2. From these specifications, it is generally estimated that
the tabernacle was three times as long as it was broad. The
cubit is variously placed from eighteen to twenty-two inches.
Taking the average of twenty inches would make the struc-
ture about fifty-five feet in length by one third that amount
12         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

in breadth, and the height equal to the width. The holy place
was twice as large as the most holy place.
    3. "The law of God, enshrined within the ark, was the
great rule of righteousness and judgment. That law pro-
nounced death upon the transgressor; but above the law was
the mercy seat, upon which the presence of God was revealed,
and from which, by virtue of the atonement, pardon was
granted to the repentant sinner. Thus in the work of Christ
for our redemption, symbolized by the sanctuary service, 'mercy
and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed each other.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 349.
    4. "No language can describe the glory of the scene pre-
sented within the sanctuary,—the gold-plated walls reflecting
the light from the golden candlestick, the brilliant hues of the
richly embroidered curtains with their shining angels, the
table, and the altar of incense, glittering with gold; beyond
the second veil the sacred ark, with its mystic cherubim, and
above it the holy Shekinah, the visible manifestation of Je-
hovah's presence; all but a dim reflection of the glories of the
temple of God in heaven, the great center of the work for
man's redemption."—Id., page 349.
    5. "The daily service consisted of the morning and evening
burnt offering, the offering of the sweet incense on the golden
        and the special offerings for individual sins. And there
were also offerings for sabbaths, new moons, and special feasts.
    "Every morning and evening a 'lamb of a year old was
burned upon the altar, with its appropriate meat offering,
thus symbolizing the daily consecration of the nation to Je-
hovah, and their constant dependence upon the atoning blood
of Christ. God expressly directed that every offering pre-
sented for the service of the sanctuary should be 'without
blemish.' The priests were to examine all animals brought
as a sacrifice, and were to reject every one in which a defect
was discovered. Only an offering 'without blemish' could be
a symbol of His perfect purity who was to offer Himself as
`a lamb without blemish and without spot.' The apostle Paul
points to these sacrifices as an illustration of what the fol-
lowers of Christ are to become. He says, 'I beseech you there-
fore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
 bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
 your reasonable service.' We are to give ourselves to the
 service of God, and we should seek to make the offering as
 nearly perfect as possible. God will not be pleased with any-
 thing less than the best we can offer. Those who love Him
 with all the heart, will desire to give Him the best service of
 the life, and they will be constantly seeking to bring every
 power of their being into harmony with the laws that will
 promote their ability to do His will."—Id., pages 352, 353.

    6. "No mortal eye but that of the high priest was to look
upon the inner apartment of the sanctuary. Only once a year
could the priest enter there, and that after the most careful
and solemn preparation. With trembling he went in before
God, and the people in reverent silence awaited his return,
their hearts uplifted in earnest prayer for the divine blessing.
Before the mercy seat the high priest made the atonement for
Israel; and in the cloud of glory, God met with him. His
stay here beyond the accustomed time filled them with fear,
lest because of their sins or his own he had been slain by the
glory of the Lord."—Id., page 352.

In A. D. 34. Note 5. See diagram on page 15.
  16. When then must the entire period of two thousand
three hundred years terminate? Ans.—In A. D. 1844.
Note 5.
                           Notes
    1. The application of the ram and the goat is so clearly
given in the explanation of the vision that there can be no
misunderstanding of these symbols. The power that is repre-
sented by the little horn, which became "exceeding great," is
the power that succeeded Grecia. It is a matter of history
that Rome was the universal monarchy that ruled the world
after Greece was conquered. The little horn covers Rome
both pagan and papal.
    2. If all would manifest the interest and earnestness that
Daniel did in the endeavor to gain an understanding of the
prophecies, there would be far less ignorance on those subjects
than is now manifest.
    3. Seventy weeks are determined, or cut off, upon the
people; cut off from the two thousand three hundred days.
    "As both the two thousand three hundred years of chapter
8 and the 'seventy weeks' of chapter 9 start from the Persian
period of Jewish history, in other words, as they both date
from the restoration era which followed the Babylonian cap-
tivity, their starting points must be either identical or closely
related chronologically."—"Light for the Last Days," by H.
Grattan Guinness, London, Hodder and Stoughton, 1893,

                                           THE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DAYS
          5. The heavy line represents the full two thousand three hundred year-day period, the long-
      est prophetic period in the Bible. Beginning in B. C. 457, when the decree was given to restore
      and build Jerusalem (Ezra 7: 11-26; Dan. 9: 25), seven weeks (forty-nine years) are measured
      off to indicate the time occupied in this work of restoration. These, however, are a part of the
      sixty-nine weeks (four hundred eighty-three years) that were to reach to Messiah, the Anointed
      One. Christ was anointed in 27 A. D., at His baptism. Matt. 3: 13-17; Acts 10: 38. In the midst
      of the seventieth week, Christ was crucified, or "cut off," which marked the time when the sac-
      rifices and oblations of the earthly sanctuary were to cease. Dan. 9: 26, 27. This seventieth
      week would reach to 34 A. D. About this time was the stoning of Stephen, the great persecution
      of the church at Jerusalem, and the turning to the gentiles. Acts 7: 59. See chapters 8, 9, 10.
      This marked the close of the seventy weeks, or four hundred ninety years, allotted to the Jew-
      ish people.
          But the seventy weeks are a part of the two thousand three hundred days; and as they (the
      seventy weeks) reach to 34 A. D., the remaining one thousand eight hundred ten years of the two
      thousand three hundred day period must reach to 1844, when the work of judgment, or cleansing
      of the heavenly sanctuary, was to begin. Rev. 14: 6, 7. Then special light began to shine upon
      the whole subject of the sanctuary and Christ's mediatorial or priestly work in it.
en        Four great events, therefore, are located by this great prophetic period,—the first advent,
      the crucifixion, the rejection of the Jewish people as a nation, and the beginning of the work
      of final judgment.
16         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    "There is plainly a close correspondence between the two
visions [of Daniel 8 and 9]. The seventy weeks are said to
be cut off for certain distinct objects; and this implies a longer
period from which they are separated, either the course of
time in general or some period distinctly revealed. Now the
previous date [the two thousand three hundred days] includes
two events,—the restoration of the sacrifice, and the desola-
tion. The first of these is identical in character with the
seventy weeks, which are a period of the restored polity of
Jerusalem; and hence the most natural view of the cutting off
is that which refers to the whore period of the former vision."
—"First Elements of Sacred Prophecy," by T. R. Birks, Lon-
don, 1843, pages 359, 360.
    4. The first and best reason for believing the date of the
decree made by Artaxerxes in the seventh year of his reign,
to be the time from which to reckon the two thousand three
hundred days, or years, is that inspiration itself indicates this
by these words recoi ded in Ezra 6: 14: "They builded, and
finished it [the temple], according to the commandment of the
God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus,
and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia." Thus from both
the divine and the human standpoint, the three decrees are
regarded as a single commandment, "the commandment to
restore and to build Jerusalem."
    It is shown by the canon of Ptolemy, compared with the
Scriptures, that the seventh year of Artaxerxes and 457 B. C.
were coincident.

  14. When did this work of cleansing the sanctuary
begin? Dan. 8: 14. Note 4.
                             Notes
    1. "But the most important question remains to be an-
swered: What is the cleansing of the sanctuary? That there
was such a service in connection with the earthly sanctuary,
is stated in the Old Testament Scriptures. But can there be
anything in heaven to be cleansed? In Hebrews 9 the cleans-
ing of both the earthly and the heavenly sanctuary is plainly
taught. 'Almost all things are by the law purged with blood;
and without shedding of blood is no remission. It was there-
fore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens
should be purified with these [the blood of animals]; but the
heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these,'
even the precious blood of Christ."—"The Great Contro-
versy," page 417.
    2. "For eighteen centuries this work of ministration con-
tinued in the first apartment of the sanctuary. The blood
of Christ, pleaded in behalf of penitent believers, secured
their pardon and acceptance with the Father, yet their sins
still remained upon the books of record. As in the typical
service there was a work of atonement at the close of the
year, so before Christ's work for the redemption of men is
completed, there is a work of atonement for the removal of
sin from the sanctuary. This is the service which began
when the two thousand three hundred days ended. At that
time, as foretold by Daniel the prophet, our High Priest en-
tered the most holy, to perform the last division of His solemn
work,—to cleanse the sanctuary."—Id., page 421.
    3. "The whole ceremony was designed to impress the
Israelites with the holiness of God and His abhorrence of
sin; and, further, to show them that they could not come in
contact with sin without becoming polluted. Every man was
required to afflict his soul while this work of atonement was
going forward. All business was to be laid aside, and the
whole congregation of Israel were to spend the day in solemn
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 19
humiliation before God, with prayer, fasting, and deep search-
ing of heart."--/d., pages 419, 420.
   4. We have found that from 457 B. C., four hundred ninety
years brings us to A. D. 34. But these four hundred ninety
years did not stand alone; they were cut off from the two
thousand three hundred years; therefore we have still one
thousand eight hundred ten years, which, added to thirty-
four, brings us to A. D. 1844, the climax of the great advent
movement which stirred so mightily not only the United
States but also a large part of the Old World.

Mal. 3: 16, 17. Note 6.
                             Notes
    1. "The coming of Christ as our High Priest to the most
holy place, for the cleansing of the sanctuary, brought to
view in Dan. 8: 14; the coming of the Son of than to the
Ancient of days, as presented in Dan. 7: 13; and the coming
of the Lord to His temple, foretold by Malachi, are descrip-
tions of the same event; and this is also represented by the
coming of the bridegroom to the marriage, described by Christ
in the parable of the ten virgins, of Matthew 25.. . .
    "When the work of investigation shall be ended, when the
cases of those who in all ages have professed to be followers
of Christ have been examined and decided, then, and not till
then, probation will close, and the door of mercy will be shut.
Thus in the one short sentence, 'They that were ready went
in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut,' we are
carried down through the Saviour's final ministration, to the
time when the great work for man's salvation shall be corn-
pleted."—"The Great Controversy," pages 426, 428.
    2. "Those who in the Judgment are 'accounted worthy,'
will have a part in the resurrection of the just. Jesus said,
`They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,
and the resurrection from the dead, . . . are equal unto the
angels; and are the children of God, being the children of
the resurrection.' And again He declares that 'they that have
done good' shall come forth 'unto the resurrection of life.' .
Hence they will not be present in person at the tribunal when
their records are examined, and their cases decided.
    "Jesus will appear as their Advocate, to plead in their
behalf before God."—Id., page 482.
    Our Lord's statement concerning those who have part in
the resurrection of the righteous, shows that there must be
a decision in regard to their cases before they are raised from
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 21

the dead, for He speaks of their being accounted worthy to
obtain the resurrection of the dead. So their cases are taken
into account before the resurrection. This is done in the
Investigative Judgment, which takes place in connection with
the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary.
    3. In connection with Christ and the holy angels, the re-
deemed saints engage in the work of examining the records
of the lives of the wicked, and determining their sentences,
as well as those of the fallen angels. This Judgment of
course takes place in heaven, as the saints are taken there
at the first resurrection (1 Thess. 4: 16, 17) ; and this Judg-
ment continues one thousand years. During this time, the
earth lies desolate, with only Satan and his angels to inhabit
the region he has turned into a wilderness.
    4. "The cleansing of the sanctuary therefore involves a
work of investigation,—a work of judgment. This work
must be performed prior to the coming of Christ to redeem
His people; for when He comes, His reward is with Him, to
give to every man according to his works.
    "Thus those who followed in the light of the prophetic
Word saw that instead of coming to the earth at the termina-
tion of the two thousand three hundred days in 1844, Christ,
then entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary,
to perform the closing work of atonement, preparatory to
 His coming."—Id., page 422.
    5. "The great day of the execution of God's Judgment
 seemed to have come. Ten thousand times ten thousand were
 assembled before a large throne, upon which was seated a
 Person of majestic appearance. Several books were before
 Him,and upon the covers of each was written in letters of
 gold, which seemed like a burning flame of fire, 'Ledger of
 Heaven.' One of these books, containing the names of those
 who claim to believe the truth, was then opened. Immedi-
 ately I lost sight of the countless millions about the throne,
 and only those who were professedly children of the light and
 of the truth engaged my attention. As these persons were
 named, one by one, and their good deeds mentioned, their
 countenances would light up with a holy joy that was reflected
 in every direction. But this did not seem to rest upon my
 mind with the greatest force.
    "Another book was opened, wherein were recorded the
 sins of those who profess the truth. Under the general head-
 ing of selfishness came every other sin. There were also
 headings over every column; and underneath these, opposite
 each name, were recorded, in their respective columns, the
 lesser sins. Under covetousness came falsehood, theft, rob-
 bery, fraud, and avarice; under ambition came pride and
 extravagance; jealousy stood at the head of malice, envy, and
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
hatred; and intemperance headed a long list of fearful crimes,
such as lasciviousness, adultery, indulgence of animal pas-
sions, etc. As I beheld, I was filled with inexpressible anguish,
and exclaimed, Who can be saved? who will stand justified
before God? whose robes are spotless? who are faultless in
the sight of a pure and holy God?"—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 4, pages 384, 385.
    6. " 'A book of remembrance' was written before God, in
which are recorded the good deeds of 'them that feared the
Lord, and that thought upon His name.' Their words of faith,
their acts of love, are registered in heaven. . . . In the book
of God's remembrance every deed of righteousness is immor-
talized. There every temptation resisted, every evil overcome,
every word of tender pity expressed. is faithfully chronicled."

  16. What prophecy will then be fulfilled? Verse 54;
Isa. 25: 8, 9.
                         Notes
   1. That the soul is not immortal, or indestructible, is
proved by the statement in Ezek. 18: 4, 20, "The soul that
sinneth, it shall die," as also by our Saviour's declaration that
there is One who "is able to destroy both soul and body."
Matt. 10 : 28. In the Hebrew, and in Greek translation, of
Num. 6: 6, we find the term "dead soul."
    2. We are here told of the attributes of God, the charac-
teristics in which we differ from Him. God is eternal; He
always existed. We are not eternal, but finite; we came but
recently into existence. God is invisible, "whom no man hath
seen or can see." We are not invisible. God is omniscient
He knows all things. We know but very little. In the matter
of immortality there is just as striking a contrast. God is
immortal. It would be just as erroneous to suppose that we
naturally possess the attribute of immortality as to suppose
that we possess omnipotence, or omniscience, or any other
attribute of the Deity.
    3. It is well to note that life and immortality were brought
to light through the gospel. We receive life now by faith.
 (John 3: 36.) We receive the physical endowment of im-
mortality at the resurrection.
    There is a distinction to be made between eternal life and
immortality. He who receives Christ by faith thereby lays
hold upon "that eternal life, which was with the Father, and
was manifested unto us;" and so Jesus said, "He that be-
lieveth on Me hath everlasting life." John 6: 47. But that
24        SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

which is thus acquired by faith is retained only by faith.
After immortality has been put on at the second cording of
Christ, the eternity of being is fully assured. This was the
purpose in view in the gift of Christ to take upon Himself
humanity.

  13. When will Jesus call the righteous to life?

  14. If there were to be no resurrection of the dead,

  15. What did the apostle Paul set forth as the hope of
the Christian? Acts 24: 15, 21; 26 : 8.

                            Notes
    1. "If, as stated in Eccl. 9: 5, the dead know not anything,
then they have no knowledge of the lapse of time. 'Six thou-
sand years in the grave to a dead man is no more than a wink
of the eye to the living.' To them, consciousness, an essential
condition in measuring time, is gone; and it will seem to them
when they awake that absolutely no time has elapsed. And
herein lies a most comforting thought in the Bible doctrine of
the sleep of the dead, that in death there is no consciousness
of the passing of time. To those who sleep in Jesus, their
sleep, whether long or short, whether one year, one thousand
years, or six thousand years, will be just as if the moment of
sad parting were followed instantly by the glad reunion in
the presence of Jesus at His glorious appearing and the res-
urrection of the just.
    "It ought also to be a comforting thought to those whose
lives have been filled with anxiety and grief for deceased
loved ones who persisted in sin, to know that they are not
now suffering in torments, but, with all the rest of the dead,
are quietly sleeping in their graves. Job 3: 17.
    "Again, it would mar the felicity of one's enjoyment in
heaven could he look upon earth and see his friends and rela-
tives suffering from persecution, want, cold, or hunger, or
sorrowing for the dead. God's way is best,—that all sentient
life, animation, activity, thought, and consciousness should
cease at death, and that all should wait till the resurrection
for their future life and eternal reward. See Heb. 11: 39, 40."
—"Bible Readings," page 513.
    2. In sound sleep, one is wholly lost to consciousness; time
goes by unmeasured; and the mental functions which are
active during consciousness are suspended for the time being.
     "Many flocked to Bethany, some out of sympathy with
Jesus, and others from curiosity to see one who had been
 raised from the dead. Many expected to hear from Lazarus
 a wonderful account of scenes witnessed after death. They
 were surprised that he told them nothing. He had nothing
 of this kind to tell. Inspiration declares, 'The dead know not
26         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

anything. . . . Their love, and their hatred, and their envy
is now perished.' But Lazarus did have a wonderful testi-
mony to bear in regard to the work of Christ. He had been
raised from the dead for this purpose. With assurance and
power he declared that Jesus was the Son of God."—"The
Desire of Ages," pages 557, 558.
    3. The words sheol in the Old Testament and hales in the
New Testament are applied to the resting place of the dead.
"They denote, as their use proves, a place of silence, secrecy,
sleep, rest, darkness, corruption, and worms. They are names
for the common receptacle of the dead, both righteous and
wicked. The righteous dead are there; for at the resurrec-
tion, they raise the victorious shout, '0 death, where is thy
sting? 0 grave [Greek, hades], where is thy victory?' 1 Cor.
15: 55. And the wicked dead are there; for at the resurrec-
tion 10. damnation, it is said that death and hell (Greek,
hades) deliver them up. Rev. 20:13."—"Here and Here-
after," page 138.
    Jacob said he would go down with his gray hairs to sheol.
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram went down alive into sheol,
swallowed up by the earth.
    4. The dead are brought from the, same place from which
God brought our Lord Himself. "Now the God of peace, that
brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shep-
herd of the sheep," etc. Heb. 13: 20. So it is evident that
the dead are brought, not from heaven, but from the grave,
from which Jesus Himself was brought forth.
    5. "The truth of the resurrection has been forcibly illus-
trated by the following incident: In the city of Hanover,
Germany, is a grave known as 'the open grave.' It is that of
a woman, an infidel German princess, who died over one hun-
dred years ago, and who, on her deathbed, gave orders that
her grave should be covered with a great marble slab, weigh-
ing perhaps a ton, surmounting solid blocks of stone firmly
bound together with clasps of iron, with this inscription placed
on the lowermost stone of the tomb: 'This grave, purchased
for eternity, must never be opened.' But no human device
can thwart the plans of God, or hinder the working of life
from Him. It happened, providentially no doubt, that a birch
tree seed was buried with the princess. Soon it began to
sprout. Its tiny shoot, soft and pliable at first, found its way
up through the ponderous stones of the massive masonry.
Slowly and imperceptibly, but with irresistible power, it grew,
until at last it burst the bands of iron asunder, and opened
this never-to-be-opened grave, leaving not a single stone in
its original position. What a rebuke to infidelity! and what
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 27

a mute but striking promise that, erelong, in God's own time,
all graves shall be opened, and the sleeping ones awake from
their dusty beds!"—"Bible Readings," pages 515, 517.

Note 5.
  13. What glorious prophecy will then be fulfilled?
Rev. 5: 13; 2 Peter 3:13. Note 6.

                           Notes
    1. The Scriptures definitely inform us that there is a
termination to the existence of the wicked, and they reveal
what that end will be. , "For yet a very little while, and the
indignation shall cease, and Mine anger in their destruction."
Isa. 10: 25.
    2. How utterly hopeless is the condition of all who are
without Christ! "They shall be as though they had not been."
Thus clearly is set forth the final condition of all who refuse
to lay hold of life. Job says, "Or as an hidden untimely birth
I had not been; as infants which never saw light." Job 3: 16.
Such would never have an existence; and the future existence
of the impenitent is to be, like theirs, totally obliterated.
    "The wicked are to be utterly destroyed—consumed away
into smoke, brought to ashes. Having inseparably allied
themselves with sin, they have forfeited the right to life and
an immortal existence, and chosen the way, of death and
destruction. By their choice, they have proved themselves
worthless. For this reason, they are compared to chaff, briers,
thorns, etc. Their destruction will consequently be no real
loss. They will themselves have lost their opportunity to
obtain eternal life; but by the way in which they used their
probationary time, they proved themselves unworthy of it.
Their destruction will, in fact, be an act of love and mercy
on the part of God; for to perpetuate their lives would only
be to perpetuate sin, sorrow, suffering, and misery. Terrible,
therefore, as this judgment will be, there will, in consequence
of it, be nothing of value lost,—nothing lost worth saving.
The experiment of sin will be over, and God's original plan
of peopling the earth with a race of holy, happy beings will
be carried out. 2 Peter 3: 13."—"Bible Readings," page 522.
    3. The wicked dead will be raised at the second resurrec-
tion, at the end of the one thousand years of Rev. 20: 5. They
will surround the city of God, the new Jerusalem, the abode
of the saints. It is then that the fire of God descends, as on
Sodom and Gomorrah, and destroys them. It is then that this
earth will melt with fervent heat, and be prepared as the home
of the people of God.
    4. This expression "unquenchable fire" is applied in Matt.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   29
3: 12 to the fate of the wicked, as represented by the chaff.
Similar language is used in Mark 9: 43-48 and elsewhere.
It is to be noticed that the enduring quality is attributed to
the devouring element, and not to that which is cast into it.
The chaff would be quickly consumed by the unquenchable
fire. Jerusalem was threatened with a fire that should not
be quenched (Jer. 17: 27). An unquenchable fire does not
subside till it has burned up all that it is preying upon.
Sodom and Gomorrah were literally burned with that kind of
fire, and thus reduced to ashes. (Jude 7; 2 Peter 2: 6.) The
land of Idumea (Isa. 34: 9, 10) was to experience a fire that
would "not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof
shall go up forever;" yet that land, with all the rest of the
earth, shall be renewed, according to the promise of God.
2 Peter 3: 13. After deserved punishment has been visited
upon the ungodly, the forever expires, and the punished ones
cease to exist. "Forever and ever" is a term expressing more
emphasis than the term "forever."
    5. "They [the wicked] are likened to chaff, which is to be
burned entirely up (Matt. 3: 12), tares to be consumed (Matt.
13:40), withered branches to be burned (John 15:6), bad
fish cast away to corruption (Matt. 13: 47, 48), a house
thrown down to its foundations (Luke 6: 49), to the destruc-
tion of the old world by water (Luke 17: 27), to the destruc-
tion of the Sodomites by fire (verse 29; 2 Peter 2: 5, 6)."—
"Here and Hereafter," page 271.
    6. It is evident, from these scriptures, that God will have
a clean universe, in which there will be no rebellious beings
to oppose His will, there will be no room for a place of eternal
existence of demons or wicked men.

for whom they have ministered? Matt. 24: 31.

                           Notes
    1. "As those who have an understanding of Bible truth
try to seek out the men and women who are longing for light,
angels of God will attend them. And where angels go, none
need fear to move forward. As a result of the faithful efforts
of consecrated workers, many will be turned from idolatry to
the worship of the living God. Many will cease to pay hom-
age to man-made institutions, and will take their stand fear-
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   31
lessly on the side of God and His law."—"Prophets and
Kings," page 171.
   "Could our spiritual vision be quickened, we should see
souls bowed under oppression and burdened with grief, pressed
as a cart beneath sheaves, and ready to die in discouragement.
We should see angels flying quickly to the aid of these tempted
ones, forcing back the hosts of evil that encompass them, and
placing their feet on the sure foundation. The battles waging
between the two armies are as real as those fought by the
armies of this world, and on the issue of the spiritual conflict
eternal destinies depend."—Id., page 176.
    2. "All the heavenly angels are at the service of the
humble, believing people of God; and as the Lord's army of
workers here below sing their songs of praise, the choir above
join with them in ascribing praise to God and to His Son.
   "We need to understand better than we do the mission of
the angels. It would be well to remember that every true
child of God has the cooperation of heavenly beings. Invisible
armies of light and power 'attend the meek and lowly ones
who believe and claim the ,promises of God. Cherubim and
seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God's
right hand, 'all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for
them who shall be heirs of salvation.' "—"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 154.

14. What warning against this satanic delusion has
God given as? Note 5.
                             Notes
    1. Necromancy is defined to be "the art of revealing future
events by means of a pretended communication with the dead;
the art of magic; conjuration; enchantment."
    2. It is evident, from these texts, that the ancient Israel-
ites were seduced into the belief that they were having inter-
course with the dead when they were actually sacrificing to,
and having communication with, the devil.
    3. Saul died for not asking counsel of the Lord. It must
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  33
be that his counsel was from the opposite source of informa-
tion, the satanic; for if he had really been talking with Sam-
uel, it would have been necessary for the Lord to interpose
to permit the ancient seer to impart information to one who
was seeking assistance from an agency God had strictly for-
bidden. Saul was evidently communing with a demon trans-
formed into al; angel of light.
    4. Modern spiritualism, whose millions of adherents in-
clude even royal heads, began its demonstrations nearly three-
score and ten years ago, in opposition to the warning of the
third angel's message, which had then just begun its great
mission to prepare a people for the second coming of Christ.
    "To-day the mysteries of heathen worship are replaced by
the secret associations and seances, the obscurities and won-
ders, of spiritualistic mediums. The disclosures of these
mediums are eagerly received by thousands who refuse to
accept light from God's word or through His Spirit. Be-
lievers in spiritism may speak with scorn of the magicians of
old, but the great deceiver laughs in triumph as they yield to
his arts under a different form.
    "There are many who shrink with horror from the thought
of consulting spirit mediums, but who are attracted by more
pleasing forms of spiritism. Others are led astray by the
teachings of Christian Science, and by the mysticism of the-
osophy and other Oriental religions."—"Prophets and Kings,"
page 210.
     5. "The prince of darkness, who has so long bent the
powers of his master mind to the work of deception, skillfully
adapts his temptations to men of all classes and conditions.
To persons of culture and refinement he presents spiritualism
in its more refined and intellectual aspects, and thus succeeds
in drawing many into his snare. The wisdom which spiritual-
ism imparts is that described by the apostle James, which 'de-
scendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.' .
    "To the self-indulgent, the pleasure-loving, the sensual,
spiritualism presents itself under a less subtle disguise than
to the more refined and intellectual; in its grosser forms, they
 find that which is in harmony with their inclinations. Satan
 studies every indication of the frailty of human nature, he
marks the sins which each individual is inclined to commit,
 and then he takes care that opportunities shall not be want-
 ing to gratify the tendency to evil. He tempts men to excess
 in that which is in itself lawful, causing them, through in-
 temperance, to weaken physical, mental, and moral power... .
     "If there were no other evidence of the real character of
 spiritualism, it should be enough for the Christian that the
 spirits make no difference between righteousness and sin,

between the noblest and purest of the apostles of Christ and
the most corrupt of the servants of Satan. By representing
the basest of men as in heaven, and highly exalted there,
Satan says to the world: 'No matter how wicked you are; no
matter whether you believe or disbelieve God and the Bible.
Live as you please; heaven is your home.' The spiritualist
teachers virtually declare, 'Every one that doeth evil is good
in the sight of the Lord, and He delighteth in them; or,
Where is the God of judgment?' Saith the word of God,
`Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
darkness for light, and light for darkness.'"—"Great Con-
troversy," pages 553-557.

their claim to the possession of the gift of the spirit of
prophecy. Note 3.
   14. Yet what has the history and experience of this
people abundantly demonstrated? 2 Chron. 20: 20.
   15. What part have spiritual gifts in maintaining unity
and guarding the church from error? Eph. 4 : 11-15.

1 Cor. 13: 1-3.
                           Notes
   1. Without the Spirit, no truly effective witness can be
borne. We are to remember that only the Lord, by His Spirit,
can make our service effective. Christ is our example in the
Continuous confession, "I can of mine own self do nothing."
On the other hand, with the Spirit's witness, the feeblest en-
deavor or testimony may be used of God for the accomplish-
ment of great results.
   2. "Helps." This plain gift is nevertheless a precious
one. While no one, perhaps, has all the gifts, here is one
that all may well aspire 10. What a blessing in the church
are the "helpers," as one version puts it—always holding up
the hands of those leading out in any work, sharing the
36          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
burdens! The marginal reference, Num. 11: 17, is worth
looking up.
    "Governments." Weymouth's translation renders it "pow-
ers of organization." The word is derived from the verb
"to steer," as steering or guiding a boat. It is an invaluable
gift in church or conference work, as in all organized or
associate service.
    3. As the days of 1844 brought the beginning of the
Judgment hour, and the time for the rise of the remnant
church, keeping the commandments of God (Rev. 14: 6, 7, 12),
the Lord set in that church the gift of the spirit of prophecy.
All should be familiar with the work of Sister Ellen G. White,
in the exercise of that gift in connection with the cause of
God in our time. This gift has been a blessed and guiding
agency, under God, in the history of the advent movement.
All along, critics have assailed this gift,: even as the loyalty
of the church to the commandments of God has been assailed;
but the gift of the spirit of prophecy has borne the divine
credentials in the church. By its fruits it is known. The
more perilous the times become, the greater need of giring
heed to the instruction that has come through this gift in
the remnant church.
