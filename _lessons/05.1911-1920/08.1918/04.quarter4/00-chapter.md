   The Conflict of the Ages Series
                       BY MRS. E. G. WHITE

A. series of five intensely interesting volumes, dealing with the great
conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil, from the
inception of the rebellion in heaven to the time when "Bin and sinners
are no more." Each volume is complete in itself, in, so far as it deals
with its special period of time and its special subject. To read 046 vol-
ume creates the desire to complete the series.

PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS
    Tracing the great conflict between good and evil from its begin
    ning down through the centuries to the time of David's death,
    indicating God's infinite love for mankind by His dealings with
    the "holy men of old." We are shown why sin was permitted,
    why Satan was not destroyed, and why man was tested. Gives
    a thrilling description of man's temptation and fall, and rehearses
    the plan of redemption devised for his salvation. 793 pages.

PROPHETS AND KINGS
    Pointing out the great moral lessons to be learned from Israel's
    triumphs, defeats, backslidings, captivity, and reformation, show-
    ing God's mercy toward an obdurate people, and making these
    lessons practical helps to souls in times of testing. It abounds
    in great character studies, and above them all rises in glory
    supernal the coming King, the Lamb of God. 750 pages.

ACTS OF THE APOSTLES
    Gives a comparatively full history of the work of the early church
    and of the apostolic dispensation. It is a most inspiring and
    encouraging account of the church at work, and a very efficient
    help to the followers of Christ in every walk of life. 630 pages.

THE DESIRE OF AGES
    Step by step the life of our Saviour is traced, and made to touch
    our life, so that He becomes, in very truth, "our elder Brother."
    The wonderful manner in which divinity and humanity were com-
    bined; the way in which Christ, while dwelling in a human body,
    with only human strength, took hold of divine strength, and thus
    overcame sin,— these things are made clear and helpful on every
    page and in every sentence. 860 pages.

THE GREAT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN CHRIST
     AND SATAN
    Presents the history of the great conflict between Christianity and
    the powers of darkness, as illustrated in the lives of Christian
    martyrs and reformers on the one hand, and wicked men and per-
    secuting powers on the other. Beginning with our Lord's great
    prophecy, given while He was viewing Jerusalem from the Mount
    of Olives, this book outlines the history of the whole dispensation
    down to the time when "God's entire universe is clean, and the
    great controversy is forever ended." 700 pages.

   11. What message follows the first angel's message?
Rev. 14: 8.
   12. When, where, and how did ancient Babylon origi-
nate? What characteristics of Babylon are revealed
from the beginning? Gen. 10: 8-10; 11 : 1-9. Note 6.

ceive his mark? What characteristics do they manifest?
Rev. 14 : 12.
   19. What comforting message is given concerning
those who die in the Lord in this time of waiting?
Verse 13.
                          Notes
    1. Ex. 33: 19 and 34: 5-7 show that God's name signi-
fies His character. The image of God in man has been de-
faced by sin. The work of the gospel is to restore that
image. In the times of refreshing that shall come, the one
hundred and forty-four thousand will reflect the character
of God, having His holy law written in mind and heart.
This is what God has pledged Himself to do for those who
come into the new covenant relationship. He says, "I will put
My laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts."
Heb. 8 : 10.
    2. Inasmuch as not to angels, but to men, is committed
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   5
the work of preaching the gospel on earth, these angels
must symbolize a gospel movement carried forward by men;
though the fact is not to be overlooked that the angels are
unseen workers with the human agents in God's work. Heb.
1:14.
     3. The first angel's message was to proclaim "the ever-
lasting gospel"—the one gospel that has been from the be-
ginning in a setting adapted to the conditions which would
prevail when that message was due. The very words of the
message are given. The one who preaches the gospel under
the first angel's message must say, "The hour of His Judg-
ment is come." He must urge men to worship the Creator—
the One who made the heaven and the earth. Any message
not embracing these features is not the fullness of the gospel
for these last days.
     4. Creative power is the distinguishing attribute of Deity.
God only can create He desires men to remember His
mighty work of creation, that they may believe in His power
 to re-create them in Christ Jesus. To destroy faith in God
as the Creator is to undermine the very foundation of the
 Christian religion, which rests on God's ability and willing-
 ness to save. Creation is the demonstration of God's power.
 Calvary demonstrates His love. He can and He will save
 sinful men.
     5. "There are three phases of the Judgment mentioned
 in the Scriptures,—the Investigative' Judgment, preceding
 the second advent; the Judgment of the lost world and
 wicked angels by Christ and the saints during the one thou-
 sand years following the second advent; and the Executive
 Judgment, or punishment of the wicked at the close of this
 period. The Investigative Judgment takes place in heaven
 before Christ comes, in order to ascertain who are worthy
 to be raised in the first resurrection, at His coming, and who
 among the living are to be changed in the twinkling of an
 eye, at the sound of the last trump. It is necessary for this
 to take place before the second advent, as there will be no
 time for such a work between the coming of Christ and the
  raising of the righteous dead. The Executive Judgment on
  the wicked occurs after their cases have been examined by
  the saints during the thousand years. Rev. 20: 4, 5; 1 Cor.
  6: 1-3. The Investigative Judgment is that which is an-
  nounced to the world by the angel's message of Rev. 14: 6,
  7."—"Bible Readings," page 249.
      6. In building the tower of Babel (Greek, "Babylon"),
  the people of Babylon revealed their true spirit and charac-
  ter. The real leader was not Nimrod, but Satan, the arch-
  enemy of God and of His work in the earth.
      "God had directed men to disperse throughout the earth,
  to replenish and subdue it; but these Babel builders deter-
6           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
mined to keep their community united in one body, and to
found a monarchy that should eventually embrace the whole
earth. . . . The magnificent tower, reaching to the heavens,
was intended to stand as a monument of the power and wis-
dom of its builders, perpetuating their fame to the latest
generations. The dwellers on the plain of Shinar disbelieved
God's covenant that He would not again bring a flood upon
the earth. . . . One object before them in the erection of the
tower was to secure their own safety in case of another
deluge. . . . The whole undertaking was designed to exalt
still further the pride of its projectors, and to turn the minds
of future generations away from God, and lead them into
idolatry."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 119.
    Thus Babylon was founded in pride and self-exaltation,
in disbelief of God's promise, in disobedience to God's word,
and in an effort to obtain salvation by their own works.
Modern Babylon exhibits the same characteristics.
    7. "The great city which reigned over the kings of the
earth in John's time was Rome, and that city has given its
name to the church which is represented by the woman, the
Church of Rome, or the papacy."—"Bible Readings," page
255. "The Church of Rome is called Babylon, and its re-
ligion is a revival of the religion ,of ancient Babylon. She
claims a priesthood with exceptional .powers and privileges,
just as did ancient Babylon. . . . She claims universal
spiritual jurisdiction, and demands submission under pains
and penalties, just as ancient Babylon did. See Daniel 3.
She repudiates the fundamental gospel truth of justification
by faith, and boasts of works, just as ancient Babylon did.
See Dan. 4: 30."—Id., page 256. As ancient Babylon stood
for the great system of apostasy from the truth of God and
for the exaltation of human power to the place of God, so
the great apostasy from God's truth in modern times is
called Babylon, including not only the papal apostasy, but
all systems that drink in the papal principles.

   15. What then must have ended at that time? Ans.-
The day of probation-the day of salvation.
8          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  16. In what words is the close of probation announced?
Rev. 22: 10, 11.
                         Notes
    1. Both Isaiah and John drew their imagery from the
Eastern custom of separating the juice from the grapes by
tramping them out with the feet. Clusters of ripe grapes
are thrown into a large vat, and several men with bare feet
tread out the wine. The juice spatters the garments of the
workmen. This process of treading out the grapes is com-
mon in Bible lands to this day.
    2. God takes no pleasure in the death of any of the
creatures of His hand. And when even infinite mercy de-
mands that sin, and consequently sinners, come to an end,
the work of destruction will be even to God a strange act.
    3. Here songs become old and worn. There upon the sea
of glass, the one hundred forty-four thousand Al sing a
new and living song, which will never grow old. It will be
a song of experience. "These are they which came out of
great tribulation." They will have passed through the "time
of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation."
They will have stood without an intercessor while the judg-
ments of God have fallen upon the wicked. They alone who
have had the experience can sing the song. It is called the
song of Moses and the Lamb. Like Moses and Christ, the
one hundred forty-four thousand pass through trial and
tribulation triumphant; and with them, they can sing the
song of victory.
    4. When the third angel's message closes, the work for
sinners will be finished. Jesus is now carrying on His work
of intercession for guilty man. He offers His perfect life
for our life of failure, His blood to atone for our trans-
gressions. But this work must soon cease, and men must
stand without a mediator in the presence of a holy God.

  14. What occurred when the seventh angel poured out
his vial? Verse 17.
  15. What great physical disturbances took place?
Verses 18-21.
  16. How is that final hailstorm described? Verse 21.
                           Notes
   1. "When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary,
the unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship
the beast and his image and receive his mark, will be poured
out. The plagues upon Egypt when God was about to de-
liver Israel, were similar in character to'those more terrible
and extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world
just before the final deliverance of God's people.".—"The
Great Controversy," pages 627, 628.
    The word "noisome" means noxious, annoying or "very
disagreeable to the sense of smell." One thinks of the ter-
rible smell of putrid flesh which accompanies certain dis-
eased conditions. This plague is similar in character to the
sixth of the plagues of Egypt, when painful and loathsome
boils and tumors afflicted man and beast.
    2. "By condemning the people of God to death, they have
as truly incurred the guilt of their blood as if it had been
shed by their hands. In like manner Christ declared the
Jews of His time guilty of all the blood of holy men which
had been shed since the days of Abel; for they possessed the
same spirit, and were seeking to do the same work, with these
murderers of the prophets."—Id., page 628.
    3. Judgments are God's calls to repentance. When long-
suffering mercy is scorned, God may speak to the soul in
sterner tones. "He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: so that his
life abhorred bread, and his soul dainty meat. His flesh is
consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that
were not seen stick out. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the
grave, and his life to the destroyers. . . . Lo, all these
things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring back his
soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the
living." Job 33: 19-22, 29, 30.
    But when neither the revelation of mercy and love, nor
that of affliction and other judgments, has been able to bring
the sinner to a sense of his sin during the day of probation,
the case is hopeless. The seven last plagues reveal the
stubborn and rebellious character of the lost. Further ex-
hibitions of God's mercy would be unavailing, and their last
breath is spent in blaspheming the God who has exhausted
the resources of infinite love and wisdom to save them from
their sins.

   "These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the
earth would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the most
awful scourges that have ever been known to mortals. All
the judgments upon men, prior to the close of probation,
have been mingled with mercy. The pleading blood of Christ
has shielded the sinner from receiving the full measure of
his guilt; but in the final Judgment, wrath is poured out un-
mixed with mercy."—"The Great Controversy," pages 628,
629.

                           Notes
   1. "This scripture points forward to a time when the
announcement of the fall of Babylon, as made by the second
angel of Revelation 14, is to be repeated with the additional
mention of the corruptions which have been entering the
various organizations that constitute Babylon, since that mes-
sage was first given in the summer of 1844. A terrible con-
dition of the religious world is here described. With every
rejection of truth, the minds of the people will become darker,
their hearts more stubborn, until they are entrenched in an
infidel hardihood. . . . As the teachings of spiritualism are
accepted by the churches, the restraint imposed upon the
carnal heart is removed, and the profession of religion will
become a cloak to conceal the basest iniquity. A belief in
spiritual manifestations opens the door to seducing spirits,
and doctrines of devils, and thus the influence of evil angels
will be felt in the churches. . . . But God still has a people
in Babylon; and before the visitation of His judgments, these
faithful ones must be called out, that they 'partake not of
her sins, and receive not of her plagues.' Hence the move-
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
ment symbolized by the angel coming down from heaven,
lightening the earth with his glory, and crying mightily with
a strong voice, announcing the sins of Babylon. In connec-
tion with his message the call is heard, 'Come out of her, My
people.' These announcements, uniting with the third angel's
message, constitute the final warning to be given to the in-
habitants of the earth."---"The Great Controversy," pages
603, 604.
    "Revelation 18 points to the time when, as the result of
rejecting the threefold warning of Rev. 14: 6-12, the church
will have fully reached the condition foretold by the second
angel, and the people cf God still in Babylon will be called
upon to separate from her communion. This message is the
last that will ever be given to the world; and it will ac-
complish its work. When those that 'believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness,' shall be left to receive
strong delusion and to believe a lie, then the light of truth
will shine upon all whose hearts are open to receive it, and
all the children of the Lord that remain in Babylon will heed
the call, 'Come out of her, My people."'—Id., page 390.
    2. In Revelation 17, Babylon is said to be "that great
city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth." This was
true of the papacy during the Dark Ages. She literally sat
a queen, and nations and kings bowed at her feet. But when
the prophetic period of one thousand two hundred sixty years
ended, amid the events of the French Revolution, she received
a deadly wound, breaking her power over the nations. Rev.
13: 3. But the prophecy points to a restoration. The wound
received in the days of 1793-1798 is to be healed. And after
this, the world will again "wonder after the beast." The
world powers will again "give their power and strength unto
the beast." This will continue but a short time, and then will
come a reversal of the attitude of these powers. Verse 16.
The present-day signs point to a speedy fulfillment of these
prophecies relating to the restoration of the papacy's in-
fluence over the nations; then, after her triumph, must
quickly follow her downfall.

   14. In its widest sense, then, how much does mystic
Babylon embrace? Ans.—All apostate religions and re-
ligionists since the creation of the world.
                            Notes
   1. The description suggests the trappings of earthly roy-
alty. The papacy assumes the purple and scarlet of kingly
power. Its head is counted as wielding kingly authority, and
the cardinals rank as "princes" of the church. The gorgeous-
16         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
ness of the ritual, and the rich vestments, and the ornaments
of the service, are the pride of the Catholic Church.
    2. The only riches that will endure the fires of the last
days are the "riches of Christ." The only clothing that will
protect from God's wrath is the robe of Christ's righteous-
ness. The adornment that will shine the brightest is the
adornment of a "meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight
of God of great price."
    3. These descriptions throughout most graphically set
forth the commercialism that will permeate the whole of
Christendom in the last days. Men will sacrifice religious
principle and even honor for wealth. Nations will contend
for commercial supremacy, and the worldly church becomes
partaker in the world's spirit. But when the whole com-
mercial structure falls to the ground, and worldly expecta-
tions and ambitions are ruthlessly swept away by the last
judgments of God, there will be weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth.

10. Compare 1 Peter 1: 10, 11.
                            Notes
   1. These elders and "living creatures," as the Revised
Version renders it, are described in chapters 4 and 5 as as-
sociated with Christ in the heavenly temple. They have been
redeemed from among men (Rev. 5: 9), and represent the
redeemed church. When Christ ascended, after His resur-
rection, we are told that He took with Him a multitude of
those redeemed from captivity, first fruits of the final har-
vest of the saved. See Eph. 4: 8, margin, and Matt. 27:
52, 53.
    2. The heavenly beings and the saints rejoice in the right-
eous judgments of God, not because they have enmity toward
the unhappy subjects of those judgments, but because "God's
wisdom, His justice, His goodness, stand fully vindicated."
    3. On verse 8, Milligan, in "Expositor's Bible," comments
as follows: "Her raiment is worthy of our notice. It is fine
linen, bright and pure; and then it is immediately added,
18         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
For the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. These
acts are not the imputed righteousness of Christ, although
only in Christ are the acts performed. . . . No outward
righteousness alone, with which we might be clothed as a
garment, is a sufficient preparation for future blessedness.
An inward change is not less necessary, a personal and
spiritual meetness for the inheritance of the saints in light.
Christ must not only be on us as a robe, but in us as a life,
if we are to have the hope of glory. Let us not be afraid of
words like these. Rightly viewed, they in no way interfere
with our completeness in the Beloved alone, or with the fact
that not by works of righteousness that we have done, but
by grace, are we saved through faith, and that not of our-
selves; it is the gift of God. All our salvation is of Christ,
but the change upon us must be internal as well as external."

                           Notes
    1. "Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror. Not now a
`man of sorrows,' to drink the bitter cup of shame and woe,
He comes, victor in heaven and earth, to judge the living
and the dead. 'Faithful and true,' in righteousness He doth
judge and make war.' And 'the armies which were in heaven
follow Him.' With anthems of celestial melody, the holy
angels, a vast, unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way.
The firmament seems filled with radiant forms,—`ten thou-
sand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.' No
human pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is adequate
to conceive its splendor.
    "Before His presence, 'all faces are turned into paleness;'
upon the rejecters of God's mercy falls the terror of eternal
despair."—"The Great Controversy," page 641.
    2. " 'A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth;
for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, He will
plead with all flesh; He will give them that are wicked to the
sword.' For six thousand years the great controversy has
been in progress; the Son of God and His heavenly messen-
gers have been in conflict with the power of the evil one, to
warn, enlighten, and save the children of men. Now all have
made their decision; the wicked have fully united with Satan
in his warfare against God. The time has come for God to
vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. Now the
20         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
controversy is not alone with Satan, but with men. 'The
Lord hath a controversy with the nations;' He will give
them that are wicked to the sword.' "—Id., page 656.
    3. Many who make loud professions of loyalty to Jesus
are refusing real allegiance of heart to the King of heaven.
Those who cherish impure thoughts, or perform un-Christ-
like acts, or manifest an unchristian temper, are saying in
their hearts, "We will not have this Man to reign over us."
    4. Some have thought that "the false prophet" is Mo-
hammed, or the followers of the Arabian prophet; but Rev.
19: 20 shows that "the false prophet" is the same agency
which in chapter 13 deceives the people by his wonders, and
causes them to enforce the mark and worship of the beast.
This is none other than apostate Protestantism, under the
deceptions of spiritualism, working especially in the making
of the image, or likeness, to the papacy, and seeking to en-
force the mark of papal power.

   13. What occurs at the end of the thousand years?
Verse 7. What work does Satan immediately resume?
Verse 8. Note 3.

22          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

strained to acknowledge? Ans.—The justice of God.
Rom. 3: 4; Phil. 2: 10, 11. Note 4.
  18. What is the ultimate fate of Satan? Rev. 20: 10.
See Ezek. 28: 17-19.
                            Notes
     1. The term "bottomless pit" is an unfortunate trans-
 lation. The Revised Version reads "abyss." The "Stand-
 ard" dictionary gives as one definition of "abyss," "The great
 deep or primal chaos." In Gen. 1: 2, the "deep," or primal
 chaos, is described thus: "And the earth was without form,
 and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep." The
 Hebrew word here translated "deep" is defined to mean "the
 primeval abyss," in the Oxford Century Bible.
     The judgments which come upon the earth in the last
 days will reduce the orderly arrangement of things to chaos.
 The earth will be turned upside down; the mountains will
 be moved out of their places; the cities will be in ruins, the
 people slain. In looking forward to this scene of desolation,
 the prophet Jeremiah says, "I beheld the earth, and, lo, it
 was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had
 no light." Jer. 4: 23. This is the future chaos, or "bottom-
 less pit," in which Satan will be bound.
    2. Rev. 5: 10 is supposed - by some to conflict with the
view that the saints are with Christ in heaven during the
thousand years. This text does say that the saints will
reign on the earth; but it does not say that this reign is
during the thousand years. The Scriptures teach that after
the thousand years, after the earth is cleansed from sin and
sinners, in the "new earth," the saints "shall inherit the
earth." "The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell
therein forever." Ps. 37: 11, 22, 29.
    3. "Gog and Magog" are no doubt used here as symbols
to represent the wicked nations that enlist under Satan's
banner after the second resurrection. "In later apocalyptic
literature they are conventional symbols for the world
hostile to Israel, or the people of God."—Oxford Century
Bible.
    4. Even the wicked will finally acknowledge the justice of
God's sentence against them in the Judgment. They have
refused to submit to the government of heaven, have cast in
their fortunes with the archrebel, and have partaken of his
character. They would not be happy in heaven if they were
taken there. The purity of that holy place would be dis-
tasteful to them. They have chosen the way of death, and
God lets them have their choice. Paul speaks of a time when
"every knee shall bow," and "every tongue shall confess."
    "The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of
God, on the charge of high treason against the government
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  23

of heaven. They have none to plead their cause; they are
without excuse; and the sentence of eternal death is pro-
nounced against them.
   "It is now evident to all that the wages, of sin is not
noble independence and eternal life, but slavery, ruin, and
death. The wicked see what they have forfeited by their
life of rebellion. . . . All see that their exclusion from
heaven is just. By their lives they have declared, 'We will
not have this Jesus to reign over us.' . . .
   "Satan sees that his voluntary rebellion has unfitted him
for heaven. He has trained his powers to war against God;
the purity, peace, and harmony of heaven would be to him
supreme torture. His accusations against the mercy and
justice of God are now silenced. The reproach which he has
endeavored to cast upon Jehovah rests wholly upon himself.
And now Satan bows down, and confesses the justice of his
sentence."—"The Great Controversy," pages 668-670.

                          Notes •
    1. Contrasts between the new earth and the earth in its
present state are frequently drawn. The Bible furnishes
material for many comparisons. In this life, the wicked
rule and reign; there the righteous will dwell. 2 Peter 3: 13.
Here men toil, and pass off the stage of action, and others
eat the fruit of their effort; there "they shall build houses,
and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat
the fruit of them." Isa. 65: 21-25. Here one ravenous beast
feeds on the life of another; there "the wolf and the lamb
shall feed together." "Here we suffer grief and pain, here
we meet to part again;" but in that fair land, "there shall
be . . . neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be
any more pain." In this present world, three fourths of the
earth's surface is covered by a boundless desert of waters;
of the new earth state, it is written, "And there was no
more sea."
              "Oh, how unlike the present world,
                Will be the onh to come !
               Here pain and sorrow, care and fear,
                Attend where'er we roam.
              "In that bright world, no tears will flow,
                 Death ne'er can enter there;
               For all who gain that heavenly land
                 Will be as angels are."
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 25

    2. Dean Alford translates, "He shall be God with them."
The promise contained in the name "Emmanuel" is then
perfectly fulfilled. See Isa. 7: 14; Matt. 1: 23. "And the
name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord is there."
Ezek. 48: 35.
    God said to ancient Israel, "Let them make Me a sanctu-
ary; that I may dwell among them." Ex. 25: 8. But in the
new earth, God brings His tabernacle down and takes up
His abode with men.
    3. "Human language is inadequate to describe the re-
ward of the righteous. It will be known only to those who
behold it. No finite mind can comprehend the glory of the
Paradise of God."—"The Great Controversy," page 675.
    "The fire that consumes the wicked purifies the earth.
Every trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally burn-
ing hell will keep before the ransomed the fearful conse-
quences of sin. One reminder alone remains: Our Redeemer
will ever bear the marks of His crucifixion. Upon His
wounded head, upon His side, His hands and feet, are the
only traces of the cruel work that sin has wrought. . . .
God's original purpose in the creation of the earth is ful-
filled as it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed."—Id.,
page 674.

  13. Who only will gain an entrance to the heavenly
city? Verse 27, last clause.
                           Notes
     1. "The names of the twelve apostles in the foundations
of the city, show it to be a Christian and not a Jewish city;
while the names of the twelve tribes on the gates, show that
all the saved, from this dispensation as well as from the
former, are reckoned as belonging to some one of the twelve
tribes; for all must enter the city through some one of these
twelve gates. It is this fact which explains those instances
in which Christians are called Israel, and are addressed as
the twelve tribes."—"Daniel and the Revelation" on Rev.
21: 14.
    2. "Twelve thousand furlongs" would equal one thou-
sand five hundred miles. It has been generally supposed that
this is the whole circumference of the city; but some eminent
modern commentators believe that the language conveys the
idea that this is the measurement of one side only. If this
be correct, the area of the city would be two and one fourth
million square miles, or more than two thirds as large as the
United States. As one modern writer has expressed it, "The
dimensions of the city, like its shape and everything belong-
ing to it, are beyond the compass of our experience."
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   27

   3. "The measure of a man, that is, of the angel," meaning,
no doubt, that the measure used by the angel is the same as
that used by man.
   4. For a description of these precious stones, read "Daniel
and the Revelation" on Revelation 21.

9, last part.
                             Notes
    1. "The idea of a river in Paradise comes down from
the description of Eden (Gen. 2: 10). With this is combined
the symbolical use of `waters,' living waters,' for all bless-
ings flowing to man from the presence of God: Jer. 2: 13,
`They have forsaken Me the fountain of living waters;' Ezek.
47: 1-12, where the fullness of the divine presence in the
temple and the land is set forth under the figure of a stream
of healing waters; in Ps. 46: 4, the river is emphatically
presented as one of the features of the city of God."—Ox-
ford Century Bible.
    2. "In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called
a country. There the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to
fountains of living waters. The tree of life yields its fruit
every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the service of
the nations. There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal,
and beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the
paths prepared for the ransomed of the Lord. There the
wide-spreading plains swell into hills of beauty, and the
mountains of God rear their lofty summits. On those peace-
ful plains, beside those living streams, God's people, so long
pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home.' — 'The Great
Controversy," page 675.
    3. "In the city of God 'there shall be no night.' None
will need or desire repose. There will be no weariness in
doing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We
shall ever feel the freshness of the morning, and shall ever
be far from its close. 'And they need no candle, neither
light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.' The
light of the ,sun will be superseded by a radiance which is
not painfully dazzling, yet which immeasurably surpasses
the brightness of our noontide. The glory of God and the
Lamb floods the holy city with unfading light. The re-
deemed walk in the sunless glory of perpetual day."—Ict.,

30         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  13. With what benediction does the writer of the book
close his.message? Verse 21.

                             Notes
    1. "Seal not . . . for the time is at hand." John had
been bidden to write of "the things which are, and the things
which shall be hereafter." Rev. 1: 19. Some of the things
of which he writes took place in his day, some immediately
after. So he could say, "The time is at hand"—that is, the
time when these prophecies begin to be fulfilled. Other parts
would not be fulfilled for a long time; those are "the things
which shall be hereafter."
    But again, the close of one's probation is always "at
hand." The on  gest life of man is but a vapor that passes
away, a short time to prepare for eternity. At death, every
man's probation ends. God wants us to think always of the
end of probation and the coming of Christ as "at hand."
    2. Sometimes we hear carping critics say of some one
who seems to be at fault, "If A goes to heaven, I don't want
to go there." Well, perhaps A will not go to heaven; but it
is quite certain that such unforgiving accusers will not enter
the pearly gates; and if A is shut out, they will be outside
with him, and with "dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers,
and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and
maketh a lie." Better be inside with A, if the Lord in His
mercy sees fit to take him in, than be outside with the other
company.
    On the word "sorcerer," the Century Bible notes say,
"Here the word is probably used literally of the whole class
of necromancers and dealers in magic, who flourished so
greatly at this period."
    3. "In this final assurance of the Lord, 'I come quickly,'
the book of Revelation finds its keynote again, and so sinks
to rest, with the acquiescent reply of faith, Amen: come,
Lord Jesus. It opened with the promise to reveal the things
which must quickly come to pass, and it goes out on the as-
surance that He for whose coming these things are the pre-
lude, is nigh at hand, even at the door."—Century Bible.
