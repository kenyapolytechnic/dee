plan was announced to him through the prophet? Isa.

                          Notes
    1. "Had Israel been true to her trust, all the nations of
earth would have shared in her blessings. But the hearts of
those to whom had been entrusted a knowledge of saving
truth, were untouched by the needs of those around them. As
God's purpose was lost sight of, the heathen came to be looked
upon as beyond the pale of His mercy. The light of truth was
withheld, and darkness prevailed. The nations were over-
spread with a veil of ignorance; the love of God was little
known • error and superstition flourished."—"The Story of
Prophets and Kings" pages 370, 371.
    2. "Their king, Merodach-baladan, upon learning that this
miracle had been wrought as a sign to the king of Judah
that the God of heaven had granted him a new lease of life,
sent ambassadors to Hezekiah to congratulate him on his re-
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    5
covcry, and to learn, if possible, more of the God who was able
to perform so great a wonder.
    "The visit of these messengers from the ruler of a far-
away land gave Hezekiah an opportunity to extol the living
God. How easy it would have been for him to tell them of
God, the upholder of all created things, through whose favor
his own life had been spared when all other hope had fled!
What momentous transformations might have taken place
had these seekers after truth from the plains of Chaldea been
led to acknowledge the supreme sovereignty of the living
God!"—Id., page 344.
    "The story of Hezekiah's failure to prove true to his trust
at the time of the visit of the ambassadors, is fraught with
an important lesson for all. Far more than we do, we need
to speak of the precious chapters in our experience, of the
mercy and loving-kipdness of God, of the matchless depths
of the Saviour's love. When mind and heart are filled with
the love of God, it will not be difficult to impart that which
enters into the spiritual life. Great thoughts, noble aspira-
tions, clear, perceptions of truth, unselfish purposes, yearnings
for piety and holiness, will find expression in words that re-
veal the character of the heart treasure."—Id., pages 347, 348.
    3. "Among the children of Israel who were carried captive
to Babylon at the beginning of the seventy years' -captivity
were Christian patriots, men who were as true as steel to
principle, who would not be corrupted by selfishness, but who
would honor God at the loss of all things. In the land of their
captivity these men were to carry out God's purpose by giving
to heathen nations the blessings that come through a knowl-
edge of Jehovah. They were to be His representatives. Never
were they to compromise with idolaters; their faith and their
name as worshipers of the living God they were to bear as a
high honor. And this they did. In prosperity and adversity
they honored God; and God honored them."—Id., page 479.
     4. "At the very outset of their career there came to them
a decisive test of character. It was provided that they should
eat of the food and drink of the wine that came from the
king's table. In this the king thought to give them an ex-
pression of his favor and of his solicitude for their welfare.
 But a portion having been offered to idols, the food from the
king's table was consecrated to idolatry; and one partaking
 of it would be regarded as offering homage to the gods of
 Babylon. In such homage, loyalty to Jehovah forbade Daniel
and his companions to join. Even a mere pretense of eating
the food or drinking the wine would be a denial of their faith.
 To do this would be to array themselves with heathenism, and
 to dishonor the principles of the law of God."—Id., page 481.
     5. "As the Lord cooperated with Daniel and his fellows,
 so He will cooperate with all who strive to do His will. And
6          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
by the impartation of His Spirit He will strengthen every
true purpose, every noble resolution. Those who walk in the
path of obedience will encounter many hindrances. Strong,
subtle influences may bind them to the world; but the Lord
is able to render futile every agency that works for the de-
feat of His chosen ones; in His strength they may overcome
every temptation, conquer every difficulty."—Id., page 487.
    6. "Soon after Daniel and his companions entered the
service of the king of Babylon, events occurred that revealed
to an idolatrous nation the power and faithfulness of the God
of Israel. Nebuchadnezzar had a remarkable dream, by which
`his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.' But
although the king's mind was deeply impressed, he found it
impossible, when he awoke, to recall the particulars."—Id.,
page 491.

           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7
truth was vividly set forth by means of the king's dream
interpreted by Daniel? Dan. 2: 44.

bolized by the golden head? Verses 37, 38.     •

                            Notes
    1. "In His law God has made known the principles that un-
derlie all true prosperity, both of nations and of individuals.
To the Israelites Moses declared of this law: 'This is your wis-
dom and your understanding.' It is not a -vain thing for .
you; because it is your life.' The blessings thus assured to
Israel are, on the same conditions and in the same degree,
assured to every nation and to every individual under the
broad heavens."—"The Story of Prophets and Kings," pages
500, 501.
    2. When Israel lost her connection with God and became
a nation of common sinners, her special privileges were taken
from her. This involved the suspension of God's material,
visible kingdom that had been committed to her special care.
    3. The fact that worshipers of Jehovah were captives in
Babylon, and that the vessels of God's house had been placed
in the temple of the Babylonish gods, was boastfully cited
by the victors as evidence that their religion and customs were
superior to the religion and customs of the Hebrews. Yet
through the very humiliations that Israel's departure from
Him had invited, God gave Babylon evidence of His suprem-
acy, of the holiness of His requirements, and of the sure
results of obedience. And this testimony He gave, as alone
it could be given, through those who were loyal to Him.
    4. "In the history of nations the student of God's word
8          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
may behold the literal fulfillment of divine prophecy. Baby-
lon, shattered and broken at last, passed away because in
prosperity its rulers had regarded themselves as independent
of God, and had ascribed the glory of their kingdom to human
achievement. The Medo-Persian realm was visited by the
wrath of Heaven because in it God's law had been trampled
underfoot. The fear of the Lord had found no place in the
hearts of the vast majority of the people. Wickedness, blas-
phemy, and corruption prevailed. The kingdoms that followed
were even more base and corrupt; and these sank lower and
still lower in the scale of moral worth."—Id., pages 501, 502.
     5. Persia was subdued in 331 B. C. by the Grecian or
Macedonian empire. This, after its time of testing, was fol-
lowed by Rome, the mighty empire of the Caesars, which, be-
tween the years 168 and 30 B. C., absorbed all the parts of
the Macedonian empire. Rome, in turn, was divided by the
barbarians into lesser kingdoms, out of which have grown the
nations of western Europe.
    6. Many have been the attempts, and various the means
employed, to unite the fragments of the old Roman empire
into a permanent whole. Charles V is said to have attempted
it; but he failed. Napoleon had an idea of building an empire
of military might to cover all western Europe. He ended his
days on the island of St. Helena, his purposes brought to
naught. The prophecy had said that the kingdom would be
divided, and that the parts would never cleave together again.

liever? Verse 28. Note 3.
   15. What invitation will the King extend to those who

25: 31-34.
                           Notes
    1. "In' taking upon Himself humanity, our Saviour unites
His interests with those of the fallen sons and daughters of
Adam, while through His divinity He grasps the throne of
God. And thus Christ is the medium of communication of
men with God, and of God with men."—"The Desire of Ages,"
page 143.
    2. "The union of the divine and human in the person of
Christ is 'the mystery of godliness,' or the mystery of the
kingdom of God.' In the case of the seed which is sown in the
field, this same principle is illustrated by the union of the
reproducing power with the material form. As the seed is
thus capable of multiplying itself, so Christ reproduces His
own character in believers, by making them partakers of the
divine nature. At His coming He bestows upon the subjects
of the kingdom the gift of immortality (1 Cor. 15: 51-53),
and so the kingdom will stand forever. It is quite likely that
10         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the wise men of Babylon did not understand about the in-
carnation of God in the flesh in the coming Messiah; but in
their statement that the dwelling of the gods was not with
flesh, they announced the fundamental error of Babylon, both
ancient and modern, and really denied the vital principle of
Christianity. This was the essential secret, or mystery, of
the kingdom of God, which needed to be known in Babylon,
and which is still to be proclaimed throughout the world."—
"Bible Readings," page 211.
    3. "Only as they were united with Christ, could the disci-
ples hope to have the accompanying power of the Holy Spirit,
and the cooperation of angels of heaven. With the help of
these divine agencies, they would present before the world a
united front, and would be victorious in the conflict they were
compelled to wage unceasingly against the powers of dark-
ness. As they should continue to labor unitedly, heavenly
messengers would go before them, opening the 'way; hearts
would be prepared for the reception of truth, and many would
be won to Christ."—"Acts of the Apostles," pages 90, 91.

deep impression upon the ruler's mind. The wise men of his
realm, taking advantage of this and of his return to idolatry,
proposed that he make an image similar to the one seen in his
dream, and set it up where all might behold the head of gold,
which had been interpreted as representing his kingdom."—
"The Story of Prophets and Kings," page 504.
    2. "Pleased with the flattering suggestion, he determined
to carry it out, and to go even farther. Instead of reproduc-
ing the image as he had seen it, he would excel the original.
His image should not deteriorate in value from the head to
the feet, but should be entirely of gold,—symbolic throughout
of Babylon as an eternal, indestructible, all-powerful king-
dom, which should break in pieces all other kingdoms, and
stand forever."—Id., page 504.
    3. "The appointed day came, and a vast concourse from
all 'people, nations, and languages,' assembled on the plain
of Dura. In harmony with the king's command, when the
sound of music was heard, the whole company 'fell down and
worshiped the golden image.' On that eventful day the pow-
ers of darkness seemed to be gaining a signal triumph; the
worship of the golden image bade fair to become connected
12          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 permanently with the established forms of idolatry recognized
 as the state religion of the land. Satan hoped thereby to de-
 feat God's purpose of making the presence of captive Israel
 in Babylon a means of blessing to all the nations of heathen-
 dom."—Id., page 506.
      4. "How did that heathen king know what the Son of God
 was like? The Hebrew captives filling positions of trust in
 Babylon had in life and character represented before him the
 truth. When asked for a reason of their faith, they had given
 it without hesitation. Plainly and simply they had presented
 the principles of righteousness, thus teaching those around
 them of the God whom they worshiped. They had told of
 Christ, the Redeemer to come; and in the form of the fourth
 in the midst of the fire the king recognized the Son of God."—
 Id., page 509.
     5. "It was right for the king to make public confession,
 and to seek to exalt the God of heaven above all other gods;
 but in endeavoring to force his subjects to make a similar
confession of faith and to show similar reverence, Nebuchad-
 nezzar was exceeding his right as a temporal sovereign. He
had no more right, either civil or moral, to threaten men with
 death for not worshiping God, than he had to make the de-
cree consigning to the flames all who refused to worship the
golden image. God never compels the obedience of man. He
leaves all free to choose whom they will serve."—Id., pages
510, 511.
     6. "The three Hebrews declared to the whole nation of
Babylon their faith in Him whom they worshiped. They re-
lied on God. In the hour of their trial they remembered the
promise, 'When thou passest through the waters, I will be
with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be
burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.' And in a
marvelous manner their faith in the living Word had been
honored in the sight of all. The tidings of their wonderful
deliverance were carried to many countries by the representa-
tives of the different nations that had been invited by Nebu-
chadnezzar to the dedication. Through the faithfulness of His
children, God was glorified in all the earth."—Id., page 512.
     "As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so
in the closing period of earth's history the Lord will work
mightily in behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the
right. He who walked with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery
furnace will be with His followers wherever they are. His
abiding presence will comfort and sustain. In the midst of
the time of trouble,—trouble such as has not been since there
was a nation,—His chosen ones will stand unmoved. ` Satan
with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God's
saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect them, and
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                          13
in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a 'God of gods,'
able to save to the uttermost those who have put their trust
in Him."—Id., page 513.

  13. What tribute did the once proud king then render
to Jehovah? Verse 37. Note 3.
                          Notes
   1. "Once more in this idolatrous nation, testimony was
to be borne to the fact that only those who love and fear God
can understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. The
king in his perplexity sent for his servant Daniel, a man es-
teemed for his integrity and constancy and for his unrivaled
wisdom."—"The Story of Prophets and Kings," page 516.
    2. "For a time the impression of the warning and the
counsel of the prophet was strong upon Nebuchadnezzar; but
the heart that is not transformed by the grace of God soon
loses the impressions of the Holy Spirit. Self-indulgence and
ambition had not yet been eradicated from the king's heart,
and later on these traits reappeared. Notwithstanding the
instruction so graciously given him, and the warnings of
vast experience, Nebuchadnezzar again allowed himself to be
controlled by a spirit of jealousy against the kingdoms that
were to follow. His rule, which heretofore had been to a great
degree just and merciful. became oppressive. Hardening his
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   15

heart, he used his God-given talents for self-glorification, ex-
alting himself above the God who had 'given him life and
power."—Id., page 519.
    3. "The once proud monarch had become a humble child
of God; the tyrannical, overbearing ruler, a wise and com-
passionate king. He who had defied and blasphemed the God
of heaven, now acknowledged the power of the Most High,
and earnestly sought to promote the fear of Jehovah and the
happiness of his subjects. Under the rebuke of Him who is
King of kings and Lord of lords, Nebuchadnezzar had learned
at last the lesson which all rulers need to learn,—that true
greatness consists in true goodness. He acknowledged Je-
hovah as the living God, saying, 'I Nebuchadnezzar praise
and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are
truth, and His ways judgment: and those that walk in pride
He is able to abase.' "—Id., page 521.

                             Notes
    1. "Through the folly and weakness of Belshazzar, the
grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, proud Babylon was soon to
fall. Admitted in his youth to a share in kingly authority,
Belshazzar gloried in his power, and lifted up his heart
against the God of heaven. Many had been his opportunities
to know the divine will, and to understand his responsibility
of rendering obedience there10. He had known of his grand-
father's banishment, by the decree of God, from the society of
men; and he was familiar with Nebuchadnezzar's conversion
and miraculous restoration., But Belshazzar allowed the love
of pleasure and self-glorification to efface the lessons that he
should never have forgotten. He wasted the opportunities
graciously granted him, and neglected to use the means within
his reach for becoming more fully acquainted with truth.
That which Nebuchadnezzar had finally gained at the cost
of untold suffering and humiliation, Belshazzar passed by
with indifference."—"The Story of Prophets and Kings,"
pages 522, 523.
    2. "It was, not long before reverses came. Babylon was
besieged by Cyrus, nephew of Darius the Mede, and com-
manding general of the combined armies of the Medes and
 Persians. But within the seemingly impregnable fortress,
with its massive walls and its gates of brass, protected by the
 river Euphrates, and stocked with provision in abundance,
 the voluptuous monarch felt safe, and passed his time in
 mirth and revelry."—Id., page. 523.                   •
    3. "Every nation that has come upon the stage of action
 has been permitted to occupy its place on the earth, that the
 fact might be determined whether it would fulfill the pur-
 poses of the Watcher and the Holy One. Prophecy has traced
 the rise and progress of the world's great empires,—Babylon,
 Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each of these, as with
 the nations of less power, history has repeated itself. Each
 has had its period of test; each has failed, its glory faded, its
 power departed."—Id., page 535.
     4. "The history of nations speaks to us to-day. To every
 nation and to every individual God has assigned a place in
 His great plan. To-day men and nations are being tested by
 the plummet in the hand of Him who makes no mistake. All
 are by their own choice deciding their destiny, and God is
  overruling all for the accomplishment of His purposes."—Id..

                            Notes
     1. "The enemies of Daniel left the presence of Darius, re-
 joicing over the snare now securely laid for the servant of
 Jehovah. In the conspiracy thus formed, Satan had played
 an important part. The prophet was high in command in the
 kingdom, and evil angels feared that his influence would
 weaken their control over its rulers. It was these satanic
 agencies who had stirred the princes to envy and jealousy;
 it was they who had inspired the plan for Daniel's destruc-
 tion; and the princes, yielding themselves as instruments of
 evil, carried it into effect."—"The Story of Prophets and
 Kings," page 540.
     2. "Although he knew full well the consequences of his
 fidelity to God, his spirit faltered not. Before those who
•were plotting his ruin, he would not allow it even to appear
 that his connection with Heaven was severed. In all cases
 where the king had a right to command, Daniel would obey;
 but neither the king nor his decree could make him swerve
 from allegiance to the King of kings.
     "Thus the prophet boldly yet quietly and humbly declared
 that no earthly power has a right to interpose between the
 soul and God. Surrounded by idolaters, he was a faithful
 witness to this truth. His dauntless adherence to right was
 a bright light in the moral darkness of that heathen court.
 Daniel stands before the world to-day a worthy example of
 Christian fearlessness and fidelity."—Id., page 542.
     3. "From the story of Daniel's deliverance, we may learn
 that in seasons of trial and gloom, God's children should be
 just what they were when their prospects were bright with
 hope and their surroundings all that they could desire. Daniel
 in the lions' den was the same Daniel who stood before the
 king as chief among the ministers of state and as a prophet
 of the Most High. A man whose heart is stayed upon God
 will be the same in the hour of his greatest trial as he is in
 prosperity, when the light and favor of God and of man beam
 upon him. Faith reaches to the unseen, and grasps eternal
 realities."—Id., page 545.
     4. "The experience of Daniel as a statesman in the king-
 doms of Babylon and Medo-Persia reveals the truth that a
 business man is not necessarily a designing, policy man, but
 that he may be a man instructed by God at every step. Daniel,
 the prime minister of the greatest of earthly kingdoms, was
 at •the same time a prophet of God, receiving the light of
 heavenly inspiration. A man of like passions as ourselves,
 the pen of inspiration describes him as without fault. His
 business transactions, when subjected to the closest Mutiny
 of his enemies, were found to be without one flaw. He was
 an example of what every business man may become when
20         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
his heart is converted and consecrated, and when his motives
are right in the sight of God.
    "Strict compliance with the requirements of Heaven
brings temporal as well as spiritual blessings. Unwavering
in his allegiance to God, unyielding in his mastery of self,
Daniel, by his noble dignity and unswerving integrity, while
yet a young man, won the 'favor and tender love' of the
heathen officer in whose charge he had been placed. The
same characteristics marked his after life."—/d, page 546.
    5. "A careful study of the working out of God's purpose
in the history, of nations and in the revelation of things to
come, will help us to estimate at their true value things seen
and things unseen, and to learn what is the true aim of life.
Thus, viewing the things of time in the light of eternity, we
may, like Daniel and his fellows, live for that which is true
and noble and enduring. And learning in this life the prin-'
ciples of the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, that blessed
kingdom which is to endure forever and ever, we may be
prepared at His coming to enter with Him into its posses-
sion."—Id., page 548.

   14. Who is proclaimed as the deliverer? Isa. 44:
24, 28.
  15. What dominion did the Lord promise Cyrus be-
cause of his kindness to Israel? Isa. 45: 1, 2, 13, 14.
                         Notes
   1. Living the natural life that proceeded from the carnal
heart had led to sinful, self-centered lives, which were so
useless for God's purpose of winning the world to Himself
through Israel, that He had to give the experience of the
captivity to correct them. Hosea 10: 12. In the prophecy
of deliverance, the call to live lives of trust and surrender,
"live by faith," which makes man a sharer of the unselfish,
loving nature of God, was emphasized. Note the application
of this same passage to the remnant church. Heb. 10: 37-39.
    2. The power which keeps from sin in Babylon and en-
ables one to continue fit to leave Babylon, is in the word of
God. "Wherefore having obtained help of God," said Paul,
"I continue." And there is Daniel, the Paul of the Old
Testament; "this Daniel continued." He was a youth when
taken to Babylon; and as far as we know, he never went
away from Babylon until he died, at about ninety; and that
youth, that young man, was in Babylon, with all that that
meant, and we are told that Daniel "continued." We know
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
that it was not merely physical, but a moral and spiritual
continuance; he stayed where he was spiritually as well as
otherwise.

                               Notes
    1. "Honored by men with the responsibilities of state and
with the secrets of kingdoms bearing universal sway, Daniel
was honored by God as His ambassador, and was given
many revelations of the mysteries of ages to come. His
wonderful prophecies, as recorded by him in chapters seven
to twelve of the book bearing his name, were not fully under-
stood even by the prophet himself; but before his life labors
closed, he was given the blessed assurance that 'at the end
of the days'—in the closing period of this world's history—he
would again be permitted to stand in his lot and place."—
"The Story of Prophets and Kings," page 547.
    2. The fourfold division of human history in this vision
is the same as in chapter 2. Babylon, the lion (606-538),
was succeeded by Medo-Persia, the bear (538-331). The next
empire, the Greco-Macedonian, the leopard (331-168), had in
turn each of its four divisions, or heads, subdued by the
terrible beast, the Roman power (168 B. C. to 476 A. n.). This
ruled all civilization until the barbarians from the north came
and divided its dominion among themselves.
    3. The barbarians who established themselves on the
ruins of the Roman empire, are the ten horns. They became
the ruling factors in Europe. Several of the leading nations
in the Old World at the present time trace their origin back
to those times.
    4. The Roman papacy meets the specifications, because it
arose among the nations of Europe; it has held, and claims,
temporal power; it claims oversight over all Christians,—
"eyes like a man"; it has spoken "great words against the
Most High" in claiming power to forgive sins and in assum-
ing titles belonging only to God; it has sought to change
God's law, and has certainly persecuted His saints.

  14. Describe the heavenly rejoicing over her downfall.
Rev. 19 : 1-6.
                            Note
    "A time in prophecy being the same as a year (see Dan.
11: 13, margin, and R. V.), three and one half times would
be three and a half years, or forty-two months, or twelve
hundred and sixty days, since the calendar year of three
hundred sixty days, or twelve months of thirty days each, is
used in prophetic chronology. As each day represents a year,
the period, the end of which was to mark the limit of the time
of the supremacy of the little horn, the papacy, over the
saints, times, and the law, -would therefore be twelve hundred
and sixty years.
    "The decree of the emperor Justinian, issued in A. D. 533,
recognized the pope as 'head of all the holy churches.'
 (Justinian's code, book 1, title 1, Baronius's Annals, A. D.
533.) The overwhelming defeat of the Ostrogoths in the
siege of Rome, five years later, A. D. 538, was a deathblow to
the independence of the Arian power then ruling Italy, and
was therefore a notable date in the development of papal
supremacy. With the period 533-538, then, commences the
twelve hundred and sixty years of this prophecy, which
would extend to the period 1793-1798.: The year 1793 was
the year of the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution, and
the year when the Roman Catholic religion was set aside in
France, and the worship of reason was established in its
stead. As a direct result of the revolt against papal author-
ity in the French Revolution, the French army, under
Berthier, entered Rome, and the pope was taken prisoner.
February 10, 1798, dying in exile at Valence, France, the fol-
lowing year."—"Bible Readings," edition of 1916, page 223.

                            Notes
    1. "The interpretation already given to this vision shows
plainly that the power represented by the little horn is the
successor of Medo-Persia and Grecia. In the vision of the
seventh chapter of Daniel, which is closely related to this
vision, the fourth beast represented the fourth kingdom, or
Rome, in its entirety, special attention, however, being given
to the 'little horn' phase of its history. As shown by the
work attributed to it, this little horn, which arose among the
ten kingdoms into which Rome was divided, was to be a
religio-political power, which was to change the times and
law of God, and persecute the people of God. , In the vision
of the eighth chapter, the ecclesiastical features of this
fourth world power are especially noticed and emphasized,
and hence the only symbol there used to represent it is the
`little horn' which waxed 'exceeding great.' . . . The little
horn of the eighth chapter represents Rome, both pagan and
papal, in its ecclesiastical aspect, with its union of paganism,
and later of apostate Christianity, with the secular power;
with its antichristian persecutions of the saints of God; with
its perversion of the priesthood of Christ; and with its as-
sertion of both temporal and spiritual power over all the
world. It is evident . . . that the emphasis is to be placed
upon the fulfillment of the prophecy in the work of papal
Rome. A careful comparison of Dan. 7: 21, 25, with Dan. 8:
10-12, R. V., and 2 Thess. 2: 3, 4, will amply justify this
conclusion."—"Bible Readings," edition of 1916, page 227.
    2. "The Scriptural ordinance of the Lord's Supper had
been supplanted by the idolatrous sacrifice of the mass.
Papal priests pretended, by their senseless mummery, to con-
vert the simple bread and wine into the actual 'body and
blood of Christ.' With blasphemous presumption, they openly
claimed the power of creating God, the Creator of all things.
 Christians were required, on pain of death, to avow their
faith in this horrible, Heaven-insulting heresy. Multitudes
 who refused were given to the flames. . . . In their secret
 councils, Satan and his angels controlled the minds of evil
 men, while unseen in the midst stood an angel of God, taking
28         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
the fearful record of their iniquitous decrees, and writing
the history of deeds too horrible to appear to human eyes.
`Babylon the great' was 'drunken with the blood of the
saints.' The mangled forms of millions of martyrs cried to
God for vengeance upon that apostate power."—"Great Con-
troversy," pages 59, 60.
    3. "The accession of the Roman Church to power marked
the beginning of the Dark Ages. As her power increased,
the darkness deepened. Faith was transferred from Christ,
the true foundation, to the pope of Rome. Instead of trust-
ing in the Son of God for forgiveness of sins and for eternal
salvation, the people looked to the pope, and to the priests
and prelates to whom he delegated authority. They were
taught that the pope was their earthly mediator, and that
none could approach God except through him; and further,
that he stood in the place of God to them, and was therefore
to be implicitly obeyed. . . . Thus the minds of the people
were turned away from God to fallible, erring, and cruel men,
nay, more, to the prince of darkness himself, who exercised
his power through them. Sin was disguised in a garb of
sanctity."—Id., page 55.
    4. In Dan. 7: 26, the papal power is said to be broken by
the sitting of the Judgment; and the same result would follow
the cleansing of the sanctuary. Therefore these two must be
different expressions for the same work, since the same re-
sults follow from each.
   5. " 'The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there
was seen in His temple the ark of His testament.' The ark
of God's testament is in the holy of holies, the second apart-
ment of the sanctuary. . . . Those who by faith followed their
great High Priest, as He entered upon His ministry in the
most holy place, beheld the ark of His testament. As they had
studied the subject of the sanctuary, they had come to under-
stand the Saviour's change of ministration, and they saw
that He was now officiating before the ark of God, pleading
His blood in behalf of sinners."—Id., page 433.

30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                            Notes
    1. "Still burdened in behalf of Israel, Daniel studied anew
the prophecies of Jeremiah. They were very plain,—so plain
that he understood by these testimonies recorded in books the
number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to
Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years
in the desolations of Jerusalem.'
    "With faith founded on the sure word of prophecy, Daniel
pleaded with the Lord for the speedy fulfillment of these
promises. He pleaded for the honor of God to be preserved.
In his petition he identified himself fully with those who had
fallen short of the divine purpose, confessing their sins as his
own."—"The Story of Prophets and Kings," pages 554, 555.
    2. The word rendered "determined" means also "cut off."
The period of seventy weeks, or 490 years, could be cut off
only from the longer period of 2,300 years, the part of the
vision which the angel had not before explained.
    3. The seventh year of Artaxerxes, when the command-
ment went forth, was B. C. 457. "This date of the seventh
year—so important to ascertain—is fixed by the combined
record of sacred and profane history with uncommon ac-
curacy." One important witness is the canon of Ptolemy,
giving the years of the reigns of the kings of ancient empires
from the days of Assyria to his own time, in the days of Rome.
    4. "The seventy weeks, or 490 years, especially allotted
to the Jews, ended, as we have seen, in A. D. 34. At that time,
through the action of the Jewish Sanhedrin, the nation sealed
its rejection of the gospel, by the martyrdom of Stephen and
the persecution of the followers of Christ. Then the message
of salvation, no longer restricted to the chosen people, was
given to the world. The disciples, forced by persecution to
flee from Jerusalem, 'went everywhere preaching the Word.'
`Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them.' Peter, divinely guided, opened the gospel to the
centurion of Cwsarea, the God-fearing Cornelius; and the
ardent Paul, won to the faith of Christ, was commissioned to
carry the glad tidings 'far hence unto the gentiles.' "—"The
Great Controversy," page 328.
    5. "The seventy weeks, or 490 years, were to pertain espe-
cially to the Jews. At the expiration of this period, the nation
sealed its rejection of Christ by the persecution of His disci-
ples, and the apostles turned to the gentiles, A. D. 34. The
first 490 years of the 2,300 having then ended, 1,810 years
would remain. From A. D. 34, 1,810 years extend to 1844.
`Then,' said the angel, 'shall the sanctuary be cleansed.' All
the preceding specifications of the prophecy had been un-
questionably fulfilled at the time appointed."—Id., page 410.
    6. "Says the prophet: 'Who may abide the day of His
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   31
coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth? for He is
like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and He shall sit as
a refiner and purifier of silver: and He shall purify the sons
of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may
offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.' Those who
are living upon the earth when the intercession of Christ
shall cease in the sanctuary above, are to stand in the sight
of a holy God without a mediator. Their robes must be spot-
less, their characters must be purified from sin by the blood
of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own dili-
gent effort, they must be conquerors in the battle with evil.
While the Investigative Judgment is going forward in heaven,
while the sins of penitent believers are being removed from
the sanctuary, there is to be a special work of purification,
of putting away of sin, among God's people upon earth."—
Id., page 425.

addition to what was represented by the little horn of

work be restored to its rightful importance?
   12. Why did righteous Daniel confess sin? What bless-
ing came as a result? When does the time period of
