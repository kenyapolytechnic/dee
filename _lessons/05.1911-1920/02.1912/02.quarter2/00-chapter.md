Topical Studies on the Message
                   Second Quarter, 1912
  • INTRODUCTORY NOTE.— The lessons for this quarter are a con-
tinuation of the topical studies begun the first quarter of the
year. Although the subjects are familiar, our faith will be
strengthened, and our hearts refreshed, as we study again God's
word for the evidences of our faith. We should be ready at all
times to give "a reason of the hope" that is in us. These lessons
should be helpful in grounding our faith a little more firmly in
the blessed truths of the third angel's message. That this may
be realized, let diligent study be given each topic.

were they warned against disobedience ? Gen. 2 : 16,
17. Note 1.

   4. What was the result of disobeying God and eat-
ing the forbidden fruit? Gen. 3 : 17-19. Note 2.

4          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  ' 6. To whom only is ascribed inherent immortality?
1 Tim. 1: 17 ; 6 : 16. Compare .Job 4 : 17. NOte 3.
               ETERNAL LIFE THE GIFT OF GOD
     7. How is eternal life obtained? Rom. 6 : 23 ; 5 : 19.
     8. How is this gift received ? 1 John 5 : 11, 12 ; John
3 : 36.
     9. Through what glorious event has man hope of a
resurrection from the dead? 1 Cor. 15 : 20-23.
    10. When will immortality be bestowed upon the
believer? How quickly will the change from mortality

    11. How is this change described ? Verse 53.

    13. What among other things are God's people • ex-
horted to seek ? Rom. 2 : 7. What does this prove ?
           IMMORTALITY ONLY THROUGH CHRIST
    14. How only can eternal life be obtained by sin-

    15. What blessing is promised to those who accept
Christ ? John 4 : 13, 14 ; 6 : 53, 54. Note 4.
                               Notes
   1. If they had been created immortal, it is certain the Lord
would not have said, "In. the day that thou eatest thereof thou
shalt surely die."
    2. It should be observed that God is now addressing the same
man, or "living soul," mentioned in Gen. 2:7. He says of him,
"For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
   3. The original word here rendered "immortal" occurs in
six other instances in the New Testament, each time being ren-
dered "incorruptible," or its equivalent. Greenfield's Greek Lexi-
con defines this word: " Incorruptible, immortal, imperishable,
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5
undying, enduring." The word is found in the following texts:
1 Tim. 1:17; Rom. 1:23; 1 Cor. 9:25; 15:52; 1 Peter 1:4, 23;
3:4.
    4. The hope that man by some merit of his own, through an
inherent principle of life, will in some manner reach the immortal
state, and live forever, is shattered by these words of the Son of
God: "Ye shall . . . die in your sins." This is the exact op-
posite of that original falsehood Satan told in Eden, and has since
restated in a thousand false religions, "Ye shall not surely die."
Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism, Theosophy, Christian Science,
and Spiritualism all have for their tap-root the dogma of human
immortality. Were it not for this fetish of human immortality,
not one of these baneful and false religions would ever hive
been possible.

6          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                      CHRIST'S DEATH
    8. What testimony is borne concerning the death of
Christ ? 1 Cor. 15 : 3; Is'a. 53 : 5, 8; John 19 : 28-30.
    9. What deep significance is attached to His death ?
Isa. 53 : 12.
    10. From what was Jesus exempt? Ps. 16 : 10;
Acts 2 : 30, 31.
    11. What blessed hope for us was involved in Jesus'
coming forth from the tomb ? 1 Cor. 15 : 20-23.
    12. When Jesus arose from the tomb what did He
bring with Him? Rev. 1 : 17, 18.
    13. What was brought to light through the gospel?,
2 Tim. 1: 9, 10. Note 1.
    14. What hope therefore lightens the darkness of
the tomb ? 1 Thess. 4 : 13, 14.

cended to heaven ? Acts 2 : 29, 34.
    16. To what time did folloWers of the Lord look
forward to meet their loved ones fallen in death? John
11 : 23, 24.
    17. How did Isaiah speak of this same time? Isa.
26:19.
    18. When did Paul expect to receive his reward ?
Who besides him would receive their reward at the same
time? 2 Tim. 4 : 6-8.
    19. Whose voice alone can awaken the dead? John
5 : 28, 29; 1 Thess. 4: 16-18. Note 2.
                             Notes
  1. There is a distinction to be made between eternal life and
immortality. He who receives Christ by faith thdreby lays hold
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     7
upon "that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was
manifested unto us," and so Jesus said, "He that believeth on
Me hath everlasting, life" (John 6:47) ; but that which is thus
acquired by faith is retained only by faith. After immortality
has been put on at the second coming of Christ, the eternity of
being is fully assured. This was the purpose in view in the gift
of Christ to take upon Himself humanity.
    2. "Wherefore comfort one another with these words." That
our loved ones are not troubled by the harrowing scenes of this
life; that they are unconscious of what is transpiring about us,
like one asleep; that to them, if saved, the next moment will be
the greeting of their Saviour, never more to be separated from
Him,— to believe thus, as the Scriptures so plainly teach, is not
a comfortless, cheerless hope.



              LESSON III — The Judgment
                   APRIL 20, 1912
   LESSON HELPS : "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 312-319;
Sabbath School Worker.

    4. When the judgment begins, what are opened?
From what are the dead judged? Rev. 20 : 12.

8           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the subjects of Christ's kingdom are determined, what
announcement is made ? Rev. 22 : 11.
    8. What then takes place ? Rev. 22:12; 1 Thess.
4 : 16, 17.
    9. How long will the saints reign with Christ in

Rev. 20 : 4 ; 1 Cor. 6: 2, 3.
    10. Who executes the decisions reached during the
thousand years ? John 5 : 26, 27.
    11. What acknowledgment will finally be made by
all whose lives have passed in review before God? Isa.
45 : 23 ; Phil. 2 : 9-11. Note 4.
    12. By what is every life tested in the investigative
judgment? Eccl. 12 : 13, 14; Rom. 2 : 12, 16. Note 5.
                                Notes
    1. That the judgment was still future in Paul's time is evident
in that when he stood before Felix he reasoned of "righteousness,
temperance, and judgment to come." Acts 24:25. But notwith-
standing this appointed "day," or time, for judgment, then future,
Paul so spoke of its solemn scenes as to cause the wicked, time-
serving Roman governor before whom he spoke, to tremble. This
being true, how we should sense the importance of the time in
which we now live,— it being that very time, or "day," to which
Paul alluded.
    2. It will be noticed that when the time comes for this message
to go to the world proclaiming the judgment, the announcement
is, The hour of His judgment is come." This investigative
judgment is the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary, which was
typified by the day of atonement in the yearly round of the earthly
sanctuary. This "hour" of God's judgment, by a very sure line
of prophecy, is shown to have begun in 1844. At this time Christ
passed from the holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary into
the most holy, and "the judgment was set, and the books were
opened." See Dan. 9:24-27. Thus the time for the judgment to
begin is made clear. For nearly threescore years and ten this
solemn review of men's lives has been going on by the Judge of
all the earth, who, the psalmist declares, "shall judge the world in
righteousness." Ps. 9:7, 8.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        9

    -3: The "book of life" doubtless contains the names of those
stvhp ,by faith have laid hold of eternal life. But it is possible for
 a.-,name once entered to be blotted out. Ex. 32:33. It is the
 most desirable of all things that our names be written and re-
 tained in this book. Luke 10:20; Rev. 3:5.
     4. Before their destruction the scenes in Christ's life and
 death will be vividly portrayed before the wicked.'
     "The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God,
 on the charge of high treason against the government of heaven.
 They have none to plead their cause; they are without excuse;
 and the sentence of eternal death is pronounced against them.
     ''It is now evident to all that the wages of sin is not noble
 independence and eternal life, but slavery, ruin, and death. The
 wicked see what they have forfeited by their life of rebellion.
 The far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory was despised
 when offered them; but how desirable it now appears. 'All this,'
 cries the lost soul, 'I might have had; but I chose to put these
  things far from me. 0, strange infatuation! I have exchanged
  peace, happiness, and honor, for wretchedness, infamy, and de-
 spair.' All see that their exclusion from heaven is just. By
  their lives they have declared, `We will not have this Jesus to
  reign over us.' "—"Great Controversy," page 668.
      5. The work of judgment which began 'in 1844, must continue
  until the cases of all are decided, both of the living and the dead;
  hence it will extend to the close of human probation. That men
  may be prepared to stand in the judgment, the message commands
  them to fear God, and give glory to Han," and worship Him
  that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
  waters.' The result of an acceptance of these messages is given
  in the words, 'Here are they that keep the commandments of
   God, and the faith of Jesus.' In order to be prepared for the
   judgment, it is necessary that men should keep the law of Cod.
   That law will be the standard of character in the judgment."
   — Id., page 436.

15 : 26; Rev. 20 : 14. Note 5.
                              Notes
    1. All the dead would remain in their graves forever were it
not that Christ died and rose again. For if He be not risen,
then there can be no resurrection of the dead. But the blessed
truth that there shall be a resurrection, because Jesus actually
died and rose again (Rev. 1:18), brings life within reach of
every lost son and daughter of Adam, and makes the plan of
eternal life through Him forever sure. John 14:19; Acts 2:24.
    2. "Amid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning; and
the roar of thunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the
sleeping saints. He looks upon the graves of the righteous, then
raising His hands to heaven He cries, Awake, awake, awake, ye
that sleep in the dust, and arise!' Throughout the length and
breadth of the earth, the dead shall hear that voice; and they
that hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with the tread
 of the exceeding great army 'of every nation, kindred, tongue, and
 people. From the prison-house of death they come, clothed with
 immortal glory, crying, 0 death, where is thy sting'? 0 grave,
 where is thy victory'!" "—"Great Controversy," page 644.
     3. "All come forth from their graves the same in stature as
 when they entered the tomb. Adam, who stands among the risen
 throng, is of lofty height and majestic form, in stature but little
 below the Son of God. He presents a marked contrast to the
 people of later generations; in this one respect is shown the great
 degeneracy of the race. But all arise with the freshness and
12          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

vigor of eternal youth.. . . All blemishes and deformities are
left in the grave. Restored to the tree of life in the long-lost
Eden, the redeemed will 'grow up' to the full stature of the race
in its primeval glory."— Id., pages 644, 645.
    4. "Then Jesus and all the retinue of holy angels, and all
the redeemed saints, left the city. The angels surrounded their
Commander, and escorted Him on His way, and the train of re-
deemed saints followed. Then, in terrible, fearful majesty, Jesus
called forth the wicked dead; and they came up with the same
feeble, sickly bodies that went into the grave. What a spectacle!
What a scene! At the first resurrection all came forth in immortal
bloom; but at the second the marks of the curse are visible on all."
    "As they come forth from their graves, they resume the cur-
rent of their thoughts where it ceased in death." " Then I saw
that Satan again commenced his work. He passed around among
his subjects and made the weak and feeble strong, and told them
that he and his angels were powerful. He pointed to the countless
millions who had been raised." "Then he looks over the vast
army, and tells them that the company in the city is small and
feeble, and that they can go up and take it, and cast out its
inhabitants, and possess its riches and glory themselves. Satan
succeeds in deceiving them, and all immediately begin to prepare
themselves for battle."—"Early Writings," old edition, part 3,
pages 151-153; new edition, pages 292, 293.
    5. What a glorious triumph it will be when death shall for-
ever be destroyed! Satan and his host of evil angels also perish
in the same lake of fire. Matt. 25:41. This is the second death,
from which there is no resurrection. It is from this that the
saved have been redeemed by the death of the precious Son of
God. Then begins the glorious reign of the saints with Christ,
in the newly-created earth, untainted by the curse of sin, the
home of the redeemed throughout eternity. Glorious inheritance!

                            Questions
     1. Whom did John see and hear about God's throne

in heaven ? What is said of the number of the angels?

    2. By whom were the angels brought into existence?
Col. 1 : 16. Note 1.

1 : 14 ; Ps. 103 : 20, 21.

31. Note 3.
                             Notes
    1. Angels are created beings. The. Son of God being the One
by whom the Father spoke all things into existence (John 1:1-3),
it is evident that the Son Himself existed prior to the highest
order of heavenly angels. Col. 1:15, 17. It is reasonable that
angels, as well as man, should worship the Son who was associated

with the Father in their creation. This they do, by the command
of the Father. Heb. 1:6.
    2. "I have seen the tender love that God has for His people,
and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints with their
wings spread about them. Each saint had an attending angel. If
the saints wept through discouragement, or were in danger, the
angels that ever attended them would fly quickly upward to carry
the tidings, and the angels in the city would cease to sing. Then
Jesus would commission another angel to descend to encourage,
watch over, and try to keep them from going out of the narrow
path; but if they did not take heed to the watchful care of these
angels, and would not be comforted by them, but continued to go
astray, the angels would look sad and weep. They would bear the
tidings upward, and all the angels in the city would weep."—

 page 39.
    3. "Angels 'gather together the elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other.' Little children are borne
by holy angels to their mothers' arms. Friends long separated
by death are united, nevermore to part, and with songs of glad-
ness ascend together to the city of God."—"Great Controversy,"

                               Notes
     1. Spiritualism.—" The belief that the spirits of the dead in
various ways communicate with and manifest their presence to
men, usually through the agency of a person called a medium."
— Standard Dictionary.
    ''The deification of the dead has held a prominent place in
nearly every system of heathenism, as has also the supposed com-
munion with the dead. The gods were believed to communicate
their will to men, and also, when consulted, to give them counsel.
Of this character were the famous oracles of Greece and Rome.
    "The belief in communion with the dead is still held, even in
professedly Christian lands. • Under the name of Spiritualism,
the practise of communicating with beings claiming to be the=
spirits of the departed, has become wide-spread. It is calculated
to take bold of the sympathies of those who have laid their loved
ones in the grave. Spiritual beings sometimes appear to persons
in the form of their deceased friends, and relate incidents con-
nected with their lives, and perform acts which they performed
while living. In this way they lead men to believe that their
dead friends are angels, hovering over them, and communicating
with them. Those who thus assume to be the spirits of the de-
parted, are regarded with a certain idolatry, and with many their
word has greater weight than the word of God."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," pages 684, 685.
    2. Having been created perfect in wisdom and beauty, when
the evil thought entered Lucifer's heart to be like God (Isa.
14:12-14), to be worshiped, his great wisdom was perverted to
work ruin. This is further proved by his being able to deceive
a host of the angels in heaven itself into the belief that his cause
was just and right.
    "Leaving his place in the immediate presence of God, Lucifer
went forth to diffuse the spirit of discontent among the angels.
. . . Since their natures were holy, he urged that the angels
should obey the dictates of their own will. He sought to ,create
sympathy for himself, by representing that God had dealt un-
justly with him in bestowing supreme honor upon Christ. He
claimed that in aspiring to greater power and honor he was not
aiming at self-exaltation, but was seeking to secure liberty for
all the inhabitants of heaven, that by this means they might
attain to a higher state of existence."—"Great Controversy,"
page 495.
    The angels were deceived upon the point of supposing that Lu-
cifer aimed to attain for them a "higher state of existence." And
it was upon this same point Eve was lured into disobedience and
sin. "Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil," was Satan's
word to her in Eden. And thousands through modern Spiritualism
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     17
are deceived into believing the highest law they are to know is
the desire of their own hearts,— Christ, God's laws, and the Bible
being set aside as standing in the way of man's highest develop-
ment.                                                              •
    3. "Satan has power to bring before us the appearance of
forms purporting to be our relatives or friends who sleep in
Jesus. It will be made to appear as if these friends were actually
present; the words they uttered while here, with which we were
familiar, will be spoken, and the same tone of voice that they had
while living, will fall upon the ear. . . . The people of God must
be prepared to withstand these spirits with the Bible truth that
the dead know not anything, and that they who thus appear are
the spirits of devils."—"Early Writings," old edition, part 3,
 page 124; new edition, page 262.
    4. Not always do the greatest deceptions come by way of op-
position, but frequently by assumed sympathy. Clothed in angel
robes, with subdued tones and apparent interest for the tempted
and tried one, the tempter approaches with his allurements. Thus
he approached Jesus in the wilderness. Souls are thus thrown off
 their guard, and Satan can the more surely fasten them in his
deception.
     5. "Satan and his angels suffered long. Satan bore not only
 the weight and punishment of his own sins, but also of the sins
 of the redeemed host, which had been placed upon him; and he
 must also suffer for the ruin of souls which he had caused."
 "Said the angel, 'Satan is the root, his children are the branches.
 They are now consumed root and branch. They have died an
 everlasting death. They are never to have a resurrection, and
 God will have a clean universe.' "—"Early Writings," old edi-
 tion, part 3, page 154; new edition, pages 294, 295.

           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      19

Matt. 11: 28-30.
                              Notes
    1. "Education, culture, the exercise of, the will, human effort,
all have their proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They
may produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they can
not change the heart; they can' not purify the springs of life.
There must be a power working from within, a new life from
above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That
power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties
of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—"Steps to
Christ," chapter "The Sinner's Need of Christ."
     2. "None are so vile, none have fallen so low, as to be beyond
the working of this power. In all Who will submit themselves to
the Holy Spirit a new principle of life is to be implanted; the
lost image of God is to be restored in humanity.
     "But man can not transform himself by the exercise of his
will. He possesses no power by which this change can be effected.
The leaven — something wholly from without — must be put into
the meal before the desired change can be wrought in it. So the
grace of God must be received by the sinner before he can be
 fitted for the kingdom of glory. All the culture and education
which the world can give, will fail of making a degraded child
 of sin a child of heaven. The renewing energy must come from
 God. The change can be made only by the Holy Spirit. All
 who would be saved, high or low, rich or poor, must submit to
 the working of this power."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages
96, 97.
     3. "They agreed in spirit and motive, while they differed in
 the form of excuse. They had accepted the invitation when re-
 mote, when it did not call upon them to take any action or give
 up any pleasure, but refused it when a decision must be made;
  just as men now want to go to heaven, and enter the pearly gates,
 and be saints and martyrs even; yet when the test time comes they
 are unwilling to accept the conditions, to do the deeds, to take up
  the cross, which are the necessary conditions."—Peloubet's Notes.
      4. "As the sinner, drawn by the power of Christ, approaches
  the uplifted cross, and prostrates himself before it, there is a
  new creation. A new heart is given him. He 'becomes a new
  creature in Christ Jesus. Holiness finds that it has nothing more
  to require. God Himself is 'the justifier of him which believeth in
  Jesus.' And whom He justified, them He also glorified.' Great
  as is the shame and degradation through sin, even greater will be
  the honor and exaltation through redeeming love. To human
20         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
beings striving for conformity to the divine image there is im-
parted an outlay of heaven's treasure, an excellency of power,
that will place them higher than even the angels who have never
 fallen."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 163.

   13. What power is it the privilege of the baptized

                              Notes
    1. "Among the multitudes that had gathered about him at
the Jordan, John bad heard dark tales of crime, and had met
souls bowed down with the burden of myriad sins; but never had
he come in contact with a human being from whom there breathed
an influence so divine. All this was in harmony with what had
been revealed to John regarding the Messiah. Yet he shrank
from granting the request of Jesus. How could he, a sinner,
baptize the Sinless One? And why should He who needed no
repentance submit to a rite that was a confession of guilt to be
washed away?
    "As Jesus asked for baptism, John drew back, exclaiming,
  I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?'
With firm yet gentle authority, Jesus answered, 'Suffer it to be
so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.' And
John, yielding, led the Saviour down into the Jordan, and buried
Him beneath the water."—"Desire of Ages," pages 110, 111.
     2. Genuine faith in Christ as the Saviour from sin precedes
baptism. Baptism follows as an outward expression of the faith
already in the heart.
     3. When death overtakes an individual, burial follows. It
would be a very sad thing to be buried alive. Likewise when the
 old man, the world's affections and lusts, is crucified, then burial
 into _the watery grave with Jesus should take place. Ananias
 said to Paul, who for three days had fasted and prayed and con-
 fessed his sins to God, "Why tarriest thou? arise, and be bap-
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

tized." It was time now for him to be buried; for he had re-
nounced his past sinful life. When we have turned away from
sin and the old man is dead, we should then be buried in the
watery grave. It is a sad thing for the church, and the indi-
vidual as well, to bury the "old man" alive.
    4. Jesus did not leave two memorials for one event. If, there-
fore, baptism commemorates His resurrection, it is evident that
there is no need for the setting apart of the first day of the week
to commemorate His resurrection, the day upon which He rose
from the grave.
    5. The Bible presents one baptism. Paul says, "We are buried
with Him by baptism into death." Rom. 6:4. When anything
is buried it is covered up, put out of sight. The dead are buried
beneath the ground, covered up and so hidden from view. Like-
wise to follow Jesus into death, into the grave by baptism, the
candidate must be buried beneath the water, hidden from view,
or there can be no significance whatever to the ordinance
    6. "Those who have put on Christ by baptism, by this act
showing their separation from the world, and that they have
covenanted to walk in newness of life, should not set up idols
in their hearts. Those who have once rejoiced in the evidence of
sins forgiven, who have tasted a Saviour 's love, and who then
persist in uniting with the foes of Christ, rejecting the perfect
righteousness that Jesus offers them, and choosing the ways
that He has condemned, will be more severely judged than the
heathen who have never had the light, and have never known God
or His law. Those who refuse to follow the light which God has
given them, choosing the amusements, vanities, and follies of the
world, and refusing to conform their conduct to the just and holy
requirements of God's law, are guilty of the most aggravating
sins in the sight of God."—"Testimonies for the Ciwurch," vol-
ume 3, pages 365, 366.
    7. "Do you ask, 'How am I to abide in Christi"— In the
same way as you received Him at first. 'As ye have therefore
received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him.' The just
shall live by faith.' You gave yourself to God, to be His wholly,
to serve and obey Him, and you took Christ as your Saviour.
You could not yourself atone for your sins or change your heart;
but having given yourself to God, you believed that He, for
Christ's sake, did all this for you. By faith you became Christ's,
and by faith you are to grow up in Him,— by giving and taking.
You are to give all,— your heart, your will, your service,— give
yourself to Him to obey all His requirements; and you must take
all,— Christ, the fulness of all blessing, to abide in your heart,
to be your strength, your righteousness, your everlasting helper,
— to give you power to obey."—"Steps to Christ,' chapter
"Growing Up into Christ."

                               Notes
    1.-"In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect ex-
emplification of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God.
God does not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by
upholding all things, He is constantly ministering for others.
`He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.' This ideal of
ministry God has committed to His Son. Jesus was given to stand
at the head of humanity, that by His example He might teach
what it means to minister. His whole life was under a law of
service. He served all, ministered to all. Thus He lived the law
of God, and by His example showed how we are to obey it"—
"Desire of Ages," page 649.,
    2. While unselfish ministry originated with God, self-seeking
and self-exaltation originated with Satan. Unconsciously, the
disciples had imbibed this worldly spirit; they strove among them-
selves which should be accounted the greatest.
    "Many of their contentions for supremacy, much of their
dissatisfaction with Christ's methods, originated with Judas."
" That which ruled him was the hope of selfish benefit in' the
worldly kingdom which he expected Christ to establish."—Mrs.
1E. G. White, in "Education," pages 91, 92.
    3. It was more than the ordinance of feet-washing Jesus was
giving the church. By this memorial He bequeathed His own
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     25
spirit of loving ministry to His followers. This was His answer
for all time as to who should be the greatest.
    "For these disciples [Judas excepted] the mission of Christ
finally accomplished its purpose. Little by little His example
and His lessons of self-abnegation molded their characters. His
death destroyed their hope of worldly greatness. The fall of
Peter, the apostasy of Judas, their own failure in forsaking Christ
in His anguish and peril, swept away their self-sufficiency. They
saw their own weakness; they saw something of the greatness of
the work committed to them • they felt their need of their Master's
guidance at every step."— Id., pages 93, 94.
    4. "At the first feast He attended with His disciples [John
2:1-11], Jesus gave them the cup that symbolized His work for
their salvation. At the last supper He gave it again, in the in-
stitution of that sacred rite by which His death was to be shown
forth 'till He come.' "
    "The communion service points to Christ's second coming. It
was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the dis-
ciples." " The wine which Christ provided for the feast [at
Cana], and that which EIe•gave to the disciples as a symbol of
His own blood, was the pure juice of the grape."—"Desire of
Ages," pages 149, 659.               •
    The bread used in instituting the Lord's supper was Passover
bread. Of this feast God commanded, "Unleavened bread shall be
eaten seven days • and there shall no leavened bread be seen with
thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quar-
ters." Ex. 13:7. Leaven, or fermentation, represents sin. See
1 Cor. 5:7, 8.
    5. "So that whosoever may be eating the loaf or drinking the
cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be responsible for
the body and blood of the Lord."— laherham's Translation.
    If one -by faith discerns by these emblems his Lord dying on
 Calvary to atone for his sins, having confessed them, he is not
 eating and drinking "unworthily," or in an unbecoming or irrev-
 erent manner.
    "Looking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully com-
 prehend the magnitude and meaning of the sacrifice made by the
 Majesty of heaven. The plan of salvation is glorified before us,
 and the thought of Calvary awakens living and sacred emotions
 in our hearts. Praise to God and the Lamb will be in our hearts
 and on our lips; for pride and self-worship can not flourish in the
 soul that keeps fresh in memory the scenes of Calvpxy."—"Desire
 of Ages," page 661.
     6. Jesus longs to have His people with Him. John 17:24.
 Spanning the interval between this last supper with the disciples

about His table in heaven, Jesus covenants not to partake of the
fruit of the vine. To Him, also, it would seem the emblem is
very sacred, in that through it a most solemn covenant relation
is sustained between the redeemed and their Redeemer. Precious
Saviour! Upon His heart constantly He bears His tempted, strug-
gling children.


                 LESSON X — Temperance
                         JUNE    8, 1912
     LESSON HELP:   Sabbath School Worker.
    GENERAL NOTE.- In the consideration of the topic of temper-
ance as a Sabbath-school lesson, it is not the design to go into de-
tails as to what articles of food constitute a proper diet. Prin-
ciples are presented for individual help. Much will be lost, there-
fore, by those who participate in discussion of what should con-
stitute articles of diet. Quotations as notes have been taken from
"Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene," a book written by
Mrs. E. G. White, and published in 1890, because it was thought
that but few of our brethren and sisters possessed •a copy of this
excellent book: Those who do have it can use it much with profit
as a help in the study of this lesson. In -this book, page 57, are
found these words: "There is real common sense in health re-
form. People can not all eat the same things. Some articles of
food that are wholesome and palatable to one person, may be
hurtful to another. . . . So it is impossible to make an unvary-
ing rule by which to regulate every one's dietetic habits."
                            Q uestions

28          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                                Notes
    1. This is a most comprehensive text. To be temperate in all
things includes more than reforms in a few articles of food. The
American Revised Version instead of the word "temperate" has the
word "self-control." The same rendering is given also in Acts
24:25; Gal. 5:23; 2 Peter 1:6; Titus 1:8. This expresses the
true idea of temperance. It is to be self-restrained, continent in
all things. True temperance includes the entire life. Some may
be temperate or Self-controlled in one or two particulars, yet very
intemperate or self-gratifying in other directions. To be tem-
perate in "all things," includes temperance in eating and drink-
ing, in labor, both mental and physical, in recreation,— in fact
in everything which goes to make up the life.
    2. "Those who are advocating a reform in diet should, by
the provision they make for their own table, present the ad-
vantages of hygiene in the best light. They should so exem-
plify its principles as to commend it to the judgment of candid
minds.
    "There is a large class who will reject any reform movement,
however reasonable, if it lays a restriction upon the appetite.
They consult taste, instead of reason and the laws of health.
By this class, all who leave the beaten track of custom and advo-
cate reform will be opposed, and accounted radical, let them pursue
ever so consistent a course.
    "But no one should permit opposition or ridicule to turn him
from the work of reform, or cause him to lightly regard it. He
who is imbued with the spirit which . actuated Daniel, will not be
narrow or conceited, but he will be firm and decided in standing
for the right. In all his associations, whether with his brethren
or with others, he will not swerve from principle, while at the
same time he will not fail to manifest a noble, Christlike patience.
When those who advocate hygienic reform carry the matter to ex-
tremes, people are not to blame if they become disgusted. Too
often our religious faith is thus brought into disrepute, and in
many cases those who witness such exhibitions of inconsistency can
never afterward be brought to think that there is anything good
in the reform. Those extremists do more harm in a few months
than they can undo in a lifetime. They are engaged in a work
which Satan loves to see go on.
    " Two classes have been presented. before me: first, those who
are not living up to the light which God has given them; sec-
ondly, those who are too rigid in carrying out their one-sided ideas
of reform, and enforcing them on others. When they take a posi-
tion, they stand to it stubbornly, and carry nearly everything over
the mark."—"Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene," pages
55, 56.

    3. "Surfeit.— To feed so as to oppress the stomach and de-
range the functions of the system; to overfeed, and produce
satiety, sickness, or uneasiness; excess in eating and drinking."
—Webster.
    " Overeating, even of the most wholesome food, is to be
guarded against. Nature can use no more than is required for
building up the various organs of the body, and excess clogs the
system." "Attention should be given also to the proper com-
bination of foods. By brain-workers and others of sedentary pur-
suits, but few kinds should be taken at a meal."—"Education,"
page 205.
    4. "Narrow ideas, an overstraining of small points, have been
a great injury to the cause of hygiene. There may be such an
effort at economy in the preparation of food, that, instead of a
healthful diet, it becomes a poverty-stricken diet. What is the
result? — Poverty of the blood. I have seen several cases of
disease most difficult to cure, which were due to impoverished diet.
The persons thus afflicted were not compelled by poverty to adopt
a meager diet, but did so in order to follow out their own errone-
ous ideas of what constitutes health reform. Day after day, meal
after meal, the same articles of food were prepared without varia-
tion, until dyspepsia and general debility resulted."—"Chris-
tian Temperance and Bible Hygiene," page 57.
    5. Temperance, or self-control, is only one - qualification of
many that go to make up a perfect Christian character. All these
qualifications here mentioned by Peter blend into one symmetrical
whole. Knowledge precedes temperance. Good judgment and
sound sense are needed in wisely taking hold of temperance prin-
ciples. Then it becomes a powerful adjunct in rising to the higher
attainments of patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love.
    6. "God requires of His people continual advancement. We
need to learn that indulged appetite is the greatest hindrance to
mental improvement and soul sanctification. With all our pro-
fession of health reform, many of us eat improperly. Indulgence
of appetite is the greatest cause of physical and mental debility,
and lies largely at the foundation of feebleness and premature
 death. Let the individual who is seeking to possess purity of
spirit bear in mind that in Christ there is power to control the
appetite."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 156.

                                Notes
   1. Here a powerful king commanded worship to an image he
had set up. This command would require the breaking of God's
holy law. These three loyal men respectfully yet firmly an-
nounced to the king that whether their God 'preserved their lives
or not, they would not worship this image he had set up, nor bow
down to it.' Here principle was involved. It was impossible to
obey the king, and at the same time remain true and loyal to the
God of heaven whom they served. The issue was thus sharply
drawn between obeying God, or the king's commandment — be-
tween the worship of the Creator, or the worship of a false god.
These Hebrews chose to ''obey God rather than men," and heaven
set its seal upon their choice.
    2. The three Hebrew brethren did not lose their individual
accountability amid the throng of worshipers in the plain of Dura.
No king could answer for them before that God whom they served.
Rom. 14:12. Likewise in the experience of Daniel, Peter, and all
the martyrs suffering affliction rather than to disobey God by
obeying some earthly ruler acting out of the ordained sphere of
civil government.
    3. "The time is coming when God's people will feel the hand
of persecution because they keep holy the seventh day. Satan has
32         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
caused the change of the Sabbath in the hope of carrying out his
purpose for the defeat of God's plans. He seeks to make the
commands of God ef less force in the world than human laws.
The man of sin, who thought to change times and laws, and who
has always oppressed the people of God, will cause laws to be made
enforcing the observance of the first day of- the week. But God's •
people are to stand firm for Him. And the Lord will work in their
behalf showing plainly that He is the God of gods."---" Testi-
monies for the Church," volume 9, pages 229, 530.

   14. Upon whom does God command special bless-
ings? Isa. 32: 8; Prov. 11: 25.
                                Notes
   1. The love of money has its root in covetousness. Covetous-
ness underlies all evil. It was Lucifer's coveting the place oc-
cupied by God that led him into sin. He coveted the worship, the
honor, the power belonging to the Creator. Those who will be
rich, those who bend every power of their being to acquire the
possession of money, fall into hurtful lusts which drown men in
perdition. This is an age of the world when this one thing has
well-nigh become the overmastering ambition. Colossal fortunes
are amassed only to become a curse to the possessor, to drag the
soul down to perdition. From all this God seeks to deliver His
children.
    2. It is plain that before one can take for himself God's holy
time, the seventh day, he must covet it. It is equilly clear that
this same commandment is also broken, as well as the eighth,
before one can place with his own stuff God's part, the tenth,
made holy by His reservation for a sacred use.
34          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     Says the deceiver:
     "Go, make the possessors of lands and money drunk with
 the cares of this life. Present the world before them in its most
 attractive light, that they may lay up their treasure here, and
 fix their affections on earthly things. We must do our utmost to
 prevent those who labor in God's cause from obtaining means to
 use against us. Keep the money in our own ranks. The more
 means they obtain, the more they will injure our kingdom by ta-
 king from us our subjects. Make them care more for money than
 for the building up of Christ's kingdom and the spread of the
 truths we hate, and we need not fear their influence; for we know
 that every selfish, covetous person will fall under our power, and
 will be separated finally from God's people."—Mrs. E. G. White,
in 1911 Week of Prayer Readings.
     3. "It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made.
 Divine benevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it was
 impossible for God to give more. . . . Why is our gratitude so
limited? It is only as a ripple on the surface, compared with the
 great tide of love that flows to us from the Father."—" Testi-
 monies for the Church," volume 9, pages 59, 60.
/ 4. "If our churches will take their stand upon the Lord's
word, and be faithful in paying, their tithe into His treasury,
more laborers will be encouraged to take up ministerial work.
 More men would give themselves to the ministry were they not
told of the depleted treasury. There should be an abundant
supply in the Lord's treasury, and there would be if selfish hearts
and hands had not withheld the tithes, or made use of them to
support other lines of work."-,71,1d., page 249.
     5. "There are many who urge that they can not do more for
 God's cause than they now do; but they do not give according
to their ability. The Lord sometimes opens the eyes blinded by
selfishness by simply reducing their income to the amount they
are willing to give. Horses are found 'dead in the field or stable,
houses or barns are destroyed by fire, or crops fail. In many
cases God tests man with blessings, and if unfaithfulness is mani-
fested in rendering to Him tithes and offerings, His blessing
is withdrawn."—" Testimonies for,the Church,' volume 4, page
484.
     6. A vow or pledge to give the Lord certain things, made at
times of spiritual refreshing when the Holy Spirit moves the heart
to benevolence, God holds very sacred indeed. It can not ruth-
lessly be set aside, nor later counted as a light matter, without
great peril to the soul.
     "Jacob made his vow while refreshed by the dews of grace,
and invigorated by the presence and assurance of God. After
the divine glory had passed away, he had temptations, like men in.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     35
our time; but he was faithful to his vow, and would not harbor
thoughts as to the possibility of being released from the pledge
which he had made/He might have reasoned much as men do
now, that this revelation was only a dream, that he was unduly
excited when he made his vow, and that therefore it need not be
kept; but he did not.
    "Long years intervened before Jacob dared to return to his
own country; but when he did, he faithfully discharged his debt
to his Master. He had become a wealthy man, and a very large
amount of property passed from his possession to the treasury
of the Lord.
    "Many in our day fail where Jacob made a success. Those
to whom God has given the greatest amount have the strongest
inclination to retain what they have, because they must give a
sum proportionate to their property. Jaeob gave the tenth of
all that he had, and then reckoned the use of the tenth, and gave
the Lord the benefit of that which be had used for his own interest
during the time he was in a heathen land, and could not pay his
vow. This was a large amount, but he did not hesitate; that
which he had vowed to God he did not regard as his, but as the
Lord's."— Id., pages 466, 467.
