                              Notes
   1. We are reconciled to God by the death of Christ, but saved
by His life. In His life on earth is seen the perfect righteousness
which the law demands. By nature we are wholly unrighteous.
In our flesh. is found no good thing. But through faith we are
cleansed from sin, and the righteous life of Jesus is imputed to us.
This righteousness is in harmony with the claims of the law, and
enables us to stand acquitted in the judgment.
   2. "By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more
than recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's
purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and
man• but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if
we had
    ' never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound
Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through
the eternal ages He is linked with us."—"Desire of Ages,"
page 25.
   3. "For four thousand years the race had been decreasing in
physical strength, in mental powers, and in moral worth; and
Christ took upon Him the infirmities of degenerate humanity.
Only thus could•He rescue man from the lowest depths of his deg-
radation. Many claim that it was impossible for Christ to be
overcome by temptation. Then He could not have been placed
in Adam's position; He could not have gained the victory that
Adam failed to gain. If we have in any sense a more trying
conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to succor us.
But our Saviour took humanity, with all its liabilities. He took
the nature of man, with the possibility of yielding to' temptation.
We have nothing to bear which He has not endured."— Id.,
page 117.

                               Notes
    1. "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a
plan formulated after the fall of Adam. . . . From the begin-
ning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the
fall of man through the deceptive power of the apostate. God
did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence,
and made provision to meet the terrible emergency."
    "Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the Father
and the Son had united in a covenant to redeem man if he should
be overcome by Satan. They had clasped Their hands in a solemn
pledge that Christ should become the surety for the human race."
—"Desire of Ages," pages 22, 834.
    2.. "God might have committed the message of the gospel, and
all the work of loving ministry, to the heavenly angels. He might
have employed other means for accomplishing His purpose. But
in His infinite love He chose to make us coworkers with Himself,
with Christ and the angels, that we might share the blessing, the
joy, the spiritual uplifting, which results from this unselfish min-
istry."—"Steps to Christ," chapter "The Work and the Life."

    4. In conversion what must we put off? Col. 3:
8-10 ; 1 Peter 2 : 1, 2.

5 : 22, 23.
    7. What are the works of the flesh? Verses 19-21.

    10. What attitude will the Christian sustain toward

    14. What purity of life will be found in the chil-
dren of God? 1 John 3 : 2. Note 4.
    15. Upon what will their affections be placed?

    16. In what way are they exhorted to do all things?
Verse 17.
                              Notes
   1. Love of the brethren is one of the tests of discipleship. If
we really love, not some, but all the brethren, we are assured that
our name is written in the book of life. "He that loveth not his
brother whom he hath seen, how can he love! God whom he bath
not seen'"
   2. " Jesus teaches that we can receive forgiveness from God
8           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

only as we forgive others. It is the love of God that draws us
unto Him, and that love can not touch our hearts without creating
love for our brethren. To cherish an unmerciful spirit toward
others, is to close the heart against the mercy of God toward
ourselves."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," page 151,
old edition.
    "0, the grave! the grave! It buries every error — covers
every defect — extinguishes every resentment. From its peaceful
bosom spring none but fond regrets and tender recollections. Who
can look down upon the grave even of an enemy, and not feel a
compunctious throb, that he should ever have warred with the
poor handful of earth that lies moldering before hina?"-
    3. Being "unequally yoked together" has a very broad appli-
cation. No doubt it applies to worldly organizations, where Chris-
tians are bound by the rules of a selfish, unsanctified body. From
these it calls for a separation. It covers also the marriage rela-
tion between believers and unbelievers. "The marriage of Chris-
tians with the ungodly is forbidden in the Bible. The Lord's di-
rection is, 'Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.' "
— "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 175.
    "Let those who are contemplating marriage weigh every senti-
ment and watch every development of character in the one with
 whom they think to unite their life destiny. Let every step toward
a marriage alliance be characterized by modesty, simplicity, sin-
cerity, and an earnest purpose to please and honor God. Marriage
affects the after-life, both in this world and in the world to come.
 A sincere Christian will make no plans that God can not approve."
 — "Ministry of Healing," page 359.
    4. "I saw that none could share the 'refreshing' unless they
 obtain the victory over every besetment, o'er pride, 'unselfishness,
 love for the world, and over every wrong word and action. We
should, therefore, be drawing nearer and nearer to the Lord, and
 be earnestly seeking that preparation necessary to enable us to
 stand in the battle in the day of the Lord. Let all remember that
 God is holy, and that none but holy beings can ever dwell in His
 presence."—"Early Writings," page 61, old edition; page 71,
 new edition.

quirements of the Lord? Rom. 8 : 3, 4.

    13. What did Abraham do in response to the in-
struction he received? Gen. 22: 3-6.
    14. What did Isaac say? What was Abraham's

   15. How far did Abraham go in obeying the com-
mand of God? Who spoke to him? What did the
angel say? Verses 9-12. Note 2.
   16. What substitute was provided by the Lord?
Verse 13. Note 3.
   17. Because of his obedience, what promise was made
to Abraham? Verses 15-18. Compare Gen. 26 : 2-5.
                              Notes
    1. At the time of this command to offer up his son as a sac-
rifice, Isaac was about twenty and Abraham one hundred twenty
years old.
    2. "Heavenly beings were • witnesses of the scene as the faith
of Abraham and the submission of Isaac were tested. The trial
was far more severe than that which had been brought upon
Adam. Compliance with the prohibition laid upon our first par-
ents involved no suffering; but the command to Abraham de-
manded the most agonizing sacrifice. All heaven beheld with
wonder and admiration Abraham's unfaltering obedience. All
heaven applauded his fidelity. Satan's accusations were shown
to be false. God declared to His servant, 'Now I know that thou
fearest God [notwithstanding Satan's charges], seeing thou hast
not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.' God's covenant,
confirmed to Abraham by an oath before the intelligences of other
worlds, testified that obedience will be rewarded."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," page 155.
    3. "It had been difficult even for the angels to grasp the
mystery of redemption,— to comprehend that the Commander of
heaven, the Son of God, must die for guilty man. When the
command was given to Abraham to offer up his son, the interest
of all heavenly beings was enlisted. With intense earnestness
they watched each step in the fulfilment of this command. When
to Isaac's question, 'Where is the lamb for a burnt offering'
Abraham made answer, 'God will provide Himself a lamb;' and
when the father's hand was stayed' as he was about to slay his
son, and the ram which God had provided was offered in the place
of Isaac,— then light was shed upon the mystery of redemption,
and even the angels understood more clearly the wonderful pro-
vision that God had made for man's salvation."— lb.

                                Notes
    I. "Workers were raised up who ably defended the faith once
delivered to the saints. History bears record to the fortitude
and heroism of these men. Like the apostles, many of them fell
at their post, but the building of the temple went steadily forward.
The workmen were slain, but the work advanced. The Waldenses,
John Wyclif, Huss and Jerome, Martin Luther and Zwingle, Oran-
mer, Latimer, and Knox, the Huguenots, John and Charles Wesley,
and a host of others brought to the foundation material that will
endure throughout eternity. And in later years those who have so
nobly endeavored to promote the circulation of God's word, and
those who by their service in heathen lands have prepared the way
for the proclamation of the last great message,— these also have
helped to rear the structure."—"Acts of the Apostles," page 598.
    2. "Trial is part of the education given in the school of
Christ, to purify God's children from the dross of earthliness.
It is because God is leading His children, that trying experiences
come to them. Trials and obstacles are His chosen methods of
discipline, and His appointed conditions of success. He who reads
the hearts of men knows their weaknesses better than they them-
selves can know them. He sees that some have qualifications
which, if rightly directed, could be used in the advancement of
His work: In His providence He brings these souls into different
positions and varied circumstances, that they may discover the
defects that are concealed from their own knowledge. He gives
them opportunity to overcome these defects, and to fit themselves
for service. Often He permits the fires of affliction to burn, that
they may be purified."— Id., page 524.
    3. "Not in freedom from trial, but in the midst of it, is Chris-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   -   13
tian character developed. Exposure to rebuffs and opposition leads
the follower of Christ to greater watchfulness, and more earnest
prayer to the mighty Helper. Severe trial endured by the grace
of God develops patience, vigilance, fortitude, and a deep and
abiding trust in God.. It is the triumph of the Christian faith
that enables its follower to suffer and be strong; to submit, and
thus to conquer; to be killed all the day long, and yet to live;
to bear the cross, and thus to win the crown of glory."— Id.,
pages 467, 468.
     4. "Stars shine brightest in the darkest night; torches are
the better for beating; grapes come not to the proof till they come
to the press; spices smell sweetest when pounded; young trees
root the faster for shaking; vines are the better for bleeding;
gold looks the brighter for scouring; glowworms glisten best in
the dark; juniper smells sweetest in the fire; pomander becomes
most fragrant for chasing; the palm-tree proves the better for
pressing; camomile, the more you tread it, the more you spread it.
Such is the condition of all God's children; they are the most
triumphant when most tempted, most glorious when most afflicted,
most in the favor of God when least in man's; as their conflicts,
so their conquests; as their tribulations, so their triumphp."
    Spencer.
     5. "It is the broken rock that sends forth streams of living
water through the wilderness. It is the broken ground that opens
its bosom for the reception of the incorruptible seed which springs
up, and which brings forth fruit abundantly. It is the broken
cloud that discharges itself in showers that usher in the spring,
and cheer the thirsty ground. It is the broken alabaster where-
with the poor penitent anoints the feet of the Saviour, and which
fills the whole house with the odor of the precious spikenard. It
 is the broken body, which the nails of the cross, and the spear of
a mortal enemy, have pierced, that tarnishes the blood that
cleanses the soul from all sin. It is the broken veil that opens
 into the holiest of all, and gives to the believing soul bright
 glimpses into the glory that is yet- to be revealed. It is the
 broken grave that announces the reality of the resurrection, and
 proclaims to the unbelieving disciple that the Saviour is risen
 indeed. It is the broken corn that is separated from the chaff,
 and laid up in the garner of the husbandman, or changed into
 the bread of life. And it is the broken berries which the mill-
 stones of the olive press have crushed, that give forth the pre-
 cious oil which filled- the dark tabernacle with the radiance of a
 clear and tranquilizing light."— Dr. J. Hamilton. •

                                Notes
    1. It may seem at first thotight strange to -tell a burden bearer
that the way to find rest is to take upon him another burden, a
yoke, though it be easy and light. But it is a different yoke from
that of sin; it is Christ's yoke.
    "The water-wheel is but a yoke put upon the neck of the river,
that it may be compelled to spin and weave for us; the sail is
simply a yoke attached to the winds to make them plow the great
deeps with the furroWs of a nation's commerce; the telegraph
wire is only a yoke for harnessing the electricity, that it may run
our errands and flash our thought to the ends of the world. Noth-
ing in earth or air or sea is of use to us till it has been restrained
and made obedient to our will. And so, instead of contradicting
the general order, Christ by these words lays clown one of -the most
universal of principles. Freedom for service comes through re-
pression of self. We must be narrowed into liberty, and con-
strained into true power."— A. J. Gordon.
     2. Two sparrows for one farthing, or five for two farthings.
 One is added, or thrown in, where the purchase was two farthings..
 The thought is that the one given away as of no comparative
 value, is not forgotten by the Lord. Then the statement, which if
 possible goes still farther in expressing the intimate watch-care
 of our heavenly Father, "But the very hairs of your head are
 all numbered.' With the psalmist we can exclaim, 'Such knowl-
 edge is too wonderful foi• me; it is high, I can not attain unto it."
 Ps. 139:6.

    "Sometimes it is hard to believe that the infinite God, who
holds the seas in His hand, and controls the stars in their courses,
should care for each individual soul. We are so small, and God's
universe is so great! We are but insects on a world which is but
a grain of sand to many of the stars. . . . If 1w provides for
birds and flowers, for the insects of an hour, for the bees, 'the
singing masons building roofs of gold,' how much more will He
care for the souls and bodies of His children, made in His own
likeness! "—Peloubet's Notes, 1910, page 74.

   I. "We can have the salvation of God in our families, but
We must believe for it, live for it, and have a continual, abiding
faith and trust in God. We must subdue a hasty temper, and
control our words; and in this we shall gain great victories.
Unless we control our words and temper, we are slaves to Satan.
We are in subjection to him. He leads us captive. All jangling,
and unpleasant, impatient, fretful words are an offering presented
to his satanic majesty. And it is a costly offering, more costly
than any sacrifice we can make for God; for it destroys the peace
and happiness of whole families, destroys health, and is even-
tually the cause of forfeiting an eternal life of happiness."—
"Testimonies for the Church," volume 1, page 310.,
    2. "It is remarkable that our divine Master, in telling us of
the coming Judgment, makes the final destiny of all men to de-
pend upon whether in this world they have exercised or have not
exercised the grace of kindness. For we are not done with life
as we live it. We shall meet it all again, not only the great things
we do, but the little things. Even our lightest words take their
place among the fixed- things of life, and will be recalled in the
Judgment. Jesus .said, 'Every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give account thereof in the clay of Judgment.' -He
does not say every wrong or evil word, but every useless, pur-
poseless, or frivolous word. The meaning is that the smallest
18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

things in life, both the evil and the good, will be taken account
of in the Judgment."—"The Beauty of Kindness," pages 9, 10.
    3. "Nothing else we can do is more worth while than kindness.
There is nothing that the world needs more, and nothing else
that leaves more real and far-reaching good in human lives.
Some day we shall learn that the little deeds of love wrought
unconsciously, as we pass on our way, are greater in their help-
fulness, and will shine more brightly at the last, than the deeds
of renown which we think of as alone making a life great."
    "Some of us, if we were to try to sum up the total of our
usefulness, would name a few large things we have done,— the
giving of money to some benevolent object, the starting of some
good work which has grown into strength, the writing of a book
which has made us widely known, the winning of honor in some
service to our community or to our country. But in every worthy
life that which has really left the greatest measure of good has
been its ministry of kindness. No record of it has been kept.
People have not talked about it. It has never been mentioned
in the newspapers.. But where we have gone, clay after day, if
we have simply been kind to every one, we have left blessings in
the world which in their sum far exceed the good wrought, the
help imparted, and the cheer given, by the few large, conspicuous
things we have done, of which we think and speak with pride."
    Id., pages 3, 9.
    " Turgenef in one of his little parables tells of meeting on
the way a beggar, who held out his greasy hand for alms. Tur-
genef searched all his pockets, but had no money, no food, nothing
whatever, to give the man. He said to him,       am sorry, brother,
that I have nothing for thee.' The beggar's face brightened,
and he said : That is enough. Thank you.' To be called
 brother' was better than any alms would have been."— Id.,
page 88.
    4. "Those who profess to believe the third angel's message
often wound the cause of God by lightness, joking, and trifling.
I was shown that this evil was all through our ranks. There
should be a humbling before the Lord; the Israel of God should
rend the heart, and not the garment. Childlike simplicity is
rarely seen; the approbation of man is more thought of than
the displeasure of God."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume

    1. ''Children who are allowed to come up to manhood or
womanhood with the will undisciplined and the passions un-
controlled, will generally in after-life pursue a course which God
condemns." --` Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, page 38.
 X" The neglect of parents to properly discipline their children
has been a fruitful source of evil in many families. The youth
have not been restrained as they should have been. Parents have
neglected to follow the directions of the word of God in this
matter, and the children have taken the reins of government into
their own hands. The consequence has been that theyhave gen-
erally succeeded in ruling their parents instead of being under
their authority."— Id., volume 4, pages 192,
                                           ,   193.
    "False ideas and a foolish, misdirected affection have nur-
tured traits which have made the children unlovely and unhappy,
have embittered the lives of the parents, and have extended their
baleful influence from generation to generation. Any child that
is permitted to have his own way will dishonor God and bring his
father and mother to shame."— Id., volume 5, page 325.4
    2. "What a reward was Hannah 's! and what an encouragement
to faithfulness is her example! There are opportunities of in-
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    21
 estimable worth, interests infinitely precious, committed to every
 mother. The humble round of duties which women have come to
 regard as a wearisome task, should be looked upon as a grand and
 noble work. It is the mother's privilege to bless the world by her
 influence,. and in doing this she will bring joy to her own heart.
 She may make straight paths for the feet of her children, through
 sunshine and shadow, to the glorious heights above. But it is only
 when she seeks, in her own life, to follow the teachings of Chria,
 that the mother can hope to orm the character of her children
 after the divine pattern."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 57.'2.)
     3. "Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which
 is due to no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon
 them a responsibility for the souls committed to their charge, has
 ordained that during the earlier years of life parents shall stand
 in the place of God to their children. And he who rejects the
 rightful authority of his• parents, is rejecting the authority of
 God. The fifth commandment requires children not only to yield
 respect, submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to
 give them love and tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard
•their reputation, and to succor and comfort them in old age. It
 also enjoins respect for ministers and rulers, and for all others
 to whom God has delegated authority."— Id., page 308.
      4. "Dear young friends, that which you sow, you will also
 reap. Now is the sowing time for you. What will the harvest bet
 What are you sowing'? Every word you utter, every act you per-
 form, is a seed which will bear good or evil fruit, and will result
 in joy' or sorrow. to the sower. As is the seed sown, so will be the
 crop._ God has given you great light and many privileges. After
  this light has been given, after your dangers have been plainly
  presented before you, the responsibility becomes yours: The man-
  ner in which you treat the light that God gives you, will turn the
  scale for happiness or wo. You are shaping your destinies for
  yourselves. "—" Testimonies for the Church,' volume 3, page'36.I.
      "A little time spent in sowing your wild oats, dear young
  friends, will produce a crop that will embitter your whole lif e;
  an hour of thoughtlessness — once yielding to temptation — may
  turn the whole current of your life in the wrong direction. You
  can have but one youth; make that useful. When once you have
  passed over the ground, you can never return to rectify your
  mistakes. He who refuses to connect with God, and puts himself
  in the way of temptation, will surely fall. God is testing every
  youth."— Id., volume 4, pages 622, 623.
      5. " Timothy's father was a Greek and his mother a Jewess.
  From a child he had known the. Scriptures. The piety that he saw
 in his home life was sound and sensible. The faith of his mother
  and his grandmother in the sacred oracles was to him a constant
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
reminder of the blessing in doing God's will. The word of God
was the rule by which these two godly women had guided Timothy.
 the spiritual power of the lessons that he had received from them
kept him pure in speech and unsullied by the evil influences with
which he was surrounded. Thus his home instructors had co-
operated with God in preparing him to bear burdens.
    "Paul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and
he chose him as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had
taught Timothy in his childhood were rewarded by seeing the son
of their care linked in close fellowship with the great apostle.
Timothy was a mere youth when he was chosen by God to be a
teacher; but his principles had been so established by his early
education that he was fitted to take his place as Paul's helper.
And though young, he bore his responsibilities with Christian
meekness."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 208, 204.

                               Notes
    1. "From the sacredness which was attached to the earthly
sanctuary, Christians may learn how they should regard the place
where the Lord meets with His people. There has been a great
change, not for the better, but for the worse, in the habits and
customs of the people in reference to religious worship. The pre-
cious, the sacred things which connect us with God, are fast losing
their hold upon our minds and hearts, and are being brought down
to the level of common things. The reverence which the people
had anciently for the sanctuary where they met with God in sacred
service, has largely passed away. Nevertheless, God Himself gave
the 'order of His service, exalting it high above everything of a
temporal nature."--,-" Testimonies for the Church," volume 5,
page 491.
    2. "If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting
begins, let them maintain a true spirit of ttevotion by silent medi-
tation, keeping the heart uplifted to God in prayer that the service
may be of special benefit to their own hearts, and lead to the con-
viction and conversion of other souls. They should remember that
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

heavenly messengers are in .the house. We all lose much sweet
communion with God by our restlessness, by not encouraging mo-
ments of reflection and prayer. The spiritual condition needs to
be often reviewed, and the mind and heart drawn toward the Sun
of Righteousness. If when the, people core into the house of wor-
ship, they have genuine reverence for the Lord, and bear in mind
that they are in His presence, there will be a sweet eloquence in
silence. The whispering and laughing and talking which might
be without sin in a common business place, should find no sanction
in the house where God is worshiped. The mind should be pre-
pared to hear the word of God, that it may have due weight, and
suitably impress the heart"— Id., -page 492.
    3. "I am often pained when I enter the house where God is
worshiped, to see the untidy dress of both men and women. If
the heart and character were indicated by the outward apparel,
then certainly nothing could be heavenly about them. They have
no true idea of the order, the neatness, and the refined deportment
that God requires of all who come into His presence to worship
Him. What impressions do these things give to unbelievers and
to the youth, who are keen to discern and to draw their conclusions?
    "In the minds of many, there are no more sacred thoughts
connected with the house of God than with the most common place.
Some will enter the place of worship with their hats on, in soiled,
dirty clothes. Such do not realize that they are to meet with God
and holy angels. There should be a radical change in this matter
all through our churches Ministers themselves need to elevate
their ideas, to have finer susceptibilities in regard to it. It is
a feature of the work that has been sadly neglected. Because of
the irreverence in attitude, dress, and deportment, and lack of a
worshipful frame of mind, God has often turned His face away
from those assembled for His worship."— Id., pages 498, 499.
    4. "All should be taught to be neat, clean, and orderly in their
dress, but not to indulge in that external adorning which is wholly
inappropriate for the sanctuary. There should be no display of
the apparel; for this encourages irreverence. The attention of
the people is often called to this or that fine article of dress, and
thus thoughts are intruded that should have no place in the
hearts of the worshipers. God is to be the subject of thought, the
object of worship; and anything that attracts the mind froin the
solemn, sacred service is an offense to Him. 'The parading of bows
and ribbons, ruffles and feathers, and gold and silver ornaments,
is a species of idolatry, and is wholly inappropriate for the sacred
service of God, where the eye of every worshiper should be single
to His glory. All matters of dress should be strictly guarded,
following closely the Bible rule. Fashion has been the goddess
who has ruled the outside world, and she often insinuates herself
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     25
into the church. The church should make the word of God her
standard, and parents should think intelligently
                                       .         upon this subject.
When they see their children inclined to follow worldly fashions,
they should, like Abraham, resolutely command their households
after them. Instead. of uniting them with the world, connect
them with God. Let none dishonor God's sanctuary by their showy
apparel."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, page 499.

                              Notes
    1. These three cities are mentioned, doubtless, for the reason
that it was here that the Lord did much of His labor, and per-
formed many of His wonderful miracles. They had abundant
opportunity to see the clear evidence of His Messialiship. But
they deliberately rejected Him, and closed their eyes to the light,
because of unbelief. Having had greater light than Sodom, their
condemnation was correspondingly greater. See John 15 : 22.
    2. " While God has given ample evidence for faith, He will
never remove all excuse for unbelief. All who look for hooks to
hang their doubts upon, will find them. And those who refuse to
accept and obey God's word until every objection has been re-
moved, and there is no longer an opportunity for doubt, will
never come to the light.
     `Distrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed
heart, which is at enmity with Him. But faith is inspired by the
Holy Spirit, and it will flourish only as it is cherished. No man
can become strong in faith without a determined effort. Unbelief
strengthens as it is encouraged; and if men, instead of dwelling
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       27
upon the evidences which God has given to sustain their faith,
permit themselves to question and cavil, they will find their doubts
constantly becoming more confirmed."—"Great Controversy," re-
vised edition, page 527.
    3. Consecrated wealth can be a great blessing and one of the
instruments for advancing the kingdom of God on earth. The sin
is in hoarding it, and using it for selfish purposes, instead of help-
ing needy souls about us.
    4. Those who practise sin are the slaves of sin, in bondage to
Satan. This is bondage in the truest sense, a load heavy to be
borne. Jesus came to deliver the world from the power of evil
habits. We are hidden to cast off the binding yoke of Satan, and
take the free, easy yoke of Jesus. With the invitation comes the
power to do the thing.

                             Notes
   1. "All that man received of God's bounty still belongs to God.
Whatever God has bestowed in the valuable and beautiful things
of earth, is placed in the hands of men to test them,— to sound
the depths of their love for Him arid their appreciation of His.
favors. Whether it be the treasures of wealth or of intellect,
they are to be laid, a willing offering, at the feet of Jesus; the
giver saying, meanwhile, with David, 'All things come of Thee,
and of Thine own have we given Thee.' "— 'Patriarchs and
Prophets," page 753.
    2. Mind and body are to be yielded to God. All is to be laid
on the altar, not a dead but a living sacrifice. This is the Lord
petitioning us to consecrate ourselves wholly to Him. The un-
yielding life is the citadel of self. This fortress God will not
force us to yield, yet nothing else will suffice for deliverance.
When once we give up all, making our consecration complete and
unconditional, the Lord will flood the soul with the fulness of His
blessing.
    3. The gifts here mentioned came from poverty. We are told
that "Macedonia had lost the benefits of its mines, which the
Roman government had apportioned to itself, and was suffering
from the weight .of taxation." But the joy of a new-found sal-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     29
vation was so great that they forgot their extreme poverty and
gave liberally. But above all, they "gave their own selves to the
Lord." Herein lies the foundation of all liberality.
    4. "I said one day to a great business man, 'How long would
you keep a man in your employ if you knew he was half for you
and half for your competitor?' He said,        should keep him until
I found it out.' Stepping over to his private desk, he took out
a piece of paper and handed it to me, and I read an iron-clad agree-
ment, which stated that whenever a man became part of this great
business concern, he practically said to the representative of the
company, 'All my influence is yours, all my strength, is yours, all
the power I have is yours.' And the merchant said to me: 'When
a man signs that contract, we give him the right to use our name.
We would not give him this privilege if we could not control
him.' "—"Power," by J. Wilbur Chapman, pages 17, 18.
    5. "The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent
especially the gifts and blessing imparted by the Holy Spirit.. . .
But not until after the ascension was the gift received in its
fulness. Not until through faith and prayer the disciples had
surrendered themselves fully for His working, was the outpouring
of the Spirit received. Then in a special sense the goods of heaven
were committed to the followers of Christ. 'When He ascended up
on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.'
  Unto every one of us is given grace, according 10.the measure of
the gift. of Christ,' the Spirit dividing to every man severally as
 He will.' The gifts are already ours in Christ, but their actual
 possession depends upon our reception of the Spirit of God. . . .
    " The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents repre-
sented in the parable. It includes all gifts and endowments,
 whether original or acquired, natural or spiritual. All are to be
 employed in Christ's service. In becoming His disciples, we sur-
 render ourselves to Him with al] that we are and have. These
 gifts He returns to us purified and ennobled, to be used for His
 glory in blessing our fellow men.
     "To every man God has given according to his several
 ability.' The talents are not apportioned capriciously. He who
 has ability to use five talents receives five. He who can improve
 but two, receives two. He who can wisely use only one, receives
 one. None need lament that they have not received larger gifts;
 for He who has apportioned to every man, is equally honored by
 the improvement of each trust, whether it be great or small. The
 one to whom five talents have been committed is to render the
 improvement of five; he who has but one, the improvement of one.
 God expects returns according to that a man hath, and not ac-
 cording to that he hath not.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
 pages 327, 328.
30          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    6. "It was the one with the smallest gift who left his talent
unimproved. In this is given a warning to all who feel that the
smallness of their endowments excuses them from service for
Christ. If they could do some great thing, how gladly would they
undertake it! but because they can serve only in little things, they
think themselves justified in doing nothing. In this they err.
The Lord in His distribution of gifts is testing character. The
man who neglected to improve his talent, proved himself an un-
faithful servant. Had he received five talents; he would have
buried them as he buried the one. His misuse of the one talent
showed that he despised the gifts of Heaven." — Id., page 355.

                                Notes
   1. A traveler to the Euphrates relates that when he came to the
Valley of Salt he broke off a piece that had been exposed to the
rain, sun, and air, and found that, though it had all the sparkle
and other qualities of salt, it had lost its savor. This is true of
many professed Christians. If we desire to salt the world, we must
begin with ourselves. We must be good if we wish to do good.
Salt has preserving qualities; but before its work can be effective
in helping the world, it must be brought into close contact with
the world.
    2. It is said that on the coast of Scotland there is a dangerous
rock too small for a lighthouse to be built upon it, but a glass
prism set on it with iron stanchions catches the beams from a
lighthouse on shore and throws them along the ship's course. In
like manner we are to reflect to the world the light of Jesus. It
is God's light, and not our own, that we are to give.
    3. "The very soul of our religion is missionary, progressive,
world embracing; it would cease to exist if it ceased to be mis-
32          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

sionary, if it disregarded the parting words of its Founder, 'Go
ye therefore, and teach all nations,' etc. The spirit of truth is
the life-spring of all religion; and where it exists, it must mani-
fest itself, it must plead, it must persuade, it must convince and
convert. There may be times when silence is gold, and speech
silver; but there are times also when silence is death, and speech
is life,—the very life of Pentecost. Look at the religions in
which the missionary spirit has been at work, and compare them
with those in which any attempt to convince others by argument,
to save souls, to bear witness to the truth, is treated with pity or
scorn. The former are alive; the latter are dying or dead."—
Max Muller.
    4. This experience in the life of Hezekiah contains a very prac-
tical lesson. In answer to prayer Hezekiah had been healed, and
fifteen years added to his life. Besides, the Lord had wrought a
great miracle; a wonder had been seen in the heavens. Curious to
understand concerning this, an embassy was despatched from
Babylon to Jerusalem to make inquiry. A great opportunity was
thus given Hezekiah to make known the true God to these repre-
sentatives of a kingdom. He could bring before them his per-
sonal experience, and how, in answer to his earnest request, God's
power had been made manifest in his restoration to health. Before
him was an opportunity to make a personal appeal to the members
of this embassy in behalf of the true God, and lead them to worship
the One whO had power over the bodies of men, as well as over the
planetary system. Instead of this, however, he showed them,
doubtless with more or less pride, the increase of his riches, his
kingly treasures, his storehouses, his flocks, herds in abundance,
and impressed hem with the might of his kingdom. No doubt
the profusion of wealth and princely establishments created a
desire to possess this wealth, which resulted later in a conquest
of Jerusalem being projected, and Daniel and others being taken
to Babylon, where in captivity they made known the true God.
    Let us not make a like mistake, when meeting persons in our
homes and elsewhere, of spending all our time talking about our
own business and secular plans, and the commonplace things of
the world, and neglecting to bring before them the goodness and
power of God, and the special work now being done in the world.
Have we done this? If so, let the experience of Hezekiah serve
as a warning.
     5. From this example of Jesus, we see how a single soul, though
the poorest and most obscure, is worthy of our efforts. We would
scarcely have expected a revival of godliness to come to Sychar
through such an unlikely instrument. But this woman first had
a face-to-face talk with Jesus. This changed her entire life, and
she then began personal work for those near at hand.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    33
    "In the words spoken to the woman at the well, good seed
had been sown, and how quickly the harvest was received! The
Samaritans came and heard Jesus, and believed on Him. Crowding
about Him at the well, they plied Him with questions, and eagerly
received His explanations of many things that had been obscure
to them. As they listened, their perplexity began to clear away.
They were like a people in great darkness tracing up a sudden ray
of light till they had found the day. But they were not satisfied
with this short conference. They were anxious to hear more, and
to have their friends also listen to this wonderful Teacher. They
invited Him to their city, and begged Him to remain with them.
For two days He tarried in Samaria, and many more believed on
Him."—"Desire of Ages," page 192.

Work with the Holiday Books
  The new prospectus, with which hundreds of home
workers successfully sold our truth-laden small books,
adapted for holiday time, last year, has entirely revo-
lutionized the small book work. Now, instead of carry-
ing full books as samples, you have conveniently ar-
ranged in a neat, durable binder, sample covers and
sheets from as many of the books of the entire list as
you wish* to sell. These samples are slipped on rings,
and may be arranged in any order you desire. Scores
of persons, including many children and young people,
inexperienced in canvassing, have made this work a
success. The following report from one of these shows
what may be done:

   The largest number of orders I have taken in one day
(in five hours), amounted to $5.85 — ten orders. One
morning from 9 to 11:30 I took eight orders, amounting
to $3.75. I have never spent a whole day and many clays
I could not get out at all. I feel that the Lord has
blessed me in this work :

   By taking hold of this work with our small books early
,this year, such a list as the above can be placed in every
community that can be reached. A stock of the pro-
spectus is now on hand, and this, with the order book,
which is all the outfit needed, may be secured at once
from your tract society for $1.00, post-paid.
   In view of the far-reaching influence of the work of
placing such books in the homes of the people, will you
not help to circulate them in your neighborhood'? You
will find it pleasant and profitable, and the Lord will
richly bless your efforts.    Write your tract society at
once for the new Home workers' booklet which gives
 experiences and instruction in methods.
