Topical Studies on the Message
                     First Quarter, 1912.
                       Introductory Note
   Fog six months the lessons for all divisions of the Sabbath-
school will be topical studies, covering many of the doctrinal
features of present truth. This is the first time we have ever had
uniform study in all divisions on these topics, and these lessons
should be a great blessing to our people everywhere. The dis-
tinctive features of the message should always be interesting to
those who love it, and to thousands who have embraced it in more
recent years they will be of special interest.
    It has been suggested that during the period covered by these
lessons there be a general revival of missionary work in all our
churches and Sabbath-schools, and that these lessons be used as a
basis for Bible studies with our neighbors and friends. We believe
the suggestion is a good one, and hope that it will be put into
practical operation.

                               Notes
     1. "Creation is the work of God: 'Without Him was not any-
thing made that was made.' He only can create. The architect
can rear a cathedral, the sculptor can cut forms of symmetry and
grace from marble, the painter can depict life on his canvas, the
machinist can construct engines that shall serve the nations; but
not one of them can create. They work with materials already
in existence. They bring existing things into new combinations:
this is all. God alone can create."— Dr. Thomas.
     2. "The hand that sustains the worlds in space, the hand that
holds in their orderly arrangement and tireless activity all things
throughout the universe of God, is the hand that was nailed to the
cross for us."—"Education," by Mrs. E. G. White, page 132.
     3. "The, assumption that the events of the first week re-
quired thousands upon thousands of years, strikes directly at
the foundation of the fourth commandment. It represents the
Creator as commanding men to observe the week of literal days
in commemoration of vast, indefinite periods. This is unlike His
 method of dealing with His creatures. It makes indefinite and
 obscure that which He has made very plain. It is infidelity in
its most insidious and hence most dangerous form; its real char-
 acter is so disguised that it is held and taught by many who
 profess to believe the Bible."
      "Geologists claim to find evidence from the earth itself that
 it is very much older than the Mosaic record teaches. ... But apart
 from Bible history, geology can prove nothing. Those who reason
 so confidently upon its discoveries, have no adequate conception of
 the size of men, animals, and trees before the flood, or of the great
 changes which then took place. Relics found in the earth do
 give evidence of conditions differing in many respects from the
 present; but the time when these conditions existed can be learned'
 only from the Inspired Record. In the history of the flood, inspira-
 tion has explained that which geology alone could never fathom."
 —"Christian Education," Mrs. E: G. White, pages 190-192.

    4. ''Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resem-
blance and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of
the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God. His
nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was
capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were pure;
his appetites and passions were under the control of reason.
He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in
perfect obedience to His will.
   "As man came forth from the hand of his Creator, he was of
lofty stature and perfect symmetry. His countenance bore the
ruddy tint of health, and glowed with the light of life and joy.
Adam's height was much greater than that of men who now in-
habit the earth. Eve was somewhat less in stature; yet her form
was noble, and full of beauty. The sinless pair wore no artificial
garments; they were clothed with a covering of light and glory,
such as the angels wear. So long as they lived in obedience to
God, this robe of light continued to enshroud them."—"Patri,
archs and Prophets," page 45.

                             Notes
   L " And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden;
and there He put the man whom He had formed.' Everything that
God had made was the perfection of beauty, and nothing seemed
wanting that could contribute to the happiness of the holy pair;
8           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 yet the Creator gave them still another token of His love, by
 preparing a garden especially for their home. In this garden
 were trees of every variety, many of them laden with. fragrant
 and delicious fruit. There were lovely, vines, growing upright,
 yet presenting a most graceful appearance, with their branches
 drooping under their load of tempting fruit, of the richest and
 most varied hues. It was the work of Adam and Eve to train the
 branches of the vine to form bowers, thus making for themselves
a dwelling from living trees covered with foliage and fruit. There
 were fragrant flowers of every hue in rich profusion. In the
midst of the garden stood the tree of life, surpassing in glory
all other trees. Its fruit appeared like apples of gold and silver,
and had the power to perpetuate life."—"Patriarchs and Pi.oph-
 ets," pages 46, 47.
    2. "In the midst of the garden, near the tree of life, stood
the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This tree was especially
designed of God to be the pledge of their obedience, faith, and
love 10. Him. Of this tree the Lord commanded our first parents
not to eat, neither to touch it, lest they die. He told them that
they might freely eat of all the trees in the garden except one;
but if they ate of that tree they should surely die.
    ''When Adam and Eve were placed in the beautiful garden,
they had everything for their happiness which they could desire.
But He chose, in His all-wise arrangements, to test their loyalty
before they could be rendered eternally secure. They were to have
His favor, and He was to converse with them, and they with Him.
Yet He did not place evil out of their reach. Satan was permitted
to tempt them. If they endured the trial, they were to be in
perpetual favor with God and the heavenly angels."—"Spirit of
Prophecy," volume 1, page 27.
    3. "While Satan claimed to have received great good by eat-
ing of the forbidden tree, he did not let it appear that by trans-
gression he had become an outcast from heaven. Here was false-
hood, so concealed under a covering of apparent truth that Eve,
infatuated, flattered, beguiled, did not discern the deception. She
coveted what God had forbidden; she distrusted His wisdom. She
cast away faith, the key of knowledge."—"Education," by Mrs.
E. G. White, page 24.
    4. "Man lost all because he chose to listen to the deceiver
rather than to Him who is Truth, who alone has understanding.
By the mingling of evil with good, his mind had become con-
fused, his mental and spiritual powers benumbed. No longer
could he appreciate the good that God had so freely bestowed."
— Id., page 25.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      9
    5. "In order to possess an endless existence, man must con-
tinue to partake of th e true of life. Deprived o f this, his vital-
ity would gradually diminish until life, should become extinct.
It was. Satan's plan that Adam and Eve should by disobedience
incur Gods displeasure; and then, if they failed to obtain for-
giveness, he hoped that they would eat of the tree of life, and
thus perpetuate an existence of sin and misery. But after man's
fall, holy angels were immediately commissioned to guard the tree
of life. Around these angels, flashed beams of light having the ap-
pearance of a glittering sword. None of the family of Adam
were permitted to pass that barrier to partake of the life-giving-
 fruit; hence there is not an immortal sinner. "—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," page 60.
    6. " Then joy, inexpressible joy, filled heaven. And the'
heavenly host sung' a song of praise and adoration. They
touched their harps and sung a note higher than they had done
before, for the great mercy and condescension 'of God in yield-
ing up His dearly Beloved to die for a race of rebels. Praise
and adoration were poured forth for the self-denial and sacrifice
of Jesus; that He would consent to leave the bosom of His Father,
and choose a life of suffering and anguish, and die an ignominious
death to give His life for others.
    "Said the angel, Think ye that the Father yielded up His
dearly beloved Son without a struggle? No, no. it was even a
struggle with the God of heaven, whether to et guilty man perish,
or to give His beloved Son to die for them. Angels were so in-
terested for man's salvation that there could be found among
them those who would yield their glory and give their life for
perishing man. But, said my accompanying angel, that would
avail nothing. The transgression was so great that an angel's
life would not pay the debt. Nothing but the death and inter-
cessions of His .Son would pay the debt, and save lost man from
 hopeless sorrow and misery." —"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 1,
 pages. 47, 48.
    7. All that the first . Adam lost by transgression, Christ, the
second Adam, purchased back through obedience. Man lost his
purity and holiness and his beautiful home given by the Creator;
through Christ man has forgiveness of sin, the righteousness of
faith, and a right again to the tree of life.

                             Notes
    1. "Enoch was troubled in regard to the dead. It seemed to
him that the righteous and the wicked would go to the dust to-
gether, and that would be their end. He could not clearly see
the life of the just beyond the grave. In prophetic vision he was
instructed in regard to the Son of God, who was to die man's
sacrifice, and was shown the coming of Christ in the clouds of
heaven, attended by the angelic host, to give life to the right-
eous dead, and ransom them from their graves. He also saw the
corrupt state of the world at the time when Christ should appear
the second time — that there would be a boastful, presumptuous,
self-willed generation arrayed in rebellion against the law of
God, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ,
and trampling upon His blood, and despising His atonement. He
saw the righteous crowned with glory and honor, while the wicked
were separated from the presence of the Lord, and consumed with
 fire."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 1, _pages 61, 60.
     2. "The Captain of our salvation has prepared His servant
 for the last great conflict. Ransomed by the sacrifice of Christ,
washed from sin in His blood, and clothed in His righteousness,
 Paul has the witness in himself that his soul is precious in the
 sight of his Redeemer. His life is hid with Christ in God, and
 he is persuaded that He who has conquered death is able to keep
 that which is committed to His trust. His mind' grasps the Sa-
 viour's promise,      will raise him up at the last day.' His
 12          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  thoughts and hopes are centered in the second advent of his Lord.
  And as the sword of the executioner descends, and the shadows
  of death gather about the martyr's soul, his latest thought springs
  forward, as will his earliest thought in the great awakening, to
  meet the Life-giver who shall welcome him to the joy of the
  blest."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," by Mrs. E. G.
  White, page 333.
      3. "Soon there appears in the east a small black cloud, about
  half the size of a man's hand. It is the cloud which surrounds
  the Saviour, and which seems in the distance to be shrouded in
  darkness. The people of God know this to be the sign of the
  Son of man. In solemn silence they gaze upon it as it draws
  nearer the earth, becoming lighter and more glorious, until it is
  a great white cloud, its base a glory like consuming fire, and
  above it the rainbow of the covenant."—"Great Controversy,"
  pages640, 641.
 ( -4.   No pen can picture or heart fully conceive of the glory
  and power which will attend the return of Jesus to receive to
  Himself the fruition of the travail of His soul. The glory
  which attended one angel who descended to raise the sleeping
  Saviour, struck the strong Roman guard to the ground. But
  when Jesus returns as King of kings, He will be attended by all
  the armies in heaven. He will come in all the glory of the Father,
  in all His own glory, and in the glory of all the'holy angels.
  Those in whom sin reigns, who are of choice identified with sin,
  will be slain by the brightness of His appearing.
      5. "The captives brought up from the graves at the time of
  the resurrection of Jesus were His trophies as a conquering
  Prince. Thus He attested His victory over death and the grave;
  thus He gave a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all
  the righteous dead. Those who were called from their graves went
  into the city, and appeared unto many in their resurrected forms,
  and testified that Jesus had indeed risen from the dead, and that
  they had risen with Him. The voice that cried, 'It is finished,'
  was heard among the dead. It pierced the walls of sepulchers,
  and summoned the sleepers to arise. Thus shall it be when God's
  voice shall be heard shaking the heavens and earth. That voice
  will penetrate the graves and unbar the tombs. A mighty earth-
  quake will then cause the world to reel to and fro like a drunk-
  ard. Then Christ, the King of Glory, shall appear, attended by
/all the heavenly angels. The trumpet shall sound, and the Life-
  giver shall call forth the righteous dead to immortal life."—
   'Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 223.

    15. What was next to be seen? Verse 30. Note 5.
    16. What will then take place? Verse 31.
    17. By what parable does the Lord impress the
nearness of the end? Verses 32-34.
    18. How sure are His words? What does no man
know? Verses 35, 36.
    19. What words of the prOphet are of special force
at this time? Amos 4 : 12.
                               Notes
    1. No one can look for an event which they do not expect, or
believe to be near.
    2. The fact that people are doubting the promise of the Lord's
coming is clear evidence that some are proclaiming the event,
and directing the attention of the people to the promise of His
return, and warning them to get ready for this glorious event.
Some will scoff, but others will receive the message with joy.
    3. Matthew says the signs in the heavens would appear "imme-
diately after the tribulation." Mark says, "after that tribula-
tion." The "tribulation" here mentioned is no doubt that. long
period of- "time and times and the dividing of times," or " forty
and two months"— 1260 days, or years — in which the papal
power was to make war on the saints and blaspheme God. See
Dan. 7:25 and Rev. 13:5. This period ended in 1798. By means
of the. Reformation the persecution ended before the period ,itself
expired. Immediately following the close of the persecution the
sun was to be darkened.

                           THE SUN
   4. "The 19th of May, 1780, was unprecedented in New Eng-
land for its great darkness. . . . The darkness extended over
several thousand square miles, though differing much in intensity
in different places. Nowhere, perhaps, was it greater than in
this vicinity. The day was appropriately called and is still
known as THE DARK DAY."— From "History of the Town of
Hampton, New Hampshire," by Joseph Dorr, Salem, Massachu-•
setts, printed by the Salem Press and' Printing Company, 1893,
volume 1, page 217. (Boston Public Library.)
    " There appears to have been.absence of clouds for the most
part, though light rain occurred. Though known as the 'Black
Friday of New England,' the area covered by darkness also ex-
tended west of that seetion."—"Eneyqopedia Americana,'' the
 Americana Company, New York, 1903, article "Dark Day." •

                           THE MOON
   "The darkness of the following evening was probably as deep
and' dense as ever had been observed since the Almighty first
gave birth to light; it wanted only palpability to render it as ex-
traordinary as that which overspread the land of Egypt in the
days of Moses. If every luminous body in the universe had
been shrouded in impenetrable shades, or struck out of existence,
it was thought the darkness could not have been more complete.
A sheet of white paper, held within a few inches of the eyes, was
equally invisible with the blackest velvet."— Article by R. M.
Downs, "Our First Century," 1776-1876; "Great and Memo-
rable Events," pages 89-96. (Boston Public Library.)

                           THE STARS
   "Compared with the splendors • of this celestial exhibition, the
most brilliant rockets and fireworks of art bore less relation than
the twinklihg of the most tiny star to the broad glare of the sun.
The whole heavens seemed in motion, and little need have been
borrowed from the morbid sensibility, to imagine that the opening
of the sixth seal was indeed at hand when the stars of heaven fell
unto the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when
she is shaken of a mighty wind. Never before has it fallen to our
lot to observe a phenomenon so magnificent and sublime."— New
York "Commercial Advertiser," quoted in the ''Eastern Argus"
(Portland, Maine) of November 18, 1833.
    "We pronounce the raining fire which we saw on Wednesday
morning last an awful type — a sure forerunner — a merciful
16          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
sign of that great and dreadful day which the inhabitants of the
earth will witness when the sixth seal shall be opened.
    "That time is just at hand described not only in the New
Testament but in the Old; and a more correct picture of a fig-tree
casting its leaves when blown by a mighty wind, it was not pos-
sible to behold.
    ''Many things now occurring upon the earth tend to convince
us that we are in the 'latter days.' This exhibition we deem to be
a type of an awful day fast hurrying upon us. This is our sin-
cere opinion; and what we think, we are not ashamed to tell."
— The "Old Countryman," .New York, printed in the "New
York Star" and quoted in th4 Portland "Evening Advertiser,"
November 36, 1833. (Portland Public Library.)
    5. "December 16, 1848, the Lord gave me a view of the sha-
king of the powers of the heavens. I saw that when the Lord
said 'heaven,' in giving the signs recorded by Matthew, Mark,
and Luke, He meant heaven, and when He said 'earth' He meant
earth. The powers of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars. They
rule in the heavens. The powers of earth are those that rule on
the earth. The powers of heaven will be shaken at the voice of
God. Then• the sun, moon, and stars will be moved out of their
places. They will not pass away, but be shaken by the voice of
God."—"Early Writings," by Mrs. E. G. White, old edition,

      (a) In the sun,
      (b) In the moon,
      (c) -In the stars,
     (d) Among the nations,
     (e) In the sea,
     (f) In the hearts of men.
     2. No doubt the primary meaning of this text is that in the
 last days people will search the prophecies, and as a result knowl-
 edge of - the Scriptures will increase. But it doubtless has a
 broader meaning, as knowledge in all lines follows where the 'word
 of God is studied.
     "To appreciate them [the wonders of this age], let us briefly
contrast the conditions of to-day with those of a hundred years
ago. This is no easy task, for the comparison not only involves
the experiences of two generations, but it is like the juxtaposition
of a star with the noonday sun, whose superior brilliancy oblit-
erates the lesser light.. , .        we make the backward run of
one hundred years, we have passed by many mile-stones of prog-
ress. Let us see if we can count some of them as they disappear
behind us. We quickly lose the telephone, phonograph, and .grapho-
phone. We no longer see the cable-cars or electric railways. The
electric lights have gone out. The telegraph disappears. The
sewing-machine, reaper, and thrasher have passed away, and so
also have all india-rubber goods. We no longer see any photo-
graphs, photoengravings, photolithographs, or snap-shot cameras.
The wonderful octuple web perfecting printing-press, printing,
pasting, cutting, folding, and counting newspapers at the rate
of 96,000 per hour, or 1,600 per minute, shrinks at the begin-
ning of the century into an insignificant prototype. We lose all
planing and wood-working machinery, and with it the endless
variety of sashes, doors, blinds, and furniture in unlimited va-
riety. There are no gas-engines, no passenger-elevators, no asphalt
pavement, no steam fire-engine, no triple-expansion steam-engine,
no Giffard injector, no celluloid articles, no barbed wire fences, no
time-locks for safes, no self-binding harvesters, no oil- or gas-
wells, no ice machines nor cold storage. We lose air-engines,
stem-winding watches, cash-registers, and cash-carriers, the great
suspension bridges • and tunnels, the Suez Canal, iron-frame build-
ings, monitors and heavy ironclads, revolvers, torpedoes, maga-

less carriages, and — enough! the reader exclaims, and indeed

     3. One of the surest evidences that the flood was coming
was seen in the message sent of God through His servant Noah
announcing this tremendous calamity. So in the last days, just
before the Lord is to send His Son from heaven to reap the harvest
of the earth, the surest, most unimpeachable witness that the, corn-
ing of the Son of man is at the door, will be a definite message
announcing the coming of Christ,-based on the fulfilment of proph-
ecy. Just such a message is now proclaimed in the world. A be-
ginning has been made in almost all nations. Beyond a doubt
the end is near.
     4. The prophet Isaiah tells us what the people will be saying
in the last days. While great preparations for war are seen on
every hand, the people will be planning disarmament and arbitra-
tion, and teaching that war will be a thing of the past. This false
cry is to be so marked that it will constitute a sign of the end.
1 Thess. 5:1-3.
     5. A few years ago Bishop Newman said: "We are now pass-
ing through the most unsettled condition of the whole world since
the crucifixion of Christ. . . . And whatever cause it is that
touches the first match to the fuse, no human power can foretell
in what countries that fuse may lead to an international explo-
sion."
    Canon Scott Holland, an English clergyman, somewhat re-
cently said: "The outlook in Europe never presented so wholly
an unchristian spectacle since the days of Constantine. Even in
medieval days, peace, and not war, was regarded as the normal
condition of men. Now nations were watching one .another like
wild beasts in a jungle, and Christian Europe had armed itself in
defiance of everything which Christ came to teach. Blood and
iron rule; huge camps and seas, crowded with horrible ships of
war, met the eye at every turn. Men scrambled for land, and
the question was who should be first in the race. Are we to be
swept away in the pagan scramble?"

LESSON VI — The Binding of Satan; the Millennium
                    FEBRUARY 10, 1912
   LESSON HELPS: "Great Controversy," chapters 29, 41; the
Sabbath School Worker.
   GENERAL NOTE.— The word millennium is from two Latin
words, mille, thousand, and annus, year, and means a thousand
years. Any period of a thousand years is a millennium. This
special period is mentioned in the Bible in Revelation 20/ and
the statement is made that Satan is bound during that' time.
This lesson is devoted largely to a study of this scripture.
                          Questions
   1. What terrible contest does the prophet tell us
once took place in heaven? Who fought? What was
the outcome? Rev. 12 : 7-9. Compare Luke 10 : 17, 18.
    2. Who were cast out with Satan, the leader? In
what condition are they? To what are they reserved?
Jude 6 ; 2 Peter 2 : 4.
   3. What has been Satan's work since his fall? Job
1:6, 7; 2:2; 1 Peter 5:8.
   4. By what name is he called? 2 Cor. 4 : 3, 4 ;
John 14: 30 ; 12: 31 ,Note 1.
   5. What did the revelator see come down from
heaven? What did he have in his hand? What did
he do? How long was Satan bound? Rev. 20 : 1, 2.
Note -2.
   6. Where did the prophet see Satan confined? For
how long is his work of deception interrupted? At
the end of the one thousand years what takes place?
Verse 3. Note 3.
   7. What great event occurs at the coming of Christ?
1 Thess. 4: 16; John 5 : 28, 29.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     21
    8. Who only are raised at the second coming of
Christ? Rev. 20: 6.
    9. What change do the "blessed and holy" experi-
ence? 1 Cor. 15 : 51-54.
    10. Where are they next seen? Rev. 20 : 4. In what
work are they engaged? .,1 Cor. 6 : 2, 3. Note 4.
 -"Id. How are the wicked affected by the coming of
Jesus? 2 Thess. 2: 7-9.
    12. To what condition is the earth brought? Jer.
4: 23-27.
    13. What takes place at the close of the one thou-
sand years? Rev. 20 : 5, 6. Note 5.
    14. What descends from heaven at the end of the
one thousand years? Rev. 21 : 2.
    15. How does the resurrection of the wicked affect
Satan? Rev. 20: 7.
    16. What does he do 1 What is said of the number
of his subjects? Verse 8.
    17. Where do they go? How is the struggle ter-
minated? Verses 9, 10.
    18. For whom was this lake of .fire originally pre-
pared? Matt. 25: 41.
    19. How will this fire which consumes Satan, fallen
angels, and sinners, affect the earth? 2 Peter 3 : 10-13.
                              Notes
   1. When Satan sinned, he with all his sympathizers was cast
out of heaven to this earth. When man sinned, he lost his life,
and the dominion given him passed into the hands of Satan,
who became the ruler of this world. During all the centuries till
Jesus hung upon the cross, Satan kept his real purpose covered,
so that even the unfallen angels did not understand. But when
Jesus died on the cross, Satan was again cast down, and the, second
Adam became the rightful representative of this world.
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    "Satan saw that his disguise was torn away. His adminis-
tration was laid open before the unfallen angels and before the
heavenly universe. He had revealed himself as a murderer. By
shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had uprooted himself
from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. Henceforth his
work was restricted. Whatever attitude he might assume, he could
no longer await the angels as they came from the heavenly courts,
and before them accuse Christ's brethren of being clothed with
the garments of blackness and the defilement of sin. The last
link of sympathy between Satan and the heavenly world was
broken."—` 'Desire of Ages," page 761.
     z. The word here translateu " bottomless pit" is in the Re-
vised Version, Rotherham's translation, interlinear, etc., prop-
erly translated "abyss," meaning a place of darkness and deso-
lation. A like expression is rounu in the Septuagint (Greek
version) of uen. I:Z, where our English version says " deep."
•• Earliness was upon the race or the deep," is tue aescription of
the earth in its caaotie conuition. It uenotes the same here.
     3. lv o more fitting term than " abyss," or • • uottomless pit,"
could be found to uescribe the earth in its desolate conuition.
Here will be satan's home for a thousand years. All about him
he will see only failure and ruin.
     "Here is io be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a
thousand years. Here he will be confined, to wander up and down
over the broken surface of the earth, and see the enects of his
rebellion against God's law. For a thousand years he can enjoy
 the rruit or the curse which he has caused. Limited alone to the
 earth, he will not have the privilege of ranging to other planets,
 to tempt and annoy those who have not fallen."—``h arty Wri-
 tings," by h is. B. G. White, old edition, part 3, page 150; new
eaition, page 290.                                  •
     4. This judgment will not be to determine who are the right-
eous, for this has previously been determined, but it will consist
in apportioning the measure of punishment due to the lost. There
will be degrees in the reward of the lost (Mark 6:11), for all will
be rewarded according as their works have been. This work will
 bring to light the hidden things, and the justice and mercy of
God will be fully seen in all His dealings with the children of
men.
     5. The millennial period is located by events so great that
 there can be no mistaking tile time. ,It     marked at both its be-
ginning and its close by a resurrection,— the righteous dead at
 tne commencement, the wicked dead at the close. The millennium
 therefore begins at the second coming or the Lord. During the
thousand years the earth is entirely depopulated, and in a chaotic
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                     23
 condition. 'How absurd to claim that during this period there
 will be a' second probation!                           •
      But other scriptures state the same thing in other words. The
 scriptures show absolutely that when Christ comes, the living
,righteous are translated, and the righteous dead raised in the first
 resurrection,*and that the wicked are slain by the glory of His
 coming: so that Satan can not further deceive them. The time
 when they are beyond his power is plainly stated to be a thousand
 years. "And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall
 be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the na-
 tions," which is plainly to say that "the rest of the dead," the
 wicked, do live again when the thousand years are finished, just
 as verse 5 declares.
      The "Millennial Dawn" advocates seek to parry the force of
 this scripture by claiming that the words, ''But the rest of the
 dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished,"
 are spurious. But there is no authority for discrediting the
 genuineness' of the text. The English edition of the Revised
 Version makes no reference to this text as being "not found"
 in ancient Greek manuscripts. The American Revised Version,
 which is admitted by the ripest scholars in the land to be the
  best translation of the Holy Scriptures extant, does not give the
 slightest hint that a part of the text is omitted in the "most
 reliable Greek manuscripts." Rotherham's translation, another
 excellent work, though noting elsewhere "doubtful" renderings,
 says nothing about the text's being spurious. The Interlinear
  translation also puts this text on the same basis as other portions
 of the Holy Scriptures. It is found in Young's translation also,
 without any hint of its being some "marginal comment." Saw-
  yer's translation contains it, also the Twentieth Century New Tes-
  tament. In the translation from the Greek text of Von Tischenclorf
  it is found unquestioned. The Emphatic Diaglott, based on Gries-
  bach's text, gives this verse, and in a foot-note says: "These
  words ["the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
  years were finished "] were probably omitted by oversight in Vati-
  can manuscript [No. 11601, as they are found in A, B, C, though
  not in the Syriac." By "A" is meant Codex Alexandrines; by
  "B," Codex Vaticanus, No. 2066, of the seventh or eighth cen-
  tury; by "C," Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus. Neither Dr. Adam
  Clarke nor Bliss, in their comments on this scripture, offer any
  objection to its genuineness. Finally, the best Greek text, that
  of 1Vestcott and Hort, contains the passage, and neither have
   the Revised Versions or any of the critics, so far as we know,
   even questioned it. The revisers adopted for their revision the
   text "for which the evidence is decidedly preponderating," and
   when that differed from the Greek text " from which the Autbor-
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
ized Version was made," the rule was that "the alteration be
expressed in the margin." (See Preface to Revised New Testa-
ment, division 2, paragraph 4.) But there is not even an in-
dication of doubt over Rev. 20:5.


             LESSON VII — The Law of God
                  FEBRUARY 17, 1912
   LESSON HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," chapter 27; the
Sabbath School Worker.
    GENERAL NOTE.- The decalogue, spoken by the voice of God,
is a marvel in its comprehensiveness. In principle it comprehends
every wrong to . be avoided, every duty to be performed, every
sin to be shunned. It is an epitome of all moral truth, forbidding
all that is injurious, and enjoining all that is for the good of man.
It is a heaven-born- code, the principles of which are universal and
eternal, and binding upon all creatures of God's everlasting king-
dom.

   1. " There is a winsome picture of God in the preface to these
commandments. It is often omitted in copies in church build-
ings and elsewhere. That is always unfortunate. A warm per-
sonal positive precedes these negatives.  am' comes before 'thou
shalt not.' Let a man get a good glimpse of God, and he is
eager for suggestions on how not to lose that sight. The voice
out_ of the mount said, `I am the Lord thy God that brought they

  out;' and that wonderful midnight, that Red Sea victory, the
  sweetened waters, and the new daily food, gave fine coloring and
  glow to theowords as they fell upon these people's eager ears."—

      2. One of the interesting coincidences in the Bible is seen in
  this scripture. In Ex. 19:19 we are told that "Moses spake,"
  hut we are not informed what he said. Centuries later, however,
  the Holy Spirit tells us that though Moses had been forty days
  in the presence of God, he was so impressed by the omnipotent
  power and indescribable glory manifested, when to quailing hu-
  manity the Lord spoke the principles of His own perfection, that
  he said, "I exceedingly fear and quake."
      3. "So terrible were the tokens of Jehovah's presence that
  the hosts of Israel shook with fear, and fell upon their faces
  before the Lord. Even Moses exclaimed, 'I exceedingly fear and
 quake.'
      "And now the thunders ceased; the •trumpet was no longer
  heard; the earth was still. There was a period of solemn silence,
  and then the voice of God was heard. Speaking out of the thick
  darkness that enshrouded Him, as He stood upon the mount, sur-
  rounded by a retinue of angels, the Lord made known His law.
  Moses, describing the scene, says: 'The Lord came from Sinai,
  and rose up from Seir unto them; He shined forth from Mount
  Paran, and He came with ten thousands of saints; from His right
  hand went a fiery law for them. Yea, He loved the people;
 all His saints are in Thy hand; and they sat down at Thy feet;
  every one shall receive of Thy words,' "—"Patriarchs and
  Prophets," pages 304, 305.
      4. "It is inevitable that children should suffer from the con-
.sequences of parental wrong-doing, but they are not punished
 for the parents' guilt, except as they participate in their sins.
 It is usually the case, however, that children walk in the steps
 of their parents. By inheritance and example the sons become
 partakers of the father's sin. Wrong tendencies, perverted ap-
 petites, and debased morals, as well as physical disease and de-
 generacy, are transmitted as a legacy from father to son, to the
 third and fourth generation. This fearful truth should have a sol-
 emn power to restrain men from following a course of sin."—
 Id., page 306.
      5. "By the thoughtless mention of God in common conversa-
 tion, by appeals to Him in trivial matters, and by the frequent
 and thoughtless repetition of His name, we dishonor Him."—
 Id., pages 306, 307.
      6. "The fourth commandment is the only one of all the ten
 in which are found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver.
 Tt is the only one that shows by whose authority the law is
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     27
Thus it contains the seal of God, affixed to His law as evidence
of its authenticity and binding force."— Id., page 307.
    7. "The fifth commandment requires children not only to yield
respect, submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to
give them love and tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard
their reputation, and to succor and comfort them in old age.
It also enjoins respect for ministers and rulers, and for all others
to whom God has delegated authority."— Id., page 308.
    8. "An intention to deceive is what constitutes falsehood.
By a glance of the eye, a motion of the hand, an expression of the
countenance, a falsehood may be told as effectually as by words.
All intentional overstatement, every hint or insinuation calculated
to convey an erroneous or exaggerated impression, even the state-
ment of facts in such a manner as to mislead, is falsehood."—
Id., page 309.
   9. "The tenth commandment strikes at the very root of all
sins, prohibiting the selfish desire, from which springs the sinful
act. He who in obedience to God's law refrains from indulging
even a sinful desire for .that which belongs to another, will not be
guilty of an act or wrong toward his fellow creatures."—Id.,
page 309.

                             Notes
   1. The law of God is but an expression of the thought of God.
The following comparisons are of interest, showing that the deca-
logue is but a reflection of the character of its Author:
            CHRIST                           THE LAW
Christ is "truth."                 The law is "truth."
              John 14:6.                        Ps. 119:142.
Christ is "holy."                  The law is "holy."
              Acts 4:27.                        Rom. 7:12.
Christ is "perfect."               The law is "perfect."
              Heb. 5:9.                         Ps. 19:7.
Christ is "righteousness."         The law is "righteousness."
              1 Cor. 1:30.                      Ps. 119:172.
Christ is "light."                 The law is "light."
              John 8:12.                        Prov. 6:23.
Christ "abideth ever."             The law "stands fast forever."
              John 8:35.                        Ps. 111:7, 8.
Christ in the heart.               The law in the heart.
              Eph. 3:17.                        Heb. 8:10.
Freedom in Christ.                 Liberty in obeying the law.
              John 8:36.                        Ps. 119:45.
Rejecting Christ brings wrath.     Breaking the law brings wrath.
              John 3:36.                        Neh. 13:18.
To be judged by Christ's word.     To be judged by the law.
              John 12:48.                       James 2:12.
    2. As sin can only be imputed when there is law, and as sin
was imputed from the beginning, even in the Garden of Eden,
it follows therefore that all the law existed in principle from
the beginning. These principles have existed from eternity, and
angels and unfallen beings are subject to them.
    3. "I was also shown a sanctuary upon the earth containing
two apartments. It resembled the one in heaven, and I was told
that it was a figure of the heavenly. The furniture of the first
30          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
apartment of the earthly sanctuary was like that in the first
apartment of the heavenly. The veil was lifted, and I looked
into the holy of holies, and saw that the furniture was the same
as in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary. The priest
ministered in both apartments of the earthly. He went daily into
the first apartment, but entered the most holy only once a year, to
cleanse it from the sins which had been conveyed there. I saw tha
                                                               t
Jesus ministered in both apartments of the heavenly sanctuary."
—"Early Writings," Mrs. E. G. White, old edition, part 3, pages
115, 116; new edition, pages 252, 253.
   "It was represented to me that the remnant followed Jesus into
the most holy place, and beheld the ark and the mercy-seat, and
were captivated with their glory. Jesus then raised the cover of
the ark, and lo ! the tables of stone, with the ten commandments
written upon them. They trace down the lively oracles, but start
back with trembling when they see the fourth commandment among
the ten holy precepts, with a brighter light shining upon it than
upon the other nine, and a halo of glory all around it. They
find nothing there informing them that the Sabbath has been
abolished, or changed to the first day of the week."— Id., old
edition, part 3, pages 117, 118; new edition, page 255.

the Sabbath? Num. 15 : 32-36.
     12. What occurred to Jerusalem because God's
 people desecrated the Sabbath? Jer. 17 : 24-27.
   . 13. What promise was made to those who observed
 the Sabbath? Isa. 58 : 13, 14.
                            Notes
   1. "Because the Sabbath was made for man, it is the Lord's
day. It belongs to Christ. For 'all things were made by Him;
and without Him was not anything made that was made.' Since
He made all things, He made the Sabbath. By Him it was set ,
apart as a memorial of the work of creation. It points to Him
as both the Creator and the Sanctifier. It declares that He who
M'eated all things in heaven and in earth, and by whom all things
32          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 hold together, is the head of the church, and that by His power
 we are reconciled to God."—"Desire of Ages;" page as.
    2. The Sabbath is founded on the facts of creation: The
 Creator worked six days, rested on the seventh, then blessed and
 hallowed the seventh day. These facts are unchangeable; there-
 fore the Sabbath is unchangeable.
    3. The division of time into months and years is indicated by
nature. But not so with the week. This division is made only by
the Sabbath. The fact that there were recognized periods of seven
days, or a week, shows that the Sabbath was known and kept.
    "The week, another primeval measure, is not a natural measure
of time, as some astronomers and chronologers have supposed,
indicated by the phases or quarters of the moon. It was origi-
nated by divine appointment at the creation for man's physical
and spiritual well-being."—"Bliss's Sacred Chronology," page
6; "Hale's Chronology," volume 1, page 19.
    "Seven has been the ancient and honored number among the
nations of the earth. They have measured their time by weeks
from the beginning.' The original of this was the Sabbath of God,
as Moses has given the reasons of it in his writings."—"Brief
Dissertation on the Finit Three Chapters of Genesis," by Dr.
Coleman, page 26.
    4. There is no difference, or contradiction, between the reason
here assigned for observing the Sabbath, and the reason assigned
in the fourth commandment of the decalogue. Creation is an act
of God. 'The deliverance of Israel from Egypt was a manifesta-
tion of the same power as is seen in the creation of the world.
So is conversion. 2 Cor. 5:17. The Sabbath is a memorial of
God's power; and wherever there is seen a special manifestation
of His power, we are called upon to observe the Sabbath as a
remembrance of the creative power of God, and thus worship
and reverence the true God.

an ancient prophet Eze. 46 : 1. Note 1.

Compare Ex. 20: 8-11.
    10. What did they do on the first day of the week?
Luke 24: 1. Note 3.
    11. What was Paul's example in reference to the
Sabbath     Acts 13 : 14, 42-44 ; 16 : 13 ; 17 : 1, 2 ; 18 :
1-4, 11.

Note 5.
34          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   15.. What blessing is pronounced upon those whQ,
keep the Sabbath? Isa. 56 : 1, 2.
   16. What is said of the Sabbath in the new earth?
Isa. 66 : 22, 23.
                               Notes
     1. In this text the Sabbath is mentioned, and six other days
of the week, which are' called "working days." One of these
must be the fiist day of the week. The first day of the week is
therefore named by an inspired writer, not the Sabbath, or a rest
day, but a "working" day.
     2. That the apostles did not meet on this occasion to com-
memorate the resurrection is evident from •the fact that they did
not believe that Jesus was risen from the dead. They were simply
having an evening meal at their own home. See Acts 1:12, 13.
     3. Three days are here mentioned: (a) the preparation day;
(b) the Sabbath; (c) the first day of the week. No clearer
statement could be made that the first day of the week is not
the Sabbath.
     4. No sacred title is here applied to the first day of the week.
It was an evening meeting, held on what is now called Saturday
night. After restoring Eutychus to life, Paul continued the meet-
ing till break of day, and early, on what we would now call Sun-
day, left on foot for Assos to meet his companions who had
gone on by boat.
     5. The following comment on this text is of interest, and shows
that this scripture has no reference whatever to a public collec-
tion in the church:
     "The whole question turns upon the meaning of the ex-
pression, 'by him;' and I marvel greatly how you can imagine
that it means 'in the collection box of the congregation.' Green-
field, in his lexicon, translates the Greek term, with one's self,
t. e., at home.' rwo Latin versions, the Vulgate and that of Cas-
tellio, render it,` aped se,' with one's self; at home. Three French
translations, those of Martin, Osterwald, and De Sacy, chez soi,'
at his own house; at home. CThe German of Luther, 'bet sich
selbt,' by himself; at homey The Dutch, by heinselven,' same
as the German. The Italian of Diodati, 'appresso di se,' in his
own presence; at home. The Spanish of Felippe Scio, 'en su casa,'
in his own house. The Portuguese. of Ferreira, 'para isso,' with
himself. The Swedish, ncer sig self,' near himself."—" Vindi-
cation of the True Sabbath," third edition, pages 51, 52.

                              Notes
    1. The three kingdoms which were plucked up by this power
were the Heruli, under Odoacer, the Vandals, and the Ostrogoths.
See "Elliott's Horce Apocalyptiew, third edition, volume 3, page
141, note 1.
    Surely no better symbol of the papacy could have been chosen
than this. Eyes, keen, intelligent, and cunning, like the eyes of
a man, a mouth pouring forth blasphemy. This foreshadows with
remarkable accuracy the shrewd, deceptive working of the man
of sin.
    2. The exceedingly wicked and arrogant character of this
power is set forth in the words, "He shall speak great words
against the Most High."
    "Hear Felinus: The pope sustains Christ's lieutenantship,
not only over things in heaven, over things in earth, and over
things in hell, but also over the angels, both the good and bad.'
Hear Antoninus, the archbishop of Florence: 'The pope's power
is greater than all other created power, in some sense reaching
unto things in heaven, things in. earth, and things in hell; so that
of that power the words may be verified which are written by
the prophet David, "Thou hast put all things under His feet." '
Hear the voice of the Lateran councils: 'All power is given to
thee [the pope] in heaven and in earth!' Hear the decretals
from popes themselves: 'It is idolatry to disobey his command.'
`We, who, according to the plenitude of our power, have right to
dispense above law or right." We declare, say, define, pronounce
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    37
it to be necessary to salvation for every human creature to be
subject to the Roman pontiff.' And, finally, hear Cardinal Bel- •
larmine himself : 'If the pope should err by enjoining vices or for-
bidding virtues, the church should be bound to believe the vices
to be good and the virtues to be evil, unless it would sin against
conscience.' Great God! how are here Thy titles, Thy preroga-
tives, wrested from Thee by this arch-apostasy! How is here Thy
dominion universal usurped! Thy homage stolen! Thy moral
government challenged! "—"Bontanism and Anglo-Catholicism,"-
J. Sortain, A.B., London, 1841, pages 84-87. '
     The persecuting character of this power is foreshadowed in the
Words "and shall wear out the saints of the Most High." "Under
these 'bloody maxims [already cited at considerable length] those
persecutions were carried on, from the eleventh and twelfth cen-
turies almost to the present day, which stand out on the page of
history. After the signal of open martyrdom had been given in
the canons of Orleans, there followed the extirpation of the Al-
bigenses, under the form of a crusade, the establishment of the
Inquisition, the cruel attempts to extinguish the Waldenses, the
martyrdoms of the Lollards, the cruel wars to exterminate the
Bohemians, the burning of Huss and Jerome, and multitudes of
other confessors, before the Reformation; and afterward, the
ferocious cruelties practised in the Netherlands, the martyrdoms
of Queen Mary's reign, the extinction, by fire and sword, of the
Reformation in Spain and Italy, by fraud and openCpersecution in
Poland, the massacre of Bartholomew, the'Jpersecutions of the
Huguenots by the League, the extirpation ofthe :Vaudois, and all
 the cruelties and perjuries connected with the revocation of the
edict of Nantes. These are the more open and conspicuous facts
 which explain the prophecy, besides the slow and secret murders
of the holy tribunal of the Inquisition."—"The First Two Visions
of Daniel," T. B. Birks, London, 1845, pages 248, 249.
     3. The commandments of God as found in "Bellarmine's Dot-
 trina Christiana Breve; or Short Christian Doctrine," pages 23,
24, which was printed at Rome in 1836, "con licenza de superiori,"
 and is here translated from the original Italian, will be of in-
 terest:
     "Repeat the ten commandments.
     "1. I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have none other god
 before Me.
     "2. Thou shalt not take the name of God in vain.
     "3. Remember to keep holy the festivals.
     "4. Honor thy father and thy mother.
     "5. Do not kill.
     "6. Do not commit adultery.
     "7. Do not steal.
38          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    "8. Do not bear false witness.
    "9. Do not covet thy neighbor's wife.
    "10. Do not covet thy neighbor's goods."
    "It is a poor apology for this expurgation of the decalogue,
that it is not so done in the Douay Bible: for when these cate-
chisms were introduced, and even yet in most Catholic countries,
not one layman in a thousand ever read that Bible; the catechism
intended for universal consumption cantained all his knowledge
of God's law. What myriads, then, through this fraud, must
have lived and died in the belief that the second commandment
was no part of God's law! It is clearly proved, that the pastors
of the church have struck out one of God's ten WORDS; which
not only in the Old Testament, but in all revelation, are the most
emphatically regarded as the synopsis of all religion and moral-
ity."— Alexander Campbell in "Campbell and Purcell Debate,"
page 214.
    4. "The following instruction on the third [fourth] command-
ment is taken from 'A New Catechism of Christian Doctrine
and Practise,' by the Rt. Rev. James Bellord, D.D., Titular Bishop
of Milevis; the authorized .American edition with the imprint
'Ave Maria, Notre Dame, Ind.,' 1907:
    " 'What day was the Sabbath?
    " 'The seventh day; our Saturday.
     " 'Do you keep the Sabbath?
     " 'No: we keep the Lord's day.
     "'Which is that?
     " 'The first day: Sunday.
     " 'Who changed it?
     " 'The Catholic Church.' "
     "Is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday, to ab-
 stain on that clay from unnecessary servile work/ Is not the
 observance of this law among' the most prominent of our sacred
 duties? But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation,
 and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification
 of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of. Sat-
 urday, a day which we never sanctify."—"The Faith of Our
 Fathers," by Cardinal Gibbons, Baltimore, John Murphy 4 Co.,
1893, page 111.
     5. The first recorded law for Sunday observance was enacted
 by the emperor Constantine, A.D. 321. The law reads as follows:
 "Let all the judges and townpeople and the occupation of all
 trades rest on the venerable day of the sun• but let those who are
 situated in the country freely and at full' liberty attend to the
 business of agriculture; because it often happens that no other
 day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines; lest the critical
 moment being let slip, men should lose the commodities granted
 by Heaven."

   15. What blessing is pronounced for obedience?
Prov. 13 : 13.
                                Notes
    1. The Lord blessed Abraham that he might be a blessing.
For a like reason He blessed the Sabbath day, that it might be
a blessing to man. The blessing of God placed on the Sabbath
is just as real as the blessing which He gives to man. But in order
for us to enjoy this blessing, it is necessary that we observe, as
He has directed, the day He blessed.
    2. We are to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
Throughout the week we are so to plan our secular affairs that,
when the Sabbath comes to us, we will be ready to receive it, and
not desecrate its sanctity because of our forgetfulness. In this
sense the fourth commandment, like the other nine, is connected '
with all the transactions of life during the entire seven days of the
week.
    3. The divine Sabbath law commands that man's work shall
be done in the "six working days" (Eze. 46:1). The first hour
of the Sabbath is as holy as any other hour; and when the Sab-
bath day begins, our work should end and the Lord's work should
be done. Many are so burdened with the "cares of this life"
that they frequently violate the sanctity of the Sabbath at its
beginning and at its close in order to do their own work. Those
who do this grieve the Spirit, and fail of receiving the full bless-
ing of Sabbath-keeping.
     There is no more fitting way to begin the Sabbath than, as
its sacred hour draws near, to assemble the family, and, after
singing and reading God's blessed word, engage in a season
of prayer, invoking pardon for sin, and asking for a Sabbath
blessing. Then as its closing moments draw nigh, offer a prayer
of thanksgiving, and ask for strength for the coming week.
    4. "When the Sabbath commences we should place a guard
upon ourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by
appropriating to our own use that time which is strictly the Lord's.
We should not do ourselves, nor suffer our children to do, any
              SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      41
   manner of our own work for a livelihood, or anything which could
   have been done on the six working clays. Friday is. the clay of
   preparation. Time can then be devoted to making the necessary
   preparation for the Sabbath, and to thinking and conversing about
  it. Nothing which will in the sight of Heaven be regarded as a
   violation of the holy Sabbath should be left unsaid or undone, to
   be said or done upon the Sabbath. God requires not only that we
   refrain from physical labor upon the Sabbath, but that the mind
   be disciplined to dwell upon sacred themes. The fourth command-
   ment is virtually transgressed by conversing upon worldly things,
   or by engaging in light and trifling conversation. Talking upon
   anything or everything which may come into the mind, is speak-
   ing our own words. Every deviation from right brings us into
   bondage and condemnation."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
   volume 2, pages 702, 703.
        5. We are not to do our own ways, or our own pleasure, or
   speak our own words on the Sabbath. To think and plan regard-
   ing secular business on the Sabbath, or permit our mind to dwell
   on things pertaining to worldly pleasure, is a violation of the
   Sabbath. The fourth commandment, like the other precepts, covers
   the thoughts and intents of the heart; and when the Sabbath
   begins there should be a cessation, not simply of secular labor,
 ; but of secular thoughts as well.
       6. By tradition the Sabbath had been made a yoke of bond-
( Age. The Author of the Sabbath swept away their traditions,
   and taught the people true Sabbath-keeping./The following from
   Edersheim gives a few of the many traditions with which the
  Fharisees had surrounded the Sabbath till its true object was lost:
       "Next, certain regulations are laid down to guide the Jew
   when dressing on the Sabbath morning, so as to prevent his
   breaking its rest. Hence he must be careful not to put on any
   dress which might become burdensome, nor to wear any orna-
   ment which he might put off and carry in his hand, for this
   would be a 'burden.' A woman must not wear such head-gear
   as would require unloosing before taking a bath, nor go out with
   such ornaments as could be taken off in the street, such as
   a frontlet, unless it is attached to the cap, nor with a gold crown,
   nor with a necklace or nose-ring, nor with rings, nor have
   a pin in her dress. The reason for this prohibition of ornaments
   was, that in their vanity women might take them off to show them
    to their companions, and then, forgetful of the day, carry them,
    which would be a 'burden.' Women are also forbidden to look
   in the glass on the Sabbath, because they might discover a white
   hair and attempt to pull it out, which would be a grievous sin;
   but men ought not to use looking-glasses even on week days, be-
    cause this was undignified. A woman may walk about her own
    court, but not in the street, with false hair."
42         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    "A plaster might be worn, provided its object was to prevent
the wound getting worse, not to heal it, for that would have been
a work. Ornaments which could not easily be taken off might be
worn in one's courtyard. Similarly, a person might go about with
wadding in his ear, but not with false teeth nor with a gold plug
in the tooth. If the wadding fell out of the ear, it could not be
replaced."
    "If a woman were to roll wheat to take away the husks, she
would be guilty of sifting with a sieve. If she were rubbing the
ends of the stalks, she would be guilty of threshing. If she were
cleaning what adheres to the side of a stalk, she would be guilty
of sifting. If she were bruising the stalk, she would be guilty
of grinding. If she were throwing it up in her hands, she would
be guilty of winnowing. Distinctions like the following are made:
A radish may be dipped into salt, but not left in it too long,
since this would be to make pickle. A new dress might be put on,
irrespective of the danger that in so doing it might be torn.
Mud on the dress might be crushed in the hand and shaken' off,
but the dress might not be rubbed (for fear of affecting the ma-
terial). If a person took a bath, opinions are divided, whether
the whole body should be dried at once, or limb after limb. If
water had fallen on the dress, some allowed the dress to be
shaken but not wrung; others, to be wrung but not shaken."—
Edersheim: "The Life and Times of Jesus," pages 781-783.
