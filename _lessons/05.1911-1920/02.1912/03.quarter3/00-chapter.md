                              Notes

   1. "Has the reader ever paid a visit to the astonishing organist
who so charmingly elicits the tourist's tears in the cathedral at
Freiburg, as he touches one after another his wondrous keys, and
greets your ear by turns with the march of warriors on the river-
side, the voice of prayer sent up from the lake during the fury of
the storm, or of thanksgiving when it is hushed to rest? All your
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         5
senses are electrified, for you seem to have seen all, and to have
heard all. Well, then, it was thus that the Lord God, mighty in
harmony, applied, as it were, the finger of His Spirit to the stops
which He had chosen for the hour of His purpose,"and for the
unity of His celestial hymn. He had from eternity before Him
all the human stops which He required; His Creator's eye em-
braces at a glance this range of keys stretching over threescore
centuries; and when He would make known to our fallen world
the everlasting counsel of His redemption, and the coming of the
Son of God, he put His left hand on Enoch, the seventh man from
 Adam, and His right on John, the humble and sublime prisoner
of Patmos. The celestial anthem, seven hundred years before the
 flood, began with these words: 'Behold, the Lord cometh with ten
 thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all;' but al-
 ready, in the mind of God, and in the eternal harmony of His—
 work, the voice of John had answered to that of Enoch, and closed
 the hymn, three thousand years after him, with these words: 'Be-
 hold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and
 they also which pierced Him. Even so, Lord Jesus, come quickly.
 Amen!' And during this hymn of thirty centuries, the Spirit of
 God never ceased to breathe in all His messengers; the angels, an
 apostle tells us, desired to look into its wondrous depths. God's
 elect were moved, and life eternal came down into the souls of
 men.       "The Plenary Inspiration ot the Holy Scriptures," by
  L. Gaussen, pages 51, 52.
      2. " The difficulties of Scripture have been urged by skeptics
 as an argument against the Bible; but so far from this, they con-
  stitute a strong evidence of its divine inspiration. If it contained
  no account of God but that which we could easily comprehend; if
  His greatness and majesty could be grasped by finite minds, then
  the Bible would not bear the unmistakable credentials of divine
  authority. The very grandeur and mystery of the themes pre-
  sented, should inspire faith in it as the word of God.
      " The Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity and a perfect
  adaptation to the needs and longings of the human heart, that
  has astonished and charmed the most highly cultivated minds, while
  it enables the humble and uncultured to discern the way of salva-
  tion. And yet these simply stated truths lay hold upon subjects
  so elevated, so far-reaching, so infinitely beyond the power of
  human comprehension, that we can accept them only because God
  has declared them. Thus, the plan of redemption is laid open to
   us, so that every soul -may see the steps he is to take in repentance
   toward God, and faith toward -our Lord Jesus Christ, in order
   to be saved in God's appointed way; yet beneath these truths, so
   easily understood, lie mysteries which are the hiding of His glory,
   — mysteries which overpower the mind in its research, yet inspire
6            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 the sincere seeker for truth with reverence and faith. The more
 he searches the Bible, the deeper is his conviction that it is the
word of the living God, and human reason bows before the majesty
of divine revelation." `Testimonies for the Church," volume
5, page 700.
    3. "After trying other books, if you experience religious long-
ings, open the Bible; listen to it. Sometimes you find here the
songs of angels, but of angels that have come down among the
children of Adam. Here is the deep-sounding organ of the Most
High, but an organ that serves to soothe man's heart and to
rouse his conscience, alike in shepherd's cots and in palaces; alike
in the poor man's garrets and in the tents of the desert. The
Bible, in fact, has lessons for all conditions; it brings upon the
scene both the lowly and the great; it reveals equally to both the
love of God, and unveils in both the same miseries. It addresses
itself to children; and it is often children that show us there the
way to heaven and the great things of Jehovah. It addresses
itself to shepherds and herdsmen; and it is often shepherds and
herdsmen that lift up their voices there, and reveal to us the
character of God. It speaks to kings and to scribes; and it is
often kings and scribes that .teach us there man's wretchedness,
humiliation, confession, and prayer. Domestic scenes, confessions
of conscience, pourings forth of prayer in secret, travels, proVerbs,
revelations of the depths of the heart, the holy courses pursued by
a child of God, weaknesses unveiled, falls, recoveries, inward ex-
periences, parables, familiar letters, theological treatises, sacred
commentaries on some ancient scripture, national chronicles, mil-
itary annals, political statistics, descriptions of God, portraits of
angels, celestial visions, practical counsels, rules of life, solutions
of cases of conscience, judgments of the Lord, sacred hymns,
predictions of future events, narratives of what passed during
the days preceding our creation, sublime odes, inimitable pieces' of
poetry; — all this is found there by turns; and all this meets
our view in most delightful variety, and presenting a whole whose
majesty, like that of a temple, is overpowering. Thus it ,is, that,
from its first to its last page, the Bible behooved to combine with
its majestic unity the indefinable charm of human-like instruc-
tion, familiar, sympathetic, personal, and the charm of a drama
extending over forty centuries. In the Bible of Desmarets, it is
said, There are fords here for lambs, and there are deep waters
where elephants swim.' "—"The Plenary Inspiration of the Holy
Scriptures," by L. Gaussen, pages 55, 56.
    4. "Who does not tremble, after following with his eyes the
Son of man as He commands the elements, stills the storms, and
opens the graves, while, filled with so profound a respect for the
sacred volume, He declares that He is one day to judge by that
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      7

book the quick and the dead' Who does not shudder, whose heart
does not bleed, when, after observing this, we venture to step
into a Rationalist academy, and see the professor's chair occupied
by a poor mortal, learned, miserable, a sinner, responsible, yet
handling God's word irreverently; when we follow him as he goes
through this deplorable task before a body of youths, destined
to be the guides of a whole people — youths capable of doing so
much good if guided to the heights of the faith, and so much
mischief if tutored in disrespect for those Scriptures which they
are one day to preach I With what peremptory decision do such
men display the phantasmagoria of their hypotheses; they re-
trench, they add, they praise, they blame, and pity the simplicity
which, reading the Bible as it was read y Jesus Christ, like Him
clings to every syllable, and never dreams of finding error in the
word of God! They pronounce on the intercalations and retrench-
ments that Holy Scripture must have undergone — intercalations
and retrenchments never suspected by Jesus Christ; they lop off
the chapters they do not understand, and point out blunders, ill-
sustained or ill-concluded reasonings, prejudices, imprudences, and
instances of vulgar ignorance.
    "May God forgive my being compelled to put this frightful
dilemma into words, but the alternative is inevitable! Either
Jesus Christ exaggerated and spoke incoherently when He quoted
the Scriptures thus, or these rash, wicked men unwittingly blas-
pheme their divine majesty."— Id., pages 94, 95.

             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    9

                             Notes
    1. "The messenger whom God sent assured him that his
prayer was accepted, and also his 'alms.' Do we sufficiently
notice how the Bible connects almsgiving with prayer, and how
little reason the Bible gives us to hope that God will hear our
prayers if we do not hear the cry of the needy, This pious
centurion's prayers were not hindered by stinginess. 'His
prayers and his alms were had in remembrance in the sight of
God.' "—"Half Hours with the Lessons of 1883," page 168.
     2. No doubt as the Son of God prayed there was a pathos, an
earnestness, a communing with His Father as with a friend,
that deeply impressed the disciples. They longed to approach
into the presence of God like that. They, therefore, requested
that He teach them to pray. In response to their request, He re-
peated the same prayer which on a previous occasion, in the ser-
mon on the mount, He had given to the multitude.
     3. "In calling God our Father, we recognize all His children-
as our brethren. We are all a part of the great web of humanity,
all members of one family. In our petitions, we are to include
 our neighbors as well a s ourselves. No one prays aright who seeks
a blessing for himself alone."—"Thoughts from the Mount of
Blessing."
    4. The manna in the wilderness fell daily, and the people were
to go out and gather a certain portion each day. This taught them
the lesson of trusting the Lord each day for what they needed.
So in the Lord's prayer we are to come to Him each day and ask
Him to supply our needs. As He is our Father, we have the as-
surance that He will do this.
    "He who lightened the cares and anxieties of His widowed
mother, and helped her to provide for the household at Nazareth,
sympathizes with every mother in her struggle to provide her chil-
dren food. He who had compassion on the multitude because they
`fainted, and were scattered abroad,' still has compassion on the
suffering poor. His hand is stretched out toward them in bless-
ing; and in the very prayer which He gave His disciples He
teaches us to remember the poor."—"Thoughts from the Mount
of Blessing."
   5. "He who is unforgiving, cuts off every channel through
which alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not think
that unless those who have injured us confess the wrong, we are
justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. It is their
part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and confes-
sion; but we are to have a spirit of compassion toward those who
have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess their
faults. However sorely, they may have wounded us, we are not
.10        SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

to cherish our grievances, and sympathize with ourselves over our
injuries; but as we hope to be pardoned for our or‘mses against
God, we are to pardon all who have done evil to us."—Id.

                               Notes
   1. In heaven the angels gather around the throne of God at
set times for worship. Concerning the fall of Satan, we read:
    "The hour for joyful, happy songs of praise to God and His
dear Son had come. Satan had led the heavenly choir. He had
raised the first note, then all the angelic host united with him, and
glorious strains of music had resounded through heaven in honor
of God and His clear Son. But now, instead of strains of sweet-
est music, discord and angry wordslla upon the ear of the great
rebel leader. Where was he/ Was it not all a horrible dream/
Was he shut out of heaven/ Were the gates of heaven nevermore
12          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

to open and admit him? The hour of worship draws nigh, when
bright and holy angels bow before the Father. No more will he
unite in heavenly song."—" Spirit of Prophecy," volume 1,
page 28.
    "In the morning the Christian's first thoughts should be upon
God. Worldly labor and self-interest should be secondary. Chil-
dren should be taught to respect and reverence the hour of prayer.
Before leaving the house for labor, all the family should be called
together, and the father, or the mother in the father's absence,
should plead fervently with God to keep them through the day.
Come in humility, with a heart full of tenderness, and with a
sense of the temptations and dangers before yourselves and your
children; by faith bind them upon the altar, entreating for them
the care of the Lord. Ministering angels will guard children
who are thus dedicated to God. It is the duty of Christian par-
ents, morning and evening, by earnest prayer and persevering
faith, to make a hedge about their children. They should patiently
instruct them,— kindly and untiringly teach them how to live
in order to please God."—" Testimonies for the Church," volume
1, pages 397, 398.
    2. "We should pray in the family circle; and above all we
must not neglect secret prayer; for this is the life of the soul.
It is impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is neglected.
Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. In solitude let
the soul be laid open to the inspecting eye of God. Secret prayer
is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God.j No curious ear is
to receive the burden of such petitions. In secret prayer the soul
is free from surrounding influences, free from excitement. Calmly,
yet fervently, will it reach out after God. Sweet and abiding
will be the influence emanating from Him who seeth in secret,
whose ear is open to hear the prayer arising from the heart. By
calm, simple faith, the soul holds communion with God, and gathers
to itself rays of divine light to strengthen and sustain it in the
conflict with Satan. God is our tower of strength."—" Steps to
Christ," pages 102, 103.
    3. " 'And David said, 0 Lord, 1 pray Thee, turn the counsel
of Ahithophel into foolishness.' Upon reaching the top of the
mount, the king bowed in prayer, casting upon God the burden of
his soul, and humbly supplicating divine mercy. His prayer seemed
to be at once answered. Hushai the Archite, a wise and able
counselor, who had proved himself a faithful friend to David, now
came to him with his robes rent, and with earth upon his head, to
cast in his fortunes with the dethroned and fugitive king. David
saw, as by divine enlightenment, that this man, faithful and true-
hearted, was the one needed to serve the interests of the king in
the councils at the capital. At David's request, Hushai returned
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                13
to Jerusalem to offer his services to Absalom, and defeat the
crafty counsel of Ahithophel."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
page 735.

                              Notes
   1. "We never need to distrust God. The just Judge repulses
no one who comes to Him in contrition. He has more pleasure in
His church, struggling with temptations here below, than in the
imposing host of angels that surround His throne. Not one sin-
cere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial choir, God
hears the cries of the weakest human being."-Mrs. E. G. White,
in "Signs of the Times," September 15, 1898.
    2. The story of the invasion of Sennacherib, his defiance of
God, and the miraculous destruction of his army, contains one of
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     15
the most wonderful deliverances of God's people in answer to
prayer, recorded in the Bible. No effort is made in the lesson to
cover every detail, the one object being to strengthen faith in
God by getting before our minds how, in answer to the prayer
of His servant, the Lord sent deliverance to His people. We, too,
are engaged in a warfare. Foes within us and enemies without
at times threaten the overthrow of the cause and work of God;
but now, as in the days of Hezekiah, God will not leave His peo-
ple, but in answer to their earnest petitions will send help.
    3. "Having utterly overthrown Merodach-baladan, Sennacherib
turned fiercely upon his rebellious provinces in the west. Sidon at
once surrendered before his impetuous onset. All Syria was
terrorized and submitted. The allies from Egypt, marching north-
ward, were defeated. Ekron fell, and its chief men were impaled
on stakes. Turning then against his chief enemy, Sennacherib
captured in swift succession forty-six of the fortified cities of
Judah. He was rapidly approaching Jerusalem. 'Signs of the
Assyrian advance were given in the sky, and night after night
the watchers on Mount Zion, seeing the glare in the west, must
have speculated which of the cities of Judah was being burned.
Clouds of smoke across the heavens, from prairie and forest fires,
told how war, even if it passed, would leave a trail of famine;
and men thought with breaking hearts of the villages and fields,
heritage of the tribes of old, that were now bare to the foot and
the fire of the foreigner. Then came touch of the enemy, the ap-
pearance of armed bands, vistas down Jerusalem's favorite valleys
of chariots, squadrons of horsemen emerging upon the plateaus
to nortk and west of the city, heavy siege-towers and swarms of
men innumerable.' "— George Adam Smith, quoted in Peloubet's
Notes, 1905,Tage 195.
    4. " Terrified- at Sennacherib's approach, Hezekiah had raised
the enormous tribute of three hundred talents of silver (about
$600,000, equal in purchasing value to six million dollars to-day).
He stripped the temple of its gold, and sent it to the Assyrian
monarch, whose headquarters were at Lachish, about thirty-four
miles southwest of J erusalem. The tribute was accepted, but the
i9araders pressed on."—Id`.
   Of We should not fail to note that when Israel was involved
in a terrible crisis, Hezekiah sent to the prophet of God to inquire
if he' had any instruction for them. And the Lord had not for-
gotten His people; He sent them a message of hope.
   9. What a splendid example is here presented before us by
Hezekiah! He took the threatening letter of the king, and "spread
it before the Lord." When in trouble and almost overwhelmed
with difficulty we too can obtain help by bringing it to the Lord,
and earnestly seeking Him for help.

                              Notes
    1. Much that is called faith is a mere belief founded on the
opinions and assumptions of men. The "devils also believe, and
tremble" • (James 2:19), but this is not faith. Real faith is
founded upon the eternal rock of Scripture. To those who be-
lieve, the word of Jehovah is the end of all controversy.
     2. " The ship • that rides at anchor experiences rackings and
heavings 'that snips which drift with the tide do not know. ho
souls wuo have no hold of Christ seem to lie softer on the surface
of a heaving world than souls that are anchored in Ills power
and love. 'tile drifting ship, before she strikes, is more smooth
and more comfortable than the anchored one; but when sue
strikes, rue smoothness is all over. The pleasures of sin are
sweet to those who taste them; but the sweetness is only for a
season.
       When the anchor has been cast into a good ground, the
heavier the strain that comes on it, the deeper and firmer grows
its hold. As winds and currents increase in volume, the anchor
 bites more deeply into the soil, and so increases its preserving
power. It is thus with a trusting soul; temptations, instead or
uriving him away from his Saviour, only fix his affections firmer
18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

on the Rock of Ages."—" The Sermon Bible," volume 11,
page 319.
    3. Faith is not speculation. It does not guess its way through.
Faith knows. We understand by faith. It is folly to claim,
as some do, that they will not believe that which they do not under-
stand. Faith precedes understanding. All the infidel ideas ad-
vanced concerning the stupendous work of creation are set forth
simply because what God says in His word concerning creation
is not believed. Faith believes things beyond the power. of human-
understanding.
    4. Rotherham's translation of 1 John 5:4 'reads, "And this
is the conquest that conquers the world, even our faith." The
Bible abounds with examples showing how unwavering faith in
the words of Jehovah has brought victory to God's people in the
past. And the Lord is the same to-day as in the past. Heb. 13:8.
    5. Righteousness is the gift of God (Rom. 5:17), as is eter-
nal life Atom. 6:23), and the two are so inseparable that one
involves tue other. Both these gifts, as all others, are received
by believing. During the time ox probation, life is continued to
the impenitent in order to give them the opportunity to repent;
but after probation closes, the coming of the Lord, will be at-
tended by such a manifestation of glory as will destroy those
who have not been living the life of faith in Christ. 2 Thess.
1:7-10. Those however who have become sons of God by believ-
ing (John 1:12), and have learned how to lay hold upon eternal
lire (1 'tiro. 6:19), will not perish with the wicked in the day of
Christ's appearing, but will continue to live by their faith.
    6. • •Poetry and eloquence for long centuries have delighted in
proclaiming tue glory of the brave Leonidas and the three bun-
ared Spartans, whose heroic valor and death-defying patriotism
made tne pass of Thermopylae a shrine and an altar for Greece.
Their equals in courage and patriotism, and their superiors in
faith, were Gideon and the immortal three hundred who remained
on mount Gilboa while their comrades bade them farewell and
marched to their homes. It was no ordinary daring they displayed
when, armed with pitchers and trumpets, they went forth to meet
the multitudes of their foes. It was the boldness of faith in
the divine word. 'One, with God on his side,' said the old Ger-
man Reformers, 'is a majority.' Thus the three hundred out-
numbeied the hosts of Miclian, for God was with them. It is
grand to stand with God's minorities. Better be with them than
the myriada of His enemies. Better be with them than with the
large majority of cowardly, half-hearted Christians whom lie
can not use."—"Half Hours with the Lessons of 1883," page 8'4U.
    7. " The sleeping army was suddenly aroused. Upon every
aide was glean the light of the flaming torches. in every direction
           SAMIATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    19
was heard the sound of trumpets, with the cry of the assailants.
Believing themselves at the mercy of an overwhelming force, the
Midianites were panic-stricken. With wild cries of alarm they
fled for life, and mistaking their own companions for enemies,
they slew one another. As news of the victory spread. thousands
of the men of Israel who had been dismissed to their homes
returned, and joined in pursuit of their fleeing enemies. . . .
    "In this signal defeat, not less than one hundred and twenty
thousand of the invaders perished. The power of the Midianites
was broken, so that they were never again able to make war upon
Israel. The tidings spread swiftly far and wide, that Israel's
God had again fought for. His people. No words can describe the
terror of the surrounding nations when they learned what simple
means had prevailed against the power of a bold, warlike people."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 550, 553.
     8. The gospel commission lasts until the end. The promises
of these mighty workings of the Holy Spirit for those who believe
are for,,us to-day as well as for the apostles. The fact that so
little power is seen among God's people at the present time is sad
evidence of the lack of real faith and trust in the promises of
God.

                             Notes
    1. Justification from sin is not merely the granting of pardon,
or forgiVeness. You may pardon a transgression, but not justify
the offender. Justification from sin includes all this, and more.
It is the accounting just, or righteous, before God of those who
are unrighteous. It is a judicial act by which the innocence of
the person is fully established. It is even more than this. "It
is not only forgiveness for sins, but reclaiming from sin." It
constitutes a change of standing before God, from a condition
of guilt and condemnation to one of perfect and complete right-
eousness. It is a removal of all guilt, a justification from all
sin and uncleanness. It includes complete remission of every sin,
and an imputation of the righteousness of Jesus Christ to the
penitent believer, so that we stand in the presence of the holy
God free from all unrighteousness. This is an act of God alone.
He and He alone is the one who justifies. Nothing that man can
do can in any way justify a wrong committed. We are justified
by faith, and not by works. The sinner believes, and God sup-
plies the fact. ,
     "In like nianner you are a sinner. You can not atone for
your past sins, you can not change your heart, and make your-
self holy. But God promises to do all this for you through Christ.
You believe that promise, you confess your sins, and give your-
self to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you do
 this, God will fulfil His word to you. If you believe the promise,
 — believe that you are forgiven and cleansed,— God supplies the
  fact; you are made whole, just as Christ gave the paralytic power
 to walk when the man believed that he was healed. It is so if
 you believe it.            to Christ," page 55.
     2. "-‘ And he believed in the Lord.' Neither Greek nor Ger-
 man, much less Latin or English, can futnish any full equivalent
 to the meaning of these words. He was supported, he was built
 up, he reposed as a child in its mother's arms (such seems the
 force of the Hebrew word), in the strength of God, in God,
 whom he did not see, more than in the giant empires of earth,
 and the bright lights of heaven, or the claims of tribe and kin-
 dred, which were always before him."— Stanley.   g
     3. " True confession is always of a specificcharacter, and ac-
 knowledges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to
  be brought before God only; they may be wrongs that should be
  confessed to individuals who have suffered injury through them;
  or they may be of a public character, and should then be as
  publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite and to
  the point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty. .
      "Confession will not be acceptable. to God without sincere

repentance and reformation. There must be decided changes in
the life; everything offensive to God must be put away."—"Steps

afflicted and oppressed? Matt. 11: 28-30.
                             Notes
    1. " Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing." The faith
which brings an answer to our prayers must be based, not on our
supposed needs, but on a statement in the word of God where the
thing for which we ask is promised to us. The Lord has not
pleuged Himself to answer every request we may make, but He
uas promised to fulfil His own word. We must therefore study
the scriptures, know what God has promised and the conditions
upon which the promise is based, and then ask in faith.
    2. " The omnipotent power of the Holy Spirit is the defense
of every contrite soul. Not one that in penitence and faith has
claimed His protection will Christ permit to pass under the
enemy's power. The Saviour is by the side of his tempted and
tried ones. With Him there can be no such thing as failure loss,
impossibility, or defeat; we can do all things through Jilin; who
strengthens us. When temptations and trials come, do not wait
to adjust all the difficulties, but look to Jesus, your helper.
    " There are Christians who think and speak altogether too
much about the power of Satan. They think of their adversary,
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

they pray about him, they talk about him, and he looms up greater
and greater in their imagination. It is true that Satan is a
powerful being; but thank God, we have a mighty Saviour, who
cast out the evil one from heaven. Satan is pleased when we
magnify his power. Why not talk of Jesus'? Why not magnify
His power and His love I"—"Desire of Ages," pages 490, 493.
   3. "The wondering crowd that pressed close about Christ real-
ized no accession of vital power. But when the suffering woman
put forth her hand to touch Him, believing that she would be
made whole, she felt the healing virtue. So in spiritual things.
To talk of religion in a casual way, to pray without soul-hunger
and living faith, avails nothing. A nominal faith in Christ,
which accepts Him merely as the Saviour of the world, can never
bring healing to the soul."—Id., page 347.
   4. " The work of Christ in cleansing the leper from his terrible
disease is an illustration of His work in cleansing the soul from
sin. The man who came to Jesus was full of leprosy.' Its
deadly poison permeated his whole body. The disciples sought to
prevent their Master from touching him; for he who touched a
leper became himself unclean. But in laying His hand upon the
leper, Jesus received no defilement. His touch imparted life-giv-
ing power. The leprosy was cleansed. Thus it is with the leprosy
of sin,— deep-rooted, deadly, and impossible to be cleansed by
human power. . . . But Jesus, coming to dwell in humanity, re-
ceives no pollution. His presence has healing virtue for the sinner.
Whoever will fall at His feet, saying in faith, 'Lord, if Thou
wilt, Thou canst make me clean,' shall hear the answer, 'I will,
be thou made clean.' "—Id., page 266.
    5. "The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul
and the body. The spiritual healing was followed by physical
restoration. This lesson should not be overlooked. There are
to-day thousands suffering from physical disease, who, like the
paralytic, are longing for the message, Thy sins are forgiven.'
The burden of sin, with its unrest and unsatisfied desires, is the
foundation of their maladies. They can find no relief until they
come to the Healer of the soul. The peace which He alone can
give, would impart vigor to the mind, and health to the body."

                               Notes

     1. The word from which • "Comforter" is translated is the
 Greek word Paractete. Five times this word is used in the New
 Testament, four times by Jesus in the upper room discourse to
 the disciples (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7), where it refers to
 the person of the Holy Spirit, and' once in 1 John 2:1, where it
 refers to Christ. In I John 2:1, we read: "My little children,
 these things write 1 unto you, . that ye sin not. And if any man
sin, we have an advocate with the lather, Jesus Christ the right-
 eous." The word Paraclete, translated "Comforter" in the other
 texts, is here translated "advocate," which is perhaps a little
 nearer the original text, and refers to a personal Saviour. The
 Holy Spirit is Christ's personal representative in the earth.
        'the word of God is the sword of the Spirit. Eph. 6:17.
 When in trial, the Spirit of God will bring to our minds the pre-
 cious promises of God, to strengthen us, and defeat the enemy.
 But in order that the Spirit may do this we must fill our minds
 with the Word by diligent stuuy. It was with the Word that
 Jesus met the enemy in the temptation in the wilderness. The
 Spirit and the Word go together. This has been well stated as
 follows:
     "The means of the Holy Ghost to accomplish His work in
 us is the word of God. The church, looked at from one point
 of view, is a school. In this school, as in all others, there are two
 things,— the lessen book (the Bible), and the Teacher (the Holy
-Ghost, who makes us understand and learn the lessons). Or, to
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      27
 make use of another comparison, the Holy Ghost is the heavenly
 Workman, who wishes to perform a good work in us — that of our
 salvation; and the Bible is the instrument He has prepared to
 that end; the ministers whom He has established in the church
 are the monitors charged with explaining the lessons (Ephesians
4; 1 Corinthians 12). He wishes us to listen to them, inasmuch
 as they are themselves faithful learners of the Word He has given
 us. The Holy Ghost, whether He wishes to explain, console, or
sanctify, does nothing without the Word; by it we have been born
again (1 Peter 2:2, 3) ; by it we are nourished (1 Peter 2:2; com-
pare John 17:17). The Word is called 'the sword of the Spirit'
 (Eph.
     "To take the one without the other is to take the Teacher
without the Book, or the Workman without His tool. Unhappily,
only too -many do this, with evil consequences — some doctrinal
and others simply practical."
     "The Spirit and the Word, the Word and the Spirit, are two
things indissolubly united by God. A theology which separates
them is not worthy of the name. `The Spirit without the Word'
is, with some, personal inspiration with all its illusions, or mysti-
cism in its bad sense, if not fanaticism with all its errors.
    "On the other hand, 'the Word without the Spirit' is, for
some, orthodox intellectualism with its desolating dryness, or,
what is still worse, rationalism and its errors; for others it is
a prolongation of their childish comprehension of the Word, the
want of peace and confidence in the promise of God, of assurance
and rejoicing over our reconciliation with Him through faith in
Jesus Christ. And it is also a delay in sanctification. Let us
avoid these two extremes with equal care; while we hold the Book,
let us lift our hearts to Him who makes us able to read it with
profit; in the union of the Word and the Spirit, and there alone,
is there entire safety for our souls."—"Through the Eternal
Spirit," pages 301, 302, 306.
    3. If an enduement of the Holy Spirit was necessary in order
that the disciples might do the work committed to their hands of
carrying the gospel to the world, it is equally necesssary for His
people in the closing work of God in the earth.

    1. The evidence that the Lord has answered our prayers and
sent to us the Holy Spirit, is not a joyous, happy feeling, but a
deep conviction of sin. His first work is to convict of sin. And
not till the sin is confessed and put away, will He convince us
of righteousness.
    2. "Those whom Christ commends in the Judgment, may have
known little of theology, but they have cherished His principles.
Through the influence of the divine Spirit they have been a bless-
ing to those about them. Even among the heathen are those who
have cherished the spirit of kindness; before the words of life
had fallen upon their ears, they have befriended the missionaries,
even ministering to them at the peril of their own lives. Among
the heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom
the light is never brought by human instrumentality, yet they
will not perish. Though ignorant of the written law of God, they
have heard His voice speaking to them in nature, and have done
the things that the law required. Their works are evidence that
the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are recognized
as the children of God.
    "How surprised and gladdened will be the lowly among the
nations, and among the heathen, to hear from the lips of the
Saviour, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
30          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.' How glad will be
the heart of Infinite Love as His followers look up with surprise
and joy at His words of approval."—"Desire of Ages," page 638.
    3. "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His
church, and the promise belongs to •us as much as to the first dis-
ciples. But like every other promise, it is given on conditions.
There are many who believe and profess to claim the Lord's
promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet
receive no benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided
and controlled by the divine agencies. We can not use the Holy
Spirit. The Spirit is to use us. Through the Spirit God works
in His people 'to will and to do of His good pleasure.' But many
will not submit to this. They want to manage themselves. This
is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those who
wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace,
is the Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand and
reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all
other blessings in its train. It is given according to the riches
of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul ac-
cording to the capacity to receive."— Id., page 672.
    4. The motive of Simon Magus was wrong. If we desire the
Spirit of God for any selfish purpose, God must withhold it from
us. Before, therefore, we can receive the fulness of the Holy
Spirit, we must have the motives and purposes of the heart right.
    5. The wort of Satan is to exalt self. "I will ascend unto
heaven." "I will exalt my throne." "I will be like the Most
High." The Holy Spirit never leads to an exaltation of self, but
ever exalts the Saviour, speaks of Him, testifies of Him, and
glorifies Him.
    6. "What a change to him who had been the judge and cham-
pion of Israel! — now weak, blind, imprisoned, degraded to the
most menial service! Little by little he had violated the con-
ditions of his sacred calling. God had borne long with him; but
when he had so yielded himself to the power of sin as to betray
his secret, the Lord departed from him. There was no virtue in
his long hair merely, but it was a token of his loyalty to God;
and when the, symbol was sacrificed in the indulgence of passion,
the blessings of which it was a token were also forfeited.
    "In suffering and humiliation, a sport for the Philistines,
Samson learned more of his own weakness than he had ever known
before; and his afflictions led him to repentance. As his hair
grew, his power gradually returned; but his enemies, regarding
him as a fettered and helpless prisoner, felt no apprehensions."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 566.
   "God's providential care had been over Samson, that he might
be prepared to accomplish the work which he was called to do.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     31
. . . The very ones whom God purposes to use as His instruments
for a special work, Satan employs his utmost power to lead astray.
He attacks us at our weak points, working through defects in the
character to gain control of the whole man; and he knows that if
these defects are cherished, he will succeed: But none need be
overcome. Man is not left alone to conquer the power of evil by.
his own feeble' efforts. Help is at hand, and will be given to
every soul who really desires it"— Id., page 568.
     7. "Why do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit,
since this is the means by which we are to receive power'? Why
do we not talk of it, pray for it, preach concerning it'? The Lord
is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to us than parents are to
give good gifts to their children: For the baptism of the Spirit
every worker should be pleading with God. Companies should be
gathered together to ask for special help, for heavenly wisdom,
that they may know how to plan and execute wisely. Especially
should men pray that God will baptize His missionaries with the
Holy Spirit. '—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 8, page 22.
     "My brethren and sisters, plead for the Holy Spirit. God
stands back of every promise He has made. With your Bibles in
your hands, say: 'I have done as Thou hast said. I present Thy
promise, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened unto you." ' "— Id., page 23.

  ,    •
    1. " It is a great thing to have a well that you can carry with
you; to have a well that is within you; to have your source of
satisfaction, not in the things outside yourself, but in a well within,
and that is always within, and that is always springing up in
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    33
freshness ane power; to have our well of satisfaction and joy,:,
within us. We are then independent of our environment. It
matters little whether we have health or sickness, prosperity or
adversity, our source of joy is within and is ever springing up.
. . . This fountain within is always gushing up with greatest
power and fulness in the days of deepest bereavement. At such
a time all earthly satisfactions fail. What satisfaction is there in
money, or worldly pleasure, in the theater or the opera or the
dance. in fame or power of human learning. when some loved one
is taken from us'? But in the hours when those that we love
dearest upon earth are taken from us, then it is that the spring
of joy of the indwelling Spirit of God bursts forth with fullest
flow, sorrow and sighing flee away, and our own spirits are filled
with peace and ecstasy. We have beauty for ashes, the oil of
joy for mourning, the garments of praise for the snirit of heavi-
ness (Isa. 61:3)."—" The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit,"
 pages 113, 114.
     2. Three laws are here brought to view: (a) The law of God:
 (b) The law of sin and death in our nature; (c) The "law of
the Snirit of life in Christ Jesus." The attempt to keen God's
holy law in our own strength results in total failure. We sink
deeper and deeper into the terrible nit of sin. We are constantly
dragged down by the law of sinful habits in our nature. But
when we in our wretched. hopeless, helpless condition look up to
Jesus, and surrender to Him every purpose, desire, and affection,
the Holy Spirit takes control of the life, and sets us free from the
power of indwelling sin, the law of sin and death in our members,
and gives us continual victory over sin. It sets the despairing
captive free. The desires of the flesh may at times assert them-
selves, for the flesh is still there, but we "through the Spirit do
mortify the deeds of the body." This is indeed glorious fruit
of the Holy Spirit.
     3. "Christ's act in cursing the tree which His own power had
created, stands as a warning to all churches and to all Christians.
No one can live the law of God without ministering to others.
But there are many who do not live out Christ's merciful, un-
selfish life. Some who think themselves excellent Christians do
not understand what constitutes service for God. They plan and
study to please themselves. They act only in reference to self.
Time is of value to them only as they can gather for themselves.
In all the affairs of life this is their object. Not for others but
for themselves do they minister. God created them to live in a
world where unselfish service must be performed. He designed
 them to help their fellow men in every possible way. But self is
so large that they can not see anything else. They are not in
 touch with humanity. Those who thus live for self are like the
34          SABBATH-SCHOOL• LESSON QUARTERLY

fig-tree, which made every pretension, but was fruitless. They
observe the forms of worship, but without repentance or faith.
In profession they honor the law of God, but obedience is lacking;
They say, but do not. In the sentence pronounced on the fig-tree
Christ demonstrates how hateful in His eyes is this vain pretense.
He declares that the open sinner is less guilty than is he who pro-
fesses to serve God, but who bears no fruit to His glory."—"De-
sire of Ages," page 584.




          LESSON XI — The Gifts of the Spirit
                     SEPTEMBER 14, 1912.
     LESSON HELP: Sabbath School Weller.
                            Questions
       Concerning what are we admonished not to be
ignorant? 1 Cor. 12: 1.
   -2. Where did the Lord place these gifts? Verse 28.

the Lord? 1 Cor. 1: 4-6.
    7. Will the time come when these gifts will not be
required? 1 Cor. 13: 8.
    8. Why will they not be required? Verses 9, 10.

gifts? 1 Cor. 12:31.

       What gift is mentioned as one of these "best
gifts"? 1 Cor. 14:1; 39.
                              Notes
   1. It is by means of the Holy Spirit which is freely given to
those who believe, that these spiritual gifts are bestowed upon the
followers of Christ. These gifts are given, not as the believer
may choose, but as the Spirit wills. 1 Cor. 12:11.
   In the scriptures cited there are many different and distinct
gifts of the Holy Spirit. There are other gifts as well, such as
"gifts of healing, helps, governments," etc. Many make a mis-
take in emphasizing one gift of the Spirit to the exclusion of
other important and helpful gifts which have been placed in the
church for the edification of the body. While one gift may be
more helpful and important than the others, all are necessary.
   2. So long as the Holy Spirit strives with men, the gifts of
the Spirit will be seen to a greater or less degree. God placed
these gifts in the church "for the perfecting of the saints, for
the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ."
And they will remain there during the militant period of the
church.

    13. What encouraging promise is made to those who
believe the Lord's prophets? 2 Chron. 20: 20. •
                               Notes
   1. No one can of himself choose to be a prophet, teacher, worker
of miracles, or any other office bestowed by the Holy Spirit. God,
through the bpiru., selects tile instrument. We may decline the
holy calling, and tail to till the place to which the Lord has Called
us; but the gifts or the Spirit, whether of prophecy or some other
girt, are distributed as the Spirit Himself wills.
    2. That there are false claims put forth and spurious gifts ex-
ercised in the world is quite true, but this should in no way dis-
credit the genuine. Counterfeit money is in circulation, but this
does not discount the genuine coin. It is against "false proph-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   37
ets," teachers who depart from the Word, that we are warned.
Though a pretended seer make a prediction which comes to
pass, yet if he teach that which leads away from the true God
and substitutes idolatry, if his teaching lead from the unerring
Word to the tradition of men, we may know that his claims to
be a prophet or teacher sent from God are not true, and we are
not to `;harken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer
of dreams."
    3. "That the Testimonies were not given to take the place of
the Bible, the following extract from a Testimony published in
1876 will show:
    " 'Brother R would confuse the mind by seeking to make it
appear that the light God has given through the Testimonies is
an addition to the word of God; but in this he presents the matter
in a false light. God has seen fit in this manner to bring the
minds of His people to His word, to give them a clearer under-
standing of it.' `The word of God is sufficient to enlighten the
most beclouded mind, and may be understood by those who have
any desire to understand it. But notwithstanding all this, some
who profess to make the word of God their study, are found living
in direct opposition to its plainest teachings. Then, to leave men
and women without excuse, God gives plain and pointed Testi-
monies, bringing them back to the Word that they have neglected
to follow.' —"Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, page 663.
    "Let the Testimonies be judged by their fruits. What is the
spirit of their teaching'1 What has been the result of their in-
fluence' 'All who desire to do so can acquaint themselves with
the fruits of these visions. For seventeen years, God has seen fit
to let them survive and strengthen against the opposition of
Satan's forces, and the influences of human agencies that have
aided Satan in his work.'
    " 'God is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs,
and strengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of God,
or it is not. God does nothing in partnership with Satan. My
work . . . bears the stamp of God, or the stamp of ti4 enemy.
 There is no half-way work in the matter. The Testimonies are
of the Spirit of God, or of the devil.' "—Id., page 671.

    A Thin "Desire of Ages"
I

                THIN, convenient-to-handle edi-
                  tion of that truly wonderful book
I
                  " Desire of Ages," has just come
                  from the press. This edition is
                  printed from the subscription
    book plates, on a special thin white paper,
    which makes a beautiful book. The full
    page engravings of the illustrated edition
    are, for the, sake of lightness, eliminated,
    but it retains all the engraved chapter head-
    ings, the small illustrations found in the text,
    together with all the reading-matter, of the
    regular subscription book. The wide mar-
    gins have been considerably reduced, so it
    weighs only 28 ounces.
       Coming in response to a continued de-
    mand, which has increased as the book has
    become one of reference for all classes of
    workers and students, " Desire of Ages " in
    this form is heartily appreciated. It is but
    little larger than " The Acts of the Apostles,"
    and uniform with it an styles of binding.
