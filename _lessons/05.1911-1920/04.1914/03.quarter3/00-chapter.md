   Evans, at a Union Conference Meeting at
   Oakland, California, March 18, 1914

      . Getting Our People to Work
  "I believe that the revival in our churches will come
about when our churches get to work for others. I be-
lieve there will be a new order . of things in our• midst
When all our churches get to work for somebody else
besides themselves. . . .
  "Every church-inember with territory; every one with
a plan; every Seventh-day Adventist resolved to bring a
soul to Christ. Let us set ourselves at it with determi-
nation."

  Circulation of the "Signs of the Times "
  "I do not know of one other thing that we can set our-
selves to as an organization that will bring such results
in the kingdom of God as will the taking hold of the
circulation of the Signs of the Times. . . .
  "Now the people say: 'What shall we do? Tell us what
is the best thing to do.' I do not know of anything better
for our people to do than to take hold of the circulation
of the Signs of the Times. . . .
  "I do not know how a man can use $1.75 in any better
way, to accomplish any better work, than to take a copy
of the Signs of the Times and let the people read it. I
believe it would come as near getting the third angel's
message into the homes and into the hearts of the people
as anything we can do."

4         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

suggest ? Ans.— That in the first epistle he thinks of
himself as Peter an apostle ; in the second, written shortly
before his death, he thinks of himself first of all as a
servant of Christ, then as an apostle. •
    5. What was his birth name? John 1 : 41.

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       5
  21. What were Jesus' last recorded words to Peter?
Verse 22, last part.
  22. What had been among His first words to Peter?
Matt. 4: i8, 19.
  23. Mention some instances which show that Peter
heeded his Master's bidding. See Acts 2-5, Jo, 12.
  24. What could Peter, out, of a full experience, _ex-
hort believers to account salvation ? 2 Peter 3 : 15, first
part.
  25. Why does the Lord exercise long-suffering toward
all, as He did to Peter? Verse 9. Note 5.
                                Notes
  1. Observe in all the epistles of the New Testament, except
those of John, the custom of the writer's announcing his identity
at the beginning of the epistle rather than at the close, as we do
now. Even John does the same in the book of Revelation.
  2. Simon's step was a threefold one: (a) his adopting, as a
principle of action, "At Thy word"; (b) his repentance and con-
fession of sin; (c) his forsaking all, especially his bright busi-
ness prospects, and following Jesus.
  3. For Simon to say directly and boldly; "Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God," meant much when Jesus was scoffed
at by the religious leaders of the people as an impostor. No
other such declaration is recorded during the life of Christ on
earth, except the announcement by John the Baptist. That
Simon was advancing in divine life is attested by Jesus' an-
swer in verse 17.
  4. Simon doubtless made this declaration sincerely. Though
he failed to live up to it during his discipleship, yet during his
apostleship it was fulfilled to the letter. That he should feel
and express such whole-hearted consecration, marks an advance
step in his Christian experience, despite the fact that he was not
ready for so severe a test.
   5. It is hoped that this brief survey of the struggles, failures,
and final triumph of a "sinful man" will be an encouragement
to every one who has responded to the call, "Follow Me," and
that the name Simon Peter will ever be to the student of this
lesson a reminder of the tenderness and patient forbearance of
a compassionate Saviour.

                             Notes
   I. In Peter's own summary at the conclusion of this epistle
are clearly seen the key words to the twofold burden that called
it forth : "beware" and "grow"; in other words, warning and
exhortation. In dealing with the two, Peter puts exhortation
first — first in order and first in importance.
   2. Peter's Christian experience had beeri an intense one. More
than any other of the disciples, perhaps, he had gone to the
extreme of failure at the crisis of his Master's humiliation.
Now that his work is about done, Peter feels especially anxious
that after his death the believers shall continue to grow in ex-
perimental, knowledge of God.
   3. In 2 Peter 3: 2, Peter sums up what he has amplified in
chapter 1 — that the means of Christian growth is the diligent
study of the Word, both prophetic and practical, in order to
keep fresh in mind the "exceeding great and precious promises"
 (2 Peter I : 4), making them a basis for cultivating the Chris-
tian virtues.
   4. According to the margin, the original, and other scriptures,
Jesus is both God (John I : I) and Saviour (Matt. I : 2I ; Luke
  : I I) ; He is also Son of man (Acts 7 : 55, 56) and Mediator
 (Heb. 9: 13-15). It is the righteousness and vicarious work of
such a being that form the basis of faith, the most precious
possession of the believer.
   5. It is safe to say that the only reason there is a sinner. in
 the world to-day is because he does not know God and Jesus
our Lord ; for really to know the love of God — experimentally,
8            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 as most Scripture terms mean —and to know in the same way
 the sacrifice and ministry of Jesus, is declared to be eternal life.
John 17: 3. "My grace is sufficient for thee," declared Jesus to
 Paul in a crisis of the latter's experience — sufficient for every
need. The only way to grow in grace is to avail ourselves of it
every time we are under temptation or failure. The experience
of grace applied brings peace, and "grace upon grace" (John
1: 16, A. R. V., margin) leads on to "perfect peace" (Isa. 26 : 3).
   6. The word "knowledge" used in verses 2 and 3 is a com-
pound of the simple form used in verses 5 and 6. It denotes
thorough knowledge, knowing a thing as it really is. It implies
expanding, added knowledge, and may properly be rendered here
"knowledge upon knowledge," until it includes "all things that
pertain unto life and godliness."
   7. It should be noted here that after the sinner has been rec-
onciled to God and has made every known adjustment with his
neighbor, his Christian life has only begun. The seed of faith
has 'been merely planted ; he must now cultivate the plant dili-
gently. He has merely cleared the obstructions to advancement
in the strait and narrow way. He has only laid the foundation
of the spiritual temple for God's indwelling; he must now work
at his own profession and build with "all diligence."
   8. FAITH: belief to the saving of the soul. Heb. lo: 39.
   VIRTUE: habitual purity of thought and action ("My strength
is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure") ; and un-
wavering courage, lacking in Peter's early experience.
   KNOWLEDGE: faith and virtue without enlightenment are like
steam in the boiler of an engine without the intelligent hand to
direct it in effective service. "My people are destroyed for lack
of knowledge." "Fools hate knowledge."
   TEMPERANCE : self-control. Besides the steam and the engi-
neer, the engine must have its "governor" to regulate its action.
The acquisition of knowledge must not become an uncurbed pas-
sion; its proper use is what tells. Self-control in all things —
to the extent of non-indulgence in hurtful practises, and of mod-
eration in good ones.
   PATIENCE: endurance. "Not weary in well-doing." It is not
enough to pursue virtue, knowledge, and temperance for a time,
or spasmodically; it must be a continuous endurance of hardness,
and perseverance in well-doing.
   GODLINESS : literally, reverence toward God, spiritual-minded-
ness. Unbelievers often cultivate patience, temperance, knowl-
edge, and virtue, to serve some sordid end —of gain, of popu-
larity, of office. The believer's cultivation of these graces must
have in it the spiritual mind, the unselfish motive — of honor
to God and blessing to his neighbor.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                           9

  BROTHERLY KINDNESS : literally, brotherly love. Disinterested
kindness and loving service to a brother, a friend, a neighbor,
an enemy, is one of the highest practical tests of love to God.
The keeping of the last six commandments is the natural fruit-
age of keeping the first four.
  CHARITY : love. The keeping of all the commandments — the
result of developing the previous seven graces of character.
  The virtues enumerated here are often called "Peter's ladder,"
and very properly. But a still more fitting conception would- be
"Peter's rainbow," the first seven, representing the seven colors
of the rainbow, blending into the last one, representing the rain-
bow as a whole — love. Or compare them to the seven prismatic
colors composing white light.
  9. The word "ministered" in verse II is the same word that is
rendered "add" in verse. 5. Observe the parallel: if through dili-
gence we add abundantly to our faith by developing the sturdy
elements of Christian character, there shall be added to us what
we can not add—an abundant entrance into the everlasting
kingdom.

  1. Here was a faithful preacher who was determined to "die in
the harness," even though he probably understood that his end
would come by violence. 2 Peter : 14; John 21: 18, lg. His
guiding principle had been, "We ought to obey God. rather than
men"; and his only apology for continuing to preach Christ,
even when forbidden by civil authority, was, "We can not but
speak the things which we have seen and heard."
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     11

  2. This passage is sometimes interpreted to mean, We have
the word of prophecy made more sure by the witness of the eye
and the ear. But it reads literally thus : And we have more sure
the prophetic word. This reading, and the additional fact that
Peter lays the emphasis on taking heed to the prophecy rather
than depending on his personal testimony, and supports his
exhortation by showing how prophecy came, seem sufficient to
justify our interpreting the passage thus: And we have,' as a
more sure testimony than that of one who had seen the trans-
figuration and heard the voice, the prophetic word. The angel
of the annunciation quoted prophecy; Simeon was waiting for
its fulfilment when he recognized the child Jesus; and Peter
himself had depended largely upon prophecy in interpreting the
meaning of Pentecost.
  3. We can appreciate the force of this figure when we consider
how great a light prophecy sheds on present-day events which
without it would be as dark to believers as to unbelievers.
   4. That this verse deals with the origin of prophecy rather
than its interpretation, seems evident from the connection and
from a closer reading of the language used. Peter has just been
affirming that he had not taught the believers "cunningly devised
fables"— something that he or some other man had made up —
but like John he declared what he saw and what he heard of the
word of life. But, he continues, there is something still more
sure as a basis for the believer'S faith—the prophetic word.
This is reliable because, as verse 20 reads more literally, "No
prophecy of Scripture comes on its own initiative"— it does not
evolve itself. Nor was it brought forth by the will of man
 (verse 21, R. V., margin), but the men who wrote it spoke as
they were moved by the Holy Spirit. This leaves no room for
human devising, and does not depend upon personal testimony
alone.
   5. The fulfilment of prophecy is like an anchor to the believer.
When he is tempted to doubt the true nature of some of his

Note 5.
                              Notes
  1. As the defection among -the angels in heaven, headed by
Lucifer, was at first carried on by secret insinuations and covert
motives, so these false teachers do their work "privily." The
true follower of Jesus should ever be on his guard against sly
suggestions. "confidential" tales, and skeptical intimations; for
what looks innocent at first often leads to serious consequences,
even to shipwreck of faith.
  2. Two things are characteristic of false teachers: they speak
evil of the way of truth in which they once walked, and they
14         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

do their evil work among the believers, beguiling unstable souls,
and making merchandise of them to their own ends. "From
such turn away."
  3. The Lord saved Noah because he was "a just man," "per-
fect in his generation," and because he "walked with God." But
Lot, for the sake of sordid gain, pitched his tent in the cities
of the plain, dwelling among men who were "wicked and sinners
before the Lord exceedingly." All but two of his daughters
married - Sodomites and perished with them. Yet the Lord, at
the earnest entreaties of Abraham, five times repeated, saved Lot
by the extreme measure of sending two angels to his house, who
finally had to lay hands on him and draw him out of destruction.
  4. For the one who is afflicted with impure, unwholesome
thoughts, this is a gospel and psychological remedy — keep the
mind dwelling upon such wholesome, uplifting things as are
enumerated in this verse. "As a man thinketh in his heart,
so is he."
  5. Here are three steps, given in logical order, which if taken
will keep a man from becoming a despiser of government or of
good organization of any kind : T. Submit to God. 2. Submit
to one another in the fear of God. 3. Submit to every ordinance
of man for the Lord's sake.

                        , Questions

    10. What does Peter say of those who "have escaped

saken the right way" and sunk again into sin? Verse 20.
 Note 5.
    i i. By what homely but striking proverbs does Peter
 describe the condition of one who has returned to a
 life of sin? Verse 22.
    12. What would have been better for these who have
 turned from such great light? Verse 21.
    13. What is the best course for us all? Heb. 3: 12-14.
                              Notes
   r. "Speak evil of the things that they understand not." Here
is the key to a large amount of mischief-making,— people speak-
ing against a thing on first impression, or without sufficient
knowledge of it to base a judgment upon. If persons of critical
temperament, in fact if all Christians everywhere, would adopt
the principle of not commenting upon a thing, especially to make
16          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

slighting remarks about it, until they understand it fully, with
the reasons for it, how 'many evil results would be avoided!
  2. The cover of night is usually sought for evil excesses of
all kinds. When people come to the place where they find
pleasure in such indulgences" in the daytime, it indicates a repro-
bate condition. The reward of such is no worse than the reward
of false teachers, according to the severe arraignment of them
in this chapter.
  3. It is "unstable souls" that are drawn into the vortex of sin.
How important, then, to give all diligence to building solid ele-
ments of stability into the character, according to the outline in
"Peter's rainbow" of character in chapter 1.
  4. The greatest bondage the world has ever known — the
bondage of sin —originated in the despising of government, and
the vain promise of liberty, resulting in the final destruction of
the participants in the rebellion against God, and of all who
have joined it since. Beware of those who wear a cloak of
liberty to conceal their maliciousness. See I Peter 2: 15.
  5. That there is added responsibility in a knowledge of the
truth, is no excuse for a man to avoid learning more of it. He
is held as responsible for his opportunities to know as for his
actual knowledge.

 in Noah's day, and in the last days, show ? Note 3.

18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  17. Is there any doubt.thaf the Lord will come accord-

  18. What is our duty meanwhile? Matt. 24: 42.
  19. What difference will finally be made between the

  zo. For what special reason should we be watchful and
ready:?. .Verse 44.
                            . Notes
   t. "Walking after their own lusts" is the one cause above all
others, perhaps, that produces scoffers. Believers depart from
the faith because they are not willing to surrender all their de-
sires to be pruned away by the "two-edged sword." These find
a kind of satisfaction in turning upon (heir former brethren and
scoffing at their "narrow," "deluded" faith and practise. Both
this class and -unbelievers make the near coming of Christ the
butt of their ridicule. A pricking conscience seeks to obtain
soothing by mocking at the conscientious.
   2. The strongest argument of last-day scoffers in their
minds — is that "all things continue as they were from the be-
ginning of the creation." Thus it seems to the casual observer,
as he looks out on a perfect day, at the clear blue sky, the beau-
tiful trees and flowers, the /terry birds and children, and as he
looks further upon the wonderful progress in the arts and
sciences and the spread of knowledge. Yet these fail to look
upon the signs the Saviour said should appear in the heavens,
the sea,-and the things of nature-and experience about us. It
is only the light of the Word, as Peter goes on to show, that
will enable us to interpret correctly the external, material signs
given us, in addition to prophetic periods, as evidence of Christ's
soon coming.
   3. The ignorance of scoffers at all 'times shows that they do
not receive nor study the, word of God. They therefore 'do not
know the power of that Word, nor' the part it acts in world
events. The antediluvians saw no evidence of the Flood 'in earth
or sky. They evidently did not remember how the heavens and
the earth had been created (Ps. 33: 6), that in their own day
the heavens and the earth "were" by the word of God, and that
at this same word the course of nature could- be changed in a day.
"The, bright rays of the morning. seemed to speak only pros-
perity and peace to the cities of th,e plain. The stir of active
life began in the streets; men were - going their various ways,
intent on the business or the pleasures of the day. The sons-in-
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     19
law of Lot were making merry at the fears and warnings of the
weak-minded old man. Suddenly and unexpectedly as would be
a thunder peal from an unclouded sky, the tempest broke. The
Lord rained brimstone and fire out of heaven upon the cities
and the fruitful plain; its palaces and temples, costly dwellings,
gardens and vineyardS, and the gay, pleasure-geeking throngs that
only the night before had insulted the messengers of heaven,—
all were consumed. The ' smoke of - the conflagration 'Went up
like the smoke of a great furnace. And the fair vale of Siddim
became a desolation, a place never to be built up or inhabited,—
a witness to all generations of the certainty of God's judgment
upon transgression."—"Patriarchs and Prophets;" page 162.
  4. The -word "whereby" is a- rendering •of -two words in the
Greek — through which, the "which" being plural in form, and
therefore not referring back directly to the word of God, but
to the heavens and the earth. In -Gen. 7 : 1 t, we read that "the
same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up,
and the windows of heaven were opened," the heavens and the
earth uniting in producing the Flood. The consideration that
the things of nature which seem to "continue as from the be-
ginning of the creation," may be turned any hour, by the word
of God, into a means of destruction, gives much -weight to
Peter's teaching in this chapter in reference to the coming of
Christ and the final destruction of the world.
  5. "By the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire
against the day of Judgment." The Revised Version, margin,
reads thus : "By the same word have been stored with fire, being
reserved against the day of Judgment." This reading makes
clearer the meaning of the whole passage,— that as the water
stored in the heavens and the earth was turned 'into an element
of destruction at the time of the Flood, so in the day of Judg-
ment the fire stored in the heavens and the earth will be used
in the destruction of ungodly men.
  6. When it comes to dealing with infinities of time, as the
Lord does continually, there is hardly an appreciable difference
between one day and one thousand years. The_ study of God's
word and God's attributes helps to keep us from thinking nar-
rowly and superficially.

3: 18, last part.
                             Notes
   i. This passage makes it clear that the point of comparison
is the coining suddenly or unexpectedly.
   2. "Burned up." In the comment by Westcott and Hort on
the passage, other readings are given : "shall not be found,"
"shall disappear." The whole passage is evidently intended to
describe the natural results of intense heat.
   3. The effect should not be that of stimulating to greater
spiritual earnestness merely because of a "fearful looking for
of indignation," but knowledge of such an end to material things
ought to lead us not to put our trust in them, but to "desire a
better country," a "kingdom which shall never be destroyed."
   4. The word "hasting" has the force of either hastening or
desiring earnestly. If we take the latter meaning, and apply it
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

as we are exhorted, it will surely lead to our helping hasten
that great event.
  5. Grace comes by faith. It is exercised toward us by apply-
ing the righteousness of Christ to cover our sin.. It is multi-
plied through the increase of experimental knowledge of God.

demption ? Eph. 4 : 30-32.
                             Notes
  I. The real, living hope of soon meeting Jesus transforms
and shapes the whole life. By faith we see Jesus hastening
forward His closing work in order that. He may come again.
He is preparing a place for us in the heavenly city. John
14: 1-3. He is making intercession for us before the Father's
throne, that we may be prepared for the place. Heb. 7: 25.
And our attitude is one of watching for His coming—"looking
for that blessed hope." Titus 2: 13. Now we must do the work
He has left us to do, and be ready to meet Him.
24                  SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  2. Notice the marginal reading of the text, "run out as leak-
ing vessels." Unless the truths that we know, are kept living
and bright in our hearts by daily personal experience in the
Lord, the level of our "love of the truth" will be found sinking
lower and lower, imperceptibly perhaps, as water sinks slowly
in a leaking vessel. The Revision puts it, "Lest haply we drift
away from them." No ships drift into port, but it is easy to
drift with tide and current or storm out of the harbor of safety.
   3. We can 'no more expect to be spiritually strong without
feeding the soul upon the word of God, than physically strong
without eating our daily food. Take some Scripture portion
into every day's work, and let it speak to the heart again and
again amidst the hurry of business. It will keep the thought
of God near.
   4. Every believer is marking out a path for some one else. A
Swiss mountaineer starting out from home along a familiar way
by the edge of a precipice, with little thought of where he was
stepping, was startled to hear a child's voice crying, "Be care-
ful where you step, papa, for I am following you." All are
setting steps for some one to follow. And let us carry a burden
 for the straying who should not have turned out of the way
for any one's misstep. Jesus has set the path, and He is never
to blame for anybody's failure. He is the one to follow, having
left "us an example, that ye should follow His steps." I
Peter 2 : 21.

26          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                              Notes
   T. The burden of the message of Revelation 14 is a call to
"worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea," etc.
This is a plain reference to the terms of the fourth command-
ment. It is the Creator who is to he recognized in worship,
whose sign or memorial is His holy Sabbath. The warning of
the last gospel message is against giving homage to the apostasy,
 whose sign or mark is the rival day, Sunday.
   2. The Lord placed a blessing on -the Sabbath day, and those
who keep it find the blessing. We hear this testimony from men
and women in all lands. The Sabbath is a blessed gift from
 God to men — something given to us, not a day taken from us,
as appears to unbelief.
   3. Some people object, "Do you think Sabbath-keeping will
save you?" Not at all. In fact, we must be saved from sin by
 faith in Jesus in order truly to keep the Sabbath. So it is with
obedience to all God's commandments. We are not saved be-
 cause we obey, but we obey because we have found the saving
grace of Christ. The call to keep the Sabbath holy is in a direct
 way a call to holiness of life and the putting away of sin.
   4. "God requires that His holy day be as sacredly observed
now as in the time of Israel. The command given to the He-
brews should be regarded by all Christians as an injunction from
Jehovah to them. The day before the Sabbath should be made
a day of preparation, that 'everything may be in readiness for its
sacred hours. In no case should our own business be allowed
to encroach upon holy time. God has directed that the sick and
suffering be cared for ; the labor required to make them com-
 fortable is a work of mercy, and no violation of the Sabbath;
but all unnecessary work should be avoided. Many carelessly
put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little things that might
 have been done on the day of preparation. This should not be.
 Work that is neglected until the beginning of the Sabbath should
 remain undone until it is past. This course might help the
 memory of these thoughtless ones, and make them careful to
 do their own work on the six working-days."—"Patriarchs and
-Prophets," page 296.

   14. To what purpose has the Lord dedicated the tithe?

   15. What are we doing in devoting our means to the
work of God? Matt. 6: 19-21.
                             Notes
  1. The Lord reserved one day of the week from common use
by man, and made it holy, to, be kept by man in recognition of
the Creator's sovereignty over all. So He has reserved one
tenth of man's income as His, to be returned to God in recog-
nition of the Lord's ownership of all things. "It is He that
giveth thee power to get wealth." Deut. 8: 18.
  2. "All the tithes." The Revision renders it, "Bring ye the
whole tithe into the storehouse." The word "tithe" means a.
tenth. It does not meet His call„ to bring a twentieth, or a
thirtieth. The Lord asks for "the whole tithe." We are to
bring to the Lord's treasury, the treasury of His church, a tenth
of all our income.
  3. This record shows the payment of tithes over four hundred
years before the establishing of the Levitical service. And the
text suggests that the devoting of the tithe to God's service was
not a new thing even to Abraham. It is treated as an obligation
well known to Abraham, the father of the faithful. Later, when
Jacob made his vow to God, he said, "Of all that Thou shalt
give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee." Gen. 28: az.
These patriarchs, with whom God held communion, were taught
to reserve the tithe as the Lord's.
  4. "Even so," says the Scripture. Just as the tithe was set
apart by God in old time for the service of the sanctuary, "even
so" the gospel ministry is to be supported in the carrying .of the
message of salvation to all the world. The priests paid a tithe
of their income, as well as the people. Num. 18: 26. All are
to recognize God's ownership.                    •

  "Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe to use according
to their own judgment. They are not to use it for themselves
in any emergency, nor to apply it as they see fit, even in what
they may regard as the Lord's work. . . . The minister should,
by precept and example, teach the people to regard the tithe as
sacred. He should not feel that he can retain and apply it ac-
cording to his own judgment because he is a minister. It is
not his. . . . Let him not give his influence to any plans for
diverting from their legitimate use the tithes and offerings dedi-
cated to God. Let them be placed in His treasury, and held
sacred for God's service as He has appointed."— Mrs. E. G.
White, in Review and Herald, November to, 1896.                —

                             Notes
   i. Temperance, or self-control, is a fruit of the Spirit. And
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. In Christ we
find liberation from the power of every habit of self-indulgence.
The spiritual nature is made master over the flesh, instead of
being ruled by it. There is power in Christ to set men free
from the drink habit, and the tobacco habit, and all other habits
that enslave.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    31
   2. These principles never change. Conditions change and
human requirements vary ; but the principle holds always true,
that every Christian is under bonds to shape his life in all things
to glorify God, according to the light given him of God. This
emphasizes the importance ,of becoming informed as to the prin-
ciples of proper home sanitation and healthful living. "Parents
should seek to awaken in their children an interest in the study
of physiology. Youth need to be instructed in regard to their
own bodies. . . . If parents themselves would obtain'knowledge
upon this subject, and felt the importance of putting it into
practical use, we should see a better condition of things."—
"Christian Bi              page 71,
—3. The Bible
           ble rule is to eat for strength, not for mere indul-
gence of appetite. This calls for the supply of proper food as
well as the elimination of unhealthful articles. "A diet lacking
in the proper elements of nutrition, brings reproach upon the
cause of health reform. . . . Some of our people, while con-
scientiously abstaining from eating improper foods, neglect to
supply themselves with the elements necessary for the sustenance
of the body. Thbse who take an extreme view of health reform
are in danger of preparing tasteless dishes, makirr, them so in-
sipid that they are not satisfying. Food should be prepared in
such a way that it will be appetizing as well as nourishing."—
"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9,,pages 161, 162.
   47"The inhabitants of the antediluvian world—weirriiitemper-
ate in eating and drinking. They would have flesh meats, al-
though at that time God had given man no permission to eat
animal food. They ate and drank till the indulgence of their
depraved appetites knew no bounds, and they became so corrupt
that God could bear with them no longer."—"Christian
perance,.'t page_43.
   5. "When we study this question in the fear of God, we shall
 learn that it is best, for both our physical and our spiritual
advancement, to observe simplicity in diet. Let us patiently
study this question. We need knowledge and judgment in order
 to move wisely in this matter. Nature's laws are not to be
 resisted, but obeyed. Those who have received instruction re-
 garding the evils of the use of flesh foods, tea and coffee, and
 rich and unhealthful food preparations, and who are determined
 to make a covenant with God by sacrifice, will not continue to
 indulge the appetite for food that they know to be unhealthful.
 God demands that the appetites be cleansed, and that self-denial
 be practised in regard to those things which are not good. This
 is a work that will have to be done before His people can stand
 before Him a perfected people."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
 volume 9, pages 153, 154.

   r. In full harmony with this answer is the familiar passage
in "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 595, "The true object of edu-
cation is to restore the image of God in the soul."
  2. There are seeming exceptions to this rule ; but where the
promised result does not follow, careful examination will usually
show some fault in the training rather than in the principle
enunciated.

  3. In the very nature of the case, the state-supported school
can not make the Bible the basis of instruction. This work can
be done only by the church and the parents. "Those who attend
the public schools of ten associate with others more neglected
than they, those who, aside from the time spent in the school-
room, are left to obtain a street education. The hearts of the
young are easily impressed; and unless their surroundings are
of the right character, Satan will use these neglected children
to influence those who are more carefully trained. Thus before
Sabbath-keeping parents know what evil is being done, the les-
sons of depravity are learned, and the souls of their little ones are
corrupted."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, page 193.
   4. "The church has a special work to do in educating and
training its children that they may not, in attending school, or
in any other association, be influenced by those of , corrupt
habits. . . . Wherever there are a few Sabbath-keepers, the
parents should unite in providing a place for a day-school where
their children and youth can be instructed. They should employ
a Christian teacher, who, as a consecrated missionary, shall edu-
cate the children in such a way as to lead them to become mis-
sionaries. Let teachers be employed who will give a thorough
education in the common branches, the Bible being made the
foundation and the life of all study."—Idem, pages 193, 198.
   5. While primarily the education of the child is the duty of the
parent, the training of the children of the church is a part of
church duty. "Feed My lambs," said Jesus to the church. "Let
all share the expense. Let the church see that those who ought
to receive its benefits are attending the school. Poor families
should be assisted. We can not call ourselves true -missionaries
if we neglect those at our very doors, who are at the most crit-
ical age, and who need our aid to secure knowledge and experi-
ence that will fit them for the service of God."—Idem, page 217.
   6. "It should be the great aim in every intermediate school to
do most thorough work in the common branches."—"Counsels
to Teachers, Parents, and Students," page 210.
   "The word of God is to lie at the foundation of all the _work
done in our intermediate schools. And the students are to be
shown the true dignity of labor."— /dem, page 203.
   "In these schools thorough work is to be done; for many stu-
dents will go forth from them directly into the great harvest-
field. They will go forth to use what they have learned, as can-
vassers, and as helpers in various lines of evangelistic work.
Many workers, after laboring for a time in the field, will feel
the need of further study, and with the experience gained in the
field will be prepared to value school privileges, and to make
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     35
rapid advancement. Some will desire an education in the higher
branches of study. For these our colleges have been estab-
lished."—Idenz, page Zo3.
   7. "The primary object of our college was to afford young men
an opportunity to study for the ministry, and to prepare young .
persons of both sexes to become workers in the various branches
of the cause."—"Testimonies for the Church;" volume 5, page 6o.
   "In our schools the standard of education must not be lowered.
It must be lifted higher and still higher, far above where it now
stands; but the education given-must not be confined to a knowl-
edge of text-books merely."—"Testimonies for the Church," vol-
ume 6, page 126.
   "While attending school, .the youth should haVe an opportunity
for learning the use of tools. .Under the guidance of experi-
enced workmen, carpenters who are apt to teach, patient, and
kind, the students themselves should erect buildings on the school
grounds and make needed improvements, thus by practical les-
sons learning how to build economically. The students should
also be trained to manage all the different kinds of work con-
nected with printing, such as typesetting, presswork, and book-
binding, together with tent-making and other useful lines of
work. Small fruits shoilld be planted, and vegetables and flowers
cultivated, and this work the lady students may be called out-
of-doors to do. ThuS, while exercising brain, bone, and muscle,
they will also be gaining a knowledge of practical life."—Idem,
page 176.
  8. "There is a dearth of educated ability among us, and we
have not men who are sufficiently trained to do justice to the
work."—"Christian Education," page 138.
  "It is fjr the honor of Christ that well-educated workers
should be multiplied among us; they will be better able to com-
municate the truth in a clear, intelligent way, and the truth
should be presented in a way that will be as free as possible
from defects."—Idene, page 138.
  "There is more need now than ever before that our young men
and women shall be intellectually qualified for the work. . . .
The mind receives its tone and efficiency by thorough discipline."

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    37
    9. What may we learn from the way in which Christ

I : 42-47. Note 5.
   1o. What is another important principle to be followed

34, 35 ; Luke 5 : 4-6, 10. Note 6.
    1. Why is personal work often. found the hardest to
do? Ans.— Because Satan knows it is the most effective.
Eph. 6: 12. Note 7.
                             Notes
   i. God has given to every man a free will, to choose to follow
good or evil. It is the will of God that every one should choose
to follow Him, but not all accept this will of God as their guide
and director. He commissions those who accept His will as
theirs, to labor to bring others to accept it too.
   2. "The words, 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel
to every creature' (Mark i6:15), are spoken to each one of
Christ's followers. All who are ordained unto the life of Christ
are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men. The
same longing of soul that He felt for the saving of the lost
is to be manifest in them."—"Testimonies for the Church," vol-
time 8, page 16.
  3. "The case of Philip and Nathanael is an example of true
holm missionary work. Philip had seen Jesus,. and was con-
vinced that He was the Messiah. In his joy he wished his friends
also to know the good news. He desired that the truth which
had brought such comfort to him should be shared by Nathanael.
True grace in the heart will always reveal its presence by diffu-
sing itself. Philip went in search of Nathanael, and as he called,
Nathanael answered from his place of prayer under the fig-tree.
Nathanael had not had the privilege of listening to the words of
Jesus, but he was being drawn toward Him in spirit. He longed
for light, and was at that moment sincerely praying for it. . .
At Philip's invitation, Nathanael sought and found the Saviour,
and in his turn joined in the work of winning souls to Christ."—
"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, page 428.
   4. The need of the one blind man called forth the sympathy
and help of the Saviour; He went sixty miles to help one who
38          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

was in need; He crossed the sea to save another; He recrossed
the sea to help one woman and one child. The Saviour was
always ready to spend and be spent for the one soul who might
need His help.
   5. "The use of hearty commendation is common in Christ's
earthly ministry. The surest way to drive men from us is to
begin with condemnation or criticism. It is not reasonable to
suppose that we can win men to ourselves or to Christ if we
begin by telling them of their sins. Christ did not work that
way. He never began His message to any individual or group of
persons by condemnation of sin. He did not hesitate to denounce
sin and sinful persons under certain circumstances; . . . but
when Jesus set out to win a person to Himself, it seemed to be
His resolute purpose to find something in that one which He
could commend, and then to commend it in all heartiness.
  "For example, the men whom Jesus first invited to follow Him
undoubtedly had as glaring sins and as obvious defects as most
of us have to-day. Those imperfections must have been quite as
much of a trial to Jesus as our fellows' shortcomings are to us.
But He did not commence by telling them of this, nor did He
seek to help them at the outset by showing them what was wrong
with them. His first recorded word to faulty Simon was, 'Thou
art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Rock' ; as though
to say, 'for you deserve a stalwart name.' So with another of
the disciples: there is no reason to suppose that Jesus could not
have found, and did not see, any sin in Nathanael; but instead
of condemning that which was there, Jesus' first word was an
outspoken, hearty admiration of this man, in that he was par-
ticularly free from craftiness, or deceit. . . . We must learn to
work in that way, if we would take men alive as Christ did. We
shall never lose, but always gain, in our influence for Christ, if
we determinedly seek that which can be commended in one whom
we would win, and speak heartily of it."—"Taking Men Alive,"
pages 176, 177.
  6. One of the principles on which Christ worked was that of
giving the present interest of the one with whom He worked
prominent place to begin with. An instance of this is found in
the first miraculous draft of fishes and the.call to the fishermen.
With the woman of Samaria, He commenced with a request for
a drink of water, that in which she was then interested. The
multitude who had been miraculously fed, He led from the tem-
poral bread in which they were interested to the Bread of heaven.
In the same manner we must, if we would be successful soul-
winners, begin our work with the subjects in which the people
are interested.

   7. Dr. Trumbull was a personal worker for nearly fifty years.
Here is his testimony concerning this question: "From nearly
half a century of such practise, as I have had opportunity day by
day, I can say that I have spoken with thousands upon thousands
on the subject of their spiritual welfare. Yet, so far from my
becoming accustomed to this matter, so that I can take hold of
it as a matter of course, I find it as difficult to speak about it
at the end of these years as at the beginning. Never to the
present day can I speak to a single soul for Christ without being ,.
reminded by Satan that I am in danger of harming the cause
by introducing it just now. If there is one thing that Satan is
sensitive about, it is the danger of a Christian harming the cause
he lives by speaking of Christ to a needy soul. He [Satan] has
more than once, or twice, or thrice, kept me from speaking on
the subject by his sensitive pious caution, and he has tried a
thousand times to do so. Therefore my experience leads me to
suppose that he is urging other persons to try any method for
souls except the best one.
   "Have we not the answer here to the question as to why this
work is the hardest in the world? Just because it is the most
effective work for Christ, the devil opposes it most bitterly, and
always will while he is permitted to oppose anything good. The
devil strikes hardest and most persistently at the forces which
will, if effective, hurt his cause most. . . . This, then, is what
we face when we enter upon this [personal] work. The greatest
and hardest work in the world, it will never grow easy, but it
 will never grow small. If it always remains the hardest, it always
remains also the greatest."—"Taking Men Alive," pages 44-46.
