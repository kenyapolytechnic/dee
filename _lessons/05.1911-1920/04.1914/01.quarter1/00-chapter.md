                             Notes
   1. "God forbid."—In other words, it is abhorrent to think
of God's forgiving sin in order that man may continue in sin.
Sin is evil and only evil; and if 'pardoning grace contributes to
the transgression of God's law, God; in granting forgiveness, is
working against Himself and His own government. Then, too,
the sinner who constantly slights the requireMents of God is hard-
ening his own heart against both obedience. and grace. Rather
the pardoned sinner should say, How can I, who am dead to sin,
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         5
whom sin condemned to die, live any longer therein? His grace
must not be received in vain. See Titus 2:11-14.
    2. "Know ye not?"— The question implies that such igno-
rance is inexcusable in Christians. All who were baptized into
Christ were baptized into His death. He died "for our sins."
Gal. 1:4. His death was for us, in our behalf. Baptism shows
faith in His death to save us from the sin which causes death.
    3. "With Him."— Faith grasps His death for our death,
His burial in consequence of sin, for our burial of the old man
of sin. We are to reckon the buried man dead.
    4. "Like as Christ"— Thank God, our Lord did not stay
dead. Joseph's new tomb could not hold Him. He who died
bearing the sins of the world could not be held by death, for
He was •in His own character righteous. Acts 2:24. By the
power of an endless life, which is victorious righteousness, Christ
came forth from the dead; He bore the character, the glory, of
the Father. Rom. 1:4. Even so by that same power we should
walk in newness of life.
    5. "We shall be also."— Planted in the likeness of Christ's
death — dying to sin — we may know that the resurrection of
life shall be ours. • Every true baptism in Christ becomes there-
fore a pledge of the resurrection to • life, and is to the world the
beginning of a life that witnesses to the power of Christ.
    6. "The body of sin."— The body of sin is equivalent to, or
essentially connected with, the old man. It is the essential sin-
fulness of human nature, that which clings like a clog, which
binds like a chain, which imprisons the sinner like stone walls and
iron bars, unless it is yielded to God, unless it is counted crucified
with Christ, and buried forever.
    7. "Death hath no more dominion."— It is well for us
ever to bear in mind why it is that death has no more dominion.
When Jesus died, He died for our sins. He lives by the virtue
of righteousness. That righteousness is everlasting; so also is
the life. Nor can death hold dominion long over those who are
clothed in the righteousness wrought by Christ.
    S. "Reckon."—Christ died for you; "reckon" His death
yours. Set it to your account. Count yourself as dying upon
the cross, and the old man of sin buried forever. Jesus was
raised from the dead for your justification; "reckon" His life
yours, and by the power of that endless life triumph over sin.

     17. What is the inestimable gift of God? Verse 23,
last part. Note 5.
                              Notes
   1. "Your members."— VVe can not keep the mind pure and
right with God while we yield our eyes to look upon sin, our
ears to listen to evil, our tongues to indulge in foolish, boastful,
or obscene talking, our appetites to indulge things not for our
good or God's glory. All these members have once been used in
the service of sin ; now they are to be consecrated to the serv-
ice of Christ,
8           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. "Not under the law."—"Under the law" does not mean
subject to the law, but under condemnation by the law, a sinner.
Sin then has dominion or lordship over us. But when all is
given to Christ, the grace of God pardons, the condemnation is
lifted, and the favor or the grace of God overshadows us, a cov-
ering of protection. But that grace puts the law into our heart.
Heb. 8:10. We are not then under the law, or over the law, but
with the law in Christ.
    3. "God be thanked."— The thought is not that Paul thanks
God that the Roman brethren were sinners, but that although
they were once slaves of sin, they obeyed God and yielded to His
truth.
                                    •
    4. "Wages of sin."— The apostle's word is clear and ex-
plicit. The wages of sin, the sure result of sin's sowing, is
death, a cessation of existence. How the infinite wisdom and
justice of God is shown in this! In His perfect plan, sin can
not be forever perpetuated,= it meets its sure end in its own
fruitage, and he who chooses sin chooses its wages, death. Surely
God is just in depriving man of life which he misuses.
    5. "The gift of God."— Man is sinful and worthy to die.
And even before man sinned, he did not earn life; it was given
him of God to use to God's glory, which is ever for man's good.
He gives it here by faith to those who "lay hold on eternal
life" (1 Tim. 6:12), and the power of this life divine works
in the believer's life; and to those who keep the faith, enduring
to the end, the life is given as a possession absolutely and for-
ever at Christ's second coming, this mortal flesh being changed
to immortality.

    18. But what does this slaying of sin prove the law
to be? Verse 12.
                              Notes
    1. "Dominion over a man."— This is a common, clear il-
lustration. No law, human or divine, holds the dead responsible.
Only while man lives is he amenable to law and responsible to
his government.
    2. "Is bound by the law."— The law binds the woman to
her husband only as long as he lives. If he dies, she is released.
lt is not the design of the law to' bind the living to the dead.
    3. "Ye also are become dead to the law."— The law does
not die; it condemns the sinner, and the sinner is counted dead.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   11
By faith Christ's death is taken by the sinner for his death; he
dies with Christ to sin, and the law no longer condemns him.
Chapter 6:3, 10, 11. But with Christ he rises by faith to a new
life, married 10. Him who rose from ,the dead, that he may bring
forth fruit unto God. Compare Col. 2:14.
    4. "The motions of sin."— The Revised Version reads, "sin-
ful passions"; Rotherham, "the susceptibilities of sins"; the
Syriac, "the emotions of sin." Eph. 2:2, 3 clearly shows that
before conversion we were dOing just what it was our nature to do.
We were children of disobedience; we walked in the lusts of the
flesh, and the mind was in harmony with the flesh. In other words,
it was the carnal mind, not subject to God's law. Rom. 8:7.
Read also the picture drawn by the apostle in Titus 3:3. As the
mind was in harmony with the passions, the passions of course
controlled us, brought us into bondage, and we brought forth
fruit unto death.
    5. "Delivered."— How'l — By dying to sin. By counting the
old man with the carnal mind crucified on the cross. Read the
text as given in the margin,—"being dead to that wherein we
were held," that is, dead to the transgression of the law, under
the bondage of which the violated law held us. The Revised
Version reads, "But now we have been discharged from the law,
having died to that wherein we were held." Rotherham renders
the text, "But now we have received full release from the law,
by dying in that wherein we used to be held fast."

    19. What did he conclude regarding the two kinds

                              Notes
   1. "But sin."— God did not design that His law should be
an instrument of death, but a channel of life. Verse 10; Prov.
1.2:28. It is the transgression, the perversion of the law, that
kills. Electricity is a useful power when transmitted thr   ough
proper channels, according to the proper law of its rightful use;
but if a man presumes to divert its power, contrary to this proper
law, into his own body, he suffers the consequence, which is often'
death. So death is by the perversion of the law, and not by its
proper use.
    2. "Sold under sin."— Man, through sin, is a slave, sold
into a bondage from which he can not redeem himself. But
Christ came to "deliver them who through fear of death were
all their lifetime subject to bondage." Heb. 2:15.
    3. "Allow not."— Paul's mind had been aroused by the
Spirit to see his own great sinfulness. His conscience had been
quickened. He saw himself carnal, God's law spiritual. Yet,.
he had no power in himself to keep the spiritual law.
    4. "I delight in the law of God."— The man truly enlight-
ened of God, though convicted of sin, does not excuse himself and
find fault with the law. He sees beauty, consistency, harmony,
 morality, in that law.. But how different was God's law, as dis-
closed by His Spirit, from the perverted law in his members!
    5. "Bringing me into captivity."— However lofty man's
standard, however high his ideals, he will inevitably fail, in his
 own strength. He is led captive by the great deceiver at will.
Man possesses no power to lift himself above himself. He may
14          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
change the form of his sinfulness, but he can not take away
the sin.
    6. "Body of this death."—"This body of death" (R.V.,
margin). Perhaps an allusion to a prisoner chained to another
who has died. Would God that all sinners might see sin, how-
ever beautifully it may be garbed, to be what it really is, a body
of death.
    7. "Bring us to Christ"— God does not condemn that He
may rejoice in our misery, or to leave us hopeless. He reveals
our misery that we may partake of His mercy. He shows us our
helpless, hopeless condition that we may obtain help and hope
in Him. He reveals to us our deadly wounds that in Him we
may find healing. He tells us we are lost that we may seek His
salvation. The law and the Spirit which condemn inevitably shut
the sinner up to the one avenue of escape, Christ Jesus.
   8. "So then."— This is a conclusion more fully developed in
our next lesson. In brief, it is that he who is ruled by the en-
lightened mind, who delights in the law of God, will obey that
law; but he who yields to the passions of the flesh, will serve the
law of sin. Paul did not teach that one could consent to the
righteousness of the law with the mind and at the same time let
the flesh rule. The text expressed two experiences,— that of the
converted man, and his past experience in
         Supplementary Questions for Home Study
     1. Why is it impossible for man to pile up good works
.in excess of what is required, or works of supererogation,
 as they are called by the Roman Catholic Church?
     2. If a righteous law covers all human conduct, is
 it possible to exceed its requirements?

Verse 9, last part.
                              Notes
    1. "No condemnatiOn."— Recall chapter 5:1:' " Therefore
being justified by faith, we have peace with God." Christ has
purchased the pardon, faith has appropriated it, and we are hidden
in Christ Jesus from the wrath which sin deserved. God looks
upon the sinner and sees only Christ Jesus.
    2. "Law of the Spirit of life."— The law of the Spirit of
life is God's law revealed in the character of Christ. The law
was "ordained to life." Rom. 7:10. In the sinful heart, it
became the law of sin and death, condemning the sin, and the
sinner identified with the sin. Then, too, the perverted, sinful
mind perverts the law, and the soul has no true standard. But
in Christ, the perfection of the law was wrought out, and God
places that perfection of righteousness to the account of the be-
lieving sinner, and the power of that perfect life sets him free.
    3. "The law could not do."— Law can never free its trans-
gressor, however much he may strive to meet its claim. The sin-
weakened flesh can not make perfect a sinful past, however it
may strive; and because sinful, it can never do even present duty.
Sin leaves the sinner absolutely without hope in himself. -
    4. "God."— What the law in sinful man could not do, God
did by sending His own Son. That Son took the flesh of sinful
man, and overcame where man failed, overthrew sin in the flesh;
and so He can come into the flesh of those who will open their
hearts to receive Him, with that same power, and conquer sin
there. See 1 John 4:2, 4; Gal. 2:20.
    5. "That the righteousness of the law might be ful-
filled in - us."—It would be mockery to strike the shackles from
a slave and tell him that he must immediately go again into
slavery. God does not so deal with His children. The same
power that sets free can keep free. The same power that for-
gives sin can save from sinning. God does not forgive the trans-
gression of the law in order that we may continue to transgress.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   17

He saved us from sin, that the law might be written in our hearts,
and so we might keep its righteousness, its ordinances, its re-
quirements, what it demands of us. And the Spirit of God is in
harmony always with His law. What a blessed triumph is such
a work!
   6. "In us."— The apostle defines who is meant by the pro-
noun "us." It is those who walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit. This is a clear evidence that the Spirit leads in har-
mony with the righteousness of the law.
   7. "Carnally minded."— Or, "the minding of the flesh,"
margin. This means a mind dominated by the flesh, in harmony
with it. The flesh is in control, lording it over the mind.
   8. "Enmity against God."— This enmity must be taken
away,' and Christ alone can do it. He did this in .human flesh
like ours when on earth, and He will do it in our flesh if we
will let Him in and subject all to His blessed rule. Gal. 2:20.
   9. "Not subject to the law."—The law, not in its mere
outward forms alone, but in the great depths of its holiness and
spirituality. We need not wonder at this enmity to the law on
the part of those who profess naught of the religion of Christ.
The sad thing is that we find this enmity to God's law in the
hearts of those who profess to be followers of Him who said,
"I delight to do Thy will, 0 My. God: yea, Thy law is within
My heart." , Which shall be the test — the profession or the law'?
See Isa. 8:20; Matt. 7:21. The law here mentioned is of course
the one referred to in Rom. 7:7-14.

   14. What does the apostle Peter say of this suffering?
1 Peter 4 : 1.
   15. Among what things which he earnestly wished
to know did the apostle Paul class this suffering
Phil. 3 : 10.
                               Notes
   1. "The body is dead," or counted crucified with Christ.
The thought carries us back to chapter 6:6, 11. Christ in us
has displaced the "old man" of sin; the body with its domina-
ting, fleshly lusts i‘ counted dead, and Christ reigns. instead. So
it must be if we live His life. Gal. 2:20.
    2. "The Spirit is life."— A blessed, ever-present experience
and comfort to the Christian. The Spirit comes to the sinner
to reprove, convince, convict of sin. The Spirit comes into the
believer as, life. Sin perverts life in the transgressor, and he
dies; but to him who is in harmony with God, who is righteous
in all his ways, the Spirit enters as the life of God; the eternal
Spirit becomes eternal life to the soul that believes on the name
of the Son of God. This is an experience it is our privilege to
know. 1 John 5:11-13. "In the way of righteousness is life."
Prov. 12:28. This is a life, a power, that the unbeliever neither
knows nor possesses. It is the only power which enables us to
overcome sin.
    3. "That raised up Jesus."— That crowning act of power
is giving life to the dead. This power is able to triumph over
sin and all its fruits. See Eph. 1:19-21.
    4. "Quicken your mortal bodies."— Better as given in the
Revised Version, "give life also to your mortal bodies." The
text embraces the present. It is true that God will raise from
the dead His trusting people and give them immortality when
Jesus comes. The mortal bodies will be made immortal. But it
is also a blessed truth that by His Spirit He now gives life,—
strengthening, cleansing, healing life.
    5. "Not debtors."— How many there are — Christians though
they profess to be— who seem to say, by their every-day walk
and words, that they owe something to the world and to the flesh,
to worldly aims, objects, and customs; that these fleshly things
must be indulged. Let us thank God that we are not debtors to
the flesh. We have been redeemed by an infinite price. We be-
long to Christ. To Him we owe all. The flesh of sin is a hard,
tyrannical master, whose service ends in death. But Christ has
purchased and called us to glorious freedom.,
    6. "Led by the Spirit of God."— Naturally the sons of God
will possess the Spirit, the life, and the disposition of the Father.
20          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

The Holy Spirit always leads to devoted obedience to God's com-
mandments. By the Spirit of God love is born in the heart.
Rom. 5:5. And this Spirit-born love keeps the commandments of.
God, and finds them a delight. 1 John 5:3; Ps. 40:7, 8. "Ye
are My friends," says our blessed Lord, "if ye do whatsoever I
command you." God's Spirit will ever lead to obedience.
    7. "Not the spirit of bondage."— Not the spirit we had
under the slavery of sin. That is slavish fear under a cruel
master. Godly fear is the loving reverence of a child for an
infinite and loving Father. The first is a fear of punishment of
sins yet retained; the other is a fear lest we do wrong to One
who is our only Saviour and Hope.
    8. "Adoption."— Though not by nature sons of God (Eph.
2:2, 3), yet we are so by redemption, re-creation, adoption. God
receives us into the heavenly family as sons and daughters (2 Cor.
6:17, 18), and we can say with loving trust, "Abba, Father," or
as rendered by some, ''Father, my Father," in a very personal
sense. Study the meaning of the term in its three occurrences
in the New Testament,—Mark 14:36; Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6.
    9. "Witness with our spirit"— This witness of the Spirit
is not merely an emotion. The experience of our regenerated
spirit is but one side of the witness. The great, unmistakable
witness of the Spirit of God is in the word of God, inspired of
that Spirit. See 2 Sam. 23:2; Acts 1:16; 1 Peter 1:11; 2 Peter
1:21. Only in the Word do we find the rule, the test of the
Spirit's teaching. Whatever that teaches as to God, sin, redemp-
tion, duty, life, and power, is the voice of the Spirit. The spirit
of the converted is in perfect agreement with it. "This is sin,"
says the word of the Spirit; the regenerate spirit responds, "Even
so, Lord." "This is salvation," says the word of the Spirit;
"Amen; it is mine," responds our spirit made new. Darkness,
discouragement, temptations, trials, surround the soul, but the wit-
ness abides, whatever the feeling, as long as our heart is in har-
mony with the Spirit's testimony in the Word. Let us not mis-
take the variable emotions of our own hearts for the Spirit of
God, but find confidence in our own spirit's submission to the
testimony of the eternal Spirit of God.

                               Notes
    1. "Of the creature."— The Revised Version gives "the cre-
ation," and so throughout this lesson. The material creation as
a whole, as will appear as our study proceeds, is groaning under
the curse. When sin entered the universe of God, it was a charge
against God's government, God's ways of working, God's good-
ness and love. It was a challenge to His wisdom and power.
However localized was sin's entrance, or direct in its operation,
in the very nature of the case it affected the whole creation; for
God's work is one, bound together in the bundle of the one life,
and the sin was against the one God, creation's Author. It is
eminently fitting, therefore, to represent the whole creation itself,
insensate though we regard it, as longing for deliverance from sin.
    2. "The manifestation."— The Revised Version reads, "The
revealing." "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be-
stowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: there-
fore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved,
now are we the sons of God, and it cloth not yet appear what we
shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be
like Him; for we shall see Him as He is." 1. John 3:1, 2. See
also Phil. 3;20, 21. The fulness of this manifestation will come
            SABBATH-SCHOOL. LESSON QUARTERLY                   23
when sin is blotted out and God's universe is clean. "Then shall
the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father." Matt. 13:43. For this glorious manifestation creation
waits.
    3. "By reason of him."—It was the arch-rebel Satan by
whom the curse entered God's fair domain. For this, creation
was not responsible. It was not of its own will that it was sub:
jected to vanity. There are myriad evidences that God's creation
is subjected to decay, vanity; and the author of all the evil is
he of whom, it was once said, "Thou sealest up the sum, full of .
wisdom, and perfect in beauty" (Eze. 28:12),— the paragon of
perfected creatures, but who made himself the devil by his self-
ishness.
    4. "Because the creation itself."— The hope is that when
God's work of redemption of man is finished, all God's universe
will be restored. When sin is forever blotted out, the creation,
marred not of its own will, shall be delivered from the bondage
of all corruption, all imperfection, into the liberty of the glory
of the sons of God. Then the challenged power and wisdom of
the Creator will brir ; the hope to fruition.
    5. "We ourselves."— God's children join in the pain and
travail for deliverance, in the longing for the redemption' of the
body, the change to immortality. Phil. 3:20, 21. The Spirit of
God has brought them into sympathetic touch with all God's pur-
poses. The first-fruits of the Spirit are God's earnest, or pledge,
that the groans and travail are not in vain.
    6. "Hope."— Hope is based on God's promise, not on visible
 things which our senses can grasp. The center of this hope is
Christ. Titus 2:13; 1 Tim. 1:1.

    2. "Maketh intercession."— Not as a, person apart from us,
hut within us; "by begetting in us those feelings of the evil of
sin, and desires after holiness and glory, that no language can
express; even as severe disease can not be described in words,
hut becomes perfectly intelligible to the tender-hearted from the
groanings of the sufferers."— Interpreting Bible. "The Holy
Spirit of God dwelling in us, knowing our wants better than we,
   mself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier
desires than we can express in words, which can only find utter-
ance in sighings and aspirations."— Alford.
    3. "According to the will of God."—" The very Spirit who
thus pleads, does it according to God,— in pursuance of the di-
vine purposes and in conformity with God's good pleasure. All
these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when
inarticulately uttered."— Alford.
    4. "In agony."—Our Lord prayed and supplicated "with
strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save." Heb.
5:7. (Read also Psalm 22.) "In His agony He clings to the cold
ground, as if to prevent Himself from being drawn farther from
God. . . . From His pale lips comes the bitter cry, '0 My Father,
if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.' " He was "suffer-
ing superhuman agony." "His suffering was even greater than
before. As the agony of soul came upon Him, 'His sweat was
as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.' "
 (Read chapter 74 on "Gethsemane" in "Desire of Ages.")
26           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    5. "Nevertheless."— This word expresses the submission of
Jesus to His Father's will. His prayer expresses His human fears
and desire, "Let this cup pass." He expresses His love and con-
fidence in "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee; "
but the supreme petition is that not His will but God's will be
done. Such a prayer can never be unanswered.
    6. "According to His will."— All conditions of prayer blend
into one. Note them: (1) faith (Heb. 11:6; Mark 11:24) • (2)
abiding in Him (John 15:7); (3) the spirit of forgiveness (Mark
11:25; Matt. 6:14, 15) • (4) asking according to God's will (1
John 3:22; 5:14, 15); (5) in Jesus' name (John 14:13). Study
them; they will bear much study. Asking in the name of Jesus
embraces them all; for we do not ask in His name if our prayer
does not embrace all these other conditions.
    7. "All things."— We see but the human side of God's work-
ing, the wrong side of the web, like the tapestry weavers; and it
looks to us, in our limited view, seeing but one stripe and color
of experience at once, that it is so imperfect. Like the tapestry
weavers, we must keep our eyes on the beautiful pattern over-
head, and leave all our doubts till the great web is unrolled. Read
the text, "And we know that to them that love God, God worketh
all things with them for good." See margin of Revised Version.
That is, it is not by a happy, fortuitous combination of things
that good comes, but God actively, positively works them all for
our good. The good Father will make even the most forbidding
thing bring good to His child.

Verses 38, 39.
                               Notes
    1. "First-born."— Christ is the First-born in God's purpose
in time; He is the First-born in preeminence, the One who holds
preeminent character, and by whose power and grace all others
are redeemed. To predestinate is to mark out beforehand.
    2. "Predestinate," "called," "justified," "glorified."— It
is a glorious succession that God has for us. Some have con-
cluded that verses 29 and 30 refer to a specific class — those
raised from the dead when Jesus was raised; that they were
pledges of what God would do for all His children; that their
salvation is recorded as a divine assurance to us. It is true now
of God's children; they are marked out, called, justified, glori-
fied, in the glory of God's righteousness.
    3. "That justifieth."— Meditate upon these great and won-
derful assurances of God's love. He,
                                   He, the Infinite One, is the only
Heing in all the universe
                        , who could      a charge against us which
would hold, because our sin is against Him; but the only One who
can lay aught against us is the One who justifies. It is as though
we were going before the judge for sentence, knowing we were
guilty, and knowing that he knew we were; and then to hear him
say, in place of pronouncing sentence, "You are free; your trans-
gression is forgiven."
    4. "It is Christ that died."— Christ only can condemn. He
walked over the same ground perfectly where we made such utter
failure. But instead of condemning, He bore our sins and died
to save us; nay, more, He lives and intercedes- in our behalf. Why
should we be discouraged? How could God do more, or give to
us greater assurance'
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     29
    5. "Who shall separate us?"— The apostle names seven
things in which all fair-weather friends would leave us. Few in-
deed would care to abide with us through these. But Christ's
love is not affected by any of them. He is with His people in all
things, in all ways, to the end. He assures us He- will never leave
nor forsake us. Heb. 13:5.
    6. "As it is written."— Read Ps. 44:22 and the context.
The words of this scripture were written in the agony of a de-
feated, scattered, seemingly forsaken people. The Christians suf-
fering all things named in verse 35 would be inclined to feel as
the quoted psalm expresses it.
    7. "More than conquerors."— The love of God triumphs
over all things. In the worst trial that can come upon His peo-
ple here, they may be "more than conquerors" through Christ.
All the evil angels and the principalities of darkness in heavenly
places, death and the grave in the lowest,— all, all have been con-
quelled by Him who has assured our salvation.

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       31
    16. In whom did all these blessings center? Rom.
9 : 5.
    17. Through what race on the human side does sal-
vation come to us? John 4 : 22.
    18. Through whom do we receive all these blessings
Eph. 3 : 6.
                                Notes
    1. "Heaviness and . . . sorrow."— He who accepts Jesus
Christ and His service must not seek a bed of roses, or a time of
idle joy or selfish ease. He will lose his burden of sin; that will
roll off at the foot of the cross; but if he has the Spirit of Christ,
he will be burdened and heavy of heart oftentimes for others. He
will know the night seasons of prayers and tears; he will meet the
mounts of temptation and the gardens of Gethsemane. That soul
who is not burdened for others has never found full fellowship
with Christ.
    2. "I could wish that myself were accursed."— That is,
if his eternal loss would but save those he loved, be would be will-
ing to make the sacrifice,— not a mere temporary one, but an
eternal giving up of all things for the salvation of his people.
"Accursed" is more literally "anathema," or as in the Old Tes-
tament, "devoted," doomed to die. It was the spirit which ac-
tuated our Lord, and which was manifest in Moses.
    3. "Israelites."— Descendants of him who by the brook Jab-
bok, in wrestling with the Angel, prevailed with God, and won
the name of Israel. Gen. 32:24-30. But they were descendants
according to the flesh. "Israel" meant character when given to
Jacob; it was a mere name of a people with most of his children.
Even so it is now with the name "Christian."
     4. "The adoption."— It is true that God adopted Israel that
He might save them. He brought them out that He might bring
them in; but it was not to a selfish salvation, or a lordly position
over the nations, that He adopted them. They were to be priests
 to the nations, and teach them the way of the Lord; to declare
 His glory among the nations, and His high and exalted position
above all other gods. They were placed in the very highway of
 nations, that they might be preeminently a missionary people.
 When they failed to retain or obtain this spirit, there was trouble
and calamity. For the same purpose God has adopted us. 1
 Peter 2:9.
     5. "The glory."— This was the glory of God's character, His
 righteousness, for which His glorious and holy name stood. God
 placed His glory upon that people, and saw no iniquity among
 them.
32            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    6. "The covenants."— A covenant based upon human prom-
ises, a new covenant based upon God's promises. The first ought
to have taught them humility, and that personal righteousness can
not come through a national covenant. The new covenant — the
everlasting covenant — is based on the promises of God in Jesus
Christ.
    7. "The law."— God loved His people, therefore He gave the
law. Dent. 33:2, 3. He gave them the law that they might re-
ceive it into their hearts, and so not sin against Him. Ps. 17:4;
119:11. Thus would they reveal His character to the world. It
was a marvelous honor to receive the law of the Most High from
heaven for a world. It is even so now.

  19. Upon what other class does He will to show
mercy? Isa. 55 : 6, 7. Note 7.
  20. Whom will the Lord harden? 2 Thess. 2: 10-12.

                            Notes
     1. "Not all Israel."— Keep the distinction in mind. There
is Israel according to the flesh, the carnal descendants of Jacob.
There is also the true Israel, who like Jacob wrestled earnestly
with the Angel. They are not all true Israel that are of Israel
according to the flesh. As we might say, They are not all Chris-
tians who are so called.
     2. "In Isaac."— Ishmael was as truly Abraham's child as
was Isaac; but the former was after the flesh, seeking to obtain
the promise by man's devising, while the latter was the child of
promise, given by the power of God. See the allegory in Gal.
4:22-31. The children of promise are we if by faith we embrace
it. Behind it is all the power of God for Victory.
     3. "Which are the children of the flesh."— This does not
imply that the children of the flesh may not become the children
of promise; but it is an emphatic declaration that fleshly descent,
however honorable, does not make us children of God. As a mat-
ter of fact, all humanity are born children of the flesh, some of
 humanly honorable descent, some of dishonorable, but they must
"be born from above" (John 3:3, margin) to become the chil-
 dren of God. •Compare Eph. 2:1, 3, 12 with 2:13,'19.
     4. "The word."— In the case of Sarah, God wrought a mir-
acle. So He does in regenerating every soul of man.
     5. "According to election."— God's purpose must stand;
 and to carry out that purpose, He uses sometimes to us strange
means. Sometimes He uses men for these purposes, regardless of
 character. His use of them does not even imply their salvation.
 Nor does His rejection of others, or His refusal to use them for
 a definite purpose, mean to them loss of salvation. The election
 of Jacob for the channel of the holy Seed did not, mean the utter
 rejection of Esau. The choice of Judah •for the same purpose
 did not mean the loss of salvation by his brothers. Election to
 eternal character and life involves our choice as well. Not that
 it is not according to God's purpose, but every soul may choose
 or reject the purpose of God.
      6. "That I might show My power."— That God might
 show His power in Pharaoh; that God's name might be declared
 throughout the earth. Now "God is no respecter of persons."
 He longs to save all men. "As I live, saith the Lord God, I
 have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    35.

turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
for why will ye die?" 'In harmony with these principles, study
this verse. "Raised thee up" is equivalent to "brought thee to
the throne," "caused thee to reign." God brought this king to
the throne of Egypt for the twofold purpose above stated., If
Pharaoh had yielded to God as did Nebuchadnezzar, God's power
would have been wrought in the king of Egypt's conversion, even
as it was in the king of Babylon's. See Dan. 4:34. By his con-
version at the head of the Egyptian kingdom, God's name, as in
the case of Nebuchadnezzar, would have been spread abroad
throughout the world. See Dan. 3:29; 4:1, 3. Pharaoh rejected
God's plan for him, but God's purpose was carried out just the
same, to Pharaoh's eternal loss, when it might have been to his
eternal gain. God chose Pharaoh for this special twofold purpose,
irrespective of character. In it Pharaoh might have found the
higher choosing.
    7. "Mercy on whom He will."— It is God's will to show
Mercy to all who will yield to His eternal purpose. Howsoever
great a sinner one may be, God will multiply pardon. And He
will never reject till, like Pharaoh, men choose darkness rather
than light, and will not receive the love of the truth or the Holy
Spirit. Compare 2 Thess. 2:10 with Rom. 5:5.

                               Notes
    1. "Why?"— Our poor human heart often asks "Why?"
when it is better to trust to God's infinite wisdom, power, and
love, and eternal, rightful sovereignty. Let us not, by our mur-
muring, place ourselves on the outside of. His purposes toward
every soul. "For I know the *thoughts that I think toward you,
saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you
an expected end." Jer. 29:11.
    2. "Vessels of wrath."— God did not make them such —
they fitted themselves for that; and :He, the great, loving .God,
endures with much long-suffering. They need not remain vessels
of wrath. "ln a great house there are . . . vessels, . .        some
to honor, and some to dishonor. If a man therefore purge him-
;self from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and
meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good work."
2 Tim. 2:20, 21.
    3. "Even us."— Every saved soul among Jews and Gentiles
was a demonstration of God's mercy toward all; for He "is no
respecter of persons," and everyman will be left without excuse.
 • 4. "Osee" is a Greek form of . the Hebrew "Hosea,." Read
the passage in Hosea, and note the class of people out of whom
God gathers His people. See also 1 Cor. 6:9-11 and many other
passages.
    5. "Ye are not My people."— The book of Acts and the
epistles of Paul are records of the transforming power of God's
mercy, and so •has been the history of Christianity from that day
to this. From sin to righteousness, from darkness to light, from
vice to virtue, from death to life, from paganism, with all its sins,
to Christianity, with all its graces   such has been the transform-
ing power of His mercy and grace. In lands of the greatest dark-
ness, where righteousness has been unknown, there the Word has
begotten "children of the living God."
    6. "Esaias."— A form of "Isaiah." Remnant.— The Re-
vised Version has a stronger thought: "It is the remnant that
shall be saved." The quotation is from Isa. 10:22: "For though
thy people,Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of
them shal return." R.V. It is ever the remnant, those who
yield to God's purpose.
    7. "Finish the work."— Yet God will finish His work.
Man's unbelief and hardness of heart will not frustrate God's
work forever. Sometime it will close quickly, and that day draws
on apace.
    8. "Whosoever."— This is in harmony with all that has been
said by the apostle; for notwithstanding God's sovereignty and
38            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

arbitrary choosing to special work, eternal life is possible for all.
"Whosoever" is not used of the Spirit to tantalize or mock the
sinner. Upon that Stumbling-stone, Christ Jesus, all can build
if they will, and not be ashamed.

              Brief Analysis of Chapters 1-9

     Chapter 1 sets forth the power of the gospel to save
 in a world utterly hopeless in itself.
     Chapter 2 clearly shows that the Jews, or the en-
 lightened ones, are not saved by works, but are trans-
 gressors as truly as are the Gentiles. •
     Chapter 3 proves that both Jews and Gentiles are
 guilty before God, proved so by the law, and that the
 only way they may become righteous is through Jesus
 Christ, freely by His grace.
     Chapter 4 is an argument to the Jews from the life
 of their great ancestor Abraham, showing that through
 the promise of God alone and faith in that promise is
 there hope.
     Chapter 5 is a simple setting forth of justification by
 faith in the righteousness and grace of the Obedien.t
One, Jesus Christ.
     Chapter 6 sets forth the meaning of baptism, and
the contrast between a life of sin and the power of tri-
umphant grace.
     Chapter 7 is an individual illustration, in Paul's ex-
perience, of the passing of a soul from the realms of
sin to the realms of grace, vindicating the holiness of
God's law.
    Chapter 8 is a marvelous revelation of the wondrous
power and grace of God in the life of the saved. soul.
    Chapter 9 is an argument concerning God's sover-
eignty, and a revelation of its consistency with mercy
in His dealings with Israel.
