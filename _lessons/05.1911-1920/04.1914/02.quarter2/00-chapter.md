                             Notes
   1. "My . . . prayer."- Notwithstanding that the Jews re-
jected our Lord and persecuted His servants, Paul knew that many
of them, even in their persecution of God's people, had real zeal
for God, but they did it ignorantly. Had they known, they would
not have crucified the Lord's Christ. Acts 3:17; 1 Cor. 2:8.
Paul, remembering his own misguided experience, could pray ear-
nestly for them. We do not see as God sees. Men of whom we
feel hopeless, may be on the very eve of turning to God. The
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5

Revised Version reads, "zeal for God," in verse 2, instead of
"zeal of God."
    2. "Establish their own righteousness."— That is what
every one tries to do who does not know God, who has not by
revelation (Matt. 16:17) seen God, or who forgets His infinite
holiness. He who holds ever in view the righteousness of God,
will abhor himself and honor God. The gospel places the glory
of man in the dust and exalts Jesus Christ.
    3. "End of the law."— The word "end" in this text means
aim or object, as in James 5:11. The aim, or object, of the law
is to bring men to Christ. It shuts man in the prison-house of
sin with but one door, Christ. It, like a hard master, leads or
drives the sinner to Christ as the only source of righteousness.
Rom. 7:7, 24, 25; Gal. 3:23, 24. Then in Christ the righteous-
ness, the requirement, of the law is fulfilled in those who walk
after the Spirit. Rom. 8:4. Faith in Christ, we have learned,
establishes the law in the heart.
    4. Righteousness by faith is personified and made to speak
for itself. It does not demand that man shall do great things by
which he will take glory to himself. Man is not to descend into
the deep, nor must he climb up to heaven; all he needs to do is
to yield himself, and believe in Christ Jesus, who has come down
to him. Thus it was in the days of Moses. They did not need
to climb up to the serpent, but "look and live." Thus it is now.
Jesus the Lord, the Saviour, has come down to us. Open the
 heart, and let faith see Him there. And it is all in the word
 which faith brings, with its cleansing power, within the heart.
    5. "Unto righteousness."— There is much belief which
 merely accepts facts and no more. Faith accepts righteousness,
 reaches to it, makes it its own. The faith which stops short of
 righteousness is a failure.
     6. "Their sound."— The voice of God speaking through His
 works; for the quotation is from Ps. 19:4. Sometimes He speaks
 in dread majesty, sometimes in marvelous wisdom, sometimes in
 the terrible tempest, in the soft-breathing night breezes, in the
 mighty oak, in the tiny floweret, in all the wonders of the jeweled
 dome above us. In a thousand different ways is proclaimed to
 the thoughtful, longing heart the power, the wisdom, and the
 love of God. There has always been light enough to lead to God,
 and there is sufficient potency in one ray to save the soul who
 receives and follows the light.
     7. "I was found of them that sought Me not."— All
 through God's work with Israel, He desired to make them instru-
 ments of salvation to the nations. He placed them in the center
 of civilization, in the highway of the nations, that they might
6              SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

minister light to the peoples of earth. He taught them this in
object-lesson, in precept, in psalm, in prophecy. But all these
blessings they took to themselves, and perverted them into curses.
We hold our blessings only by using them for others.

             Supplementary Questions for Home Study
   1. Should we place any one outside of God's limit
and power to reach and -save? For hgw many, then,
should we pray?
   2. In the light of this lesson, can we prosper spir-
itually and not bear witness for God?

                             Questions

cast off His people? Verse 1. Note 1.
   2. What further proof does he cite? Verse 2.

    5. What conclusion does the apostle draw from
these instances? Verse 5.

    7. What disappointment must necessarily come to
Israel, who sought righteousness by works? Verse 7,
first part. Note 2.
    8. Who did obtain the righteousness they sought?
Verse 7, last part.

    15. What comparison is drawn between the casting
 away and the receiving of the Hebrew people? Verse 15.
    16. What proofs are given of character? Verse 16.
     17. How did the Gentiles come in? What blessings
 thus came to them? Verse 17. Note 7.
     18. What reason is given to show us we have no
 right to boast or glory? Verse 18.
                              Notes
   1. "I also."- Paul was in his own experience a demonstration
that God had not cast away the Jews from salvation. For if
God could pardon Paul, who was a persecutor and blasphemer,
He could pardon all who came to Him; for He is "no respecter
of persons."
8            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     2. "Israel hath not; . . . the election hath."— Israel
 sought righteousness by works. But how could they obtain it, for
 all their works fell short of God's glory. Faith in the free grace
 of God was wanting. The election obtained righteousness, be-
 cause they chose it, chose God's grace, God's righteousness in
 their behalf, chose all for which He had chosen them.
     3. "Blinded."— Better "hardened," as in the margin. They
 were hardened because they would not accept God's way, and
 God let them have their own way.
     4. "Let."— As they are determined to walk in their own way,
 let them have it, let them have all the fruitage thereof. All the
 things mentioned are the legitimate fruit and consequences of
 their own choice.
     5. "Their fall."— Not their destruction as individuals, but
 their separation from God, their setting aside, as a special people.
 Christ had come. The true Israel — the Jew — was of the spiri-
 tual seed alone. See Rom. 2:28, 29; 9:6-8. "The leaders in the
 Jewish nation had signally failed of fulfilling God's purpose for
 His chosen people. Those whom the Lord had made the deposi-
 taries of truth had proved unfaithful to their trust, and God
 chose others to dO His work."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
 pages 78, 79.
     But though cast off in their national capacity, God eagerly
longed that they as individuals should come into the fold through
 Christ.
     6. "The fall . . . their fulness."— God would have used
 the nation of Israel to enlighten the world in the fullest sense
if they had yielded fully to Him; but when their whole effort
and thought was for themselves, they held the world back from
the riches of God's grace entrusted to them. Their fall as a
nation, and the proclamation of the gospel to all alike, opened
to the world the infinite riches of God's grace. But even greater
blessings would have been given if they had yielded all, so. that
God could have used them as a positive force in the work of
carrying the gospel.
    7. "Partakest of the Root."— The Root of the holiness is
Christ. If branches will not partake of His life, they die, or
are cut off. As is the character of the source, so is that which
it produces. The lump evidently refers to the loaves offered when
Israel entered the land. See Num. 15:18-21. We must not lose
sight of the fact that the term "Israel" is used in its twofold
aspect. The Jews used it in its literal, fleshly, national aspect,
and many Christian expositors do still. Paul recognized this, but
his effort was to show to them that only Israel by faith was ac-
ceptable to God. So Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — the fathers —
obtained the blessings and the promise by faith. Therefore when
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       9
the people as a nation were set aside, the individuals were not.
God had better things for them in a "fulness" not earthly, but
heavenly.
          Supplementary Questions for • Home Study
   1. Which class grasps salvation, the mass or the
remnant?
   2. What proves that there was salvation for all in
Elijah's time? What proves the same of Paul's day?
   3. When did Israel settle her fate as a nation?
   4. What Israel still survives?

           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      11

   19. In what is His all-sufficiency shown? Verses
34-36. Note 9.
                               Notes
    1. "Behold therefore the goodness."— There is goodness
in God's severity. It cut off the Jews as a nation. It did not
cut off a single Jew as an individual. If he would not believe,
he remained in condemnation. His name as Israel, with the char-
acter of a sinner, would not save him. But the severity against
those who fell in a national way opened in an equal way to every
one the goodness and mercy of God, where "there is neither Jew
nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free."
    2. "Contrary to nature."— According to nature the fruit
borne is that of the scion, the engrafted piece, not the root; but
contrary to nature, the scion itself becomes changed, and the
root indicates the character of the fruit. The Root of Israel is
Christ Jesus. The Gentile is a wild olive-branch. But the fruit
is of the Root, not the branch.
    3. "The fulness."— This term has been greatly perverted.
It has been made to mean the conversion of the Jews and their
restoration as a nation in the last days. But if the fulness applies
to Jews or Gentiles as persons, it must include every one, and we
know that not all of either class will be converted. The simple
Scripture truth is much clearer. The fulness is that which sup-
plies all needs. To the Jew it was offered in Christ Jesus. And
of Him John says, "Of His fulness have all we received, and
grace upon grace." "For it pleased the Father that in Him
should all fulness dwell." Col. 1:19. There every believing Jew
found it. But addressing the Gentile Christians, Paul said, "In
Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, and in Him
ye are made full." Col. 2:9, 10, R.V. The fulness of Jew and
Gentile is in Christ Jesus our Lord; and the blindness, or hard-
 ness, happened to Israel until all the covenant blessings in Christ
 were offered to the Gentiles.
    4. "And so."— That is, by faith in Christ, the Fulness, shall
 Israel be saved. "Thou [the Gentile convert] standest by faith,"
 and the Jews will stand also if they abide not in unbelief in
 Christ the Fulness. And therefore there shall come "out of Zion
 the Deliverer." Only in the Deliverer can fulness of blessing
 be found.
     5. "Enemies . . . beloved."—Looked upon as a whole, as
 a nation, the Israelites were excluded, east off for the sake of all
 others; but they are beloved still for the sake of the covenants
 made with the fathers.
     6. "Without repentance."—God does not repent of the
 good He has done. Man may misuse His gifts, despise His good-
12           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

ness, yet Infinite Love will not repent that He bestowed that love.
For God loves mankind, not because it is lovable, but because
He is love; and "we love, because He first loved us."
    7. "All . . . all."— And God has done this because Infinite
Wisdom knew that only in His mercy was there hope for man.
Man may fix up ten thousand schemes by which it is thought he
singly or unitedly may save himself, but all his efforts will prove
futile. All are in unbelief, for all have sinned, and He in His
goodness proffers mercy unto eternal salvation to all.
    8. "Riches, . . . wisdom, . • . knowledge."—In the
fulness of God rests our hope, not in the hoped-for sufficiency of
ourselves.
    9. Of Him in their origin, through Him in their disposal,
unto Him that all His purposes may be fulfilled to His glory.
It would seem that the apostle was carried away with God's mar-
velous plan of saving man, as he closes this doctrinal part of this
marvelous epistle. The grace of Christ, given in God's wisdom,
love, and power, meets all man's needs, solves all perplexities,
works for man's eternal good, and redounds to the praise and
glory of God.

                             Notes
   1. "Therefore."— In view of all God's mercies, as set forth
in all that has gone before. All the wonderful doctrinal teaching
set forth is nothing unless it is revealed in the life. As Chrys-
ostom remarks, it is as though Paul "brought the Benefactor
Himself to supplicate."
14          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. "Present."—" The verb used is the regular word used for
bringing to offer in sacrifice."
    "Your bodies."—"The body is the organ of practical ac-
tivity, which practical activity is to be dedicated to God; better
still, as an indication that the sanctification of Christian life is
to extend to that part of man's nature which is more completely
under the bondage of sin."— Alford.
    "A living sacrifice."— In contrast to the offerings of beasts
which were slain. The beast could be offered but onceb; the body
is a continual sacrifice, denying itself all the evil tendencies and
lusts, and serving God positively.
    "Reasonable."—Logical, spiritual. It is rendered both.
    3. "Conformed."— Shaped, molded from without.
    4. "Transformed."—"Transfigured," molded from within.
The world molds us for death; under the creative power of God,
we grow into His image.
    5. "Good, and acceptable, and perfect" does not apply to
the will of God — that can not be otherwise — but that we in
ourselves may prove "what is the will of God, namely, that which
is good and well-pleasing in Him, and perfect."
    6. "Not to think of himself more highly," etc.— A proper
abiding conception of the gifts of God's Spirit, or spiritual gifts,
would prevent an undue estimate of our own power and ability,
and foster humility, and would also keep us from becoming wor-
shipers of men. "There is a play on the words here in the orig-
inal, which can only be clumsily conveyed in another language:
`not to be high-minded above that which he ought to be minded,
but to be so minded as to be sober-minded.' "— Alford.
     7. "One body."— Christ is the Head (Eph. 1:22, 23; Col.
1:18), and, of course, believers are members one of another;
"for by one Spirit are we all baptized into the one body." 1 Cor.
12:13. So should we ever regard each other.
     8. "Gifts."— Read 1 Corinthians 12; Eph. 4:7-12; and the
 parable of the talents in Matthew 25 and that of the pounds in
Luke 19. We will learn, from these scriptures, that the gifts
were bestowed upon the church by our Lord through the Spirit
 when He ascended; that gifts are bestowed upon all; that they
are given for His people to improve and to profit by in the upbuild-
 ing of the church and the work of the ministry; that they are
 given as God wills — not as man wills; that they are to remain
 in the church till our Lord's return; that then all will have to
 account for their use. These gifts are very precious, and our
 Lord likens them to highest denominations of money in the Jew-
 ish and Roman systems.
     9. "Ministry."— Service. All who can accept Christ can
 minister for, or serve, Him; for ministry means service. And
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    15
ministry for Christ is to serve not as we choose, but as He directs.
Thus serving, the lowliest tasks become glorified.
   10. "With simplicity."— Better, ''with liberality," or "lib-
erally." "With cheerfulness."—"It is in exhibiting compas-
sion, which is often the compulsory work of one obeying his con-
science rather than the spontaneous effusion of love, that cheer-
fulness is so peculiarly required, and so frequently wanting."—
Alf ord. How do you answer the offending one;who has apologized
or who asks forgiveness? Do you cheer fully say, I freely and
fully forgive? or does your very manner imply that in your heart
you condemn?

                              Notes
   1. "Without dissimilation."— The Revised Version reads,
"Let love be without hypocrisy." In other words, let it not be
pretense. Let it come from the heart, born of God, "shed abroad"
by the Holy Spirit. Rom. 5:5.
    2. "Kindly affectioned."— The word in the original is that
used for affection toward near relatives. Alford renders the text,
":In love of the brethren be affectionate one to another; in giving
honor, outdoing one another." ''Not waiting to be loved by
another, but thyself spring forward to the act, and make the be-
ginning."
    3. "Not slothful."—"In diligence, not slothful."— Alford.
It pertains first of all to the Lord's business; and yet all the
Christian's business ought to be the Lord's business. Whether it
be raising corn, or building houses or keeping books, he should
be doing all for God, under whose all-searching
                                      '          eye all work must
come at last. We can not do God's business for Him and ours for
ourselves; all should be for God. How can we understand other-
wise "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with -all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength"? But how far short we come! We will find when we
plan for God, He will plan for us.
   '4.. "Given to hospitality."— Alford says, "This is but a
feeble rendering of the original, which is pursuing, making ear-
nestly a point of hospitality." Chrysostom says, "He does not
say practising, but pursuing, teaching us not to wait for those
that are in need, but rather to run after them and track them out."
    5. "Live peaceably."— It may not be possible, but it must
not be our fault. As much as depends upon us, we should live in
peace. "Follow peace with all." Heb. 12:14; Rom. 14:19. We
may always have peace with God. Rom. 5:1.
    6. "Give place unto the wrath of God," R.V.— We should
leave all avenging of wrongs with God. He knows all motives.
He will deal justly — that which man can never do in his wrath.
Of Jesus it is said that He "committed His cause to Him that
 judgeth righteously." 1 Peter 2:23, margin.
    7. "By evil."— The Christian's weapons, motives, purposes,
are not retaliation, not to destroy. He is to return good for evil,
sweetness for the bitter. He will find that such things will be
 more effective for good than it would be to heap coals of fire
18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

on the head of an enemy. In his own life he is to fight the evil
by filling the thoughts, the heart, the life, with God. We never
put away evil, never overcome evil, by dwelling upon it. "Fill
our hearts with Thy love, that there may be no room for com-
peting affections," is a good prayer.

    19. What injunction includes all duties? Rom.
13 : 14.
                               Notes
   1. "Be subject."—Be cheerfully obedient. Neither follow
Gentile rebellions, nor imbibe the seditious spirit of the Jews;
for all authority is of God's ordaining or permission. ''His pre-
cepts regard an established power, be what it may. It, in all
matters lawful, we are bound to bey. . . . If the civil power
commands us to violate the law of God, we must obey God before
man. . . . These distinctions must be drawn by the wisdom
granted to Christians in the varying circumstances of human
affairs. They are all only subordinate portions of the great duty
of obedience to law. . . . But even when law is hard and un-
reasonable, not disobedience, but legitimate protest, is the duty
of the Christian."— Alford.
    2. "A • terror."— The tendency of all proper civil power is
salutary, notwithstanding the abuses in government. It would be
a fearful world if there were not civil, organized authority. The
worst of tyrannical government is better than wild anarchy.
    3. "God's minister."— Nebuchadnezzar, even in his proud
idolatry, is called God's "servant." He may not have known it,
but he was, nevertheless, the minister of God. This has no doubt
been true of other governments. Yet apart from .God's over-
ruling guidance, they have all shown the inherent,greed and per-
versity of fallen humanity.
    4. "Conscience' sake."— A higher motive than fear or force
actuates the Christian. His own conscience, "for the Lord's
sake," will keep him. He needs not laws to compel him or pre-
vent him, but to inform him as to what the proper authority re-
quires. So long as the authority of the government is exercised
in the sphere of civil authority, every true Christian will obey its
requirements.
    5. "Tribute."— The payment of money for the state. "Cus-
tom" is toll, or tax, on produce. "Fear" is to be exercised to-
ward those having power, set over us; and "honor" toward all
upon whom the state has conferred distinction.
    6. Dean Alford remarks: "Pay all other debts. Be indebted
in the matter of love alone. This debt increases the more, the
more it is paid, because the practise of hive makes the principle
of love deeper and more active."
    7. "Love . . . law."— Love toward God is unworthy of the
 name if it will not delight to keep God's law. Love fulfils the
law by doing it willingly, gladly.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      21
   8. "Knowing the time."—Vot mere duration, but the spe-
cial, appointed season, the character of the generation and the
period in which we live, foretold by great prophecies and signs.
   9. "As in the day."— God's children are of the day. The
revelers, the dishonest, the immoral, are of the night, and it is
toward the dawning of the morning that such a class are always
locked in deepest slumber.

                              Notes
   1. "Weak in the faith."— Alford suggests that this ''weak
in the faith" was probably the overscrupulous Jewish convert
afraid of meats offered to idols, or of being brought into contact
with undiscoverable uncleanness. In foreign lands he abstained
from prepared food, and ate only that which he could trace from
nature to his own use. Various ceremonial days had strong hold
upon a conscience not wholly enlightened and a faith not strong.
These converts were to be received as Christians, and their doubt-
ful thoughts not judged or condemned.
      2. "Not judge."— The very scrupulous should not "judge"
— condemn — his brother who eats, for God has received him.
The strong in faith should not " despise"— consider as of no
account — the brother who was wavering, doubtful, perhaps over-
scrupulous.
      3. "Shall be holden up."— Despite man's judgment, God is
able to make His children stand. One of the great, dominant
 thoughts of this chapter is, Judge not.
      4. "Every day."— By "every day" we must not conclude
 that the Sabbath is included. This is guarded in the great funda-
 mental law, the Decalogue, over which there can be no question.
 The expression means the "every day" of the days apart from
 the Sabbath, such as the Passover, day of Atonement, etc. See
 Ex. 16:4, where the term "every day" is used, including only
 "the six working-days." Compare Ex. 16:4, 27, 28; Eze. 46:1.
 The controversy and the questionings pertained to the national
 feast-days, as Passover, Pentecost, and others, which had been
 celebrated as a matter of lifelong habit by the Jews. As feasts
 of Levitical obligation they were no more of force after the cross,
 but as national festivals they had a strong hold upon many among
  the Jewish converts.
      5. "In his own mind."— God holds each one responsible.
  Each person must, or should, decide for himself. And this is true
  in moral as well as ceremonial observances. The power of choice
  is for each individual to exercise.
       6. "And he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth
  not regard it" is not found in the Revised Version, not being in
  the best Greek manuscripts.
       7. "Each one."— The great Judgment-day is an individual
   affair. We can not hide in the crowd, nor shield ourselves by
   some one else. We must then stand alone, face to face, so to
  speak, with God. He is the Lawgiver, He is the Judge. Bearing
   this in mind, we shall not care to judge or despise or condemn
   our brother. The great thought of the lesson will be ours, "Judge
 not, that ye be not judged."

 Note 6.
                             Notes
   1. "Judge this rather."— Let your judging, your discern-
ment, your criticism, turn upon your own acts. If you are strong,
look beyond yourself to your weak brother. "None of us liveth
to himself, and no man dieth to himself." More than your own
desire and tastes is the soul of your weak brother. Let no act of
yours put a stumbling-block or an occasion for stumbling in his
way. See Matt. 18:6.
   2. "Nothing unclean."— The uncleanness here referred to
must, in the light of the earlier part of the chapter, have refer-
ence to ceremonial uncleanness in that mixed church of Jew and
26           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Gentile converts. Nevertheless, if the conscience of the Christian
Jew said they were unclean, let him not violate his conscience.
To him they were unclean. Let him keep his conscience free.
    3. Your strong faith is good. Let it not justly be condemned.
    4. "Kingdom of God."— The kingdom of God is founded
upon the eternal principles of righteousness; and from that right-
eousness, received by faith, come peace and joy in the all-control-
ling Spirit of God. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His
righteousness," are the words of Jesus. Matt. 6:33.
    5. "Destroy not"-- Destroy neither yourself in overindul-
gence, nor your neighbor by a bad example.
    6. "Because he eateth not of faith."— Faith has respect to
God, and centers in Him. It has respect not alone to His prom-
ises, but to His precepts. In all things it defers to Him, yields to
Him. "Without faith it is impossible to please Him." Not to
please Him is to be out of harmony with Him, and out of har-
mony with God is sin.

  15. For what blessed experience in God's children
does the apostle pray? Verse 13. Note 6.
                              Notes
     1. "Please his neighbor."— Not to that neighbor's hurt, but
to that neighbor's good. The Christian is to npbuild his neighbor.
That is one of the purposes of the gifts. Eph. 4:12. This is the
law of God's kingdom,— every one in his .appointed place, every
one working for all others, and each served by all, blessed by all.
Only love can do this.
    2. "It is written."— The words quoted from this psalm are
addressed to the Father, not to man. But they show that Jesus,
while doing the Father's work, bore in His own person all the
reproaches that men had cast upon the Father. They show that
Jesus pleased not Himself.
     3. "Through patience and comfort of the Scriptures."—
 Through the patience and comfort which the Scriptures give, hope
 is born and confirmed in the hearts of the children of faith.
 "The expression, 'Whatsoever things were written aforetime,'
 applies to the whole ancient Scriptures (the Old Testament), not
 to the prophetic parts only."— Alford.
     4. Dwell on the clauses of the text —"the God of patience,"
 the long-suffering God; "the God of . . . consolation," the com-
 forting God; "like-minded one toward another," to build one
 another up; not according to the world, or our own limited, im-
 perfect way, but "according to Christ Jesus." Then will God
 indeed be glorified.
     5. The praise given to God shows how far His salvation ex-
 tended, and it included both Jew and Gentile. It all centers in
 the Root, our blessed Lord.
     6. "The God of hope."— The God of patience, or long-suffer-
 ing, is also the God of hope, the One from whom all our hopes
 spring, in whom they all center. The inspired prayer is God's
"promise to the children of faith. He will fill the believer with
 all joy and peace, that hope may abound. The power through
 which this is accomplished is that of the Holy Spirit.

Verse 33. Note 4.
                               Notes
• 1. "Another man's f oundation."— Paul wanted proof from
God for his own labors. He did not care or dare to speak of
others' work, but only of his own. Verse 18. He would lay but
the one foundation, Christ Jesus. 1 Cor. 3:11. Much of the suc-
cess of many evangelists is in building on the foundation laid by
devoted souls who have preceded them. Nearly all apostates who
have "greater light" tarry around churches, endeavoring to split
them, instead of working, and teaching the new theories which
they hold as light, in the new fields.
   2. "Journey into Spain."— It is a matter of dispute among
scholars as to whether the great apostle ever visited Spain. Such,
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    31
he tells us, was his intention. He did visit Rome, but under far
different circumstances from those he had planned. Yet with him
it was well. Rom. 8:28.
    3. "Debtors they are."— The world looks upon the spiritual
blessings lightly, upon the temporal as of far greater value. Yet
the temporal things perish with the using, the spiritual things are
eternal. Would that God's gifts might be better and more strongly
appreciated. We would then see that even our temporal things are
increased by them.
    4. "Peace."— In turbulent Rome, God's children had need of
peace. In this turbulent world, how much we need the "God of
peace" at all times! But this is the legacy which the blessed
Saviour left for His people here in the world. John 14:27.

                              Notes
   1. "Cenchrea" was the eastern part of Corinth, about nine
miles distant. It seems to have been a town of considerable im-
portance in thd apostle's day. It is now known as Kichries.
Phebe was a servant, or deaconess, at Cenchrea, and may well have
been the bearer of this epistle. Pliny, in his letter to the emperor
Trajan, speaks of two Christian handmaids whom he tortured, and
whom he declares were called ministree, or deaconesses.
   2. Priscilla and Aquila were among the strong lay helpers of
the gospel. Priscilla seems to have been the more prominent, as
her name is sometimes mentioned first. Paul first met them at
Corinth. Acts 18:2. They were natives of Pontus, and went with
Paul to Ephesus. Here they instructed Apollos in the truth.
They then went to Rome, and later returned to Ephesus. They
had gathered in Rome a church which met in their own house.
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      33

    3. EpEenetus, according to the Revised Version, was of Asia
instead of Achaia. We know naught of these persons only as they
are here mentioned by the apostle. It was good to know that
Paul had relatives in Rome, who accepted the truth before he
did, consequently were known to the apostles. Junia was prob-
ably the wife of Andronicus.
    4. Of this list of Christians (verses 8-15) we know naught,
save that Rufus is supposed to be the son of Simon of Cyrene.
Mark 15:21. The mother of Rufus seems also to have been like
a mother to Paul, one of the mothers whom Paul found by fol-
lowing Christ. Mark 10:29, 30. But all God's unknown workers
are recorded on high. The mention of these shows how Paul re-
garded individually his personal helpers.
    5. Rome was then the center of the world. All information
went out more readily from Rome to all parts of the empire than
from any other, center. Churches elsewhere became greatly in-
terested in the believers who were under the shadow of the palace
of the Cmsars. The apostle did not wish them to be wise in wick-
edness, but to know naught of it. We do not need to study
counterfeits to know the genuine, but we do need to know the
genuine that we may discern at once the counterfeit.
    6. A renewal, in promise, of the prophecy made 4,000 years
before. Gen. 3:15. At the very longest, the triumph of evil will
soon be over. The light afflictions are for a moment, the triumph
is an eternal weight of glory. 2 Cor. 4:17.

                               Notes
   1. Timotheus we know as Timothy, Paul's "son in the faith"
and fellow worker. For Lucius see Acts 13:1; Jason, Acts 17:5;
Sopater, Acts 20:4. The identity of none of these is certain, but
probable.
    2. Gains is mentioned in 1 Cor. 1:14 as having been baptized
by Paul. The word rendered "chamberlain" seems to refer to
treasurer, and it is so rendered by Alford and others. This shows
that the gospel had reached high official circles.
    3. God's great plan of salvation is not new. Sin did not take
Him by surprise. All the efforts of Satan against the govern-
ment of heaven have made more glorious God's love and mercy.
The death of Jesus, designed of the evil one to destroy the king-
dom of God, in God's wisdom opened up and revealed such depths
of God's love as amazed the universe. The silence of the ages
burst into an eternal song of praise.
    4. "Obedience."— This is the purpose of the gospel. The
"obedience of faith," the trusting, loving obedience of the child
to a father worthy to be loved. If the gospel fails in this, it
fails of its purpose. But, praise God, it never fails.'
    5. Amen.—` `Yea," "verily," "it is true." It is a Hebrew
 word meaning firm, constant, certain, sure. It affirms the truth
 of what is spoken. Let it be in us, all that God designs in this
 epistle, in Christ Jesus. For "all the promises of God in Him

 A note from the editor outlining the subject-matter
      that will appear in the next series of the



           Olgtuf of the Utme$
ft;     HE "Signs of the Times," in its next series, will
          contain as interesting matter as can be secured
          from the best talent in the Seventh-day Advent-
          ist denomination. Our leading men, not merely
          in this country, but in China, Japan, India,
          Africa, Europe, Australia, South America, and
the islands of the sea, have promised to contribute valu-
able articles upon various phases of our great message.
   Toward the close of the present series, and extending
well through the next, will be issued a line of articles
setting forth our educational principles, in which atten-
tion will be called to our schools in all parts of the
world. Illustrations of groups of young men and women
who are preparing to give this message to the ends of
the earth will appear in connection with these articles.
   In like manner there will be a series of articles giv-
ing the principles of health that we are taking to the
world, together with illustrations of groups of young
men and women who are training as physicians and
nurses in order that they may join in the great work of
giving the third angel's message.
   Similar articles will present a brief history of our
publishing work.
   There will also be a further line of articles giving a
brief account of our great missionary evangelistic work
and its miraculous spread into every part of the habit-
able globe.
   The object in presenting these four lines of special
articles will be to show the breadth and significance of
the great world-wide movement that we call the third
angel's message.
   Another special feature for the next series will be a
number of articles from the pen of Mrs. E. G. White on
the subject of "divine healing." These articles will be
a special help in dispelling the mists of Christian Science
and other such kinds of spurious faith healing.
    The next series begins May 1, and extends over a
period of six months. From the foregoing note by the
editor, the series will doubtless be one of the most in-
teresting yet produced.

    The Fundamentals
       of Geology
       Every person who would understand how to meet
     the present-day theories of geology and evolution as
     opposed to the Bible story of Creation should have this
     book. The fundamentals of geology, and the theories
     taught, are presented in a most interesting way.
     Maps and illustrations of great sections in Montana
     and Alberta                          where geological
     research is being                     carried on are
     given.
        In the closing                    chapter, where
     the evidence is                       grouped, the au-
     thor says: "And                      now geology,
     when allowed to                      give her testimo-
     ny in a thorough-                     ly scientific fash-
     ion, testifies to                     the same general
     truth regarding                       the great groups
     of plant and ani-                     mal forms, like
     physics and                          chemistry point-
     ing backward along the great perspective of the ages
     to the same vanishing-point, already charted long
     ago in the Christian Bible as the birthday of the
     world."
