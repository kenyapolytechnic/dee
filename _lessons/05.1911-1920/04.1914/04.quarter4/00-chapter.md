                       Introductory Note
   AUTHORSHIP.— There are several persons mentioned in the
New Testament bearing the name James : (I) the son of Zebe-
dee; Mark : 19, 20; 3 : 17 ; (2) the son of Alpheus, Matt. to: 3;
Mark 3: 18; (3) the Lord's brother, Matt. 13 : 55;'Mark 6 ;
(4) James the Less; Mark 15 : 40 ; (5) the brother of Jude, Jude
r. While there is some question as to the authorship of, the
epistle of .James, it is generally conceded that it was written
by James the Just, the Lord's brother. He is called "the Just"
by Josephus, who says that he was. celebrated for his integrity
and zeal., Dr. Adam Clarke says :. "Modern. critics are agreed,
with almost entire unanimity, that 'James the brother of our
Lord,' who seems to have been recognized as the chief minister
9f the church at Jerusalem, was the author of the epistle." "He
resided at Jerusalem, seems,.„to,„have been married 0 Cor. 9 : 5),
and was early a,re'cognized1eader in the church. Acts 12: 17;
21:..18; :Gal.. 2: 9, 12. He appears to have seen Christ shortly
before His ascension (1 Cor. 15 : 7), and to have presided over
the council held at Jerusalem A. D. 49. Acts 15: 13." ("Smith's
Bible Dictionary.")             ' •   '
    DATE AND PLACE.— There is some difference ,of opinion con-
cerning .the date . of the epistle, the latest date assigned being
A. D. 62. • "The epistle of James is generally supposed to have
been written at Jerusalem, about A. D. 61, by James .to jUst,
shortly before his death." (Id.)
    "Many expressions and references in the epistle make it
fully certain that it was written before the destruction of Jeru-
salem:.        It would seem, from a comparison of all the evidence
that can be made to bear upon the case, that the epistle could
not have- been :written earlier than A. D., 5o,..nor later than A. D.
62." Adam Clarke.

  15. What is possible to the one who believes God?
Mark 9 : 23.
                                 Notes
     t. James assumes no title. He does not claim to be the
 Lord's brother, or an apostle, or bishop at Jerusalem. He simply
 designates himself as "a servant of God," a title which is an
 honor above all others.
     He writes to the twelve tribes scattered abroad,—to all
 Christians. His exhortations to faith, stability, obedience,
 patience, and devotion to God, while equally applicable to any
 age and to any people, may be especially helpful to those who live
.through the conflicts of the last days.
    2. As the instruction given reaches down to the last days,
 and Christians are designated as "the twelve tribes which are
 scattered abroad," it shows that no Israel is now recognized but
 Christian, or spiritual Israel. This would explain how the sealing
 work of Rev. 7: 1-8, which gathers twelve thousand from each
 of the twelve tribes of Israel, can be fulfilled in the last genera-
 tion.
    3. "The word which is here translated 'temptation' signifies
 affliction, persecution, or trial of any kind ; and in this sense is
 used here."— Clarke.
     When temptations come, we are not to consider them as a
 punishment, or as some curse or calamity visited upon us because
 we are wicked. God's people in all ages have been tried, many
 even suffering death.
    4. The word "steadfastness" is given in the margin of the
 Revised Version instead of "patience." This gives the true idea.
 A person might seemingly be very patient and yet be very un-
 stable. The design of all trials is to develop steadfastness, and
 stability is wrought into the character of the person who patiently
 endures trials.
     5. Nothing presents a more striking symbol of unstability
 and restlessness than the surging, ever-changing, shifting waves
 of the sea, never at rest, always on the move, coming in and go-
 ing out, subject to wind and tide. Compare Isa. 57: 20, 21. The
 Lord does not want us to be like that. He exhorts us to be es-
 tablished on the immovable rock of faith. It is ask and receive ;
 seek and find. If we ask for wisdom, He will not upbraid us for
.ou.r_ignorance, but from the storehouse of His fulness, will
 liberalrvgiv_g to us all that we need.

    i. Among men there are clags distinctions, but all are one in
Christ Jesus. Christianity brings           up On the same level. The
true value of a man consists in moral worth. Character is what
the Lord considers ,of value.,, Christ•did.not. die for the:talented
and wealthy'only. He died(for all. .All have equ'alOiiii3Ortunity

trial that the chaff is separated from the wheat. 'There must,be
battle-fields in every life. Fire and hammer and- file- are - neces-
sary to give form to metal. So character is shaped and bright-
ened in trial. Those who faithfully endure the grinding, test-
ing process will receive the crown.
    3: The word "hist" here means desire.: . The source of all
temtitation is in man himself. There maY be induceinerit to sin';
but there must be some inclination, some desire for it, - to give
it power. If there were no desire, or appetite, for food, there
would be no temptation -to eat even if it were placed-before us.
The unrestrained man will be drawn along by his Own natural
 propensities to sin. Power over the sin in his own fleshly
heart is the need of every
    4. The wages, or reward, of sin is not eternal life iri misery,
and unspeakable torture in the lake of fire; but it is death, the
second death, in the "fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
The righteous receive the gift of God, eternal life; the wicked
 the opposite, eternal death.
    5. Error is darkness. Truth is light. Ignorance of the Scrip-
 tures and of the power of God is responsible for all the •error
and darkness that cover the earth, whether scientific or religious.
8          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   6. God is always the same, at all seasons and in all ages.
"For I am the Lord, I change not." There is no alteration in His
character, His purposes, His plans. What Be was in the eter-
nity of the past, He will be countless ages yet to come. Human
affairs change, nations pass away, but God is the same. We
have to-day the same blessed Christ that healed the sick and
comforted the sorrowful when on earth. Heb. I : 10-12; 13:8.
   7. The word from which the phrase "begat He us" is trans-
lated is the same that in verse 15 is rendered "bringeth forth."
Sin "bringeth forth" death, but the word of God "bringeth
forth" life. It is the voice of God, His word, that "bringeth
forth" the dead out of their dusty beds at the resurrection.

   14. How much is embraced in the expression "un-

   15., How thorough should be our surrender to God?
Rom. 12: I.
   16. To what should we not be conformed? What
transformation should be experienced? Why should this
change take place? Verse 2.
                             Notes
    I. "In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin." Prov.
to: 10. "He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life." Prov.
13: 3. "Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be
hasty to utter anything before God." Eccl. 5: 2. Many times we
have occasion to regret that we have spoken, but seldom that we
remained silent.
    2. The Revised Version reads the "implanted Word"; and in
the margin, the "inborn Word." The word of God implanted in
the heart creates us new creatures in Christ Jesus. "Having
been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorrupti-
ble, through the word of God who liveth and abideth." I Peter
I : 23, A. R. V., margin.
    3. It is not enough to look occasionally into the great mirror
of God's law ; because, as in looking into a glass, we soon lose
sight of the defects shown us. We should continually look into
the law of God, by which sin is revealed, not being forgetful
 0          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON. QUARTERLY,

hearers, but doers of the Word. (Some endeavor to destroy the
law, because it reveals defects and failures in their lives. This
is no'Nviser than it would be to da:h a mirror into fragments. lie-
cause it revealed defects in our persons or clothing. Such are
like the Hindu who, when the microscope made known to him
the fact that there were living Organisins in'the water he drank,
at once destroyed the microscope.
    4. "Many _will. be weighed in the balance and found wanting
in this matter of so great importance. Where are the Christians
who walk by this rule? Who will take God's part against the
evil speaker? who will please God, and, set a watch, a continual
watch, before the mouth, and keep the door of the lips? Speak
evil of no man. Hear evil of no man. If there be no hearers,
there will be no speakers of evil. If any one speaks evil in
your presence, check him. Refuse to hear him, though his
manner be ever ,so soft, and his accents mild. He may profess
attachment, and yet throw out covert hints and stab the char-
acter in the dark."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 2,
page 54.
    5. Much is said about the need of the physical nature for
Pure water, pure air, and pure food. But that which is of the
greatest importance is pure religion. It is possible to drink
pure water, breathe pure air, and eat pure food, and yet be cor-
rupt in heart, and have a censorious, domineering character.

                              Notes
   z. The Revised Version, margin, of this text reads, "My
brethren, do ye, in accepting persons, hold the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Lord .of glory?" None who profess the. pure
and undefiled religion of our Lord should countenance any. dis-
tinction, or manifest any partiality, among members of the
church, because of difference in wealth or social standing. We
are all one in Christ Jesus.
   2. While God is no respecter of persons, He is a respecter of
character. He will immortalize a 'pure and holy chafacter in His
I2          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON- QUARTERLY

kingdom. We, too, should love and respect good character, no
matter in whom it may be found.
    3. We are here cited to the higher, supreme law, before
which all will stand on an equality. There will- be no rich or
poor, no high or low. Right and wrong, guilt and innocence
alone will be considered. It is the "royal law" because it is the
law of the great King. Before this law all must how. By it
all differences must finally be settled.
    4. The moral law "is that revelation of the divine will which
relates to the duties men owe both to their Maker and to their
fellow men, or neighbors, as explained in Luke 10 : 33-37. This
law is spiritual and perfect, extending to all the inward creations
and outward actions of men, and can never be changed or an-
nulled.Binney's Theological Compend," page 153.)"

   14. What impressive illustration is given of a dead
 faith? Verse 26.
                              Notes
    i. "Can faith save him?"—Yes, real faith can save the soul.
"By grace are ye saved, through faith." "He that believeth
.     . shall be saved." Works can not save us. We are saved
by faith alone. But the writer of this epistle is seeking to show
that the mere profession of faith does not prove that we have
faith. James is setting forth the emptiness of the claim when
there is no fruit in the life as proof. A sign advertising wares
for sale is not sure evidence that the goods are within. The
meaning here seems to be that that faith which a man may claim
to have, but which does not manifest itself in a holy life, will
save no one, for it is not genuine faith.
    2. The apostle Paul speaks of the "work of faith." i Thess.
  : 3. Faith is living, and manifests itself in good works. That
kind of faith which will permit a man to say, "I have faith,"
and at the same time allow the destitute and naked to go unfed
and unclothed, when he might minister to their needs, is of no
 avail. It is dead. It does not exist in reality. Such a person
 does not really believe. He is professing to be what he is not.
 The fruit seen in the life will determine whether or not we have
 real faith. The tree is known by the fruit.
     3. "The word which is rendered 'yea' would be better ren-
 dered by 'but.' The apostle designs to introduce an objection, not
 to make an affirmation. The sense is, 'Some one might say,'
 or, 'To this it might be urged in reply.' That is, it might perhaps
 be said that religion is not always manifested in the same way,
 or we should not infer, because it is not always exhibited in the
14           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY


same form, that it does not exist:" One man may manifest it in
one way, and another in another, and still both have true piety:
One may be distinguished for his. faith, and another for his
works, and both may have real religion.":— Barnes.
    "But it must be a living faith — a' faith that showS'its sincer-
ity by the sacrifices of self which it makes, by the .works of love
which it performs. A merely intellectual orthodoxy may be held
by demons. A mere profession of faith may be worth no niore
than the body of a man without the breath of life. A true faith
loves, works, lives. It regulates the conscience, the. speech, and
the life, by the . conviction of God's constant presence; it shows
its appreciation of spiritual realities by separation from• the
world. It takes the law of God as a reality, and, bringing its
grand truths and inspiring motives to bear directly upon, the
conduct of every day, works by love."—"Bible in the Hoine,"
page 115.
    4. A.mere intellectual belief is not faith. It will save no„one.
The fallen angels intellectually believe in a God. They know
He exists. They have been in heaven. They know something
of His nature and majesty, though engaged in warfare against
Him. Their belief does not lead them to repentance. It terri-
fies them. They tremble at the knowledge of the 'future which
their belief reveals to them. Many have what 'might be termed
an intellectual belief in the existence of God; and in tliinspira-
tion of the Word, yet continue in sin:. Real faith 'leads to a refor-
Mation Of life, a surrendering of all to God, manifested in a seiv.
ice of love.
    5. "There are many who fail to understand the relation of
faith and works. They say, 'Only believe in Christ,-and you are
safe. You have nothing. to do with keeping the law'. ,are
genuine faith will be - manifest in obedience."="Patriarchs and
Prophets," pages 153, 154.

                                  Notes,
      i. The plan of this epistle seems to be to notice such things
as needed to be especially eori-ected. Some of the errors. and
improprieties that: .eNisted, among the people have .beeri rioticed
in . the.prieviotts ChaPter. Others are notieed in this chapter.
     The 12.eyiia.' 'Version'     thig'i;'erk reads, -"Be"-niit'inanY Of

 judgment.- "Evidently designed to censure the false mania for
 teaching, the dogmatizing contentiousness which is thoroughly
characteristic of Judaizing Christians." (Lange.)
    2. "He who truly masters his words will master his works."
    3. The Revised Version, margin, reads, "Behold, how great a
 forest is kindled by how small a fire!" The figure is that of a
wide-spread conflagration kindled by the incendiary work of an
unruly, unsanctified tongue.
    4. "Setteth on fire the wheel of nature." R. V. This indicates
how an unbridled tongue can completely possess and have a
reflex influence on the soul, changing the whole course of human
life into a great fire wheel of destruction. "Set on fire of hell."
The word "hell" is not here translated .from the word hades, or
the grave, but ge henna. The unsanctified, unruly tongue kindles
in the family, in the church, in the neighborhood, the flames of
gehenna --"fire of hell." We should individually take heed that
we do not kindle .the first spark of this awful devastation.
    How often this "fire of hell" has been kindled in churches
and communities by the improper use of the tongue! Nothing
will drive the Holy Spirit from the life more effectually than a
wrong use of this unruly member. An unbridled, unconsecrated
tongue may be a remorseless tool of Satan. There is no more
infamous instrument of evil than the tongue of the gossiper, the
tattler, the backbiter, and the slanderer. There are many tearful
eyes, broken hearts, ruined homes, and blasted lives, as the result
of the wrong use of the tongue. Churches-have been ruined
and neighborhoods disgraced by busybodies and scandal-mongers:-

   15. What is said of the wisdom from above? James

   16. How is the fruit of righteousness sown? By
whom is it sown? Verse 18. Note 7.
                            Notes
   I. "These things ought not so to be." That is, they must not
be, they are not fitting.
   2. No fountain is both sweet and bitter. Be the stream of
water ever so small that comes into the fountain of pure water
through some opening or fissure in the rock, the whole stream is
18         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

made bitter. No such inconsistency is found in nature as for a
fountain to send forth both fresh water and salt, and none such
should be found in the life of any individual, especially a Chris-
tian.
    3. Four illustrations are given, showing the inconsistency of
living such a contradictory life: (a) a fountain; (b) a fig-tree;
(c) a vine; (d) salt water. A fountain can not produce sweet
water and bitter; a fig-tree can not produce olive berries; a•vitie
can not bear figs; the sea can not yield fresh water. According
to the ordinary operations of nature, these things are iMpossible.
All these illustrations are used to show the utter impossibility of
depravity and virtue dwelling in the same heart, or of th_love
of God dwelling in the heart when hatred and maliee are
cherished.
    4. Proud, haughty, disdainful, unholy persons may pass for
great scholars, and have the reputation of being very learned,
but such do not have true wisdom. This comes from above, and
is revealed in a holy life.                           •
    5. That "the life is the light" is .true of Christ's followers
also. We are epistles known and read of men. Our words have
but little weight unless they are emphasized by a consistent life.
    6. "If ye be under the influence of an unkind, fierce,' and con-
temptuous spirit, even while attempting or pretending to defend
true religion, do not boast. . . . Ye have no religion, and no true
wisdom; and to profess either is to lie against the truth."—
Clarke.                                                          •
    7. "Sown in peace." Fields are not sown with grain in the
tumult of a mob, or in a battle. Nothing is more peaceful than
a farmer going forth with measured tread to scatter seed over
his field.
    "The whole effect, therefore, of religion is to produce peace.
It is all peace—peace in the original and in its results; in the'
heart of the individual, and in society; on earth, and in heaven."
— Barnes.

  16. What earnest admonition to personal godliness is
given? James 4:8. Note 7.
                             Notes
    I. Hitherto the instruction and admonitions seem to have
been somewhat general. But now the application is made more
personal: "Whence come wars and fightings among you."
    "Not public or national wars, nor yet conflicts in the courts,
but rather quarrels growing out of their selfishness and unchari-
tableness."— Clarke.
    2. "Ye have not, because ye ask not." One of the great
causes of all spiritual death, and strife in homes and churches,
is here pointed out. It is the lack of prayer.
    3. "The general sense is: If you prayed aright, this feeling
of continued craving after more of worldly things would not
exist. All your proper wants would be supplied ; and these im-
proper ones, which beget wars and fightings among you, would
not exist."— Alford.
    4. This world has its god. We can not worship the God of
heaven and the god of this world. Those who bow before the
god of this world are truly the enemies of God.
    "How strange it is that people professing Christianity can
suppose that with a worldly spirit, worldly companions, and their
lives governed by worldly maxims, they can be in favor of God,
or have a place in the kingdom of heaven! When the world
gets into the church, the church becomes a painted sepulcher, its
spiritual vitality being extinct."— Clarke.
     5.,The Revised Version, margin, reads: "Or think ye that the
 Scripture speaketh in vain? That Spirit which He made to dwell
in us yearneth for us even unto jealous envy." This rendering
contains a promise of the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit
 to resist envy.
     6. "The sure way to please God is to submit to the dispen-
 sations of His grace and providence ; and when a man acknowl-
 edges Him in all his ways, He will direct all his steps. The
 covetous man grasps at the shadow and loses the substance."

     7. "The heathen and the Jews were accustomed to wash
 their hands before they engaged in public worship. The par-
 ticular idea here is, that in order to obtain the favor of God, it
 is necessary to put away our sins; to approach Him with a pur-
 pose and desire to be pure and holy. The mere washing of the
 hands, in itself, could not recommend us to His favor; but that
 of which the washing of the hands would be an emblem would be
 accepted in His sight. It may he inferred from what is said
 here that no one can hope for the favor of God who does not
 abandon transgression."— Barnes.

  14. In what were they rejoicing? What is said of this

  15. What is the sad result of failing to do what we

                              Notes
    I. James continues his exhortation and admonition to those
who through lack of Christian experience were guilty of the
things mentioned in the previous lesson. Thorough repentance
and humiliation of heart are demanded from those who trans-
gress the instruction of the Lord.
    2. "Mourners and penitents lay on the ground and rolled
themselves in the dust. When comforted and pardoned, they
arose from the earth, shook themselves from the dust, and
clothed themselves in their better garments. God promises to
raise men from the dust, when they are truly humbled."—
Clarke.
    3. "There is nothing more decidedly condemned in the Scrip-
tures than the habit of pronouncing a judgment on the motives
and conduct of others. There is nothing in which we are more
liable to err, or to indulge in wrong feelings'; and there is noth-
ing which God claims more for Himself as His peculiar prerog-
ative."— Barnes.
    4. Those who judge usurp the office and prerogative of the
supreme Judge. As God alone knows the heart and can read the
motives, He alone can be the Judge. Those, therefore, who
assume to judge others, put themselves in the place of God,
which is the essence of the papacy.
 ' 5. The custom of ancient times is probably referred to here.
The people traded from city to city, carrying their goods on their
backs. Presumptuously planning concerning the things of this
life, while leaving God out of the reckoning, and taking no
account of the vicissitudes and uncertainties of life, is rebuked.
The evil of fixing a definite time, designating the exact period
(luring which they would remain, and when they would return,
without any reference to God's will or purpose, is pointed out.
This contains a searching lesson for this time.

   6. The Revised Version reads: "What is your life?. For ye
are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth
away." Surely man, being but vapor, has nothing whereof to
boast: How needful that he lay hold upon an enduring sub-
stance!
   7. "Not only oui- doing depends on the Will of the Lord, but
also, first of all, life itself."— Lange.

  15. Who is set forth as our example at this time?
Verse 10.
                                 Notes
     I. "The, term 'riches' is to be taken . . . generically for all
 kinds of property having a money value which is proverbially
 liable to loss or perishing."— Clarke.
     2. "A witness." "Their putrefied stores, moth-eaten garments,
 and tarnished coin are so many proofs that it was not for want
 of property that they did not help the poor, but through selfish-
 ness and avarice they defrauded the poor."
• "Eat your flesh as it were fire." "This is a very bold and
 striking figure. He represents the rust of their 'coin as becoming
 a canker that should produce gangrenes and phagedenous ulcers
 in their flesh, till it should be eaten away from their bones."—
 Clarke.
     3. "In a paper on 'The Concentration of Wealth,' Henry L.
 Call, of Washington, D. C., says : 'Fifty years ago there were
 not to exceed fifty millionaires in the United States, and their
 combined fortunes did not exceed probably one hundred million
 dollars, or one per cent of the then aggregate wealth of the
 nation. To-day a bare one per cent of our population owns
 practically ninety-nine per cent of the entire wealth of the
 nation.' "—"Capital and Labor."
     4. "And he doth not resist." The poor have no one to plead
 their cause while they are groaning under the load of injustice
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         25

and oppression. But if they wait patiently, the One into whose
ears their cry has entered will give justice and equity to all.
    5. The reference to the early and the latter rain has a broader
application. The early rain was the rain of seed-time, the latter
rain was the rain of ripening for the harvest. The first fell in
Judea about November; the second toward the end of April,
when the ears of grain were filling. Without these the earth
would have been unfruitful. In like manner the former rain of
the Spirit fell at Pentecost to water the seed. The latter rain
is to fall to ripen the harvest of the earth. We are to be patient
until then.
    6. In the time of trial, we are not to grow impatient, and
seek, as many do, to right wrongs by resorting to force and
questionable methods; but we should look forward patiently to
the time when Jesus will come, and render a just reward to every
man.
    7. "Groan not; grumble not; do not murmur through im-
patience ; and let not any ill treatment which you receive induce
you to vent your feelings in imprecations against your op-
pressors. Leave all this in the hands of the Lord."— Clarke.

  13. How does the Lord regard the saving of a soul?

  14. How is this same comforting truth expressed by
one of the prophets? Eze. 18 : 23 32.
                              'Notee
    s. "The end of the Lord." The word "end" here means
object. There was a purpose in the trial and affliction of Job."
The Lord was working toward an end. It is even so. in -the
trials and afflictions that He permits to befall each of us. .In•
trial we are to learn that the Lord is pitiful and compassionate.
    2. "Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the
judicial oath, in which God is .solemnly called to witness that
what is said is ale truth, and nothing but the truth. Jesus
Himself; at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse to
testify under oath. The high priest said unto Him, 'I adjure
Thee by the living God, that Thou tell us whether Thou be the
Christ, the Son of God.' Jesus answered, 'Thou hast said.' Had
Christ, in the Sermon on the Mount, condemned the judicial oath,
He would at His trial have reproved the high priest, and thus,
for the benefit of His followers, have enforced His own teach-
ing."—"Mount of Blessing."

   3. "The remedy is prayer.; not necessarily to obtain the reward
of trial, but at any rate for the increase of faith, to raise the
spirits, so that we be comforted and of good cheer."—"Speaker's
Commentary."
   4. "In the word of God we have instruction relative to special
prayer for the recovery of the sick. But the offering of such
prayer is a most solemn act, and should not be entered upon
without careful consideration. In many cases of prayer• for the
healing of the sick, that which is called faith is nothing .less than
presumption."—"Ministry of Healing," page 227. Read the entire
chapter on this subject.
    5. "It is labor lost to teach people to look to God as a healer
of their infirmities, unless they are taught ,also to       aside un-
healthful practises. In order to receive His blessing in answer to
prayer, they must cease. to do evil and learn to do well.' Their
surroundings must be .sanitary, their habits of life correct. They
must liVe in harmony with the law of God, both natural and
spiritual."— Id., pages 227, 228.
  •6. "If any who are seeking health have been guilty of evil
speaking, if they have sowed discord in the home, the neighbor-
hood, or the church, and have stirred up alienation and dissen-
sion; if by any wrong practise they have led others into sin, these
things should- be confessed before God' and before those who
have been offended."— Id., page 229.
    7. It would be helpful, in the study of this lesson, to read
carefully the story of Elijah's remarkable experience recorded
in. i .Kings, chapters 17, 18.
    We should remember that Elijah was a man like ourselves,
having the same passions and desires; and what God did for him
in answer to prayer, He is able and willing to do for us, if we
continue in prayer as Elijah did.

                                 Notes
    I. "The greatest sin which now exists in the church is covet-
ousness."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume I, page 194.
   2. "I saw that anciently the covetousness of some led them to
withhold a suitable proportion; they made their offering stinted.
This was recorded in heaven, and they were cursed in their har-
vest and their flocks just as they withheld. Some were visited
with affliction in their families. God would not accept a lame
offering."—Id., page 221.
   3. "The word of God defines covetousness as idolatry. It is
impossible for men and women to keep the law of God and love
money. The heart's affections should be placed upon heavenly
things. Our treasure should be laid up in heaven ; for where our
treasure is, there will our heart be also."—Id., volume 3, page 13o.
   4. "A concealed golden wedge and a Babylonish garment
troubled the entire camp of Israel. The frown of God was
brought upon the people because of the sin of one man. Thou-
sands were slain upon the field of battle because God would not
bless and prosper a people among whom there was even one
sinner, one who had transgressed His word."—Id., page 239.
   5. "I saw that many who profess to be keeping the command-
ments of God are appropriating to their own use the means
which the Lord has intrusted to them, and which should come
into His treasury. They rob God in tithes and in offerings.
They dissemble, and withhold from Him to their own hurt.
They bring leanness and poverty upon themselves and darkness
upon the church, because of their covetousness, their dissembling,
and their robbing God in tithes and offerings."— Id., page 269.
