                              Notes
   1. We may allow our thoughts to go back to that revealed
"beginning," when only the self-existent Father and His
only-begotten Son were in existence. God here inhabited
eternity. He was then the "true God," the "living God," the
"everlasting King," or "King of eternity." Jer. 10: 10, in-
cluding margin. Here is where God began His revelation of
 Himself, and here finite minds must stop. But in this eter-
nity of the past, God was, and with Him was His Son—the
Word.
   2. God might have remained alone with His Son. But, in-
stead, He purposed to create other beings to enjoy His love
and revealed goodness. So He chose to create other intelli-
gences upon whom or to whom He could exhibit His attri-
butes of holiness, justice, wisdom, goodness, and mercy. These
qualities of His character must have remained forever hidden
and dormant in the bosom of the eternal Father, if there had
not been beings created upon whom He could pour out that
wealth of divine love and mercy which was treasured in His
heart from the days of eternity. Hence seraphs, angels, and
men.
  3. Nothing is more plainly taught in Scripture than that God
was in no wise responsible for the entrance of sin; that there
was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace, no deficiency
in the divine government, that gave occasion for the uprising
of rebellion. Read "Great Controversy," chapter 29.
   4. How the divine attributes of .justice and mercy can be
harmonized, whereby God can be just and yet clear the guilty
—or save sinners while yet the law remains in force—is 'an
insoluble human mystery. But it has been gloriously wrought
out, in the development of the eternal purpose in Christ.
There is now no conflict between the divine attributes. "Mercy
and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 5

kissed each other." Ps. 85: 10. In the solution of this mys-
tery, the law, instead of being in any way lessened, has been
magnified. Isa. 42: 21.
  5. "Christ set up His tabernacle in the midst of our human
encampment. He pitched His tent by the side of the tents
of men that He might dwell among us, and make us familiar
with His divine character and life."—"The Desire of Ages,"
chapter 1, paragraph 15.

  16. By what means should we aid in the dissemina-
tion of spiritual light? John 1: 8; Acts 1: 8. Note 5.
                              Notes
   1. "God is light; and in the words, 'I am the light of the
world,' Christ declared His oneness with God, and His rela-
tion to the whole human family. It was He who at the begin-
ning had caused 'the light to shine out of darkness.' He is
the light of sun and moon and star. He was the spiritual
light that in symbol and type and prophecy had shone upon
Israel. . . . As the sunbeams penetrate to the remotest cor-
ners of the earth, so does the light of the Sun of righteous-
ness shine upon every soul."
   "When He spoke these words, Jesus was in the court of the
temple specially connected with the services of the Feast of
Tabernacles. . . . In the illumination of Jerusalem, the peo-
ple expressed their hope of the Messiah's coming to shed His
light upon Israel. But to Jesus, the scene had a wider mean-
ing. As the radiant lamps of the temple lighted up all about
them, so Christ, the source of spiritual light, illumines the
darkness of the world. Yet the symbol was imperfect. That
great light which His own hand had set in the heavens was
a truer representation of the glory of His mission.
   "It was morning; the sun had just risen above the Mount
of Olives, and its rays fell with dazzling brightness on the
marble palaces, and lighted up the gold of the temple walls,
when Jesus, pointing to it, said, 'I am the light of the world.'
. . . In the words, 'I am the light of the world,' Jesus de-
clared Himself the Messiah."—"The Desire of Ages," chapter
51, paragraphs 7, 2-4, 9.
   2. "He whose heart has responded to the divine touch will
be seeking for that which will increase his knowledge of God
and will refine and elevate the character. As a flower turns
to the sun, that the bright rays may touch it with tints of
beauty, so will the soul turn to the Sun of righteousness, that
Heaven's light may beautify the character with the graces of
the character of Christ,"—Id., chapter 51, paragraph 23.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7
   3. Lucifer himself, before his fall, was the covering cherub.
"He had stood in the light of God's presence. He had been
the highest of all created beings, and had been foremost in
revealing God's purposes to the universe."—Id., chapter 79,
paragraph 4. But he refused to walk in the light, and dark-
ness came upon him. If we fail to walk in the light, a simi-
lar condition will be ours. Jesus admoriished us against such
disaster. See Luke 11: 34, 35.
   4. "Of Gabriel the Saviour speaks, in the Revelation, say-
ing that 'He sent and signified it by His angel unto His serv-
ant John.' And to John the angel declared, 'I am a fellow
servant with thee, and with thy brethren the prophets.' Won-
derful thought—that the angel who stands next in honor to
the Son of God, is the one chosen to open the purposes of God
to sinful men!"—Id., chapter 10, paragraph 8.
   5. "We are witnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves the
working of a power that is divine. Every individual has a
life distinct from all others, and an experience differing es-
sentially from theirs. God desires that our praise shall as-
cend to Him, marked by our own individuality. These pre-
cious acknowledgments to the praise of the glory of His grace,
when supported by a Christlike life, have an irresistible
power, that works for the salvation of souls."—Id., chapter 36,
paragraph 15.

                             Notes
    1. This foundation was laid when God gave His only-begot-
ten Son to be the Saviour of the world. To believe on Christ
is to build on this sure foundation. Read Matt. 7: 24-27.
   2. From the days of Moses, God had been known as the
rock of refuge and the rock of salvation. God manifested in
the flesh was the rock foundation for the church. The union
of the divine and the human in Christ was to be brought out
in the church; and through this union, the church was to tri-
umph over all foes.
   3. "From eternal ages, it was God's purpose that every
created being, from the bright and holy seraph to man, should
be a temple for the indwelling of the Creator. Because of sin,
humanity ceased to be a temple for God. Darkened and de-
filed by evil, the heart of man no longer revealed the glory of
the divine One. But by the incarnation of the Son of God,
the purpose of Heaven is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity;
and through saving grace, the heart of man becomes again
His temple. God designed that the temple at Jerusalem
should be a continual witness to the high destiny open to every
soul."-"The Desire of Ages," chapter 16, paragraph 16.

   13. What will such a/church be to the world? Matt.
5:14.
                             Notes
   1. That the office of "elder" is the same as that of "bishop"
 may be seen by comparing 1 Tim. 3: 1-7 with Titus 1: 5-9.
 The correct meaning of the term "bishop" may be seen by
10          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 reference to the marginal reading of these passages as given
 in the Revised Version, where the word "overseer" is substi-
 tuted for "bishop." That the elder is an overseer is shown
 by 1 Peter 5: 1, 2, where it is stated that he is to take the
oversight of the flock, or church. The terms "oversight" and
"bishop" are derived from the same word.
   2. Observe that we have a duty toward the brother who has
transgressed against us. Even if we are conscious of having
done no wrong toward him, it is our privilege and our duty
to go to him in the love of Christ and seek to win him from
his evil way. In this, we have the example of Jesus, who
came to earth to seek and to save the lost sinner.
   "Henceforth, said Jesus, 'let him be unto thee as an heathen
man and a publican.' But he is not to be regarded as cut off
from the mercy of God. Let him not be despised or neglected
by his former brethren, but be treated with tenderness and
compassion as one of the lost sheep that Christ is still seek-
ing to bring to His fold."—"The Desire of Ages," chapter 48,
paragraph 36.
   3. "The church of Christ on earth was organized for mis-
sionary purposes, and the Lord desires to see the entire church
devising ways and means whereby high and low, rich and
poor, may hear the message of truth. Not all are called to
personal labor in foreign fields; but all can do something, by
their prayers and their gifts, to aid the missionary work.
   "An American business man, who was an earnest Christian,
in conversation with a fellow worker, remarked that he him-
self worked for Christ twenty-four hours of the day. 'In all
my business relations,' he said, 'I try to represent my Master.
As I have opportunity, I try to win others to Him. All day I
am working for Christ. And at night, while I sleep, I have a
man working for Him in China."—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 6, page 29.

that surround His throne."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Signs of the
Times, September 15, 1898.
   "Hearts that have been the battle ground of the conflict
with Satan, and that have been rescued by the power of love,
are more precious to the Redeemer than are those who have
never fallen. . . . He collected all the riches of the universe,
and laid them down, in order to buy the pearl. And Jesus,
having found it, resets it in His own diadem."—"Christ's Ob-
ject Lessons," page 118.
  2. "It is not the Lord's purpose that ministers should be left
to do the greatest part of the work of sowing the seeds of
truth."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 128.
  "To every man, God has appointed his work; not work in
his fields of corn and wheat, but earnest, persevering work
for the salvation of souls."—Id., volume 5, page 381.
  3. "He who is a child of God should henceforth look upon
himself as a link in the chain let down to save the world, one
with Christ in His plan of mercy, going forth with Him to
seek and save the lost."—"The Desire of Ages," chapter 45,
paragraph 30.
  4. During the seven years of the reign of Cyrus, the work
of rebuilding progressed, though hindered by the enemies of
the Jews. At the very beginning of the reign of Cambyses,
who succeeded Cyrus, the work was stopped (Ezra 4: 24), and
nothing more was done till the second year of Darius, a period
of ten years.
  5. "When the reproach of indolence and slothfulness shall
have been wiped away from the church, the Spirit of the Lord
will be graciously manifested. Divine power will be revealed.
The church will see the providential working of the Lord of
hosts. The light of truth will shine forth in clear, strong rays,
and as in the time of the apostles, many souls will turn from
error to truth. The earth will be lighted with the glory of the
Lord."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9, page 46.
  "If all who had labored unitedly in the work of 1844 had
received the third angel's message, and proclaimed it in the
power of the Holy Spirit, the Lord would have wrought
mightily with their efforts. A flood of light would have been
shed upon the world. Years ago the inhabitants of the earth
would have been warned, the closing work would have been
completed, and Christ would have come for the redemption of
His people."—Id., volume 8, page 116.
  6. "Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of Thy
power, in holy array: out of the womb of the morning Thou
hast the dew of Thy youth." Ps. 110: 3, A. R. V. "The work

women comprising our church membership rally to the work,
and unite their efforts with those of the ministers and church
officers."—/d., volume 9, page 117.

people offered themselves willingly, bless ye Jehovah." Judges
5: 2, A. R. V. "The greatest help that can be given our people

31. Note 5.                    Notes
   1. "We do not obtain a hundredth part of the blessing we
should obtain from assembling together to worship God."—
"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, page 362. This state-
ment should lead us to a very close and careful study as to
what our conduct in the house of worship should be, in order
to secure the fullness of the promised blessing. It is the pres-
ence of the Holy One that makes a place sacred and holy. It
was the presence of God in the burning bush that made the
spot so holy that Moses was bidden to take off his shoes before_
treading upon it.
   2. "The church is the sanctuary for the congregation.
There should be rules in regard to the time, the place, and the
manner of worshiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that
pertains to the worship of God, should be treated with care-
lessness or indifference. . . . When the worshipers enter the
place of meeting, they should do so with decorum, passing
quietly to their seats. . . . Common talking, whispering, and
laughing should not be permitted in the house of worship,
either before or after the service. . . . They'should remember
that heavenly messengers are in the house. . . . If, when the
people come into the house of worship, they have genuine rev-
erence for the Lord, and bear in mind that they are in His
presence, there will be a sweet eloquence in silence. The whis-
pering and laughing and talking which might be without sin
in a common business place, should find no sanction in the
house where God is worshiped."—Id., volume 5, pages 491, 492.
   3. "When the minister enters, it should be with dignified,
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  15

solemn mien. He should bow down in silent prayer as soon
as he steps into the pulpit, and earnestly ask help of God.. .
Every one of the congregation, also, who fears God, should
with bowed head unite in silent prayer with him, that God
may grace the meeting with His presence, and give power to
His truth proclaimed from human lips. . . . All the service
should be conducted with solemnity and awe, as if in the
visible presence of the Master of assemblies."—Id., volume 5,
pages 492, 493.
   4. "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth
is the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the
words spoken by Christ's representatives, are God's appointed
agencies to prepare a people for the church above, for that
loftier worship in10. which there can enter nothing that de-
fileth."—Id., volume 5, page 491.
   5. "Go early to church. Not only be punctual, but be in
your place before the hour announced for the service to begin.
   "Go in a reverent spirit. On the way, remember whither
you go. Avoid lightness of manner, and conversation on
worldly topics.
   "Before you enter and as you enter the church, breathe a
silent prayer of invocation for the influence of the Holy Spirit.
   "As you take your place, bow your head reverently in prayer
for yourself and for all others who enter the sanctuary.
   "Resolve that you will foster no thought, fix your eyes on no
object, utter no word, that will tend to divert your mind from
the holy purpose for which you have come into this place.
   "As the minister enters the pulpit, offer an earnest silent
prayer in his behalf.
    "In all the service, take an active part, as hearer, as wor-
shiper.
    "At the close of the service, after a moment of prayerful
 silence, greet with quiet cheerfulness and good will all whom
 you happen to meet, remembering that Christian fellowship is
 a part of Christian worship."—Bishop Vincent.

  16. The rather, what should our hearts lovingly and
continually be asking? Ps. 116: 12.

                           Notes
   1. "Satan's dominion was that wrested from Adam, but
Adam .was the vicegerent of the Creator. His was not an
independent rule. The earth is God's, and He has committed
all things to His Son. Adam was to reign subject to Christ.
When Adam betrayed his sovereignty into Satan's hands,
Christ still remained the rightful King."—"The Desire• of
Ages," chapter 13, paragraph 14.
   2. "This tree [the tree of knowledge of good and evil] God
reserved as a constant reminder of His ownership of all."
—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, page 386.
   3. "Numerous instances of the use of tithes are found both
in profane and also in Biblical history, prior to or independ-
ently of the appointment of the Levitical tithes under the
law. In Biblical history, the two prominent instances are:
1. Abram presenting the tenth of all his property, or rather
of the spoils of his victory, to Melchizedek (Gen. 14: 20; Heb.
7: 2, 6). 2. Jacob, after his vision at Luz, devoting a tenth
of all his property to God in case he should return home in
safety. (Gen. 28: 22.) "—"Smith's Bible Dictionary."
   4. "Men and women professing to be waiting and loving the
appearing of their Lord are shut up to self. The noble, the
godlike, they have parted with. . . . They talk of love to
God, but their fruits show not the love they express. They
rob Him in tithes and offerings, and the withering curse of
God is upon them. The truth has been illuminating their
pathway on every side. God has wrought wonderfully in the
salvation of souls in their own households; but where are
their offerings, presented to Him in grateful thanks for all
His tokens of mercy to them? . . . The sacrifice for man was
infinite, beyond the comprehension of the strongest intellect;
yet men who claim to be partakers of these heavenly benefits,
which were brought to them at so great a cost, are too thor-
oughly selfish to make any real sacrifice for God. Their minds
are upon the world, the world, the world."—"Testimonies for
the Church," volume 2, pages 197, 198.
   5. "When Satan declared to Christ, The kingdom and glory
of the world are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will
 I give it, he stated what was true only in part. . . . Satan
 can exercise his usurped authority only as God permits.

                           Notes
   1. "God has made men His stewards. The property which
He has placed in their hands is the means that He has pxo-
vided for the spread of the gospel. To those who prove them-
selves faithful stewards He will commit greater trusts."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets, page 529.
   "I was shown that the parable of the talents has not been
fully understood. This important lesson was given to the dis-
ciples for the benefit of Christians living in the last days.
And these talents do not represent merely the ability to
preach and instruct from the word of God. The parable ap-
plies to the temporal means which God has intrusted to His
people. Those to whom the five and the two talents were
given, traded and doubled that which was committed to their
trust. God requires those who have possessions here, to put
their money out to usury for Him,—to put it into the cause
to spread the truth. . . . I saw that some of God's professed
people are like the man who hid his talent in the earth. They
keep their possessions from doing good in the cause of God."
—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 1, pages 197, 198.
   "I saw that there are many who have wrapped their talent
in a napkin and hid it in the earth. They seem to think that
every penny which is invested in the cause of God is lost to
them beyond redemption."—Id„ volume 1, page 530.
   2. "The ruler's possessions were intrusted to him that he
might prove himself a faithful steward. . . . So God now in-
trusts men with means, with talents and opportunities, that
they may be His agents in helping the poor and the suffering.
He who uses his intrusted gifts as God designs, becomes a
coworker with the Saviour. He wins souls to Christ, because
he is a representative of His character."—"The Desire of
Ages," chapter 57, paragraph 17.
   3. "To every man God has appointed his work ; not work
in his fields of corn and wheat, but earnest, persevering work
for the salvation of souls."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
volume 5, page 381.
   "Satan is now seeking to hold God's people in a state of in-
activity, to keep them from acting their part in spreading the
 truth, that they may at last be weighed in the balance and
found wanting."—Id., volume 1, page 260.
   "The warfare has been left in our hands by our great Leader
for us to carry forward with vigor. We are not doing a
twentieth part of what we might do if we were awake."—Id.,
 volume 3, page 407.
   4. "Blameless, as the steward of God," is what the Bible
 says a man should be who accepts the responsibility of a
20     4    SA3BATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
bishop,—church elder. No man has any right to accept a
position of responsibility in the church who does not settle it
in his heart to render to God conscientiously and faithfully
that which He claims in tithes and offerings. The church
commits a wrong against herself, and against her Master and
 Head, in accepting or electing to office in the church a person
who is not faithful in these things.

  12. What reply did Eve make when questioned con-
cerning her sin? Gen. 3: 13. (Young's translation reads,
"The serpent hath caused me to forget.")
  13. Who causes us to forget the sacredness of devoted
things?
                         Notes
   1. "God never establishes arbitrary institutions nor promul-
gates arbitrary laws. This is just as true in the physical as
in the moral realm. Suns and planets were not made because
of nor for the law of gravitation, but the law of gravitation
was and is a necessity for the control of suns and planets.
Controlling and governing them, it controls and governs all
things else material. Its suspension or abrogation would
quickly result in wreck and ruin in the physical universe.
   "We were not made for the laws of health and right living.
They were made for us, and like all of God's laws, are the
very essence of kindness and good will. The 'shalt nots' of
the commandments, yea, of the entire Bible, are but another
name for signboards and red flags put up by loving hands to
warn us of danger, and apply alike to our physical, mental,
and spiritual well-being.
   "But 'shalt nots' are negatives, and exist only to warn us
against getting out of the positive path of right living and
doing. Over against every negative 'thou shalt not' signboard
 is a positive one, on which is plainly written, 'This is the way,
walk ye in it.' All of God's laws, both negative and positive,
 were enacted for our temporal, physical, and spiritual happi-
 ness and prosperity; and every one of His 'thou shalts' has
 back of it our need for doing just what He commands. His
 laws do not create duties. They define them. It follows that
 every moral law was a moral necessity before its enactment;
 and,without exception, a law that is a moral necessity is also
 a physical and material necessity."—"What We Owe and Why
 We Owe It," by A Layman.
22          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   2. "The law of the Sabbath, the seventh of time for rest and
worship, was necessarily- a law before its promulgation. It
had its origin in the necessities of our moral and physical na-
ture, and was therefore not an arbitrary act of divine legisla-
tion. It is a good law, not alone because God enacted it, but
also becauseLwe need it."—Id.
   3. It should be borne in mind that God's people lived in this
world two thousand years before the Bible was written. To
suppose that they did not know and recognize God's laws,
would be to suppose a government without laws. Rom. 2: 15
shows clearly that even in the hearts of heathen people there
are traces of the knowledge of the divine law.
   4. "This tenth, called Teru,moth, is ordered to' be assigned to
the Levites, as the reward of their service; and it is ordered
further, that they are themselves to dedicate to the Lord a
tenth of these receipts, which is to be devoted to the mainte-
nance of the high priest. (Num. 18: 21-28.) "—"Smith's Bible
Dictionary."
   5. "But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted
thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the chil-
dren of Israel." Joshua 7: 1, A. R. V. Achan thought to en-
rich himself by appropriating to his own use that which the
Lord had pronounced holy, and which had been devoted to a
sacred use.
   "Achan understood well the reserve made, and that the
treasures of gold and silver which he coveted were the Lord's.
He stole from God's treasury for his own benefit."—"Testi-
monies for the Church," volume 3, page 269.
   "If, when Achan yielded to temptation, he had been asked if
he wished to bring defeat and death into the camp of Israel,
he would have answered, 'No, no! is Thy servant a dog, that
he should do this great wickedness?'"—Id., volume 4, page
492.

12; Luke 21: 2-4.
                            Notes
   1. "Jesus had called His disciples that He might send them
forth as His witnesses, to declare to the world what they had
seen and heard of Him. Their office was the most important
to which human beings had ever been called, and was second
only to that of Christ Himself. They were to be workers to-
gether with God for the saving of the world. As in the Old
Testament the twelve patriarchs stand as representatives of
Israel, so the twelve apostles were to stand as representatives
of the gospel church."—"The Desire of Ages," chapter 30,
paragraph 6.
   2. "Their warfare is not to be waged, against flesh and
blood, but 'against the principalities, against the powers,
against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual
hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.' They are to con-
tend with supernatural forces, but they are assured of super-
natural help. All the intelligences of heaven are in this army.
And more than angels are in the ranks. The Holy Spirit, the
represer )-9.tive of the Captain of the Lord's host, comes down
to direct the battle. Our infirmities may be many, our sins
and mistakes grievous; but the grace of God is for all who
seek it with contrition. . . . 'Behold,' said Jesus, 'I send you
forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore wise .as
serpents, and harmless as doves.' "—Id., chapter 37, para-
graphs 11, 12.
   3. In the first chapter of Revelation, Christ represents
Himself as walking in the midst of the seven golden candle-
sticks, which symbolize His true church to the end of time;
and holding in His right hand the true and faithful ministers
of the church.
   "Jesus, as a personal Saviour, came to the world. As a
personal Saviour, He ascended on high. As a personal Sav-
iour, He intercedes in the heavenly courts. Before the throne
of God in our behalf ministers 'One like unto the Son of
man.' "—"Ministry of Healing," pages 418, 419.
   4. "The tithing system was ordained by God, and it had
been observed from the earliest times. Abraham, the father
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  25

of the faithful, paid tithes of all that he possessed."—"The
Desire of Ages," chapter 67, paragraph 21.
   "Never, by word or deed, did Jesus lessen man's obligation
to present gifts and offerings to God. It was Christ who gave
all the directions of the law in regard to tithes and offerings."
—Id., chapter 42, paragraph 8.
   "If He worked—and no one doubts that He did—He had an
income. That He tithed it we cannot doubt when we remem-
ber what He afterward said about tithing, to the Pharisees.
It is impossible to believe that our Saviour would say to the
Pharisees, that they ought not to leave a thing undone which
He did not recognize as a duty and which He Himself refused
to practices . . . While He was a workingman, He had some
kind of income. That He honored His God with His sub-
stance, and obeyed the law of the tithe, we have no right to
question."—"What We Owe and Objections to Paying It," by
A Layman.
    5. "It is the glory of our God to give. . . . All things
 Christ received from God, but He took to give. So in the
heavenly courts, in His ministry for all created beings;
 through the beloved Son, the Father's life flows out to all;
through the Son, it returns, in praise and joyous service, a
 tide of love, to the great Source of all. And thus through
 Christ, the circuit of beneficence is complete, representing the
 character of the great Giver, the law of life."—"The Desire
 of Ages," chapter 1, paragraph 7.
    6. "The twin laws that the seventh of our time and the
 tenth of our income shall be devoted in a special sense to God's
 service, have never been repealed or abrogated. . . . Yet
 neither of these laws, the law of the Sabbath or that of the
 tithe, was an arbitrary dictum of the Almighty. Both have
 their foundation in human needs, and both were promulgated
 for our benefit. . . . From the standpoint of health and
 physical well-being, to say nothing of both temporal and
 spiritual advantages, we cannot afford to ignore resting and
 changing the current of our thoughts every seventh day;
 neither from the standpoint of financial success in any true
 sense, to say nothing of spiritual uplift and growth, can we
 afford not to consecrate specially to God's service one tenth of
 our income."—"What We Owe and the Law Back of It," by
 A Layman.

           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 27

                           Notes
   1. "In placing among us the poor and the suffering, the
Lord is testing us, to reveal to us what is in our hearts. We
cannot with safety swerve from principle, we cannot violate
justice, we cannot neglect mercy. When we see a brother
falling into decay, we are not to, pass him by on the 'other
side."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, page 261.
   2. "In a special sense, Christ has laid upon His church the
duty of caring for the needy among its own members. He
suffers His poor to be in the borders of every church. They
are always to be among us, and He places upon the members
of the church a personal responsibility to care for :them.    .
   "As the members of a true family care for one another,
ministering to the sick, supporting the weak, teaching the
ignorant, training the inexperienced, so is the 'household of
faith' to care for its needy and helpless ones. Upon no con-
sideration are these to be passed by.. . .
   "The aged also need the helpful influences of the family. In
the home of brethren and sisters in Christ can most nearly
be made up to them the loss of their own home. If encouraged
to share in the interests and occupations of the household, it
will help them to feel that their usefulness is not at an end.
Make them feel that their help is valued, that there is some-
thing yet for them to do in ministering to others, and it will
cheer their hearts, and give interest to their lives.
   "So far as possible, let those whose whitening heads and
failing steps show that they are drawing near to the grave
remain among friends and familiar associations. Let them
worship among those whom they have known and loved. Let
them be cared for by loving and tender hands.
   "Whenever they are able to do so, it should be the privilege
of the members of every family to minister to their own
kindred. When this cannot be, the work belongs to the church,
and it should be accepted both as a privilege and as a duty.
 All who possess Christ's spirit will have a tender regard for
the feeble and the aged.
   "The presence, in our homes, of one of these helpless ones
is a precious opportunity to cooperate with Christ in His
ministry of mercy and to develop traits of character like His."
—"Ministry of Healing," pages 201, 204.
    3. "There are to-day close beside us many who are hungry,
 naked, and homeless. A neglect to impart of our means to
 these needy, suffering ones places upon us a burden of guilt
 which we shall one day fear to meet."—"Christ's Object Les-
 sons," page 261.
    4. "It should be written upon the conscience as with a pen
 of iron upon a rock, that he who disregards mercy, compas-
28          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 sion, and righteousness; he who neglects the poor, who ignores
 the needs of suffering humanity, who is not kind and courte-
 ous, is so conducting himself that God cannot cooperate with
 him in the development of character."—"Testimonies for the
 Church," volume 6, page 262.
    5. "We need not to go to Nazareth, to Capernaum, or to
 Bethany, in order to walk in the steps of Jesus. We shall
find His footprints beside the sick bed, in the hovels of poverty,
in the crowded alleys of the great city, and in every place
where there are human hearts in need of consolation. In do-
ing as Jesus did when on earth, we shall walk in His steps."
—"The Desire of Ages," chapter 70, paragraph 14.
   '6. "Thus in the night of spiritual darkness, God's glory is
to shine forth through His church in lifting up the bowed
down and comforting those that mourn. . . . God calls not
only for our gifts for the needy, but for our cheerful coun-
tenance, our hopeful words, our kindly handclasp. . . . There
are many from whom hope has departed. Bring back the sun-
shine to them. Many have lost their courage. Speak to them
words of cheer. Pray for them. There are those who need
the bread of life. Read to them from the word of God. Upon
many is a soul sickness which no earthly balm can reach nor
physician heal. Pray for these souls, bring them to Jesus.
Tell them that there is a balm in Gilead and a Physician
there."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 417, 418.

   14. What is the glory of the Christian home, and of the

                           Notes
  1. "Those who empty their hearts of vanity and rubbish,
through the giace of God may purify the mind, and make it
a storehouse of knowledge, purity, and truth. And it will be
continually' reaching beyond the narrow boundaries of worldly
thought, into the vastness of the infinite."-"Counsels to
Teachers," page 513.
  2. "The young man who makes the Bible his guide, need
not mistake the path of duty and of safety. That book will
teach him to preserve his integrity of character, to be truth-
ful, to practice no deception. It will teach him that he must
never transgress God's law in order to accomplish a desired
object, even though to obey involves a sacrifice."-Id., page
449.
  3. "The integrity of Joseph, and his wonderful work in
preserving the lives of the whole Egyptian people, was a
30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 representation of the life of Christ."—"Christ's Object Les-
 sons," page 286.
    4. David thought and purposed in his heart to build a
 house for God, though he was not permitted to accomplish
 the work. God was so pleased with David's purpose to do that
 good work, that He promised to establish David's house for
 time and eternity. God is no respecter of persons. He is
 looking to-day for hearts that are prompted, as was David,
 to do something for Him-; and every such one becomes con-
 nected with the "sure mercies of David."
    5. One of the later developments in connection with the
 third angel's message, has been the response, on the part of
,our great army of young people, to the call to organize.
    "There are many lines in which the youth can find oppor-
 tunity for helpful effort. Let them organize into bands for
 Christian service, and the cooperation will prove an assist-
 ance and an encouragement.. .
    "With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly
 trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a crucified,
 risen, and soon-coming Saviour might be carried to the whole
 world! How soon might the end come,—the end of suffering
 and sorrow and sin! How soon, in place of a possession here,
 with its blight of sin and pain, our children might receive
 their inheritance where 'the righteous shall inherit the land,
 and dwell therein forever ;' where 'the inhabitant shall not
 say, I am sick,' and 'the voice of weeping shall be no more
 heard.' "—"Education," pages 269, 271.,
    Q. "God will accept the youth with their talent and their
 wealth of affection, if they will consecrate themselves to Him.
 They may reach to the highest point of intellectual greatness;
 and if balanced by religious principle, they can carry forward
 the work which Christ came from heaven to accomplish."—

  1. "I will make an help meet for him"-not a helpmeet nor
a helpmate, but a help meet (two words) for him; that is, fit
or suitable for him. '
  "Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam,
signifying that she was not to control him, as the head, nor
to be trampled under his feet, as an inferior, but to stand by
his side, as an, equal, to be loved and protected by him. A
part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was
his second self ; showing the close union and the affectionate
attachment that should exist in this relation."-"Patriarchs
and Prophets." page 46.
32          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   2. "Every member of the family centers in the father.
His name, 'house-band,' is the true definition of 'husband.'
He is the lawmaker, illustrating in his own manly bearing the
sterner virtues, energy, integrity, honesty, and practical use-
fulness. The father is in one sense the priest of the house-
hold, laying upon the altar of God the morning and evening
sacrifice, while the wife and children unite in prayer and
praise. With such a household Jesus will'tarry; and through
His quickening influence, the parents' joyful exclamations
shall yet be heard amid more exalted scenes, saying, 'Behold,
I and the children whom the Lord hath given me.' "—"Testi-
monies for the Church," volume 1, page 547.
   "There are men in this church who feel that they should
teach the truth to others, while they are fretful, impatient,
and faultfinding in their own families. Such need that one
teach them, until they become patient, God-fearing men at
home. They need to learn the first principles of true religion.
They should seek God with earnestness of soul; for they have
been a scourge in their families, and as a desolating hail to
depress and destroy their brethren. These men do not deserve
the name of husband, `house-band'; for they do not bind the
family together with the Christian love, sympathy, and true
dignity of a godly life and Christlike character."—Id., volume
4, page 612.
   3. "Children who are allowed to come up to manhood or
womanhood with the will undisciplined and the passions un-
controlled, will generally in after life pursue a course which
God condemns."—Id., volume 5, page 38.
   4. No position in life is superior to that of the mother, no
influence more potent for good or evil. "All that I am or hope
to be, I owe to my . . . mother," said Abraham Lincoln. "All
that I have ever accomplished in life, I owe to my mother," de-
clared D. L. Moody. "A kiss from my mother," said Benjamin
West, "made me a painter." "My mother was the making of
me," declares the noted inventor, Thomas A. Edison. An-
drew Carnegie, the millionaire, who gave his mother his earn-
ings when a boy, adds, "I am deeply touched by the remem-
brance of one to whom I owe everything that a wise mother
ever gave to a son who adored her." It has been truly said
that "the home is the primeval school, the best, the most hal-
lowed, and the most potential of all academies, and that the
mother is the first, the most influential, and therefore the most
important of all teachers."
