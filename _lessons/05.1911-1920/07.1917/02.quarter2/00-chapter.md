  NOTE.—In the quotations often made in the notes from
Conybeare and Howson's "Life and Epistles of St. Paul,"
page references are not given, inasmuch as there are a vari-
ety of editions, variously paged. The book follows the order
of the story in Acts so closely that any reference can easily
be found. For brevity's sake, quotations from this book are

                      Lessons for Us
   1. The different parts of the world-wide field are to
help one another in the one work. Note 8.
   2. Notwithstanding the great service God had wrought
by Paul, the apostle waF not irritated by criticism, and
was ever ready to listev to counsel. Rom. 12: 3, 16.
   3. Even a strong point of character must be guarded,
lest it be overemphasized and carried too far. Note 9.
    4. Paul, in the confusion on the stairway, was calmly
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   5

thinking how he could secure an opportunity to testify
for Christ. 2 Tim. 4: 2; Isa. 26: 3.
                            Notes
   1. The same James who had presided at the conference re-
corded in the fifteenth chapter,—"James the Lord's brother."
Gal. 1:19.
   2. "The gathering of these contributions had cost the
apostle and his fellow workers much time, anxious thought,
and wearisome labor. The sum, which far exceeded the ex-
pectations of the elders at Jerusalem, represented many sac-
rifices and even severe privations on the part of the gentile
believers. These freewill offerings betokened the loyalty of
the gentile converts to the organized work of God throughout
the world."—`The Acts of the Apostles," page 399.
   3. Eight or nine years had passed since the conference at
Jerusalem had given Paul the right hand of fellowship to
"go unto the heathen." Gal. 2: 9. In these years, the mes-
sage had been carried by Paul and his associates into Europe,
as well as among Greeks and others in Asia Minor. It must
have been a stirring missionary report that Paul gave.
   4. "They felt that the methods of labor pursued by the
apostle bore the signet of Heaven. . . . This was the golden
opportunity for all the leading brethren to confess frankly
that God had wrought through Paul, and that at times they
had erred in permitting the reports of his enemies to arouse
their jealousy and prejudice. But instead of uniting in an
effort to do justice to the one who had been injured, they gave
him counsel which showed that they still cherished a feeling
that Paul should be held largely responsible for the existing
prejudice."—Id., pages 402, 403.
   5. "The brethren hoped that Paul, by following the course
suggested, might give a decisive contradiction to the false
 reports concerning him. . . . The Spirit of God did not
prompt this instruction; it was the fruit of cowardice."—Id.,
 page 404.
    6. "When we think of Paul's great desire to be in harmony
 with his brethren, his tenderness toward the weak in the
 faith, his reverence for the apostles who had been with Christ,
 and for James, the brother of the Lord, and his purpose to
 become all things to all men so far as he could without sac-
 rificing principle,—when we think of all this, it is less sur-
 prising that he was constrained to deviate from the firm,
 decided course that he had hitherto followed."—Id., page 405.
    7. "Asia"—not the continent, but the small province of
 Asia, of which Ephesus was the chief city. The Ephesian
6           SABBATH SUHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Jews had been among the gospel's bitterest opponents, and
they knew Paul at sight.
   8. The large gift that Paul and his associates brought from
the churches in Europe was an evidence of the unity of "the
organized work of God throughout the world." See Note 2.
One part of the gospel field was to help another. "That now
at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want,
that their abundance also may be a supply for your want:
that there may be equality." 2 Cor. 8: 14. The fields prayed
for one another more earnestly because of this sharing of
resources. 2 Cor. 9: 13, 14. Just so our Sabbath schools and
churches to-day, in all the world, unite in             forward
"the organized work of God throughout the world" by gifts
for missions and by prayer for the fields. It is the spirit
of the gospel.
   9. Paul was willing to be servant of all in 'order to win
souls. 1 Cor. 9: 22. But here he went too far. "He was not
authorized of God to concede as much as they asked. . . .
Instead of accomplishing the desired object, his efforts for
conciliation only precipitated the crisis."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 405. But it was an error of judgment in the
longing to help; and the Lord never forsakes the soul who
is trying to take the right course in a delicate situation. The
Christian is to stand for conciliation without compromise of
principle, and for loyalty to principle without uncharitable-
ness or fleshly stubbornness.

Verses 1, 2; Matt. 5:44; 1 Peter 2:21-23.
     2. The memory of what Christ has saved us from
should make us patient and sympathetic with those out
 of the way. Acts 22: 3, last part; Eph. 2: 1, 4, 5.
    3. The Christian is to witness to the personal experi-
 ence of the grace of God-"what thou hast seen and
heard." Acts 22: 15; Luke 8: 39.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   4. We need wisdom to know how to work to advan-
tage, studying times and seasons and conditions Acts
22: 19-21. Note 6.
                             Notes
   1. Christian courtesy rang out in those first words, "Breth-
ren, and fathers." Literally it was, "Men who are my breth-
ren." Paul's motto was, "The love of Christ constraineth
us." 2 Cor. 5: 14.
   2. Gamaliel was the most famous teacher of that time.
"His learning was so eminent and his character so revered,
that he is one of the seven who alone among Jewish doctors
have been honored with the title of `Rabban.' " He it was
who gave counsel against slaying Peter and others. Acts
5: 34-40. He was still living, an aged man, when Paul spoke,
but died three years later, while Paul was on his journey
to Rome. The burial honors of a king were given him, while
his pupil was to be put to death as a criminal. But in another
school, at the feet of the divine Teacher, this pupil had ex-
changed the dead forms of learned rabbinical teaching for the
life-transforming and saving truths of the gospel, "determined
not to know anything, . . . save Jesus Christ, and Him cru-
cified." 1 Cor. 2: 2.
   2. "Jesus of Nazareth"—literally, "Jesus the Nazarene."
Saul was going to cast the Nazarenes (so the Christians were
called, see Acts 24: 5) into chains and dungeons, when he was
stopped by the Lord, announcing Himself from heaven to be
"Jesus the Nazarene." Jesus is identified with His followers,
no matter how the world regards them. "He is not ashamed
to call them brethren." Heb. 2: 11.
   4. Saul saw that Just One, and heard His voice; and that
one glimpse of the Saviour's righteousness and forgiving love
won his soul, and changed his life. It was conversion. Not
with the same physical demonstration, but just as really,
Jesus, by. His Spirit, seeks to reveal Himself to every soul.
After seeing Jesus, it was Paul's work "to make all men see."
As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so Christ is
lifted up, that the dying may look and live. Have we looked?
 Let us keep "looking unto Jesus." And let us plead with
every unsaved soul to look. The apostle Paul was led to
repeat this story, that yet others might look and live.
            "When I survey the wondrous cross
              On which the Prince of glory died,
             My richest gain I count but loss,
              And pour contempt on all my pride."
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     9

            "Were the whole realm of nature mine,
               That were a tribute far too small;
             Love so amazing, so divine,
               Demands my life, my soul, my all."
  5. Note the tone of decision, and prompt, even quick obedi-
ence in the counsel of the man of God regarding baptism.
Many who have come quietly to believe by the study of the
Scriptures are too prone to delay open confession of Christ
and baptism.
  6. The testimony that can be borne in one place or at one
time may not always be the best in another place or at an-
other time. Paul was then willing to go right into Jerusalem,
where his prominence and experience would have stirred
things. "But it was not in harmony with the purpose of
God that His servant should needlessly expose his life. . . .
The departure of Paul suspended for a time the violent op-
position of the Jews, and the church had a period of rest, in
which many were added to the number of believers."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," page 130. Meanwhile Paul was win-
ning souls in the gentile field to which the Lord had called him.

                     Lessons for Us
   1. The Lord keeps the fully surrendered heart calm
amidst opposition and danger. Isa. 26: 3; Acts 21: 13.
See memory verse.
   2. We should never fail to be courteous, or hesitate
to withdraw the sharp retort. Acts 23 : 5. Quick apology
when betrayed into error is a sign of strength, not of
weakness. 1 Peter 3: 8, 9.
   3. The apostle was quick to use every circumstance
that could be turned to the advantage of the truth; as
birth and rights of citizenship (Acts 22: 25), and the
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 11

partial agreement of the Pharisees with a fundamental
Christian doctrine (Acts 23: 6).
   4. The Lord can overrule to His glory the consequences
of even a mistake in judgment, and wishes no sorrowing
believer to be discouraged. Verse 11; Ps. 103: 13, 14.
                           Notes
  1. "Accustomed to look upon themselves as the only people
favored by God, they were unwilling to permit the despised
gentiles to share the privileges which had hitherto been re-




                       MODERN TARSUS

garded as exclusively their own."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
pages 409, 410. Yet the promise to Abraham, whose children
they boasted of being, was that in him should "all nations be
blessed." Gal. 3: 8. No one can keep the truth of God who
does not pass it on to others.
  2. "He had not been able to understand the apostle's He-
brew speech; and when he saw its results, he concluded that
his prisoner must be guilty of some enormous crime; . . . and
before long, the body of the apostle was 'stretched out,' like
that of a common malefactor, 'to receive the lashes.'"—Cony-
beare and Howson.
  3. "The Valerian law forbade any Roman citizen to be
bound. The Porcian law forbade any to be beaten with
rods."—Clarke.
  4. "The apostle was now to be tried by the same tribunal
of which he himself had been a member before his conver-
sion."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 410.
  5. Paul did not know it was the high priest who spoke.
12         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

In reality, Ananias was not legally the high priest. He had
been deposed from the office for bad conduct, and sent to
Rome to answer. Released, he returned to Jerusalem, and
found that his successor had been assassinated, and the office
was vacant. "The Sanhedrin being destitute of a president,
Ananias appears to have discharged that office by his own
authority, and with much tyranny, and he might not then
have worn the robes of the high priest."—Henry and Scott.
But Paul respected the office, however perverted.
   6. Not only is the life to come dependent on the resurrec-
tion, so that there could be no gospel if the dead rise not, but
"if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised," and all faith
is vain. 1 Cor. 15: 16-18. The hope of the patriarchs and
the prophets, the hope of the gospel, centers in the doctrine
of the resurrection.
   7. "Later, while reflecting on the trying experiences of the
day, Paul began to fear that his course might not have been
pleasing to God. Could it be that he had made a mistake
after all in visiting Jerusalem? Had his great desire to be
in union with his brethren led to this disastrous result?. . .
Could it be that his work for the churches was ended, and
that ravening wolves were to enter in now? . . . In distress
and discouragement he wept and prayed. In this dark hour
the Lord was not unmindful of His servant."—"The Acts of
the Apostles," pages 412, 413.

                    Lessons for Us
   1. Man's extremity is God's opportunity. Memory
verse. Also Psalm 124.. Note 6.
   2. Though Paul had the promise of God that he would
be delivered (Acts 23: 11), he did all that human wis-
dom could suggest to aid himself. Verse 17; Matt. 10: 16.
                          Notes
  1. We are not told who these conspirators were, but recall
the fact that the Jews from the Ephesus district were the
ones who laid hands upon Paul in the temple, and were de-
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

termined to slay him. The success of the gospel among Jews
and gentiles in the province of Asia had stirred their rancor
to the utmost.
  2. These men knew the character of the priests, and did
not hesitate to ask their cooperation in the plan to commit
murder, to which they had bound themselves by a religious
oath, a "great" oath. The priesthood had traveled the down-
ward way so far that the buying and selling of preferment
was common, and the use of a class known as professional
assassins was not unknown in their own factional quarrels.
Jerusalem had long since filled out the measure of its trans-
gression (Dan. 9: 24), and now its cup of iniquity was over-
flowing, and the end of the once holy city was hastening
(Dan. 9: 26).
  3. It is the one glimpse we have of any of Paul's family;
and the youthful nephew appears but for a moment, as the
agent of Providence, and we see him no more. It is at least
pleasing to think that his loyalty to the apostle, and the evi-
dent abhorrence he had of the character of the Jewish leaders,
may have led him to decide fully for the truth.
  4. The "third hour of the night," or nine o'clock.
   5. Antipatris, between Joppa and Cmsarea, would be
reached a little after daylight, we are told.
  6. This psalm of deliverance (Psalm 124) was sung by a
Waldensian band in the Alps, as they were escaping from
the troops sent against them. They had been surrounded at
nightfall, on a mountain,. and the Catholic troops expected an
easy victory in the morning. But a cloud of mist came down,
thickly veiling the whole peak; and through this mist the
Waldensians escaped by goat paths, and when the mists lifted,
their enemies saw them far away across the valleys. The
story of God's providences is a wonderful one.

                           Notes
   1. Tertullus. "The name is Roman, and there is little doubt
that he was an Italian, and spoke on this occasion in Latin."—
Conybeare and Howson.
   2. The usual recourse was had to flowery and untruthful
flattery. Yet, while the character of Felix was base,—as the
Roman writer, Tacitus, says, "he exercised the power of a
king with the temper of a slave,"—he had put down the
bandits and robbers with an iron hand, and had pursued and
scattered the band of revolutionists led by the fanatical Egyp-
tian, for whom the Roman captain had at first mistaken Paul.
Acbs 21: 38. Paul's own manner of address, a few moments
later (verse 10), was respectful and complimentary, but
without false flattery.
   3. The climax of the accusation was the charge of profana-
tion of the temple. The Romans allowed the Jews to put any
Dne to death who was found polluting their temple. With
this, it was charged that Paul was a stirrer up of sedition,
the Jews knowing well that the Roman authorities were likely
to lay hands on any one raising sedition, with which they had
had so much trouble.
   4. Paul showed tliat he had not been long enough in Jeru-
salem to be the leader of a seditious party. He challenged
proof of the things charged. The Jews themselves were
seditious, and plotters against the superior civil authority,
which later they tried to overturn altogether. As a Chris-
tian, the apostle Paul was subject to the powers of govern-
ment in all things civil.
   5. Temperance means self-control, chastity. Felix was liv-
ing a vicious life, and the terrors of the coming Judgment
made him tremble.
   6. The inspired record leaves Felix in his baseness, doing
injustice to Paul to please the Jews. There had been an out-
break between the Jews and the gentiles in Caesarea; and
on accusation of the Jews, Felix had been called to account
by Nero, at Rome. He was pardoned, however, but apparently
never achieved distinction again, and he had turned from life
eternal. It is evident, from history, that Drusilla and her son
by Felix perished in the great eruption of Vesuvius, in A. D.
79. One of those shapeless human forms dug out of the ashes
and lava beds of Pompeii in recent years may represent the
wicked but beautiful princess who listened to Paul's sermon
that day in Caesarea, calling in vain to repentance before the
Judgment to come.

    2. Of what had Christ forewarned Paul, and what was

    3. How much depends upon the answer to the ques-
tion which seemed so trivial to the Roman governor?
Acts 25:9; 1 Cor. 15: 16, 17; Rom. 8: 10, 11.
                           Notes
   1. Porcius Festus was appointed by Nero, in A. D. 60. The
high priest was one Ishmael, appointed in A. D. 59, by King
Agrippa, who had the right of appointing the high priest.
That the Jews were so quick to approach Festus, after wait-
ing two years, shows that the spread of the Christian teach-
ing kept irritating them, and also that Paul was considered
a leader of the new movement.
   2. "But Festus held firmly to his purpose of giving Paul
a fair trial at Cmsarea. God in His providence controlled
the decision of Festus, that the life of the apostle might be
lengthened."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 429. The un-
prejudiced Roman governor was more susceptible to the in-
fluence of God's Spirit than the Jewish pri3sts who had year
after year been rejecting light and instruction.
   3. "The apostle knew that he could not look for justice from
the people who by their crimes were bringing down upon
themselves the wrath of God. He knew that, like the prophet
Elijah, he would be safer among the heathen than with those
who had rejected light from heaven and hardened their hearts
against the gospel. Weary of strife, his active spirit could
ill endure the repeated delays and wearing suspense of his
trial and imprisonment. He therefore decided to exercise his
privilege, as a Roman citizen, of appealing to Cmsar."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," page 430.
   When a Roman citizen appealed from the provincial court
to Cxsar, "pronunciation of the single word Appello [I ap-
peall was sufficient to suspend all further proceedings." The
apostle endured all manner of persecution without calling for
his enemies to be punished. And here his appeal was not to
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 19
bring charges against the Jewish leaders, but to save his life
from their hands. By no act of his own he had been placed
before the law in the imperial courts, and he only demanded
that he be tried according to law.
   4. Agrippa II was the great-grandson of Herod the Great,
who ordered the massacre of the children in his effort to
destroy the newborn King of the Jews. Matt. 2: 16-18. He
was son of Herod Agrippa I, who put James to death, and
who was smitten by the Lord in this same city of Cmsarea
for his blasphemous pride in allowing his flatterers to pro-
claim him a god. Acts 12: 1, 2, 21-23.
   5. "God desires His people to prepare for the soon-coming
crisis. Prepared or unprepared, they must all meet it; and
those only who have brought their lives into conformity to
the divine standard, will stand firm at that time of test and
trial. When secular rulers unite with ministers of religion
to dictate in matters of conscience, then it will be seen who
really fear and serve God. When the darkness is deepest,
the light of a godlike character will shine the brightest."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 431, 432.

   1. What is the hope for which we stand before the
world, even as Paul stood? Verses 6, 7; Acts 3:20, 21;
Titus 2: 13, 14.
   2. What should we ever remember as we meet op-
posers?—That they may be sincere but uninstructed, and
are to be enlightened and won if possible. Acts 26 : 9 ;
2 Tim. 2:24, 25.
   3. How closely is Jesus associated with every child
of His on tri61? Acts 26: 14; Matt. 25: 40; Isa. 63:9.
                           Notes
  1. Not as a guilty criminal cringing before the judge, but
as a witness and pleader for a great cause, the apostle stood
before the assembly. His hand, though possibly the one from
which a chain was hanging, was stretched forth in gesture to
command attention, after the manner of the practiced orator.
  2. Agrippa and Bernice were wicked and corrupt, despicable
in character. But the apostle respected the position of author-
ity the king held; and, moreover, it was his opportunity to
bear witness before a king who needed help, and before the
great of earth who had seldom heard the gospel. His manner
was respectful and courteous; and throughout his address, we
hear him appealing to this wicked king and his wicked sister
to turn to God.
   3. The apostle's argument is but alluded to in the nar-
rative. It must have begun with the promise made in Eden
of a deliverer, and with the promise to Abraham; and the
apostle showed how the very things for which the people of
Israel had hoped, were to come through Jesus, the Messiah.
   "He showed how the Old Testament Scriptures had declared
that the Messiah was to appear as a man among men; and
how in the life of Jesus had been fulfilled every specification
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

outlined by Moses and the prophets. For the purpose of re-
deeming a lost world, the divine Son of God had endured the
cross, despising the shame, and had ascended to heaven tri-
umphant over death and the grave."—"The Acts of the Apos-
tles," page 436.
   4. "With you" is in the plural, taking in the whole assembly.
The fulfillment of the hope of Israel was dependent upon the
resurrection. Abraham and all the faithful were dead, yet
God had promised an everlasting inheritance to them.
   5. The Presbyterian commentator, Dr. Albert Barnes, says,
"None but a madman will persecute men on account of their
religious opinions."

    1. What manner of response should ever be given to
the call of duty? Verse 19; Ps. 119: 60.
    2. As the apostolic preaching was a witness to ful-
filling prophecy in that generation, so now the gospel
carries a message of prophecy fulfilling in our own gen-
eration. Acts 26: 22; Rev. 14: 6, 7.
    3. What lesson comes in Agrippa's reply?—The peril
of stopping just short of full surrender—almost but not
quite ready. Matt. 24: 44; 25: 10-13.
             "Almost persuaded now to believe;
                Almost persuaded Christ to receive.
              Seems now some soul to say,
                Go, Spirit, go Thy way;
              Some more convenient day,
                On Thee I'll call."
                              Notes
   1. No difficulties, no fleshly or selfish considerations, made
 the apostle hesitate. Gal. 1: 15, 16. As he had opposed Jesus
 ignorantly but conscientiously before, now he just as whole-
 heartedly threw himself into Christ's service.
   2. Paul's message was a witnessing to fulfilling prophecy.
24         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

With all the preaching of the way of salvation through faith
in Christ, there was mingled the testimony to the fulfillment
of prophecy in that day and generation. This was the bur-
den of the first sermon preached by Peter after Pentecost.
Acts 2: 16.
   3. As all roads in the ancient empire led to Rome, so every
line of thought in the Holy Scriptures had been leading to
Christ, the Messiah. John 5: 45, 46.
   4. As Paul made the appeal direct to the wicked king, it
is plainly apparent that it was Agrippa, and not Paul, who
was on trial that day.
   5. "Deeply affected, Agrippa for the moment lost sight of
his surroundings and the dignity of his position. Conscious
only of the truths which he had heard, seeing only the humble
prisoner standing before him as God's ambassador, he an-
swered involuntarily, 'Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 438.
   6. The governor had hoped that the king, with all his knowl-
edge of Jewish matters, would be able to give counsel as to
formulating the charge to be sent to Rome. Acts 25: 26.
But at the end of the hearing, the conscience-stricken king
could only bear witness that Paul was not deserving of pun-
ishment of any kind.

                            Notes
  1. "One circumstance greatly lightened the hardship of his
lot,—he was permitted the companionship of Luke and Aris-
tarchus. In his letter to the Colossians, he afterward referred
to the latter as his 'fellow prisoner' (Col. 4: 10) ; but it was
from choice that Aristarchus shared Paul's bondage, that he
might minister to him in his afflictions."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 440.
   Aristarchus had passed through some stirring experiences
before this, in his service with the apostle. Acts 19: 28, 29.
   2. How cheering is the token of providential care at the
beginning of a difficult undertaking! The Lord knows the
need of a word of encouragement or a token of His comforting
presence as one enters into the experience.
  3. The fast was that of the day of atonement, on the tenth
day of the seventh month, as the marginal reading states.
Lev. 23: 27, 29. Farrar says that in this year, it probably
fell on September 24. The Jewish season for navigation was
closed, but the gentile navigators continued somewhat later.
  4. The ship's small boat had been towing behind, but now
they hoisted it aboard; and with the danger of the ship timbers
springing, thus letting in water, ropes were passed around
the ship and drawn tight.
  5. "For fourteen days they drifted under a sunless and
starless heaven. The apostle, though himself suffering phys-
ically, had words of hope for the darkest hour, a helping
hand in every emergency. He grasped by faith the arm of
Infinite Power, and his heart was stayed upon God. He had
no fears for himself; he knew that God would preserve him
to witness at Rome for the truth of Christ. But his heart
yearned with pity for the poor souls around him, sinful, de-
graded, and unprepared to die. As he earnestly pleaded with
God to spare their lives, it was revealed to him that his
prayer was granted."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 442.

   2. What is the secret of good cheer amidst trial?
Acts 27: 25 ("I believe God") ; Rom. 9:38, 39.
                           Notes,
   1. We may well understand that Paul's words were not
in the irritating or boaitful spirit of "I told you so." "He
reminds them of his earlier warning in order to more readily
persuade them to follow his present counsel."
   2. What a picture—the hopeless company, Paul at peace
and in communion with God amidst the confusion and the
noise; and then an angel of light, from the throne of God,
standing by Paul amidst the driving wind and the flying
spray. Paul has passed away, but that angel still lives.
"Whose I am, and whom I serve." It was the motto of Paul's
life. He belonged to God, and his one business was to serve
Him. Whenever his work was finished, he was ready.
   3. Paul has been called "an apostle of encouragement."
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    29
Speak the word of cheer and courage. "This ministry of
cheer is always needed in life voyages, and never more needed
than it is to-day."
  4. The company needed food for their health, as well as
encouraging words for their souls. The angel that found
Elijah the prophet discouraged, first of all fed him. 1 Kings
19: 4-7.
  5. The Roman soldier was supposed to forfeit his life if
a prisoner intrusted to him escaped. The proposition was
not a strange one. Acts 12: 19; 16: 27.
  "The plan would have been executed at once, but for him
to whom all alike were under deep obligation. Julius, the
centurion, knew that Paul had been instrumental in saving
the lives of all on board; and, moreover, convinced that the
Lord was with him, he feared to do him harm."—"The Acts
of the Apostles," page 445.

care of his ever present Saviour. Verse 5; Mark 16: 18;
Ps. 139: 1-3, 9, 10.
    2. Whether temporarily or permanently settled in a
place, every place is a missionary field. Acts 28: 9;
2 Cor. 2: 14; 4: 10.
    3. God having promised to bring Paul to Rome (Acts
23: 11), no storms could keep him from reaching that
city. Even so no storms of opposition can keep the trust-
 ing believer from the overcomer's portion in the city of
God. Rev. 3 : 21.
                          Notes
   1. The modern name is Malta, now a British naval station.
It is sixty miles from the island of Sicily, and two hundred
from the African coast. A bay on the north side of the
island has been named St. Paul's Bay, where it is supposed
the party landed.
   2. To the Greeks, all were "barbarians" who did not speak
Greek. The people were of Phoenician origin. It was prob-
ably late in October, and already the chill nights and mornings
of autumn had begun. The kindness shown by the islanders
was repaid in blessings later.
   3. Worn with watchings and exertion, the aged apostle
was nevertheless not one to sit quietly while work was to be
done. He was "instant in season" not only in preaching the
Word, but in doing any other task.
   4. Weymouth's translation: "Now in the same part of the
32         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

islarld there were estates belonging to the governor, whose
name was Publius. He welcomed us to his house, and for
three days generously made us his guests. It happened, how-
ever, that his father was lying ill of dysentery aggravated
by attacks of fever; so Paul went to see him, and, after
praying, laid his hands on him and cured him."
   5. November, December, and January had been spent in
Malta, evidently; and with early February, the Alexandrian
grain ships were again moving toward Italy. Syracuse was
the great port of Sicily; and at Rhegium, at the toe of the
Italian boot, the apostle first touched Italy. The company
landed at Puteoli, on the present Bay of Naples.
   6. The apostle may have stopped the seven days in order
to spend the Sabbath with the believers, even as once before
he had tarried at Troas seven days (Acts 20: 6, 7) in order
to spend a Sabbath there, leaving early Sunday morning.
   7. Paul was always cheering others on. It was because he
drew courage for himself from every token of God's good-
ness and every memory of Christ's loving grace.
   "It was with a heavy heart that Paul went forward to his
long expected visit to the world's metropolis. How different
the circumstances from those he had anticipated! How was
he, fettered and stigmatized, to proclaim the gospel? His
hopes of winning many souls to the truth in Rome, seemed
destined to disappointment. . . . Suddenly a cry of joy is
heard, and a man springs from the passing throng and falls
upon the prisoner's neck, embracing him with tears and re-
joicing, as a son would welcome a long absent father. Again
and again is the scene repeated, as, with eyes made keen by
loving expectation, many discern in the chained captive the
one who at Corinth, at Philippi, at Ephesus, had spoken to
them the words of life. . . . Few realize the significance of
those words of Luke, that when Paul saw his brethren, 'he
thanked God, and took courage' In the midst of the weeping,
sympathizing company of believers, who were not ashamed
of his bonds, the apostle praised God aloud. The cloud of
sadness that had rested upon his spirit was swept away. . . .
Bonds and afflictions awaited him, he knew; but he knew also
that it had been his to deliver souls from the bondage infi-
nitely more terrible, and he rejoiced in his sufferings for
Christ's sake."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 448, 449.

                    Lessons for Us
   1. What may Christians expect to meet from the

Acts 28: 22; John 15: 18-20.
    2. Yet of what must we have a care in facing the

the church to-day? Matt. 24: 14; Rev. 14: 6.
                          Notes
  1. If Paul had been teaching that the seventh day was no
longer the Sabbath, he could not have said this to the Jews.
How quickly such teaching would have brought the apostle
into controversy!
  2. Paul's appeal to Cmsar was not to accuse any, or to
plead for the punishment of persecutors. He had simply
used his rights as a Roman citizen to prolong his opportunity
to bear witness to Christ, and to prevent his being thrown
into the hands of ecclesiastics who would quickly have si-
lenced his testimony.
   3. "Everywhere." The word shows how the gospel had
spread, and the "reproach of Christ" followed it.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    35

   4. Paul's first trial before Nero was delayed these two
years by the failure of his accusers to present themselves.
"In the providence of God, this delay resulted in the further-
ance of the gospel. . . . During, this time, the churches that
he had established in many lands were not forgotten. . . .
The apostle sought so far as possible to meet their needs by
letters of warning and practical instruction. And from Rome
he sent out consecrated workers to labor not only for these
churches, but in fields that he him<•elf had not visited. . . .
Thus, while apparently cut off from active labor, Paul ex-
erted a wider and more lasting influence than if he had been
free to travel among the churches as in former years."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pages 453, 454.
   During this first imprisonment, he evidently wrote the
epistles to the Ephesians, the Colossians, the Philippians, and
Philemon. In Philemon 22, the apostle told of his plan to
visit the churches again.
   5. All authorities agree that Paul was acquitted at his trial,
and that he left Rome in time to escape the persecution that
followed the burning of Rome, which Nero charged upon
the Christians.
   "He sought to establish a firmer union between the Greek
and the Eastern churches, and to fortify the minds of the be-
lievers against the false doctrines that were creeping in to cor-
rupt the faith."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 487, 488.
   "We must acknowledge (unless we deny the authenticity
of the pastoral epistles to Timothy and Titus) that after St.
Paul's Roman imprisonment, he was traveling at liberty in
Ephesus (1 Tim. 1: 3), Crete (Titus 1: 5) , Macedonia (1 Tim.
1: 3), Miletus (2 Tim. 4: 20), and Nicopolis (Titus 3: 12),
and that he was afterward a second time in prison at Rome
 (2 Tim. 1: 16, 17)."—Conybeare and Howson.
   6. The chronology of events in these years, as nearly as
students have worked it out, is as follows:
        Paul's arrival in Rome,                   A. D. 61
        Trial and acqUittal,                       " 63
        Burning of Rome,                           " 64
        Paul's condemnation and martyrdom,         " 68
   During the visit to Greece and Macedonia and Asia, the
apostle wrote the epistle to Titus and the first to Timothy;
the second epistle to Timothy, 'so full of courage and trust,
his last message to the church, being written in Rome, after
his condemnation. It is supposed that Paul must have been
 executed in May or June, A. D. 68; and the middle of June
brought the suicide of Nero, forsaken of all. What a contrast
36         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 between the lives and the end of the great emperor and the
 great apostle! The following scene in Paul's trial before
 Nero is pictured by the spirit of prophecy:
   "The vast hall was thronged. . . . As he gazes upon the
 throng before him,—Jews, Greeks, Romans, with strangers
 from many lands,—his soul is stirred with an intense desire
 for their salvation. He loses sight of the occasion, of the
 perils surrounding him, of the terrible fate that seems so
 near. He sees only Jesus, the Intercessor, pleading before
 God in behalf of sinful men. . . . His words are as a shout
of victory above the roar of battle. He declares the cause
to which he has devoted his life to be the only cause that can
never fail. . . .
   "Light shone into the minds of many who afterward gladly
followed its rays. The truths spoken on that day were des-
tined to shake nations, and to live through all time. . . .
Never before had Nero heard the truth as he heard it on
this occasion. . . . The light of heaven pierced the sin-
polluted chambers of his soul. . . . He feared the apostle's
God, and he dared not pass sentence upon Paul, against whom
no accusation had been sustained. A sense of awe restrained
for a time his bloodthirsty spirit. For a moment, heaven was
opened to the guilty and hardened Nero. . . . The invitation
of mercy was extended even to him. But only for a moment
was the thought of pardon welcomed. Then the command was
issued that Paul be taken back to his dungeon; and as the
door closed upon the messenger of God, the door of repentance
closed forever against the emperor of Rome."—"The Acts of
the Apostles," pages 494-496.
   Of Paul's last moments we read: "As he stands at the place
of martyrdom, he sees not the sword of the executioner
or the earth so soon to receive his blood; he looks up through
the calm blue heaven of that summer day to the throne of
the eternal. . . . His faith is strengthened as he calls to mind
how patriarchs and prophets have relied upon the. One who
is his support and consolation. . . . From the rack, the stake,
the dungeon, from dens and caves of the earth, there falls
upon his ear the martyr's shout of triumph. . . . His mind
grasps the Saviour's promise, 'I will raise him up at the last
day.' His thoughts and hopes are centered on the second
coming of his Lord. And as the sword of the executioner
descends, and the shadows of death gather about the martyr,
his latest thought springs forward, as will his earliest in the
great awakening, to meet the Life-giver, who shall welcome
him to the joy of the blest."—Id., pages 511-513.
