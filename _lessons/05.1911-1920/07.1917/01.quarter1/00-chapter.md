Lessons on the Book of Acts
                  SENIOR DIVISION
                  FIRST QUARTER
                      • 1917
                      Introductory Note
   As we begin the third quarter's lessons on the book of
Acts, it will be helpful to take a brief survey of this remark-
able book.
   1. The writer of the book is Luke. Compare Acts 1: 1
with Luke 1: 1-4.
   p. It is supposed to have been written about A. D. 65.
   3. The time covered is about thirty-three years, or about
the length of time that Christ was upon earth.
   4. The important geographical centers are the three cities,
Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome. Jerusalem, was the center of
Judaism, Rome of gentile-dom, and Antioch, it seems, the
center of gentile Christianity. It will be helpful to locate
these places on the map.
   5. In the first section of the book, chapters 1-12, the apostle
Peter seems to be the most important character, beginning
especially at Pentecost. In the remainder of the book, the
leading character is the apostle Paul. Peter's message seemed
to be more especially to the Jews, while Paul's was to the
gentiles.
   6. Throughout the record of chapters 13-20 Paul is at lib-
erty, and during this time made three missionary tours, and
raised up and established a number of churches. From chap-
ters 21-28 he is in bonds.
   The book of Acts, as one writer says, "records the advent
and the activities of the Holy Spirit."
    The importance of this quarter's lessons is emphasized
when we consider that two of the wonderful missionary tours
of the apostle Paul are to be studied. We should constantly
keep in mind that the great work which is here recorded was
 done in the years immediately following Pentecost, or the
time of the "former rain." Then the gospel was carried to
 all the world in one short generation (Col. 1: 23). Under the
ministration of the Spirit in the "latter rain" the gospel of
 the last message will again be carried to all the world in one
 generation.

  LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 15: 1-21.

  MEMORY VERSE: "We believe that through the grace of the

ter? What were they to write to all the churches?
Verses 19, 20.
   16. Why was it thought unnecessary to give all the
details? Verse 21.
                       Lessons for Us
   1. The question at Jerusalem involved the whole ques-
tion of salvation,— whether we have something to do
to win salvation, or whether it is a free gift.
   2. We should lay perplexing questions involving prin-
ciple before the brethren for counsel. Verse 2.
   3. Delegates were chosen to represent the various,
churches, and the decisions arrived at were to be re-
spected by all. Note 9.
    4. We should report what the Lord is doing in different
fields, and how churches are being established through
 the gospel message. Verse 3.
    5. The fact that James was the presiding officer would
 indicate that Peter did not understand that he was a pope
 and head of all the churches. Verse 13.
                            Notes
  1. This council was held at a time between the first and
second missionary tours of the apostle Paul in Asia Minor.
While there is a difference of opinion as to the year, it prob-
ably was about A. D. 48.
  2. The history of the church records difficulties, contro-
versies, and corruptions. There was a Judas among the
apostles, and Ananias and Sapphira in the church following
Pentecost, the misunderstandings and murmurings of the Gre-
cians and Hebrews, etc. But none of these things indicate that
6           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the gospel preached was not the truth. It is worthy of note
that these "false brethren" then found their field of activities
in the church, creating dissension and confusion, instead of
pushing out into a lost world, bringing souls to Christ and
establishing a work of their own. The work of the "false
brethren" was to destroy and not build up. It is the same now
as in the early church.
   3. "The Pharisees had been the companions of St. Paul's
younger days. Death had made many changes in the course
of fifteen years; but some must have been there who had
studied with him 'at the feet of Gamaliel.' Their opposition
was doubtless embittered by remembering what he had been
before his conversion."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle
Paul," Conybeare and Howson, People's Edition, page 189.
   4. "Far more was involved than any mere opposition, how-
ever factious, to individual missionaries, or than the severity
of any conditions imposed on individual converts. The ques-
tion of liberty or bondage for all future ages was to be de-
cided; and a convention of the whole church at Jerusalem was
evidently called for."— Id., page 189.
   5. "Peter related the plain interpretation of these words,
which was given him almost immediately in his summons to
go to the centurion and instruct him in the faith of Christ.
This message showed that God was no respecter of persons,
but accepted and acknowledged all who feared Him. Peter
told of his astonishment when, in speaking the words of truth
to those assembled at the home of Cornelius, he witnessed the
Holy Spirit taking possession of his hearers, gentiles as well
as Jews."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 193.
   6. "This yoke was not the law of Ten Commandments, as
some who oppose the binding claims of the law assert; Peter
here referred to the law of ceremonies, which was made null
and void by the crucifixion of Christ."— Id., page 194.
   7. "But the opinion of another speaker still remained to be
given. This was James, the brother of the Lord, who, from
the austere sanctity of his character, was commonly called,
both by Jews and Christians, 'James the Just.' No judgment
could have such weight with the Judaizing party as his. Not
only in the vehement language in which he denounced the sins
of the age, but even in garb and appearance, he resembled
John the Baptist, or one of the older prophets, rather than
the other apostles of the new dispensation."—"Life and Epis-
tles of St. Paul," Conybeare and Howson, pages 191, 192.
   8. This allusion to the rebuilding of the house of David that
"is fallen,"" as spoken by Amos, is especially interesting, show-
ing, as it does, that the true house of David, or the true Is-
rael, are those of all nations who become one with Christ by
faith. See Gal. 3: 29; Eph. 2: 11-13; Hosea 2: 23; Rom. 9:
25, 26.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  9. "The entire body of Christians was not called to vote
upon the question. The 'apostles and elders,' men of influence
and judgment, framed and issued the decree, which was there-
upon generally accepted by the Christian churches. Not all,
however, were pleased with the decision; there was a faction
of ambitious and self-confident brethren who disagreed with it.
These men assumed to engage in the work on their own re-
sponsibility. They indulged in much murmuring and fault-
finding, proposing new plans, and seeking to pull down the
work of the men whom God had ordained to teach the gospel
message. From the first the church has had such obstacles
to meet, and ever will have till the close of time."—"The Acts
of the Apostles," pages 196, 197.

                     The Narrative

  12. Where did they go? What did they do? Verse 41.
                      Lessons for Us
  1. We should receive the news from the council of God's
people with joy. Verse 31.
  2. The presiding presence of the Holy Spirit should
be recognized in the deliberations of the church. "It
seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us,"- the Holy
Spirit first. Verse 28.
  3. It is well at times to revisit churches which have
been established and see how they do.
  4. The account of Paul's second missionary journey is
covered in Acts 15: 36 to 18: 22.
  5. Those leading out in the work may conscientiously
differ in judgment. Acts 15: 39.
                          Notes
  1. "They carried with them the decree which was to give
peace to the consciences that had been troubled by the
Judaizing agitators; and the two companions, Judas and
Silas, who traveled with them, were empowered to accredit
their commission and character. It seems also that Mark
was another companion of Paul and Barnabas on this jour-
ney; for the last time we had occasion to mention his name
was when he withdrew 'from Pamphylia to Jerusalem (page
144), and presently we see him once more with his kinsman
at Antioch."-Acts 15: 37. "Life and Epistles of the Apostle
Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 196.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   9

   2. Notice the expression in verse 28: "It seemed good to
the Holy Ghost, and to us." The Holy Spirit is recognized
as the One who presided in the council, and equally respon-
sible in formulating the decrees. The presiding presence
of this third person of the Godhead in our assemblies and
councils is too often overlooked.
   3. "These two disciples remained some short time at An-
tioch. They were possessed of that power of 'prophecy' which
was one of the forms in which the Holy Spirit made His
presence known; 'and the Syrian Christians were 'exhorted
and confirmed' by the exercise of this miraculous gift. The
minds of all were in great tranquillity when the time came
for the return of these messengers 'to the apostles' at Jeru-
salem. Silas, however, either remained at Antioch, or soon
came back thither. He was destined, as we shall see, to be-
come the companion of St. Paul, and to be at the beginning
of the second missionary journey what Barnabas had been
at the beginning of the first."— Id., pages 197, 198.
   4. Gospel workers may learn a lesson from the watchful-
ness of the apostle Paul over those whom he had brought
to Christ through his ministry. Having seen the baneful
fruit of apostasy, and the distracting influence of false
teachers, who, not by open antagonism, but rather by clan-
destine intrigue, came spying around the church to pull down
what he by hard labor had built up, he bent all his energies
to save the flock from being deceived. He warned "every
one night and day with tears" in order that he might "present
every man perfect in Christ Jesus."
   5. "How could Paul consent to take with him a companion
who would really prove an embarrassment and a hindrance?
Such a task as that of spreading the gospel of God in a hostile
world needs a resolute will and an undaunted courage. And the
work is too sacred to be put in jeopardy by any experiments.
Mark had been tried once and found wanting. . . . And
Barnabas would not be without strong arguments to defend
the justice of his claims. It was hard to expect him to resign
his interest in one who had cost him much anxiety and many
prayers. His dearest wish was to see his young kinsman
approving himself as a missionary of Christ."— Id., page 217.
   6. We see here the great apostle with Silas as his compan-
ion starting on his second great missionary journey, begin-
ning about A. D. 51 and continuing till about A. D. 54.
   This second tour seems to have originated in a desire ex-
pressed to Barnabas, that they should revisit all the cities
where they had preached the gospel, and founded churches.

    13. What woman is especially mentioned as among the

    14. How is her thorough conversion indicated? Verse
15. Note 5.
                          Lessons for Us
    1. The youth should be taught the Scriptures from a
.child, as Timothy was. •2 Tim. 1: 3-5; 3: 14, 15. Note 6.
    2. Where no principle of right is at stake it is wise to
 give consideration to what others may think. Paul cir-
 cumcised Timothy "because of the Jews that were in
 those parts." Acts 16: 3, A. R. V.
    3. We should pray for, and expect the guidance of, the
 Holy Spirit in our work. Verses 7-9.
    4. We may win by being found where "prayer was wont
 to be made." Verse 13.
                              Notes
    1. Timothy was doubtless one who accepted the gospel
 under the labors of Paul on his first missionary tour. That he
 was a genuine convert is evidenced by the good report which
 the church gave of him.
    2. "The expression in the original means, 'he was a born
 Greek.' The most natural inference is, that his father was
 living, and most probably not a proselyte of righteousness,
 if a proselyte at all."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle
 Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 229, note.
    "As a precautionary measure, Paul wisely advised Timothy
 to be circumcised — not that God required it, but in order to
 remove from the minds of the Jews that which might be an
 objection to Timothy's miriistration."—"The Acts of the
•Apostles," page 204.
    3. "Here again we are taught a new and vital lesson. The
  Holy Spirit is shown to us in another of His acts of adminis-
 tration: the double guidance of the apostle and his companion;
 on the one hand prohibition and restraint, on the other per-
 mission and constraint. They are forbidden in one direction,
  invited in another; one way the Spirit says, 'Go not;' the
 other He calls, `Come'— not into Bithynia, where they assayed
  to go, but into Macedonia, where He had a mission for them
  to accomplish in introducing the gospel into Europe.""The
  Acts of the Holy Spirit," pages 120, 121.
    4. In verses 4, 6, 7, Luke, the writer of the Acts, speaks of
  Paul and those who were with him in the third person, "They
  went through the cities," "When they were come." This would
  indicate that Luke was not one of the company. In verse 11,
  he changes to the first person, "We came with a straight
12          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

course," etc., which would indicate that he was one of the
company, having evidently joined Paul and Silas at Troas.
   5. "Lydia, being convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, and
having made a profession of her faith, was forthwith baptized.
The place of her baptism was doubtless the stream which
flowed by the proseucha [place of prayer]."—"Life and Epis-
tles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 255,
People's Edition.
   6. "From a child, Timothy knew the Scriptures; and this
knowledge was a safeguard to him against the evil influences
surrounding him, and the temptation to choose pleasure and
selfish gratification before duty. Such a safeguard all our
children need; and it should be a part of the work of parents
and of Christ's ambassadors to see that the children are
properly instructed in the word of God."—"Testimonies for
the Church," volume 4, page 398.

                           Notes
   1. "This woman was a special agent of Satan, and had
brought to her masters much gain by soothsaying. Her in-
fluence had helped to strengthen idolatry. Satan knew that
his kingdom was being invaded, and he resorted to this means
of opposing the work of God, hoping to mingle his sophistry
with the truths taught by those who were proclaiming the
gospel message."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 212.
   2. The rebuking and subjugating of the demoniacal spirit
with which this woman was possessed was a manifestation
of the power of the gospel over the forces of evil. The words
of the Saviour are: "Behold, I give unto you power to tread
on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the
enemy,: and nothing shall by any means hurt you." Luke
10: 19. This same power should attend the gospel now.
   3. "The jailer fulfilled the directions of the magistrates
with rigorous and conscientious cruelty. Not content with
placing the apostles among such other offenders against the
law as were in custody at Philippi, he 'thrust them into the
inner prison,' and then forced their limbs, lacerated as they
were, and beeding from the rod, into a painful and con-
strained posture, by means of an instrument employed to
confine and torture the bodies of the worst malefactors."--
"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and
Howson, page 262.
   4. These inner prisons of the ancient world were such as
that into which Jeremiah was let down with cords, and
where he sank "in the mire." Jer. 38: 6. In these damp,
dark, pestilential cells the chains are said to have rusted on
the limbs of the prisoners. The legs, arms, and neck of
offenders were confined and stretched in the stocks, produc-
ing excruciating torture. In such a place, their bodies lacer-
ated and bleeding, the apostles were heard singing a duet
of praise and thanksgiving to God. No murmuring or com-
plaining. What a beautiful' esson of trust in God is here
presented!
  5. "The earthquake was not a mere coincidence. There
was more here. Earthquakes do not throw all bolted doors
open, and unclasp fetters and chains. God was here. He
was breaking a way for His gospel to the heart of heathen-
dom. But His mercy followed close in the heavy steps of
His power. The jailer, like a true Roman, was about to
execute himself for the loss of his prisoners, as he supposed.
Paul arrests the attempt. The marvelous story of his con-
version follows."—"Introduction to the Book of Acts," Stif-
ler, pages 157, 158.
   6. "Philippi is famous in the annals of suicide. Here
Cassius, unable to survive defeat, covered his face in the
empty tent, and ordered his freedmen to strike the blow. His
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   15

messenger Titinius held it to be a 'Roman's part' to follow
the stern example. Here Brutus bade adieu to his friends,
exclaiming, 'Certainly we must fly, yet not with feet, but
with the hands;' and many, whose names have never' reached
us, ended their last struggle for the republic by self-inflicted
death. Here, too, another despairing man would have com-
mitted the same crime, had not his hand been arrested by
an apostle's voice. Instead of a sudden and hopeless death,
the jailer received at the hands of his prisoner the gift both
of temporal and spiritual life."—"Life and Epistles of -the
Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, pages 265, 266.
  7. The law of Rome made it a crime to scourge a Roman
citizen or deprive him of liberty without a fair trial. The
apostles, knowing this, stood upon their rights as citizens.
  8. "In Paul's time, Roman citizenship conferred freedom
from, corporal punishment, the right of appeal to the em-
peror against the sentences of magistrates, the right to hold
office, and exemption from direct taxation."—"Te'achers'
Testament," Nelson, note.

                      Lessons for Us
   1. Power attends the word of God when spoken in
faith. 1 Thess. 1: 5.
   2. Much trial and affliction are sometimes experienced
in establishing the work of the gospel. 1 Thess. 1: 6; 2: 2.
   3. Those who are Christians should give the light to
others. 1 Thess. 1: 7, 8. Note 5.
   4. Those who preach the gospel may sometimes be
looked upon as traitors. This was involved in the charge
that the apostles claimed another king than Csar.
Acts 17: 7.
  5. It is sometimes wise when persecution is manifested
in one place to go quietly to another. Verse 10.
  6. The Word is the standard by which to test what is
being taught. Verses 11, 12.
                            Notes
  1. "Thessalonica.- A city of Macedonia, now called Sa-
lonica."-"Twentieth Century Dictionary."
   Notice the words, "they had passed." (Compare Acts 17:
1 and 16: 10-13, 16, 17.) It is evident from this that Luke
is not with them and writes as a historian and not as an
eyewitness. This perhaps explains why the narrative of
events at Thessalonica is quite general, while that of Philippi
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   17

is more in detail. Luke does not appear to be with Paul
again until the time of his second visit to Macedonia on his
third missionary tour. See Acts 20: 4-6. Timotheus howelier
seems to have rejoined Paul and Silas either at Thessalonica
or Berea.
  2. While it might be inferred from Paul's statement that
he preached "three Sabbath days," that his stay was limited
to this time, many Bible writers think that he remained a
longer time.
   3. Paul, as a great gospel preacher, did not dwell upon the
social and ethical questions of his time, but proclaimed with
power the vital truth of Christianity from the Scriptures.
He preached in verity the word of God.
   4. "The length of St. Paul's stay in the city is quite un-
certain. From the fact that the Bereans were occupied 'daily'
in searching the Scriptures for arguments to establish or
confute the apostle's doctrine, we conclude that he remained
there several days at least. From his own assertion in his
first letter to the Thessalonians, that, at the time when he
had been recently taken away from them, he was very anx-
ious, and used every effort to revisit them, we cannot doubt
that he lingered as long as possible in the neighborhood of
Thessalonica."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul,"
Conybeare and Howson, page 294.
   5. Thessalonica was a seaport of great commercial impor-
tance at that time. As news from there would be carried
throughout a wide, area, it is quite probable that the disorderly
demonstrations, as well as the miraculous demonstration in
the deliverance of Paul and Silas, were very widely known.

           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 19

                         Lessons for Us
   1. We may be well versed in the wisdom of this world
 and not knoW the true God. Verse 23.
   2. The gospel must be made known to the learned as
well as the unlearned. Verse 19.
   3. The Lord is very near to all, even to those who may
 not know Him. Verses 27, 28.
   4. We are responsible for the light that has come to
 us. Verse 30.
   5. Later Paul at Corinth said he "determined not to
know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him
crucified." 1 Cor. 2: 2. Does this not imply that his
course at Athens in meeting logic with logic, and philoso-
phy with philosophy, was not the wisest way?
   6. Honest souls may be found among those who mock.
Acts 17: 34. Note 7.
                             Notes
   1. The city of Athens was famed for its architecture and
art, and for the education and intelligence of its people. But
it was nevertheless shrouded in heathenism. Statues of gods
and deified heroes were to be seen in every direction. Temples
and sanctuaries with their altars and filled with idols were
on every hand. There were the sculptured forms of Minerva,
Jupiter, Apollo, and a sanctuary to Bacchus. There were
statues of the great men of Athens, such as Solon and Demos-
thenes. There were deified heroes of mythology. "Thus,
every god in Olympus found a place in the Agora. But the
religiousness of the Athenians went even further. For every
public place and building was likewise a sanctuary. The
Record House was a temple of the mother of the gods. The
Council House held statues of Apollo and Jupiter, with an
altar of Vesta. The theater at the base of the Acropolis,
into which the Athenians crowded to hear the words of their
great tragedians, was consecrated to Bacchus." But with
all this "vast composition of architecture and sculpture,
dedicated• to the national glory and to the worship of the
gods," the true God was to them unknown. What a com-
mentary on the worthlessness of an education outside of
Christ!
   2. "Among those who encountered Paul in the market place
were 'certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Sto-
ics;' but they, and all others who came in contact with him,
soon saw that he had a store of knowledge even greater than
their own. His intellectual power commanded the respect
of the learned; while his earnest, logical reasoning and the
20         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

power of his oratory held the attention of all in the audience.
His hearers recognized the fact that he was no novice, but
was able to meet all classes with convincing arguments in
support of the doctrines he taught. Thus the apostle stood
undaunted, meeting his opposers on their own ground, match-
ing logic with logic, philosophy with philosophy, eloquence
with eloquence."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 235, 236.
                                                        •
   3. Areopagus was "a rocky eminence at Athens, near the
Acropolis, upon which a sovereign criminal court held its
sittings. The judges were called Areopagites, and through
a long period were greatly respected." ("Twentieth Cen-
tury Dictionary.")
   4. The word "superstitious" in this text seems an unfor-
tunate translation. The Revised Version gives "religious."
Conybeare and Howson translates the text, "I bear witness
to your carefulness in religion," and in a footnote adds, "The
mistranslation of this verse in the Authorized Version is much
to be regretted, because it entirely destroys the graceful
courtesy of Paul's opening address, and represents him as
beginning his speech by offending his audience."
   5. "The quotation [in this verse] is from Aratus, a Greek
poet, who was a native of Cilicia; a circumstance which
would, perhaps, account for St. Paul's familiarity with his
writings."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Cony-
beare and Howson, page 328, note.
   6. Hales, in his chronology, speaking concerning the dark-
ening of the sun at the cross, makes the following interest-
ing statement concerning Dionysius; assuming that it is the
same Dionysius: "This obscuration of the sun must have been
preternatural, in its extent, duration, and opposition of the
moon at full to the sun. It was observed at Heliopolis, in
Egypt, by Dionysius, the Areopagite, afterwards the illus-
trious convert of Paul at Athens (Acts 17: 34), who, in a
letter to the martyr Polycarp, describes his own and his
companion's — the sophist Apollophanes'— astonishment at
the phenomenon, when they saw the darkness commence at the
eastern limb of the sun, and proceed to the western, till the
whole was eclipsed; and then backward from the western to
the eastern, till his light was fully restored; which they at-
tributed to the miraculous passage of the moon across the
sun's disk. Apollophanes exclaimed, as if divining the cause,
`These, 0 good Dionysius, are the vicissitudes of divine
events!' Dionysius answered, 'Either the Deity suffers, or
He sympathizes with the Sufferer.' And that Sufferer, accord-
ing to tradition recorded by Michael Syncellus, of Jerusalem,
he declared to be 'the unknown God,' for whose sufferings all
nature was darkened and convulsed." ("Hales," volume 3,
page 230.)
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        21

  7. No one under sixty years of age could be a member of
the court of the Areopagites. "The court had jurisdiction in
criminal and political cases, as well as those affecting public
morals." (See Nelson's "Teachers' Testament," note.)

           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    23

able. Apollos is a good example of this. He was willing
to receive more light.
  6. Any consecrated person in the church, however hum-
ble, may be used in bringing additional light to those who
may be regarded as great teachers. Verse 26.

                             Notes
   1. Paul visited Corinth three times. About A. D. 53 he
spent a year and a half here (Acts 18: 11), during which time
he probably wrote the two epistles to the Thessalonians; then
between 54 and 57 (1 Cor. 16: 7; 2 Cot. 12: 13, 14; 13: 1),
and the three winter months from 57 to 58, during which he
wrote the epistle to the Romans. Acts 20: 2, 3. Compare 1
Cor. 16: 6; Rom. 16: 1.
   2. Aquila and Priscilla were refugees from Rome, having
fled from Italy to the Grecian metropolis after the decree of
Claudius in A. D. 32, expelling all the Jews from Rome.
   "He [Paul] wrote two epistles to the Christians at Corinth.
The site of this once proud and dissolute city is now occupied
by the miserable little village of Gortho.' —"Cyclopedia of
Religious Knowledge," page 218.
   3. "The remarkable word which is used to describe the
`pressure' which he experienced at this moment in the course
of his teaching at Corinth, is the same which is employed of
our Lord Himself in a solemn passage of the Gospels (Luke
12: 50) when He says, 'I have a baptism to be baptized with;
and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!'"—"Life and
 Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page
339.
   4. Gallio was "the adopted name of Marcus Annus
 Novatus, son of M. Annmus Seneca of Cordova in Spain,
brother of the philosopher L. Annmug Seneca, and uncle of
the poet Lucan. He was a man of fine character and culture,
 and proconsul of Achaia during Paul's first visit to Corinth
 (after 49 A. D.) and fell a victim to Nero's cruelty in 66 A. D."
 (Standard Bible Dictionary.)
   5. Gallio doubtless understood the real reasons for their op-
 position to Paul, and seeing that there was no Roman law
 violated, he did not see fit to waste time on religious techni-
 calities, so drove them from his court. His act no doubt
 greatly enraged his accusers.
   6. The journey, from Cmsarea to Jerusalem is related very
 briefly indeed. Luke simply says, "He Went up and saluted
 the church." No disputes or contentions are mentioned. We
 are not informed whether or not he arrived in time for the
 feast, though it is quite probable that he did.
    7. "The work of the believers had been given them by God.
 By their faithful adherence to the truth they were to give to
24           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

others the light which they had received.• The apostle bade
them not to become weary in well-doing, and pointed them
to his own example of diligence in temporal matters while
laboring with untiring zeal in the cause of Christ. He re-
proved those who had given themselves up to sloth and aimless
excitement, and directed that 'with quietness they work, and
eat their own bread.' He also enjoined upon the church to
separate from their fellowship any one who should persist in
disregarding the instruction given by God's ministers. 'Yet,'
he added, 'count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a
brother.'"—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 267, 268.
  8. "As he [Paul] was planning to leave the city for a more
promising field, and seeking earnestly to understand his duty,
the Lord appeared to him in a vision, and said, 'Be not afraid,
but speak, and hold not thy peace: for I am with thee, and no
man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I ,have much people
in this city.' "— Id., page 250.

                             Notes
  1. "When John the Baptist was preaching, many, in their
visits to Jerusalem at the annual feasts, had gone out to the
banks of the Jordan to listen to him. There they had heard
Jesus proclaimed as the Promised One, and they had carried
the tidings to all parts of the world. Thus had. Providence
prepared the way for the labors of the apostles.
26         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   "On his arrival at Ephesus, Paul found twelve brethren,
who, like Apollos, had been disciples of John the Baptist, and
like him had gained some knowledge of the mission of Christ."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 281, 282.
   2. Tyrannus was a "sophist or rhetorician of Ephesus, who
kept one of those schools of philosophy and eloquence so
common at that period." ("Popular and Critical Encyclo-
pedia.")
   "This school `was probably a lecture room, which, as the
private property of the owner, was lent or let to the apostles.'
Ramsay suggests that it was the lecture room used by the
professors of rhetoric and philosophy a part of the day; and
Paul at other hours."—"Peloubet's Notes," 1909.
   3. "These manifestations of supernatural power were far
more potent than had ever before been witnessed in Ephesus,
and were of such a character that they could not be imitated
by the skill of the juggler or the enchantments of the sorcerer.
As these miracles were wrought in the name of Jesus of
Nazareth, the people had opportunity to see that the God of
heaven was more powerful than the magicians who were wor-
shipers of the goddess Diana. Thus the Lord exalted His
servant, even before the idolaters themselves, immeasurably
above the most powerful and favored of the magicians."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," page 287.
   4. Exorcism was a belief in demoniacal possessions. In
some instances the gift was regarded as divine. "The epithet
applied to these exorcists indicates that they were traveling
mountebanks, who, beside skill in medicine, pretended to the
knowledge of magic." ("Popular and Critical Encyclopedia.")
   5. "And the man in whom the_ evil spirit was leaped on
them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so
 that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
   "Thus unmistakable proof was given of the sacredness of
 the name of Christ, and the peril which they incurred who
 should invoke it without faith in the divinity of the Saviour's
 mission. 'Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord
 Jesus was magnified.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page
288.
    6. Would that the gospel to-day might get such a hold in
 the lives of many as to lead them to destroy the cheaper
 fiction which is a curse to their homes! "They did not sell
 them [the books] for others to use, as they might have done,
 but destroyed the instruments of evil at great cost, reckoning
 at fifty thousand pieces of silver, Latin, denarii; Greek,
 drachmas, worth about sixteen cents each,. or $8,000 in all.
 But in those days a drachma was equivalent to a day's wage,
 so that the sum was equivalent to $50,000 to $100,000 in our
 time." ("Peloubet's Notes," 1909.)

                           Notes
  1. "The first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians was written
during the apostle's long sojourn in Ephesus (1 Cor. 16: 8,
9, 19; Acts 19), probably early in A. D. 57."—"A Dictionary
of the Bible," Davis.
   2. Diana was "the Roman goddess of the moon, and of
field and woods, and of all forms of life and activity which
were supposed to be influenced by the moon. Her image was
supposed to have fallen from heaven." (Id.) Her worship
was nature worship with all its abominations.
   3. "The scale on which the temple was erected was mag-
nificently extensive. It was 425 feet in length and 220 in
breadth, and the columns were 60 feet high. The number
of columns was 127, each of them the gift of a king; and
36 of them were enriched with ornament and color. The
folding doors were of cypress wood; the part which was not
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                29

open to the sky was roofed over with cedar; and the stair-
case was formed of the wood of one single vine from the is-
land of Cyprus. The value and_ fame of the temple were en-.
hanced by its being the treasury where a large portion of the
wealth of western Asia was stored up. It is probable there
was no religious building in the world in which was concen-
trated a greater amount of admiration, enthusiasm, and
superstition."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul,"
Conybeare and Howson, pages 465, 466.
   4. The Revised Version reads, "And certain also of the
Asiarchs, being his friends." These were the officers having
charge of the Roman province of Asia; and their course indi-
cates that the better class of people had no sympathy with the
mob, and were really Paul's friends.
   5. "The purpose of this was most likely to save the Jews
from being mixed up with the Christians in the vengeance
of the people. He may or may not have been the same as
Alexander the coppersmith."—"Standard Bible Dictionary."
   6. "Coins show that in the several cities of Asia Minor the
 town clerk presided in popular assemblies, and was the vir-
 tual, or in some cases the actual, head of the municipal gov-
 ernment."—"A Dictionary of the Bible," Davis.
   7. If the image of Diana really had a supernatural origin
 and fell down from Jupiter, how could she be deposed from
 her magnificence? Could not Jupiter, the king of gods, take
 care of his own?

   1. The plots of the enemies of the truth are often

   2. We should pay regard to the customs of the• people
when they do not conflict with right principles. Paul
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  31

doubtless regarded some of the feasts as an opportunity
to preach to the people a more complete, gospel.
   3. We should be very diligent in the work of the Mas-
ter. Paul sent the boat with his companions on ahead,
thus giving him a few hours _longer for labor at Troas.
Verse 13.
   4. The same power should attend the gospel now as in
the day of Paul. Verses 9-12. Read Matt. 10 : 7, 8 ; Luke
10: 17-19. Note 7. •
                             Notes
   1. "From Ephesus Paul set forth on another missionary
tour, during which he hoped to visit once more the scenes of
his former labors in Europe. Tarrying for a time at Troas,
`to preach Christ's gospel,' he found some who were ready
to listen to his message. 'A door was opened unto me of the
Lord,' he afterward declared of his labors in this place. But
successful as were his efforts at Troas, he could not remain
there long. 'The care of all the churches,' and particularly
of the church at Corinth, rested heavily on his heart. He
had hoped to meet Titus at Troas, and to learn from him how
the words of counsel and reproof sent to the Corinthian
brethren had been received; but in this he was disappointed."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 323.
   2. "In the autumn he [Paul] went to Greece and spent
three months there, chiefly in Corinth, where he had much
to do amid sickness and afflictions on every side, fightings
without and fears within (2 Cor. 4: 7-11; 7: 5, 6), in caring
for all the churches (2 Cor. 11: 28), and correcting wrong
conduct (2 Cor. 12: 20, 21; 13: 1, 2). It was, four or five
years since he had left them after a stay of a year and a
half."—"Peloubet's Notes," 1909. •
   "After his mention of the affectionate parting between St.
Paul and the Christians of Ephesus, St. Luke tells us very
little of the apostle's proceedings during a period of nine or
ten months; — that is, from the early summer of the year
A. D. 57, to the spring of A. D. 58."—"Life and Epistles of the
Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 478.
   "From Macedonia, perhaps from Philippi, he wrote the
second epistle to the Corinthians, which he soon followed in
person. From Corinth he wrote his epistle to the Romans, in
order to prepare the brethren of Rome for his personal
preaching. Phoebe, the deaconess, was probably the bearer
of the letter. But before going to Rome he visits Jerusa-
lem."—"Concise Cyclopedia of Religious Knowledge," page
715.
   3. "The voyage seemed to begin unfavorably. The space
between Neapolis •and Troas could easily be sailed over in
32         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

two days with a fair wind; and this was the time occupied,
when the apostle made the passage on his first coming to
Europe. On this occasion the same voyage occupied five days.
We have no means of deciding whether the ship's progress
was retarded by calms, or by contrary winds."—"Life and
Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page
591.
   4. "The labors of the early days of the week that was spent
at Troas are not related to us; but concerning the last day
we have a narrative which enters into details with all the
which succeeded the Jewish Sabbath. On the Sunday morn-
minuteness of one of the Gospel histories. It was the evening
ing the vessel was about to sail."— Id., pages 592, 593.
   5. "And strength and peace were surely sought and ob-
tained by the apostle from the Redeemer, as he pursued his
lonely road that Sunday afternoon in spring, among the oak
woods and streams of Ida."— Id., page 595.
   6. "The Macedonian Christians responded nobly to the ap-
peal which was made to them by St. Paul. . . . The Phi-
lippians are in the epistles what that poor woman is in the
Gospels, who placed two mites in the treasury. They gave
much, because they gave of their poverty; and wherever the
gospel is preached throughout the whole world, there shall
this liberality be told for a memorial of them."— Id., pages
511, 512.
   7. "When as a people our works correspond to our profes-
 sion, we shall see very much more accomplished than now.
 When we have men as devoted as Elijah, and possessing the
 faith which he had, we shall see that God will reveal Him-
 self to us as He did to holy men of old."—"Gospel Workers,"
 page 21, old edition.

  LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 20: 17-38.
  MEMORY VERSE: "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus,

   15. What example had he given them? What words of
Jesus were to be remembered? Verse 35.
   16. Describe the parting scene. Verses 36-38. Note 8.
                       Lessons for Us
   1. The gospel seed should be sown in tears. Verse 19.
   2. We should do personal work for sinners. Verse 20.
   3. All, even life itself, should be on the altar. Verses
22-24; Mark 8:35.
   4. The work of those chosen as teachers, or shepherds,
is to "feed the flock." Man lives by "every word that pro-
ceedeth out of the mouth of God." Matt. 4: 4.
   5. We should recognize the presiding presence of the
Holy Spirit in the deliberations of the church. Acts
20: 28.
   6. False shepherds will arise in the church. Verse 30.
   7. We should watch. Mark 13: 35-37.
   8. The word of God is our safeguard. Acts 20: 32.
                           Notes
  1. Ephesus was about thirty-six miles north from Miletus.
One can well imagine the joy of the elders on receiving a
summons to meet the one to whose instruction,they had lis-
tened in the school of Tyrannus.
  2. Paul's work was not alone in speaking to the public con-
gregation, but he combined personal work from house to house.
We will do well to emphasize the methods of this great mis-
sionary, and practice them in our lives.
  3. Conybeare and Howson render this verse, "Testifying
both to Jews and gentiles their need of repentance towards
God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ." This would make
his work very personal in its application.
  4. Conybeare and Howson translate this text, "And now,
as for me, behold, I go to Jerusalem, in spirit foredoomed to
chains." The aged hero of the cross seemed to see the clouds
darkening, and great trials awaiting him. These things, with
the burden of all the churches, weighed greatly on his heart.
  5. Paul warns the elders against two dangers which threat-
ened the church,— wolves from without that would come in
to destroy, and those of their own number who would arise
in their midst, who would cast away their former faith, and
teach things contrary to the truth. In this way, division in
the church would be created, and these false brethren would
draw away some of the flock after them. Observe that these
disciples are drawn to these "false brethren" instead of to
Christ. This danger still threatens the church.

   6. "This space of three years may either be used (in the
Jewish mode of reckoning) for the two years and, upwards
which St. Paul spent at Ephesus; or, if we suppose .him to
speak to the Macedonians and Corinthians also (who were
present), it may refer to the whole time (about three years
and a 'half) since he came to reside at Ephesus in the autumn
of 54 A. —"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Cony-
beare and Howson, page 603, footnote.
   7. Paul, writing' to the Corinthian church, said, "I myself
was not burdensome to you; forgive me this wrong." 2 Cor.
12: 13. It was not best for the churches to be free of all
financial burden in this matter, neither could it have been for
the apostle, who must to some extent have been hindered in
the work of preaching, while earning a living.
   8. "Paul knelt down on the shore with all those who had
listened to him, and offered up a prayer to that God who was
founding His church in the midst of difficulties apparently in-
superable; and then followed an outbreak of natural grief,
which even Christian faith and resignation were not able to
restrain. They fell on the apostle's neck and clung to him,
and kissed him again and again, sorrowing most because of
his own foreboding announcement, that they should never be-
hold that countenance again, on which they had often gazed
with reverence and love. But no long time could be devoted
to the grief of separation. The wind .was fair, and the vessel
must depart. They accompanied the apostle to the edge of
the water. The Christian brethren were torn away from the
embrace of their friends; and the ship sailed out into the open
sea, while the presbyters prepared for their weary and mel-
ancholy return to Ephesus.       Id., pages 603, 604.

                        Lessons for Us•
   1. The Spirit of prophecy is a guide for the church.
Verses 4, 11.
   2. The times are very uncertain. In parting with
friends or brethren, it is well to make a prayer a part of
the farewell. Verse 5.
   3. An example for the youth. Verse 9. It seems this
entire family was devoted to gospel work.
   4. Even life itself is none too precious to be given for

   5. There should be submission to the Lord's will in all
things. Verse 14.
                            Notes
  1. Coos and Rhodes were both small islands in the Grecian
Archipelago. On the island of Rhodes was a city of the same
name. "The city was famous for its Colossus, a great light-
house, said to have been seventy cubits, or about one hundred
five feet, high. It was erected between 300 and 228 B. C."
This Colossus was reckoned as one of the seven wonders of
the world. It was destroyed by an earthquake 244 B. C.
  2. The time the ship remained at Tyre was doubtless con-
sumed in taking out and receiving cargo, and perhaps wait-
ing for favorable breezes. Paul improved the opportunity
in strengthening and encouraging the believers. A church is
said to have been established here at the dispersion conse-
quent upon the death of Stephen. Some of the believers seem
to have been endued with the gift of prophecy.
  3. The last parting moments here, as at Miletus, were em-
ployed in praying to Him who alone can give true comfort
and protection. This contains a lesson we all will do well to
heed.
   4. Ptolemais, under the ancient name of Accho, appears in
the book of Judges, chapter 1: 31. It was one of the towns
of the tribes of Asher. While Tyre, the seaport which formed
the "burden of the sublimest prophecies in the last days of the
Hebrew monarchy," and Cwsarea, founded by the family of
Herod, have both fallen into decay, Ptolemais, older than
either; has outlived them both.
   5. This is the same Philip who preached the gospel to the
Samaritans and baptized the Ethiopian eunuch.
   6. It was this same prophet Agabus who prophesied of the
famine throughout the world (Acts 11: 28). He appears
again with a warning of danger to Paul.
   7. "His [Agabus's] revelation was made in that dramatic
form which impresses the mind with a stronger sense of
38         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

reality than mere words can do, and which was made familiar
to the Jews of old by the practice of the Hebrew prophets. As
Isaiah (chapter 20) loosed the sackcloth from nis loins, and
put off his shoes from his feet, to dee;are how the Egyptian
captives should be led away into Assyria naked and barefoot,
— or as the girdle of Jeremiah (chapter 13 ) , in its strength
and its decay, was made a type of the people of Israel in their
privilege and their fall,— Agabus, in like manner, using the
imagery of action, took the girdle of St. Paul, and fastened
it around his own hands and feet, and said, 'Thus saith the
Holy Ghost: So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man to
whom this girdle belongs, and they shall deliver him into the
hands of the gentiles.' "—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle
Paul," Conybeare and Howson, pages 615, 616.
   8. Though Paul's heart was moved and almost broken by
the tears, sorrow, and entreaties of his companions and
friends at the prospect of imprisonment and danger before
him, he was unwavering in his purpose, seeing victory through
all the hindrances which were before him.
   9. "Some of the Christians   o   Csarea went along with
them, not merely, as it would seem, to show their respect and
sympathy for the apostolic company, but to secure their com-
fort on arriving, by taking him to the house of Mnason, a
native of Cyprus, who had been long ago converted to Chris-
tianity, possibly during the life of our Lord Himself, and
who may have been one of those Cyprian Jews who first made
the gospel known to the Greeks at Antioch."— Id., page 617.
   10. This was Paul's last visit to Jerusalem. Doubtless
many things here stirred his memory. He moved among com-
paratively few friends, and many enemies.
