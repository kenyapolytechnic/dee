        American Revised Version of Lesson Scripture
1 Bless Jehovah, 0 my soul.
   0 Jehovah my God, Thou art very great;
   Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
2 Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment
   Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
3 Who layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters;
   Who maketh the clouds His chariot;
   Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
4 Who maketh winds His messengers ;
   Flames of fire His ministers ;
5 Who laid the foundation of the earth,
   That it should not be moved forever.
6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;
   The waters stood above the mountains.
 I At Thy rebuke they fled ;
   At the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away
 S (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down)
   Unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them.
9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
   That they turn not again to cover the earth.
10 He sendeth forth springs into the valleys;
   They run among the mountains;
11 They give drink to every beast of the field;
   The wild asses quench their thirst.
12 By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation ;
   They sing among the branches.

                             Notes
     This psalm sets forth the greatness of Jehovah, the Cre-
 ator, Provider, and Ruler of the world. Its purpose is "to
 make man bow in lowly faith before God's boundless wisdom,
 believing that He, whose power created, and whose provi-
 dence rules, the whole order of nature, is no less wonderful
 in His government of the moral world. He never mistakes."
     "The whole natural world is designed to be an inter-
 preter of the things of God. . . . As the works of God are
 studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction into the mind. It
 is not the conviction which logical reasoning produces • but,
 unless the mind has become too dark to know God, the eye
 too dim to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a
 deeper meaning is grasped, and the sublime spiritual truths
 of the written Word are impressed on the heart. . . . God
 has, in the natural world, placed in the hands of the children
 of men the key to unlock the treasure house of His word.
 The unseen is illustrated by the seen; divine wisdom, eternal
                  SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         5

truth, infinite grace, are understood by the things that God
has made."
    With verse 2 compare 1 John 1: 5; Gen. 1: 2, 3; 2 Cor.
4: 6.
    Observe the use made of verse 4 of this psalm, by the
writer of the Hebrews, in chapter 1: 7.
    There is undoubted reference to the Flood in verses 6-9.
Although the record states that "the fountains of the great
deep [were] broken up, and the windows of heaven were
opened," and that the waters were assuaged by a wind which
passed over the earth, yet it was none the less directly the
personal act of God which brought the Flood, and it was at
His rebuke that the waters fled. The so-called operations of
nature are in truth the operations of God, and the so-called
laws of nature are the habitual methods of God's working.
By studying the things which God has made, and observing
the working of His power in upholding and caring for them,
we may become acquainted with that power which is the
essential feature of the gospel. Rom. 1: 16-20.

13   He
      watereth the mountains from His chambers:
   The earth is filled with the fruit of Thy works.
14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
   And herb for the service of man ;

15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
   And oil to make his face to shine,
   And bread that strengtheneth man's heart.
16 The trees of Jehovah'are filled with moisture,
   The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;

   The rocks are a refuge for the conies.

  21: What is said of the works of Jehovah? HoW have
they been wrought?
  22. What has the Lord bestowed upon the earth?

                                 Notes
    Although the ground was cursed on account of the sin
of man (Gen. 3: 17), yet the power of God is working through
it to supply His creatures with food.
    From verses 14, 15, we may learn that food, both for
man and for beast, is the gift of God. Read John 6: 5-12,
27, 32-35, and note the explanation there given of the power
of God in multiplying the loaves to feed the world.
    Before sin came into the world and brought so many
artificial conditions, man was in much closer touch with his
Maker. "The sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they
were clothed with a covering of light and glory such as the
angels wear. So long as they lived in obedience to God, this
robe of light continued to enshroud them."
    "It was the work of Adam and Eve to train the branches
of the vine to form bowers, thus making for themselves a
dwelling from living trees covered with foliage and fruit."
Although the animal creation has been involved in the.suffer-
ing consequent upon sin, yet the trees still constitute a home
for the birds, the mountains for the goats, and the rocks for
the conies. When the young lions roar after their prey, God
regards it as a call upon Him for food.
    Work was not imposed upon man as a punishment for sin.
The father and the Son are both workers. John 5: 17. Our
experience of weariness and of wearing out while working is
one of the results of sin.
    With verse 24 compare Prov. 3: 19, 20 and Jer. 10: 12.

8            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

        American Revised Version of Lesson Scripture
25 Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
   Wherein are things creeping [moving] innumerable,
   Both small and great beasts [living creatures].
26 There go the ships ;
   There is leviathan, whom Thou bast formed to play therein.
27 These wait all for Thee,
   That Thou mayest give them their food in due season.
28 Thou givest unto them, they gather;
   Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
29 Thou hidest Thy face, they are troubled ;
   Thou takest away their breath, they die,
   And return to their dust.
30 Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created ;
   And Thou renewest the face of the ground.
31 Let the glory of Jehovah endure forever;
   Let Jehovah rejoice in His works:
32 Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth ;
   He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
33 I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live:
   I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
34 Let my meditation be sweet unto Him:
   I will rejoice in Jehovah.
35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.
   And let the wicked be no more.

                             Notes
    Still the psalmist sings of the eternal mercies of God and
His wonderful providence. Now he shows that divine care
is over even' the innumerable forms of life beneath the broad
expanse of the ocean. All wait upon God, and not one is
forgotten. Luke 12: 6, 7, 24. But that which is given, "they
gather." Busy activity is the law of life for all creatures.
    "The Lord shall rejoice in His works." See Ps. 147: 11;
Zeph. 3: 16, 17. The earth itself is represented as responding
to a look from the Creator.. This sensitiveness of all creation
to the touch of God leads the psalmist to declare his purpose
to meditate on God's care and glory continually. Here is a
divinely inspired prayer for the blotting out of sin, which
mars creation.

                             Notes
    Continuing the subject of the previous lesson, the psalmist
exhorts us to call upon the name of the Lord, giving thanks
to Him. He would have this done intelligently, and so sug-
gests that the deeds of the Most High be made known among
the people, both in song and in conversation with our asso-
ciates. This, followed out, would work reform,in many ways.
    We in these last days are especially to consider the deal-
ing of God with His children in olden times. Isa. 51: 9-11;
Ps. 44: 1-3.
    Notice the promise 10. Abraham (Gen. 13: 14-17), oath-
confirmed to Isaac (Gen. 26: 2-5), and then to Jacob (Gen.
35: 10-12). It is the promise of the inheritance and ever-
lasting life through faith. Gal. 3: 29.
    "Though this covenant was made with Adam and renewed
to Abraham, it could not be ratified until the death of Christ.
It had existed by the promise of God since the first intimation
of redemption had been given; it had been accepted by faith;
yet when ratified by Christ, it is called a new covenant. The
law of God was the basis of this covenant, which was simply
an arrangement for bringing men again into harmony with
the divine will, placing them where they could obey God's
law."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 370, 371.

        American Revised Version of Lesson Scriptime._
14 He suffered no man to do them wrong ;
   Yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,
15 Saying,. Touch not Mine anointed ones,
12           8A98ATH ScRoOL LESSON MIARTVILV
   And do My prophets no harm.
16 And He called for a famine upon the land
   He brake the whole staff of bread.
17 He sent a man before them ;
   Joseph was sold for a servant:
18 His feet they hurt with fetters:
   He was laid in chains of iron,
19 Until the time that His word came to pass,
   The word of Jehovah tried him.
20 The king sent and loosed him ;
   Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
21 He made him lord of his house,
   And ruler of all his substance ;
22 To bind his princes at his pleasure,
   And teach his elders wisdom.
23 Israel also came into Egypt;
   And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
24 And He increased His people greatly,
   And made them stronger than their adversaries.
25 He turned their heart to hate His people,
   To deal subtly with His servants.

                               Notes
    The Lord promises to care for those who do the right and
trust Him. See Gen. 35: 5; Ps. 34: 7; Ex: 2: 24.
    Over and over, in the story of reform and missionary
effort, God's invisible hand has restrained, and His voice has
said to savage hearts, "Touch not Mine anointed." In the
story of his life among the South Sea cannibals, John G.
Paton says of one occasion:
   "A club was raised to follow the blow of the killing stone,
but God baffled the aim. They encircled us in a deadly ring,
and one kept urging another to strike the first blow, or fire
the first shot. . . . The host of armed men also ran along
on each side with their weapons ready; but, leaving every-
thing to Jesus, I ran on as if they were my escort. If any
reader wonders how they were restrained, much more would
I, unless I believed the same Hand that restrained the lions
from touching Daniel held back these savages from hurt-
ing me."
    The Lord sent Joseph into Egypt, overruling the evil pur-
pose of his brethren. God uses even the wrath of men to
praise Him; and, whatever men do to us, we are in His hands.
That which Jacob thought against him (Gen. 42: 36) was
being worked for him by God.
    Notice that it was the blessings God gave Israel in Egypt
that turned against them the hatred of the people of the land.

26 He sent Mpses His servant,
   And Aaron whom He had chosen.
27 They set among them His signs,
   And wonders in the land of Ham.
28 He sent darkness, and made it dark ;
   And they rebelled not against His words.
29 He turned their waters into blood,
   And slew their fish.
30 Their land swarmed with frogs
   In the chambers of their kings.
31 He spake, and there came swarms of flies,
   And lice in all their borders.
32 He gave them hail for rain,
   And flaming fire in their land.
33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees,
   And brake the trees of their borders.
34 He spake, and the locust came,
   And the grasshopper, and that without number,
35 And did eat up every herb in their land,
   And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
36 He smote also all the first-born in their land,
   The chief of all their strength.
37 And He brought them forth with silver and gold ;
   And there was not one feeble person among His tribes.
38 Egypt was glad when they departed ;
   For the fear of them had fallen upon them.

                            Notes
    Read also Ps. 78: 43-52.
    Moses' preparation for service deserves more than casual
study. That decree which brought sadness and gloom into
the homes of the Hebrews was used by the Lord to fit the
man whom He had chosen to lead His people out of Egypt
when the fullness of the time should come.
    The circumstances which would not permit Moses' parents
to rear him in their own home led to his being placed where
he could receive the training and education that would fit him
to be Israel's future leader.
    Note Moses' fidelity to God when the crisis came in his
life (Heb. 11: 23-26; read also Ps. 84: 11) and the hope which
buoyed him up in these trying hours (Heb. 11: 26, 39, 40).
    But Moses' preparation was not complete when he had•
served in the Egyptian court. Forty years were spent in the
solitude of the mountains, where he could become acquainted
with God.
   Do not fail to observe .the practical lessons in the life of
Moses,
16             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    A study of the plagues reveals the fact that they seemed
to be designed to destroy the confidence of the Egyptians in
the power and protection of their idols. By reference to the
history itself (Exodus 7-13), we find that some of the
Egyptians did have their faith shaken in their idols, and
saw in these things the finger o'f God.
    "The plagues upon Egypt were similar in character to
those more terrible and extensive judgments which are to
fall upon the world just before the final deliverance of God's
people." Ps. 91: 1, 10. Now, while Jesus still intercedes for
us, the preparation must be made that will enable us to stand
in the trying times before us.

39 He spread a cloud for a covering,
   And fire to give light in the night.
40 They asked, and He brought quails,

41 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;

    Ps. 78: 14; 1 Cor. 10 : 1, 2; and Ps. 84: 11 should be
studied with Ps. 105: 39.
    "By day the cloud directed the journeyings, or spread as
a canopy above the host. It served as a protection from the
18            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

burning heat, and by its coolness and moisture afforded
grateful refreshment in the parched, thirsty desert. By night
it became a pillar of fire, illuminating their encampment,
constantly assuring them of divine presence." Read Isa.
4: 5, 6. "Here reference is made to the pillar of cloud and
of fire to represent God's care for His people in the great
final struggle with the power of evil."
    The cloud that flooded the entire encampment of the
Hebrews with the radiance of day was a wall of darkness
to the Egyptians. The way that God marks out for His
people will be flooded with light, although the unbelieving
will not see it.
    The manna was a type of Jesus, the Bread of life. John
6: 48-51. Read also Rev. 2: 17; 1 Cor. 10: 3.
    With Ps. 105: 41 read Ps. 78: 15, 16. "Moses smote the
rock; but it was the Son of God who, veiled in the cloudy
pillar, stood beside Moses, and caused the life-giving water
to flow." Ps. 65: 9; Rev. 22: 1; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 4: 13,
14; 7: 37, 38.
    Ps. 105: 42; Gen. 15: 12-14; and Acts 7: 6, 7 record the
covenant with Abraham. For the blessing of this covenant
to Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise, see
Heb. 6: 11-20.
    With Ps. 105: 43 read Ps. 116: 12, 13; Psalm 33.
    God brought forth His people "that they might keep His
statutes, and observe His laws." The same is true in regard
to His people to-day.
    In all these experiences, God designed to teach His people
their utter dependence upon Him, and not merely on the man
Moses, who was their leader.

   t'hey remembered not the multitude of • Thy loving-kindnesses,
   But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
8 Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake,
   That He might make His mighty power to be known.
9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up:
   So He led them thilough the depths, as through a wilderness.
10 And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
   And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
11 And the waters covered their adversaries;
   There was not one of them left.
12 Then believed they His words;
   They sang His praise.
13 They soon forgat His works ;
    They waited not for His counsel,
14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
   And, tempted God in the desert.
15 And, 1e gave them their request,
   But sent leanness into their soul.
16 They envied Moses also in the camp,
    And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
    And covered the company of Abiram.
18 And a fire was kindled in their company ;
    The flame burned up the wicked.
19 They made a calf in Horeb,

           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  21

                            Notes
    This psalm opens with an exhortation to praise and
thanksgiving, and the acknowledgment that God's people
to-day are repeating the history of His chosen people in the
wilderness.
    Verse 7. Observe how extensively this experience is be-
ing repeated in the lives of the majority of professed Chris-
tians. How rarely the multitude of God's mercies are re-
counted! This is the source of strength, the means by which
Satan will always be defeated.
    Verse 8. God is now gathering out a people for His
name. Acts 15: 14. Not only may we be among that people,
but we may share hi gathering them, with this closing mes-
sage, from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.
Through this people, God will make known His mighty
power; for He will vindicate His righteous character before
the u!iiverse. This is the highest reason that can be as-
signed for God's great love in pardoning and saving sinners.
Compare Ezek. 36: 22, 32; Isa. 43: 25; 48: 9; Jer. 14: 7;
Ps. 6: 4; 23: 3; 25: 11; 31: 16.
    The song of Moses (Ex. 15: 1-18) does not belong to the
Jewish people alone. It points forward to the final victory,
when the Israel of God will sing not only the song of Moses,
but the song of the Lamb (Rev. 15: 2, 3). Those who will
sing that song of triumph then must learn to sing it now.
Ps. 50: 23; 67: 5; 146: 2.
    "The history of the wilderness life of Israel was chroni-
cled for the benefit of the Israel of God to the close of time.
The varied experience of the Hebrews was a school of prepa-
ration for their promised home in Canaan. God would have
His people in these days review with a humble heart and
teachable spirit the trials through which ancient Israel
passed, that they may be instructed in their preparation for
the heavenly Canaan."
    On the significance of their idolatrous worship, "Patri-
archs and Prophets," appendix, note 7, page 760, says:
    "The golden calf was a representation of the sacred bull
called Apis, which the Egyptians worshiped, and with which
the Israelites had necessarily become very familiar during
their long sojourn in Egypt. Concerning this god Apis and
what it signified, we find the following:
    " `Apis, the bull worshiped by the ancient Egyptians, who
regarded it as a symbol of Osiris, the god of the Nile, the hus-
band of Isis, and the great divinity of Egypt.' "—Chambers's
Encyclopedia.

        American Revised Version of Lesson Scripture
21 They forgat God their Saviour,
   Who had done great things in Egypt,
22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
   And terrible things by the Red Sea.
23 Therefore He said that He would destroy them,
   Had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach,
   To turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them.
24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
   They believed not His word,
25 But murmured in their tents,
   And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
26 Therefore He sware unto them,
   That He would overthrow them in the wilderness,
27 And that He would overthrow their seed among the nations,
   And scatter them in the lands.
28 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,
   And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
29 Thus they provoked Him to anger with their doings;
   And the plague brake in upon them.
30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;
   And so the plague was stayed.
31 And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,
   Unto all generations forevermore.
32 They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah,
   So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes ;
33 Because they were rebellious against His Spirit,
   And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

                           Notes
    Unsanctified memory is a treacherous thing. Notice how
continually the people forgot God and His deliverances, and
remembered the trials and the difficulties. They remembered
the leeks and onions of Egypt, but forgot the bitterness of
their bondage. Let us count the mercies, and forget not the
Lord's benefits.
    When Moses pleaded with God for the people, he based
his plea for pardon upon the covenant with Abraham (Ex.
32: 11-13), the promise of forgiveness and righteousness by
faith• in Christ.
    Many of the people, as they journeyed, lost sight of the
aim of the movement, and did not believe the promise of an
inheritance. Hence the murmuring by the way. Now, with
the inheritance just before us, let no one murmur in his tent.
There is where it usually begins,—in the home.

    At Baal-peor, they ate the sacrifices that had been offered
to the dead, joined in the heathen rites of ancient spiritual-
ism. As ancient Israel had to contend with this delusion, so
in these last days, the doctrines of spiritualism, theosophy,
and similar deceptions, are spreading abroad to ensnare
souls. But the very increase of Satan's deceptions is evidence
that the time is short.

        American Revised Version of Lesson Scripture
84 They did not destroy the peoples,
   As Jehovah commanded them,
35 But mingled themselves with the nations,
   And learned their works,
86 And served their idols,
   Which became a snare unto them.
37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
38 And shed innocent blood,
   Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
   Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan ;
   And the land was polluted with blood.
39 Thus were they defiled with their works,
   And played the harlot in their doings.
40 Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against His people,
   And He abhorred His inheritance.
41 And He gave them into the hand of the nations;
   And they that hated them ruled over them.
42 Their enemies also oppressed them,
   And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
43 Many times did He deliver them ;
   But they were rebellious in their counsel,
   And were bropght low in their iniquity..
44 Nevertheless He regarded their distress,
   When He heard their cry:
45 And He remembered for them His covenant,
   And repented according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses.
46 He made them also to be pitied
   Of all those that carried them captive.

  24. What significant phrase closes the psalm?
                                 Notes
    The book of Judges is the story of repeated apostasy and
rebellion and deliverances. The second chapter shows how
compromise with the world caused the troubles of the people.
A precious lesson for times of distress is that in Judges
6: 12-14.
    The prayer of the psalmist in verse 47 is especially ap-
propriate for these days, when God is gathering out His
people from among the nations to triumph in His praise.
There is triumph in praise, as there is defeat in murmuring.
In the gathering of His people in these last days, vze are
to see again His power to deliver and save as in ancient days.
Jer. 16: 14, 15; Isa. 11: 10-12. Review the whole psalm, and
see how much murmuring and apostasy would have been
saved had people but trusted God. The psalm begins and
ends with the same cry, "Hallelujah." It is the battle cry
of Christian warfare.

1 Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for He is good;
  For His loving-kindness endureth forever.
2 Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so,
  Whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
3 And gathered out of the lands,
  From the east and from the west,
  From the north and from the south.
4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way ;
  They found no city of habitation.
5 Hungry and thirsty,
  Their soul fainted in them.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    27
6 Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,
   And He delivered them out of their distresses,
7 He led them also by a straight, way,
   That they might go to a city of habitation.
8 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
   And for His wonderful works to the children of men I
9 For He satisfieth the longing soul,
   And the hungry soul He filleth with good.
10 Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
   Being bound in affliction and iron,
11 Because they rebelled against the words of God,
   And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
12 Therefore He brought down their heart with labor;
   They fell down, and there was none to help.
13 Then they cried unto Jehovah in their troubles,
   And He saved them out of their distresses.
14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
   And brake their bonds in sunder.
15 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
   And for His wonderful works to the children of men
16 For He hath broken the gates of brass,
   And cut the bars of iron in sunder.

  27.    With what power has the Lord wrought to deliver

                                 Notes
    We are not merely to think, but to say, that the Lord is
good. The more the redeemed of the Lord say it, the deeper
sense of His goodness will they have. It is wonderful how
much help one may receive by the earnest effort to tell others
how good the Lord is. Let us open our mouths and say it
out. Heb. 13: 15.
    God led the people forth "by the right way." The ways
of the Lord are right. In Christ, the Way, we have deliver-
ance from sin, from the power of the enemy. See the song
of Zacharias. Luke 1: 63-75. The record of the deliverances
of a whole people is but the history of the work of God in
our own hearts, the defeats, the victories, and the leadings in
individual experiences.
    Rebellion (verse 11) is the cause of our troubles, as it was
the cause of the troubles of ancient Israel. Jesus, our ex-
ample, received teaching and discipline, and was not rebel-
lious. Isa. 50: 4-10.
    When they fell down and there was none to help, then
came deliverance, as they called on God. What assurance of
victory in verses 12-14 of this psalm! Not a soul should pass
this lesson, surely, without accepting deliverance; for every
bond is loosed and every bar cut asunder.

       American Revised Version of Lesson Scripture
17 Fools because of their transgression,
   And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of food ;
   And they draw near unto the gates of death.
19 Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
   And He saveth them out of their distresses.
20 He sendeth His word, and healeth them,
   And delivereth them from their destructions.
21 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
   And for His wonderful works to the children of menl
22 And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
   And declare His works with singing.
23 They that go down to the sea in ships,
   That do business in great waters;
24 These see the works of Jehovah,
   And His wonders in the deep.
25 For He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
   Which lifted up the waves thereof.
26 They mount up to the heavens,-.
   They go down again to the depths:
   Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
   And are at their wits' end.
28 Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,
   And He bringeth them out of their distresses.
29 He maketh the storm a calm,
   So that the waves thereof are still.
30 Then are they glad because they are quiet;
   So He bringeth them unto their desired haven.
31 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for His loving-kindness,
   And for His wonderful works to the children of men !
32 Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,
   And praise Him in the seat of the elders.

                           Notes
    With verse 19, many illustrations may be drawn from
Old and New Testament history, showing God's speedy de-
liverance when His people sought Him. Jacob, the children
of Israel before the Red Sea, Daniel, the three Hebrews in
Babylon, Hezekiah, Peter, Paul, and many other instances,
will suggest themselves.
    The power of His word (Ps. 33: 6-9) heals the sick. With
verse 30, read Matt. 8: 8; Luke 7: 7; Ps. 103: 2-4; Isa. 53:
4, R. V., margin.
    The experience recorded in Mark 4: 36-40 is an excellent
comment on verses 23-30. He who created the sea can speak
peace to its troubled waters. But still more precious is the
promise of peace to the troubled soul that calls upon Him.
John 14: 27; 16: 33; Rom. 5: 1; Phil. 4: 6, 7. There is power
in His word to perform that which He speaks. "All His
biddings are enablings."
    The last verse of the lesson makes clear the obligation to
speak God's praise in the public congregation. Mal. 3: 16-18.
This is especially enjoined upon those who see the end ap-
proaching. Heb. 10: 25.

33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
   And water-springs into a thirsty ground ;
34 A fruitful land into a salt desert,
   For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
35 He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
   And a dry land into water-springs.
36 And there He maketh the hungry to dwell,
   That they may prepare a city of habitation,
37 And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
   And get them fruits of increase.
38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly ;
   And He suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
39 Again, they are diminished and bowed down
   Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
40 He poureth contempt upon princes,
   And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
41 Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction,
   And maketh him families like a flock.
42 The upright shall see it, and be glad ;
   And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
43 Whoso is wise will give heed to these things ;
   And they will consider the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah.

                           Notes
   While verses 33 to 37 show God's marvelous power-to pro-
vide for His people, even in solitary places, an experience
which awaits many of the faithful children of God before
the final triumph of His work, there is no doubt that they
also refer to the wondrous provision He has made for His
people in the new earth, when the desert shall rejoice and
blossom as the rose. Isaiah 35; also 65: 17-25.
   Verses 38 to 42 are a wonderful commentary on that
familiar verse, Rom. 8: 28. Everything is in the hands of
God. If there is prosperity, it comes from Him; if there are
reverses, He permits them. God deals with man in the way
that will best cause him to recognize his Creator. The right-
eous see these things, and rejoice now; and the time is coming
when even the mouth of the wicked will be led to acknowledge
the wisdom of God. Then it will be too late to accept His
mercy, which is still offered. "To-day if ye will hear His
voice, harden not your hearts." "Behold, now is the day of
salvation." This Sabbath should be the time when we submit
our all to God, if we have not done so before, accepting
everything that He sends as from the hand of a loving
heavenly Father. See 1 Cor. 13: 12.
