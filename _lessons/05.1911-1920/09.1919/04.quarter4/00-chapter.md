                             Notes
    1. Church —"A body of Christian believers holding the
same creed, observing the same rites, and acknowledging the
same ecclesiastical authority."—Webster.
    In the New Testament, the word "church" has two mean-
ings:
    a. The whole body of believers. Eph. 1: 22.
    b. A particular, or local organization. Acts 8: 1.
    2. "The church is built upon Christ as its foundation; it
is to obey Christ as its head. It is not to depend upon man,
or be controlled by man."—"The Desire of Ages," page 414.
    3. The word "Peter" means a fragment of rock, a movable
stone — not a fitting symbol for the foundation of a building.
The word "rock" in the same verse means solid mass of rock,
in its native state, immovable as a whole — fit symbol for a
stable, permanent foundation of the church. That "rock"
refers to Christ, Son of man, and Son of God, not to Peter,
cannot be doubted. Peter or any other believer may become
by faith a "living stone" built into a spiritual house (1 Peter
2: 3-5), but "other foundation can no man lay than that is
laid, which is Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 3: 11.
    4. Study the words "knit together." Bones that are
broken will knit together when they have life in theth. The
Spirit of life in the church will cause the members to hold
together, to be knit together, to grow together. It is through
Christ that all things hold together.
    5. " 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of
Christ. All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are
here included. These words have power to open and to shut
heaven. They declare the conditions upon which men are
received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach
God's Word is a savor of life unto life or of death unto
death. Theirs is a mission weighted with eternal results."
—Id., page 414.
    6. "The soul that has given himself to Christ is more
precious in His sight than the whole world. The Saviour
would have passed through the agony of Calvary, that one
might be saved in His kingdom. He will never abandon one
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            5
for whom He has died. Unless His followers choose to leave
Him, He will hold them fast."- Id., page 480.
   "The church of Christ, enfeebled and defective as it may
be, is the only object on earth on which He bestows His su-
preme regard."-Mrs. E. G. White, in General Conference
Bulletin, 1893, page 408.
    7. "The church, endowed with the righteousness of Christ,
is His depositary, in which the riche's of His mercy, His
grace, and His love, are to appear in full and final display."
-"The Desire of Ages," page 680.
    8. "In Christ the family of earth and the family of heaven
are bound together. Christ glorified is our brother."- Id.,
pages 25, 26.

       7. Review the lesson.

       Rom. 12: 10.
12. What example of thorough organization was anciently
       established among God's people? Deut. 1: 10-15.
13. What charge was given to these leaders? Verses 16, 17.
       Note 9.
14. Why was this written? 1 Cor. 10: 11.
                             Notes
    1. "As the angel from heaven rolled away the stone, the
other entered the tomb, and unbound the wrappings from the
body of Jesus. But it was the Saviour's hand that folded
each, and laid it in its place. In His sight who guides alike
the star and the atom, there is nothing unimportant. Order
and perfection are seen in all His work."—"The Desire of
Ages," page 789.
    2. In a comment on this verse, "Conybeare and Howson"
say, "Not simply 'set in order,' but set in order farther."
Evidently the great apostle believed fully in the most perfect
order and organization in the church under his care; and
desiring that this work should be more fully perfected than
he was able to do while with them, he left his faithful and
tried helper to complete the work.
    3. "As an important factor in the spiritual growth of the
new converts, the apostles were careful to surround them
with the safeguards of gospel order. Churches were duly
organized in all places in Lycaonia and Pisidia, where there
were believers. Officers were appointed in each church, and
proper order and system was established for the conduct of
all the affairs pertaining to the spiritual welfare of the
believers."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 185.
    4. It is evident, from the high qualifications set forth,
that the apostle regarded the work of an elder as of great
importance, and the office as one that carried with it great
responsibility.
    That the office of "elder" is the same as that of "bishop"
may be seen by comparing 1 Tim. 3: 1-7 with Titus 1: 7-9.
The correct meaning of the term "bishop" may be seen by
reference to the marginal reading of these passages as given
in the Revised Version, where the word "overseer" is sub-
stituted for "bishop." That the elder is an overseer is shown
by 1 Peter 5: 1, 2, where it is stated that he is to take the
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7

oversight of the flock, or church. The terms "overseer" and
"bishop" are derived from the same word.
    5. The work of feeding the flock over which one is placed
by the Holy Spirit as an "overseer" is a weighty responsi-
bility. It calls for study, the deepest piety, and the most
godly life.
    6. The importance of this counsel cannot be overestimated.
Unless those who lead and instruct the church are in harmony
with the Word of God and the message for the time, they
will bewilder the flock, and confusion and error will result.
Especially at this time, when every wind of doctrine is blow-
ing, the church overseers should be "sound in the faith."
    7. The position of a deacon is a responsible one. He
stands next to the elder, and in a very special way should
share the burdens of the church.
    8. There are other important offices in the church, such
as treasurer, clerk, deaconess, etc., which require capable,
consecrated persons to carry on the work properly.
    9. "Satan well knows that success can only attend order
and harmonious action. He well knows that everything con-
nected with heaven is in perfect order, that subjection and
thorough discipline mark the movements of the angelic host.
It is his studied effort to lead professed Christians just as
far from Heaven's arrangement as he can • therefore he de-
ceives even the professed people of God, and makes them be-
lieve that order and discipline are enemies to spirituality;
that the only safety for them is to let each pursue his own
course, and to remain especially distinct from bodies of
Christians who are united, and are laboring to establish dis-
cipline and harmony of action. All the efforts made to es-
tablish order are considered dangerous, a restriction of right-
ful liberty, and hence are feared as popery. These deceived
 souls consider it a virtue to boast of their freedom to think
and act independently. They will not take any man's say so.
 They are amenable to no man. I was shown that it is Satan's
 special work to lead men to feel that it is God's order for
them to strike out for themselves, and choose their own course,
 independent of their brethren.
     "I was pointed back to the children of Israel. Very soon
 after leaving Egypt they were organized and most thoroughly
 disciplined. . . .
     "The travels of the children of Israel are faithfully de-
 scribed; the deliverance which the Lord wrought for them,
 their perfect organization and special order, their sin in mur-
 muring against Moses and thus against God, their transgres-
 sions, their rebellions, their punishments, their carcasses
 strewn in the wilderness, because of their unwillingness to
 submit to God's wise arrangements,— this faithful picture
 is hung up before us, as a warning lest we follow their ex-
 ample of disobedience, and fall like them. . . .
 8             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    "Has God changed from a God of order? No; He is the
same in the present dispensation as in the former. Paul
says, 'God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.' He
is as particular now as then. And He designs that we should
learn lessons of order and organization from the perfect
order instituted in the days of Moses, for the benefit ,of the
children of Israel."-"Testimonies for the Church," volume
1, pages 650, 652, 653.



       Lesson 3-The Unity of the Church

                             Notes
   1. "If the world sees a perfect harmony existing in the
church of God, it will be a powerful evidence to them in
favor of the Christian religion. Dissensions, unhappy dif-
ferences, and petty church trials dishonor our Redeemer."—
"Testimonies for the Church," volume .4, page 19.
    2. This commandment-to love one another, though known
from ancient times (Lev. 19: 18), is new to those who have
never learned to do it.
    3. "Satan is constantly seeking to introduce distrust,
alienation, and malice among God's -people., We shall often
be tempted to feel that our rights are invaded, even when
there is no real cause for such feelings. Those whose love
for self is stronger than their love for Christ and His cause,
will place their own interests first, and will resort to almost
any expedient to guard and maintain them. Even many who
appear to be conscientious Christians are hindered by pride
and self-esteem from going privately to those whom they
think in error, that they may talk with them in the spirit
of Christ, and pray together for one another. When they
think themselves injured by their brethren, some will even
go to law instead of following the Saviour's rule."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," page 305.
    4. "Ourselves faulty, we are not qualified to sit in judg-
ment upon others. Finite men can judge only from outward
appearance. To Him alone who knows the secret springs of
action, and who deals tenderly and compassionately, is it
given to decide the case of every soul."—"Thoughts from the
Mount of Blessing," page 179.
    5. "Do not make your opinions, your views of duty, your
interpretations of Scripture, a criterion for others, and in
10         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 your heart condemn them if they do not come up to your
 ideal. .➢o not criticize others, conjecturing as to their
 motives, and passing judgment upon them."— Id., page 178.
     6. "Those who condemn or criticize others, proclaim them-
 selves guilty; for they do the same things. In condemning
 others, they are passing sentence upon themselves, and God
 declares that this sentence is just. He accepts their own
verdict against themselves."— Id., page 179.
     7. "I saw that some are withering spiritually. They have
 lived some time watching to keep their brethren straight,—
watching for every fault, to make trouble with them. And
 while doing this, their minds are not on God, nor on heaven,
 nor on the truth; but just where Satan wants them,— on
some one else. Their souls are neglected; they seldom see or
 feel their own faults, for they have had enough to do to
 watch the faults of others without so much as looking to
their own souls, or searching their own hearts. A person's
dress, bonnet, or apron takes their attention. They must talk
to this one or that one, and it is sufficient to dwell upon for
weeks. I saw that all the religion a few poor souls have, con-
sists in watching the garments and acts of others, and finding
fault with them. Unless they reform, there will be no place
in heaven for them, for they would find fault with the Lord
 Himself."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 1, page 145.
    8. "Ministers and lay members of the church displease
God when they allow individuals tb tell them the errors and
faults of their brethren. They should not listen to these re-
ports, but should inquire, 'Have you strictly followed the in-
junctions of your Saviour? Have you gone to the offender,
and told him his faults between you and him alone? And
has he refused to hear you? Have you carefully and prayer-
fully taken two or three others, and labored with him in
tenderness, humility, and meekness, your heart throbbing with
love for his soul?' If the Captain's orders, in the rules given
for the erring, have been strictly followed, then an advance
step is to be taken,— tell it to the "church, and let action be
taken in the case according to the Scriptures. Then it is that
heaven will ratify the decision made by the church in cutting
off the offending member if he does not repent. If these
steps have not been taken, close the ear to complaints, and
thus refuse to take up a reproach against your neighbor. If
there were no brethren and sisters to do this, evil tongues
would soon cease; for they would not find so favorable a
field in which to work in biting and devouring one another."
—Id., volume 5, pages 616, 617.
    9. The work of the church is to win souls. If one has
taken a course which makes it the duty of the church to with-
draw the hand of fellowship, it is our duty to labor as un-
tiringly for the salvation of this person as for others who
have never been members of the church.

19. What power is it the privilege of the baptized believer to .
     know? Phil. 3: 10; Eph. 1: 18-20. Note 9.
                                Notes
     1. We are to "reckon," or count, that we are "dead indeed"
 to sin. Here is the secret of a victorious Christian life.
  When temptation even in its most enticing forms comes to
  us, we are to say, No, I cannot do this wicked thing. I am
  dead to such things. On the other hand, we are to reckon
  that we are "alive unto God." When Christian duties come to
  us, though they may involve a sacrifice, we are to say, Yes, I
  am alive to these things through Christ.
      2. "The Christian's life is not a modification or improve-
 ment of the old, but a transformation of nature. There is a
  death to self and sin, and a new life altogether. This change
  can be brought about only by the effectual working of the
  Holy Spirit."—"The Desire of Ages," page 172.
      3. Buried with Christ by baptism. As we bury our loved
  ones who are taken from us by death, so those who die to
 sin are to be buried in the watery grave. Incidentally, by this
 figure we are taught how baptism should be administered.
  The sprinkling or pouring of water is not symbolical of a
  burial.
'     4. Baptism is the ceremony that publicly unites us to
  Christ, and admits us into His household, the church, to a*
 place among the "holy brethren." (Heb. 3: 1.) We are then
 sons of God (Gal. 4: 6), and Christ is our brother (Heb.
  2: 12). A woman may accept the love of a man, and de-
 votedly give her heart to him, but she has no right to bear
 his name until after the marriage ceremony has been per-
  formed. No more have we the right to bear the name of
  Christ, until we have been baptized into the name of the
  Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
      5. Genuine faith in Christ and repentance of sin precede
 baptism. Baptism is the outward expression of an inward
 work. This precludes the baptism of infants not having at-
 tained to the years of accountability, as they cannot exercise
 faith in Christ, or repent of sin.
      6. Paul and Silas went to Philippi in response to the
 vision which appeared to Paul of a man saying, "Come over
 into Macedonia, and help us." All the circumstances after
 their arrival seemed to be working to hinder the progress of
 the gospel; yet the Lord worked in a very marvelous way,
 and a company of baptized believers was developed.
      7. "It is not at all improbable that some, perhaps many,
 among the multitude had joined in the cry of 'Crucify Him.' "
 — Sadler.
     8. "The eunuch had never heard before of Christian bap-
 tism, and could not have asked for it unless Philip had laid
 great stress upon its reception."— Id.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    13
   9. "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power
takes possession of the new heart. A change is wrought
which man can never accomplish for himself. It is a super-
natural work, bringing a supernatural element into human
nature. The soul that is yielded to Christ, becomes His own
fortress, which He holds in a revolted world, and He intends
that no authority shall be known in it but His own. A soul
thus kept in possession by the heavenly agencies, is impreg-
nable to the assaults of Satan."-"The Desire of Ages,"
pages 328, 324.

      Matt. 26: 29. Note 7.
17. How was this sacred service closed? Where did Jesus
      and His disciples go? Verse 30.
                             Notes
    1. "In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect ex-
emplification of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in
God. God does not live for Himself. By creating the world,
and by upholding all things, He is constantly ministering for
others."—"The Desire of Ages," page 649.
    2. The spirit of self-exaltation finds its origin in Satan.
It was this desire for supremacy which caused the fall of
Lucifer. See Isa. 14: 12-17.
    Referring to the disciples, this statement is made: "Many
of their contentions for supremacy, much of their dissatis-
faction with Christ's methods, originated with Judas."—
"Education," page 92.
    "Before honor is humility. To fill a high place before
men, Heaven chooses the worker who, like John the Baptist,
takes a lowly place before God."—"The Desire of Ages,"
page 436.
    "The strife probably began when the disciples were as-
sembled in the upper room, and were about to take their
places at the table."— Peloubet.
    3. "At length all were reclining at the tables, and the
Passover supper was begun. Jesus wisely waited until time
had been given for the excitement to be quieted, and the dis-
ciples to come to a better frame of mind. Then, by a sym-
bolic action, He taught them a lesson which has been needed
all down the ages. He who had all power, who came from
God, and was going to God, arose from the supper, poured
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       15
water into a basin, and washed His disciples' feet, including
the feet of Judas, into whose heart the devil had put the
plan to betray Him."- Id.
    4. "This action opened the eyes of the disciples. Bitter
shame and humiliation filled their hearts. They understood
the unspoken rebuke, and saw themselves in altogether a new
light."-"The Desire of Ages," page 644.
    5. "Gave thanks." "From the Greek word eucharistesas,
thus translated, comes The Eucharist, i. e., The Thanksgiving,
as the name of the Lord's Supper."- Peloubet.
    "Drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom." "The
thought of the meeting again is brought in to brighten the
gloom of the leave-taking." Neither here nor in eternity will
Jesus again meet all His disciples around the table. Judas
will be missing.
    6. If through faith the believer discerns by these emblems
His Lord dying on Calvary to atone for his sins, having con-
fessed them, he is not eating and drinking "unworthily."
    7. The Saviour bears His people upon His heart, and looks
forward with joy to that time when He will be surrounded
in His kingdom with the whole family of the redeemed.

    1. "In the parable the shepherd goes out to search for one
sheep,- the very least that can be numbered. So if there
had been but one lost soul, Christ would have died for that
one."-"Christ's Object Lessons," page 187.
    2. "He [Christ] left His home of security and peace, left
the glory that He had with the Father before the world was,
left His position upon the throne of the universe. He went
forth, a suffering, tempted man; went forth in solitude, to
sow in tears, to water with His blood, the seed of life for a
world lost."- Id., page 36.
    3. "Not more surely is the place prepared for us in the
heavenly mansions than is the special place designated on
earth where we are to work for God."- Id., page 327.
    4. "The smallest duty done in sincerity and self-forgetful-
ness, is more pleasing to God than the greatest work when
marred with self-seeking."- Id., page 402.
    5. It is our part to sow the seed (Eccl. 11: 6) ; it is God's
part to give the increase (1 Cor. 3: 6).
    6. "As the will of man cooperates with the will of God, it
becomes omnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His com-
mand, may be accomplished in His strength. All• His biddings
are enablings."- Id., page 333.

                              Notes
    1. The baptism of the Holy Spirit was given to Jesus
for service. In like manner, it will be given to His followers
who will use it in going about doing good. "To take His
yoke is one of the first conditions of receiving His power.
The very life of the church depends upon her faithfulness in
fulfilling the Lord's commission. To neglect this work is
surely to invite spiritual feebleness and decay."—"The Desire
of Ages," page 825.
    2. The disciples had been with Jesus and listened to His
instruction; they had witnessed the miracles He performed
in stilling the sea, healing the sick, and raising the dead; but
this did not qualify them for the great work before them.
They must have a personal experience in the things of God,
and a baptism of the Spirit for Service. It is the same with
us. No theory of truth, however correct it may be, is suffi-
cient. It is the Spirit that imparts life for service.
    3. "These disciples prepared themselves for their work.
Before the Day of Pentecost they met together, and put away
all differences. They were of one accord. They believed
Christ's promise that the blessing would be given, and they
prayed in faith. They did not ask for a blessing for them-
selves merely; they were weighted with the burden for the
salvation of souls. The gospel was to be carried to the utter-
most parts of the earth, and they claimed the endowment of
power that Christ had promised. Then it was that the Holy
Spirit was poured out, and thousands were converted in a
day.
    "So it may be now. Instead of man's speculations, let
the Word of God be preached. Let Christians put away their
dissensions, and give themselves to God for the saving of the
lost. Let them in faith ask for the blessing, and it will come.
The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was the 'former
rain,' and glorious was the result. But the 'latter rain' will
be more abundant."—"The Desire of Ages," page 827.
    4. "Filled can mean nothing less than that the whole
capacity of each man was occupied, and all his being under
the influence. The degree of receptivity varied, no doubt, but
the lesser and the greater vessels were all full. The whole
nature was influenced; for that divine Spirit can enter into,
every part of a soul, and will prove Himself the Spirit of
truth to the understanding, the Spirit of power and of love
and of self-control to the will and the affections and the
governing reason, the Spirit of sound understanding to the
practical man; and the whole nature, filled with Him, will
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    19
flame with new brilliance, like a bit of black carbon in a
stream of electricity. The Spirit of God has all humanity
for its sphere of action."— Maclaren.
    "We know that an unseen power exists by what it does.
The sound, the flame, the speaking with tongues, were proofs
of the unseen power of the Spirit. The apostles could not
know and realize the presence of the Holy Spirit without
some manifestations that made it known to the senses. No
one ever saw the greatest forces in the world. No one ever
saw electricity, or gravitation, or chemical forces. We know
them only by what they do. We know the Holy Spirit by what
He did and is still doing, especially in His transformation of
people. From this time on, there was a marvelous change in
the apostles. It was almost a transfiguration experience. So
the dead wire is thrilled with electricity, and bursts out into
light and power. They were common men no longer. As
Mosheim says, 'Their ignorance was turned into light, their
doubts into certainty, their fears into a firm and invincible
fortitude, and their former backwardness into an ardent and
inextinguishable zeal.' Note especially the change in Peter
from the man who, two months before, had forsaken his Lord,
and fled, and thrice denied Him."— Peloubet.
    5. "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to
His church, and the promise belongs to us as much as to the
first disciples."—"The Desire of Ages," page 672.

                           Notes
    1. "The tenth commandment strikes at the very root of
all sins, prohibiting the selfish desire, from which springs the
sinful act."-"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 809.
    2. "Covetousness is the root of all evil: [1] Crimes, self-
ishness, oppressions, wrongs of all kinds, grow from this root.
It stands in the way of all progress, all elevation of man.
[2] It is the source of all evils to the covetous person; it is
selfish, hard-hearted; it smothers every noble feeling and
aspiration; it quenches every hope of religion; it sears the
conscience; it asphyxiates and starves the intellect. It is
full of wretchedness, stops up every avenue of real joy,
drowning all the music of delight in the chink of gold."-
Peloubet.
    3. The Revised Version renders this text, "For the wicked
boasteth of his heart's, desire, and the covetous renounceth,
yea, contemneth Jehovah." No deep-seated love for God can
dwell in a covetous heart.
    4. "God cannot approve of the least degree of covetousness
or selfishness, and He abhors the prayers and exhortations
of those who indulge these evil traits. As Satan sees that
his time is short, he leads men on to be more and more selfish
and covetous, and then exults as he sees them wrapped up in
themselves, close, penurious, and selfish. If the eyes of such
could be opened, they would see Satan in hellish triumph, ex-
ulting over them, and laughing at the folly of those who ac-
cept his suggestions and enter his snares."-"Early Writ-
ings," page 268.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  21
    5. "Every selfish, covetous person will fall out by the
way. Like Judas, who sold his Lord, they will sell good
principles and a noble, generous disposition for a little of
earth's gain."—"Early Writings," page 269.
    6. "Instead of giving all for Christ, many have taken
the golden wedge and a goodly Babylonish garment, and hid
them in the camp. If the presence of one Achan was suffi-
cient to weaken the whole camp of Israel, can we be surprised
at the little success which attends our efforts when every
church and almost every family has its Achan? Let us in-
dividually go to work to stimulate others by our example of
disinterested benevolence."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
volume 5, page 157.
    7. "The practice of the truths that Christ taught was
at variance with his [Judas's] desires and purposes, and he
could not bring himself to yield his ideas in order to receive
wisdom from heaven. Instead of walking in the light, he
chose to walk in darkness. Evil desires, covetousness, re-
vengeful passions, dark and sullen thoughts, were cherished
until Satan gained full control of him."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 558.
    8. "If the reservoir be poisoned or polluted, then all the
water drawn from the various faucets in the house will be
poisoned or polluted. If the heart is polluted with covetous-
ness, the deeds from the hands and the words from the
mouth will be evil."— Peloubet.
    9. "When the steamer Central America, with nearly six
hundred passengers aboard, was wrecked off Cape Hatteras,
 September 12, 1857, in a fearful storm, many of the- pas-
sengers, who were returning miners from the gold mines of
California, divested themselves of their treasure belts and
scattered the gold upon the cabin floors, telling those to take
 it who would, lest its weight about their persons should
carry them to their death. 'Full purses, containing in some
instances thousands of dollars, lay around untouched. Carpet-
bags were opened, and the shining metal was poured out on
the floor with the prodigality of death's despair. One of the
passengers opened a bag and dashed about the cabin twenty
thousand dollars in gold dust, and told him who wanted to
gratify his greed for gold to take it. But it was passed by
 untouched, as the veriest dross.' "—"Our First Century,"
 pages 642, 643.

                            Notes
    1. "A man that sows little must expect to reap little. If
he sows a small piece of land, he will reap a small harvest;
or if he is niggardly in sowing, and wishes to save his seed.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 23
and will not commit it to the earth, he must expect to reap
little. So it is in giving."— Barnes.
    2. "Systematic giving is not enough; ten cents a month
for a millionaire would be systematic. Proportionate giving
is not enough; a cent for every hundred dollars of income
would be proportionate. What is needed is a systematic,
generous proportion."— Peloubet.
     We are not to give to the Lord according to our own
fancy, or as other people are giving, or according to other
people's ability, but "every man according to his ability."
    3. " 'God loveth a cheerful giver,' Paul wrote to the
Corinthians, using a word [hilaron] which has been trans-
lated into our 'hilarious.' God loveth such a giver. What
an inheritance! What a baptism! Such a man lives in the
love of the Almighty."— J. H. Jowett.
    "I am so impressed with the importance that God at-
taches to sweet voluntariness that I am often tempted to re-
solve never to beg a cent for God again, but rather spend
my energy in getting Christians spiritualized, assured that
they will certainly become liberalized."— A. J. Gordon.
     4. "The heart of God yearns over His earthly children
with a love stronger than death. In giving up His Son, He
has poured out to us all heaven in one gift."—"Steps to
Christ," page 24.
    "All things Christ received from God, but He took to
give."—"The Desire of Ages," page 21.
    5. To hate is defined to mean "to regard with less affec-
tion, love less, esteem less."
     "To love God with all the heart means not to love at all
 those things that would destroy our love for God. This is
 termed hate. But he who loves God with all his heart, will
 love father, mother, and all others, as no one outside of
 Christ can love them; but his love is ,for their eternal good,
 that they may be saved. To love them supremely is not to
 love God. Such love is worldly, carnal. It will end with
 this life. To love God supremely means oftentimes to for-
 sake the dearest ties of earth; and this the world would call
 hatred."
     6. "The measure of a gift lies not in the largeness of the
 gift, but in the largeness of the love and sacrifice it ex-
 presses; not the size of the gift, but the cost to the giver;
 not the number of the sheaves, or of the measures of fruit,
 but the love and gratitude and faith that fills them. And in
 that great day when we present our fruits at the judgment
 seat, some large sheaves will grow larger by that measure,
 and some will shrink into a handful of half-grown stalks;
 and pebbles which the gatherer' blushes to present as the
 only fruit from barren fields, will grow into gems and gold;
 and homely plants will be transformed into blossoms of
 Paradise; and the widow's mite will become a harp of gold."
 —Pelonbet.
24             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    7. "Nearly all the Macedonian believers were poor in this
world's goods, but their hearts were overflowing with love
for God and His truth, and they gladly gave for the support
of the gospel. When general collections were taken up in
the gentile churches for the relief of the Jewish believers, the
liberality of the converts in Macedonia was held up as an
example to other churches. . . . The willingnes's to sacrifice
on the part of the Macedonian believers came as a result of
whole-hearted consecration. . . . It was not necessary to
urge them to give; rather, they rejoiced in the privilege of
denying themselves even of necessary things in order to sup-
ply the needs of others. When the apostle would have re-
strained them, they importuned him to accept their offering.
In their simplicity and integrity, and in their love for the
brethren, they gladly denied self, and thus abounded in the
fruit of benevolence."-"The Acts of the Apostles," pages
343, 344.

       Note 8.
                             Notes
    1. "God requires no less of His people in these last days,
in sacrifices and offerings, than He did of the Jewish nation.
Those whom He has blessed with a competency, and even the
widow and the fatherless, should not be unmindful of His
blessings. Especially should those whom God has prospered
render to Him the things that are His."—"Testimonies for
the Church," volume 2, page 574.
    2. "Each one gave of what the Lord had given him. The
people brought so willingly and so freely, that there was
more than enough, and Moses had to issue a proclamation
restraining them from giving any more. It is the free giving
from a willing heart for a worthy object that brings the
largest gifts. According to the best estimates, the amount of
gold was about a ton and a fifth (a ton of gold is now worth
about a million dollars) ; of the silver, about four tons and
a fifth; and of bronze or copper (the Biblical brass), nearly
three tons. This shows that the people gave very liberally.
It is impossible to compute the exact amount per head, but it
could not have been less than three dollars for each man.
This would be a large average in our country; but they were
a nation just escaped from slavery. Money was also worth
much more among them than among us now. This, more-
over, does not include the gifts of other materials, as precious
stones, oil, spices, wood, wool, linen, and dyestuffs, all of
which were costly, nor does it make any account of the work
contributed."— Sunday School Times.
    3. A talent of gold, according. to Webster's Dictionary,
was worth $32,640. Authorities differ, some giving a higher
value, some a lower; but on this basis of computation, a hun-
dred thousand talents of gold, expressed in our currency,
26         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
would be $3,264,000,000. A talent of silver, according to the
same authority, was worth $2,176. The value of a thousand
thousand, or a million, talents of silver, therefore, would be
$2,176,000,000. In these two items, we have the sum of $5,-
440,000,000. When we add to this "brass and iron without
weight," "timber also and stone," also "onyx stones, and
stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colors, and
all manner of precious stones" (1 Chron. 29: 2), together
with the value of the labor performed, we gain some faint
idea of the cost of building the temple.
    4. Three thousand talents of gold, according to the above
basis of value, would be $97,920,000. Seven thousand talents
of silver would be $15,232,000, or a total sum of $113,152,000.
Quite a liberal personal gift!
    5. Five thousand talents, as reckoned above, would be
equal to $163,200,000; ten thousand talents of silver, to $21,-
760,000. Some authorities reckon a dram of gold at $5.50.
On this basis, ten thousand drams would be equal to $55,000.
Reckoning a talent of brass at about $800, as given by some
authorities, 18,000 talents would be $14,400,000, or a total of
gold, silver, and brass alone of $199,360,000.
    In addition to this, "one hundred thousand talents of iron"
is mentioned as having been given by "the chief of the
fathers," "princes of the tribes," etc. It would seem "the
leaders took the lead" in giving as well as in other things.
    6. "Angels were so interested for man's salvation that
there could be found among them those who would yield their
glory and give their life for perishing man. 'But,' said my
accompanying angel, 'that would avail nothing.' The trans-
gression was so great that an angel's life would not pay the
debt. Nothing but the death and intercession of God's Son
would pay the debt, and save lost man from hopeless sorrow
and misery."—"Early Writings," page 127.
    7. "In the parable, the pearl is not represented as a gift.
The merchantman bought it at the price of all that he had.
Many question the meaning of this, since Christ is rep-
resented in the Scriptures as a gift. He is a gift, but only to
those who give themselves, soul, body, and spirit, to Him
without reserve."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 116.
    8. "How many surprises there will be in the age to come,
when all the lines of spiritual influence are revealed, that
have contributed to the elevation of a man into the eternal
life! Men from India, China, and Africa will say to you:
`You are my friend. Welcome here! You do not know me,
but I have learned that it is due to sacrifices that you made,
and money that you gave, that I ever heard the gospel. We
are friends.' "— Bosworth.

   1. "Since God is the owner of all our goods, shall not
gratitude to Him prompt us to make freewill offerings and
28          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

thank offerings, thus acknowledging His ownership of soul,
body, spirit, and property? Had God's plan been followed,
means would now be flowing into His treasury; and funds to
enable ministers to enter new fields, and workers to unite
with ministers in lifting up the standard of truth in the
dark places of the earth, would be abundant."—"Testimonies
for the Church," volume 6, page 386.
   2. Christ's ownership of the earth and all things that are
therein, and of man, is His by right, not only by creation, but
by redemption as well. Through His death, Christ bought
back the lost dominion; and when redemption is finished,
man's Eden home will be restored to the redeemed.
   3. Man is a steward over the Lord's goods. "The Lord
would have every one acknowledge that He is the rightful
owner of all the goods which He has lent us to trade upon.
He says to us, Render back to Me the tithes and gifts and
offerings, as a token of your loyalty to Me, and of your de-
pendence upon Me."— Mrs. E. G. White, in Home Missionary
Extra, December, 1894, page 34.
   4. The Lord withheld from man but one thing. He re-
served the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The test
was whether man, to whom was given all else in the garden,
would let that alone which the Creator had reserved to
Himself.
   5. In the reservation of the tithe as holy to Himself,
the Lord has in principle placed before man the same test
that was before Adam in Eden. The test is whether man will
recognize God's right of ownership, by returning to Him that
which God has reserved for His own work.

                            Notes
    1. "Many who profess to be keeping the commandments
of God are appropriating to their own use the means which
the Lord has intrusted to them, and which should come into
His treasury. They rob God in tithes and in offerings. They
dissemble, and withhold from Him to their own hurt. They
bring leanness and poverty upon themselves and darkness
upon the church, because of their covetousness, their dis-
sembling, and their robbing God in tithes and in offerings."
-"Testimonies for the Church," volume 3, page 269.
    2. A tithe is one tenth of our income. The difference be-
tween income and increase is defined by Webster as follows:
    "Income, that gain which proceeds from labor, business,
or property of any kind; the produce of a farm; the rent of
houses, the proceeds of professional business; the profits of
commerce or of occupation; the interest of money or stock in
funds, etc., revenue; receipts, especially the annual receipts
of a private person or corporation from property." /The
total receipts from any branch of business are gross income.
 That portion which remains after paying wages, for material,
 etc., is net income.
    "Increase, to become greater in size, quantity, number, de-
 gree, value, intensity, authority, reputation, etc. To grow;
 to augment; to advance." One tenth of all that comes in as
 gain, or net income from all sources, is a tithe.
    3. "The special system of tithing was founded upon a
 principle which is as enduring as the law of God. This
30         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
system of tithing was a blessing to the Jews, else God would
not have given it them. So also will it be a blessing to those
who carry it out to the end of time. Our heavenly Father
did not originate the plan of systematic benevolence to en-
rich Himself, but to be a great blessing to man. He saw
that this system of beneficence was just what man needed."
—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 3, pages 404, 405.
    4. "In the Hebrew economy, one tenth of the income of
the people was set apart to support the public worship of
God. . . . But the tithing system did not originate with the
Hebrews. From the earliest times the Lord claimed a tithe
as His; and this claim was recognized and honored. Abra-
ham paid tithes to Melchizedek, the priest of the most high
God. Jacob, when at Bethel, an exile and a wanderer, prom-
ised the Lord, 'Of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely
give the tenth unto Thee.' As the Israelites were about to
be established as a nation, the law of tithing was reaffirmed,
as one of the divinely ordained statutes upon obedience to
which their prosperity depended."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," page 525.
    5. Upon the receipt of means, the tithe should be taken
out first, and laid aside as sacred to the Lord, and as soon as
possible sent on to His treasury. We should always place the
Lord first in all our plans.
    6. "Let the church appoint pastors or elders who are de-
voted to the Lord Jesus, and let these men see that officers
are chosen who will attend faithfully to the work of gather-
ing in the tithe. If the pastors show that they are not fitted
for their charge, if they fail to set before the church the im-
portance of returning to God His own, if they do not see to it
that the officers under them are faithful and that the tithe
is brought in, they are in peril. They are neglecting a mat-
ter which involves a blessing or a curse to the church. They
should be relieved of their responsibility, and other men
should be tested and tried."— Mrs. E. G. White, in Supple-
ment to Review and Herald, December 1, 1896.
    7. In all the Book of God there is no greater promise of
reward for faithfulness than is set forth in these words to
those who return to the Lord a faithful tithe. The very
windows of heaven will be opened upon them, the devourer
rebuked, their barns be filled with plenty, and blessing un-
measured poured out upon them. It is hard to understand
how the Lord could place before us any more abundant bless-
ing than He has been pleased to do here by the mouth of His
 servant. It is indeed sad that man's heart by selfishness and
 covetousness becomes so hardened as to withhold from the
 Lord His own. Surely if we fulfill our part, the Lord will
 make good His promise.

                             Notes
    1. Just as those who plant a vineyard may rightfully eat
of its fruit, or those who feed the flock may properly par-
take of the milk of the flock, or those who minister about
 holy things of the temple receive support from the temple,
"even so," or in like manner, has the Lord "ordained" (that
is, set in order, established, appointed, decreed, enacted) that
those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel. The in-
spired apostle here clearly shows that the Lord has an or-
dained or established plan for the support of His workers.
The Lord pays them for their labor from that which He
has reserved as holy, and He has clearly set forth the source
from which their support is to come. No earthly government
sends out soldiers without making proper provision for their
support and care; much less the perfect government of
heaven.
    2. The portion of the Levites was the tenth. Num. 18: 21.
When this was withheld, they went to work in the field. As a
result, the service of God was neglected, and His house for-
saken. The same result will follow now as then, if we with-
hold that which belongs to the treasury of God. Many more
laborers would be to-day in the field, proclaiming the gospel
in home and foreign lands, if an honest tithe were paid by all.
    "The magnitude of our work calls for willing liberality
on the part of the people of God. In Africa, in China, in
India, there are thousands, yes, millions, whoeav not heard
the message of the truth for this time. They must be
warned. The islands of the sea are waiting for a knowledge
of God. . . . The Lord has made us His stewards. He has
placed His means in our hands for faithful distribution. He
asks us to render to Him His own. He has reserved the
tithe as His sacred portion, to be used in sending the gospel
to all parts of the world. My brethren and sisters, confess
and forsake your selfishness, and bring to the Lord your
gifts and offerings. Bring Him also the tithe that you have
withheld. Come confessing your neglect. Prove the Lord,
as He has invited you to do."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
volume 9, pages 51, 52.
    3. The principle of tithing rests on a moral obligation.
It is a recognition of God's ownership. It is designed to keep
us from setting our hearts upon earthly treasures. Continual
giving of that which we receive and which we may need, tends
to wither and starve covetousness. Tithing is ordained of
God as a blessing to all. Ministers and others laboring in
     •     SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     33
the work of God are in no way exempt from the temptation
to selfishness. They need the blessing of the tithing system,
and should pay a strict and honest tithe into the Lord's
treasury, not only that they may experience the blessing
which comes from obeying the Lord, but also as an example
to believers.
    4. "Instead of giving all for Christ, many have taken the
golden wedge and a goodly Babylonish garment, and hid
them in the camp. If the presence of one Achan was suffi-
cient to weaken the whole camp of Israel, can we be surprised
at the little success which attends our efforts when every
church and almost every family has its Achan? Let us in-
dividually go to work to stimulate others by our example of
disinterested benevolence. The work might have gone for-
ward with far greater power had all done what they could
to supply the treasury with means."—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 5, page 157.
    5. "The history of Ananias and Sapphira is given us that
we may understand the sin of deception in regard to our
gifts and offerings. They had voluntarily promised to give
a portion of their property for the promotion of the cause of
Christ; but when the means was in their hands they declined
to fulfill that obligation, at the same time wishing it to ap-
pear to others that they had given all. Their punishment
was marked, in order that it might serve as a perpetual
warning to Christians of all ages. The same sin is fearfully
prevalent at the present time, yet we hear of no such signal
punishment. The Lord shows men once with what abhor-
rence He regards such an offense against His sacred claims
and dignity, and then they are left to follow the general
principles of the divine administration."—Id., volume 5, pages
148, 149-
    6. The prayers of Cornelius were in no way hindered by
stinginess. With his prayers he made offerings to God.
 Both came up for a memorial before God. It is our privilege
to have like memorials come up before the Lord.

   Questions and Answers
      "I wish to acknowledge sincere appreciation of the new
   book 'Questions and Answers.' I have briefly sketched
t through many pages, and believe that it fills a long-felt need,
   and is a compendium of real logical and conclusive answers
rl to the many questions propounded by cavilers against the
li
 z truth. The book should be in the hands of every Seventh-day
   Adventist, especially those who have to meet the public in
   presenting the truth."
     "I have received the book 'Questions and Answers.' While
   I have several hundred books in my library, I think this is
   one of the very best. It is so arranged that a busy man can
   turn quickly to any point he may require, and is a mine of
   information on many questions. . . . All who study this little
   book must be impressed with its value."
      "I think it is indeed a valuable book. I have wondered
    more than once why the splendid answers to these various
    puzzling questions which have been printed in the Signs from
    time to time have not been put out in convenient reference
    form, and I am sure the people everywhere will welcome it as
    just what they have been looking for,"
      "That valuable little book 'Questions and Answers' came
    to hand. All who have seen this little gem speak very highly
    of it, and would not part with it for many times its price if
