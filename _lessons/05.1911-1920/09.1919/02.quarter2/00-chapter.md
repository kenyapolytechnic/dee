                             Notes
     1. "It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the
pit of sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and
we cannot change them. 'Who can bring a clean thing out of
an unclean? — Not one.' The carnal mind is enmity against
God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
can be.' Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human
effort, all have their proper sphere, but here they are power-
less. They may produce an outward correctness of behavior,
but they cannot change the heart; they cannot purify the
springs of life. There must be a power working from within,
a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin
to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can
quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to
God, to holiness."—"Steps to Christ," page •20.
     2. "This was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have re-
mained at the Father's side. He might have retained the
glory of heaven, and the homage of the angels. But He chose
to give back the scepter into the Father's hands, and to step
down from the throne of the universe, that He might bring
 light to the benighted, and life to the perishing."—"Desire
of Ages," page 23.
     3. " 'Propitiation' means mercy seat, or covering. The
 mercy seat covering the ark of the covenant was called a
 propitiation. Ex. 25: 22. It is that by which God covers,
overlooks, and pardons the penitent and believing sinner be-
 cause of Christ's death. Propitiation furnishes a ground on
 the which God could set forth His righteousness, and yet par-
 don sinful men. Rom. 3: 25, 26. Christ Himself is the pro-
 pitiatory sacrifice. 1 John 2: 2. The death of Jesus Christ
is set forth as the ground on which a righteous God can par-
 don a guilty and sinful race without in any way compromising
 His righteousness."— Wm. Evans, indtiGreat Doctrines of the
 Bible," page 72.
     4. "The meaning of a ransom is clearly set forth in Lev.
25: 47-49 — to deliver a thing or person by paying a price;
 to buy back a person or thing by paying the price for which
 it is held in captivity. So sin is like a slave market in which
 sinners are sold under sin. Rom. 7: 14. Souls are under
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
sentence of death. Ezek. 18: 4. Christ, by His death, buys
sinners out of the market, thereby indicating complete de-
liverance from the service of sin. He looses the bonds, sets
the prisoners free, by paying a price — that price being His
own precious blood."—Id., page 71.
    5. "Through type and promise, God 'preached before the
gospel unto Abraham.' And the patriarch's faith was fixed
upon the Redeemer to come. Said Christ to the Jews, 'Your
father Abraham rejoiced that he should see My day; and He
saw it, and was glad.' The ram offered in the place of Isaac
represented the Son of God, who was to be sacrificed in our
stead. When man was doomed to death by transgression of
the law of God, the Father, looking upon His Son, said to the
sinner, 'Live: I have found a ransom.' "—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," page 154.
    6. "Jesus refused to receive the homage of His people un-
til He had the assurance that His sacrifice was accepted by
the Father. He ascended to the heavenly courts, and from
God Himself heard the assurance that His atonement for the
sins of men had been ample, that through His blood all might
gain eternal life. The Father ratified the covenant made
with Christ, that He would receive repentant and obedient
men, and would love them even as He loves His Son. Christ
was to complete His work, and fulfill His pledge to 'make a
man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden
wedge of Ophir.' All power in heaven and on earth was
given to the Prince of life, and He returned to His followers
in a world of sin, that He might impart to them of His power
and glory."—"Desire of Ages," page 790.

                              Notes
    1. "A repentance such as this, is beyond the reach of our
own power to accomplish; it is obtained only from Christ,
who ascended up on high, and has given gifts unto men.
6          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    "Just here is a point on which many err, and hence they
fail of receiving the help that Christ desires to give them.
They think that they cannot come to Christ unless they first
repent, and that repentance prepares for the forgiveness of
their sins. . . . But must the sinner wait till he has repented
before he can come to Jesus? Is repentance to be made an
obstacle between the sinner and the Saviour? . . . It is the
virtue that goes forth from Christ, that leads to genuine re-
pentance. . . . We can no more repent without the Spirit of
Christ to awaken the conscience than we can be pardoned
without Christ."—"Steps to Christ," pages 29, 30.
    2. "It is true that men sometimes become ashamed of their
sinful ways, and give up some of their evil habits, before they
are conscious that they are being drawn to Christ. But when-
ever they make an effort to reform, from a sincere desire to
do right, it is the power of Christ that is drawing them. An
influence of which they are unconscious works upon the soul,
and the conscience is quickened, and the outward life is
amended. And as Christ draws them to look upon His cross,
to behold Him whom their sins have pierced, the command-
ment comes home to the conscience. The wickedness of their
life, the deep-seated sin of the soul, is revealed to them."—
Id., page 31.
    3. "Those who have not humbled their souls before God
in acknowledging their guilt, have not yet fulfilled the first
condition of acceptance. If we have not experienced that re-
pentance which is not to be repented of, and have not with
true humiliation of soul and brokenness of spirit confessed
our sins, abhorring our iniquity, we have never truly sought
for the forgiveness of sin; and if we have never sought, we
have never found the peace of God. .      . True confession is
always of a specific character, and acknowledges particular
sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before
God only; they may be wrongs that should be confessed to
individuals who have suffered injury through them; or they
may be of a public character, and should then be as publicly
confessed. But all confession should be definite and to the
point, acknowledging the very sins of which yoti are guilty."
— Id., pages 42, 43.
    4. "The preaching of the Word is of no avail without the
presence and aid of the Holy Spirit; for this Spirit is the only
effectual teacher of divine truth. .Only when the truth is ac-
companied to the heart by the Spirit, will it quicken the con-
science or transform the life. A minister may be able to pre-
sent the letter of the word of God; he may be familiar with
all its commands and promises; but his sowing of the gospel
seed will not be successful unless this seed is quickened into
life by the dew of heaven. Without the cooperation of the
Spirit of God, no amount of education, no advantages, how-
ever great, can make one channel of light."—"Gospel Work-
ers," page 284.

                             Notes
    1. The American Revised Version of Heb. 11: 1 is, "Now
faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things
not seen."
    "In like manner you are a sinner. You cannot atone for
your past sins, you cannot change your heart, and make your-
8           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
self holy. But God promises to do all this for you through
Christ. You believe that promise. You confess your sins,
and give yourself to God. You will to serve Him. Just as
surely as you do this, God will fulfill His word to you. If you
believe the promise,— believe that you are forgiven and
cleansed,— God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just
as Christ gave the paralytic power to walk when the man
believed that he was healed. It is so if you believe it"—
"Steps to Christ," page 55.
   2. "Do not wait to feel that you are made whole, but say,
`I believe it; it is so, not because I feel it, but because God
has promised.' "—Ibid.
    "Many are inquiring, 'How am I to make the surrender
of myself to God?' You desire to give yourself to Him, but
you are weak in moral power, in slavery to doubt, and con-
troled by the habits of your life of sin. Your promises and
resolutions are like ropes of sand. You cannot control your
thoughts, your impulses, your affections. The knowledge of
your broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens your
confidence in your own sincerity, and causes you to feel that
God cannot accept you; but you need not despair. What you
need to understand is the true force of the will. This is the
governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision,
or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the
will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs
to exercise. You cannot change your heart, you cannot of
yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to
serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work
in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure."—
Id., pages 51, 52.
    3. "The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere intellec-
tual assent to the truth. He who waits for entire knowledge
before he will exercise faith, cannot receive blessing from
God. It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must be-
lieve in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which
embraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His
merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving
faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ join
themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is
life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding
trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power."—"De-
sire of Ages," page .947.
    4. "When we speak of faith, there is a distinction that
should be borne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is
wholly distinct from faith. The existence and power of God,
the truth of His word, are facts that even Satan and his
hosts cannot at heart deny. The Bible says that 'the devils
also believe, and tremble;' but this is not faith. Where there
is not only a belief in God's word, but a submission of the will
to Him; where the heart is yielded to Him, the affections fixed
upon Him, there is faith,— faith that works by love, and
purifies the soul."—"Steps to Christ," page 68.

      regeneration? Gal. 3: 26, 27. Note 5.
                             Notes
    1. "There are• thousands to-day who need to learn the
 same truth that was taught to Nicodemus by the uplifted
serpent. They depend on their obedience to the law of God
 to commend them to His favor. When they are bidden to
look to Jesus, and believe that He saves them solely through
 His grace, they exclaim, 'How can these things be?"'—"De-
sire of Ages," page 175.
    2. "No human invention can find a remedy for the sin-
ning soul. . . . The fountain of the heart must be purified
before the streams can become pure. He who is trying to
reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law, is at-
tempting an impossibility. There is no safety for one who
has merely a legal religion, a form of godliness. The Chris-
tian's life is not a modification or improvement of the old,
but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and
sin, and a new life altogether. This change can be brought
about only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. —
Id., page 172.
    3. "Not all the wisdom and skill of man can produce life
in the smallest object in nature. It is only through the life
which God Himself has imparted, that either plant or animal
can live. So it is only through the life from God that spiritual
life is begotten in the hearts of men. Unless a man is 'born
from above,' he cannot become a partaker of the life which
Christ came to give."—"Steps to Christ," page 71.
    4. "More than this, Christ changes the heart. He asides
in your heart by faith. You are to maintain this connection
with Christ by faith and the continual surrender of your will
to Him; and so long as you do this, He will work in you to
will and to do according to His good pleasure. So you may
say, 'The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith
of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.' "
—Id., pages 67, 68.
    5. "Here is where thousands fail: they do not believe that
Jesus pardons them personally, individually. They do not
take God at His word. It is the privilege of all who comply
with the conditions to know for themselves that pardon is
freely extended for every sin. Put away the suspicion that
God's promises are not meant for you. They are for every
repentant transgressor. Strength and grace have been pro-
vided through Christ to be brought by ministering angels to
every believing soul."--(d., page 57.

                                   Notes
   1. "Justification by faith is a change in a man's relation
or standing before God. It has to do with the relations that
have been disturbed by sin, and these relations are personal.
12            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 It is a change from guilt and condemnation to acquittal and
 acceptance. Regeneration has to do with the change of the
 believer's nature; justification, with the change of his stand-
 ing before God. . . . According to Deut. 25: 1, it means to
declare or to cause to appear innocent or righteous."— Wm.
 Evans, in "The Great Doctrines of the Bible," page 156.
     2. "There are two errors against which the children of
God—particularly those who have just come to trust in His
grace — especially need to guard. The first, already dwelt
upon, is that of looking to their own works, trusting to any-
thing they can do, to bring themselves into harmony with
God. He who is trying to become holy by his own works in
keeping the law, is. attempting an impossibility. All that man
can do without Christ is polluted with selfishness and sin.
It is the grace of Christ alone, through faith, that can make
us holy."—"Steps to Christ," pages 64, 65.
     3. "The opposite and no less dangerous error is, that be-
lief in Christ releases men from keeping the law of God; that
since by faith alone we become partakers of the grace of
Christ, our works have nothing. to do with our redemption.
But notice here that obedience is not a mere outward com-
pliance, but the service of love. The law of God is an ex-
pression of His very nature; it is an embodiment of the great
principle of love, and hence is the foundation of His govern-
ment in heaven and earth. If our hearts are renewed in the
likeness of God, if the divine love is implanted in the soul,
will not the law of God be carried out in the life?"—

     commandments? 1 John 5: 1-3.
                              Notes
    1. " 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begot-
ten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
but have everlasting           While the law of God is main-
tained, and its justice vindicated, the sinner can be pardoned.
The dearest gift that Heaven itself had to bestow has been
poured out, that God 'might be just, and the justifier of him
which believeth in Jesus.' By that gift, men are uplifted
from the ruin and degradation of sin, to become children of
God. Says Paul, 'Ye have received the Spirit of adoption,
whereby we cry, Abba, Father.'
    "Brethren, with the beloved John I call upon you to 'behold
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God.' What love, what match-
less love, that, sinners and aliens as we are, we may be
brought back to God, and adopted into His family! We may
address Him by the endearing name, 'Our Father,' which is
a sign of our affection for Him, and a pledge of His tender
regard and relationship to us. And the Son of God, behold-
ing the heirs of grace, 'is not ashamed to call them brethren.'
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 They have even a more sacred relationship to God than have
 the angels who have never fallen."—"Testimonies for the
 Church," volume 5, pages 739, 740.
    2. "All the paternal love which has come down from gen-
eration to generation through the channel of human hearts,
all the springs of tenderness which have opened in the souls
 of men, are but as a tiny rill to the boundless ocean, when
compared with the infinite, exhaustless love of God. Tongue
 cannot utter it; pen cannot portray it. You may meditate
upon it every day of your life; you may search the Scriptures
diligently in order to understand it; you may summon every
 power and capability that God has given you, in the endeavor
to comprehend the love and compassion of the heavenly Fa-
ther; and yet there is an infinity beyond. You may study
that love for ages; yet you can never fully comprehend the
length and the breadth, the depth and the height, of the love
of God in giving His Son to die for the world. Eternity it-
self can never fully reveal it. Yet as we study the Bible,
and meditate upon the life of Christ and the plan of redemp-
tion, these great themes will open to our understanding more
and more. And it will be ours to realize the blessing which
Paul desired for the Ephesian church, when he prayed 'that
the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
give unto you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
knowledge of Him; the eyes of your understanding being en-
lightened, that ye may know what is the hope of His calling,
and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the
saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power to
usward who believe.' "— Id., page 740.
  • 3. "We may have high anticipations in regard to the
things of this life, but we shall meet with disappointment.
We shall find that they fade away. But here is 'an inherit-
ance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
reserved in heaven for you.' We .want our thoughts to be
fixed on the things that will abide, not upon those that pass
away with the using. If we fix our hopes on the future, im-
mortal world, we shall not be disappointed.
    "When Christ came into this world, He saw that men had
left the future, eternal life out of their reckoning. He came
to present that life before us, that by beholding it we might
be led to change our relation to the things of this life, that
our affections might be placed upon the things above, and not
upon the things of the earth, so soon to pass away. The
shadow that Satan has caused to intervene between our souls
and God, Christ seeks to roll back, that the view of God and
eternity may become clear. While He does not despise this
world, He places it in its proper position of subordination.
And then He places the things of eternity in their relative
importance before us, that we may fix the eye of faith upon
the unseen. The things of temporal interest have power to
engross the thoughts and affections, and it is important that
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY              15
we should be constantly educating and training our minds
to dwell upon things of eternal interest. Will this make us
unhappy? Will it cause us to have a hard time here? - No,
indeed. Receiving the gift of God will make everything in
life easy. The more of the Spirit of God, the more of His
grace, is brought into our daily experience, the less friction
there will be, the more happiness we shall have, and the more
we shall impart to others."- Mrs. E. G. White, in the "Re-
view and Herald," March 8, 1892.

                               Notes
    1. "Christ became one flesh with us, in order that we might
become one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of this union that
we are to come forth from the grave,— not merely as a mani-
festation of the power of Christ, but because, through faith,
His life has become ours. Those who see Christ in His true
character, and receive Him- into the heart, have everlasting
life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and
the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the be-
ginning of the life eternal."—"Desire of Ages," page 388.
    2. "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to
receive Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives
our sins, and that we are complete in Him. It is by behold-
ing His love, by dwelling upon it, by drinking it in, that we
are to become partakers of His nature. What food is to the
body, Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot benefit us un-
less we eat it; unless it becomes a part of our being. So
Christ is of no value to us if we do not know Him as a per-
sonal Saviour. A theoretical knowledge will do us no good.
We must feed upon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that
His life becomes our life. His love, His grace, must be as-
similated. . . . Are you a follower of Christ? Then all that
is written concerning the spiritual life is written for you,
and may be attained through uniting yourself to Jesus. Is
your zeal languishing? has your first love grown cold? Ac-
cept again of the proffered love of Christ. Eat of His flesh,
drink of His blood, and you will become one with the Father
and with the Son."— Id., pages 389, 390.
    3. " 'I am the Vine, ye are the branches,' Christ said to
His disciples. Though He was about to be removed from
them, their spiritual union with Him was to be unchanged.
The connection of the branch with the vine, He said, repre-
sents the relation you are to sustain to Me. The scion is en-
grafted into the living vine, and fiber by fiber, vein by vein,
it grows into the vine stock. The life of the vine becomes
the life of the branch. So the soul dead in trespasses and sink
receives life through connection with Christ. By faith in
Him as a personal Saviour the union is formed. • The sinner
unites his weakness to Christ's strength, his emptiness to
Christ's fullness, his frailty to Christ's enduring might. Then
he has the mind of Christ. The humanity of Christ has
touched our humanity, and our humanity has touched divinity.
Thus through the agency of the Holy Spirit man becomes a
partaker of the divine nature, He is accepted in the Be-
loved."—Id., pages 675, 676,
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                          17
    4. "The inscrutable power in us reproduces itself in us
through acts of self-sacrifice, through putting away of sin,
through Christian work, through loving deeds, and, in fact,
in all the practical activities and strivings of the Christian
life."— E. Y. Mullin, in "The Christian Religion," page 414.
    5. "Though noW He has ascended to the presence of God,
and shares the throne of the universe, Jesus has lost none
of His compassionate nature. To-day the same tender, sym-
pathizing heart is open to all the woes of humanity. To-day
the hand that was pierced is reached forth to bless more
abundantly His people that are in the world. 'And they shall
never perish; neither shall any man pluck them out of My
hand.' The soul that has given himself to Christ is more
precious in His sight than the whole world. The Saviour
would have passed through the agony of Calvary, that one
might be saved in His kingdom. He will never abandon one
for whom He has died. Unless His followers choose to leave
Him, He will hold them fast."—"Desire of Ages," page 480.

                            Notes
    1. "The life that Christ lived in this world, men and
women can live, through His power and under His instruc-
tion. In their conflict with Satan, they may have all the
help that He had. They may be more than conquerors through
Him who loved them and gave Himself for them. The lives
of .professing Christians who do not live the Christ-life are
a mockery to religion. Every one whose name is registered
on the church roll is under obligation to represent Christ by
revealing the inward adorning of a meek and quiet spirit.
They are to be His witnesses, making known the advantages
of walking and working as Christ has given them example.
The truth for this time is to appear in its power in the lives
of those who believe it, and is to be imparted to the world.
Believers are to represent in their lives its power to sanctify
and ennoble."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9,
page 22.
    2. "The work of transformation from unholiness to holi-
ness is a continuous one. Day by day God labors for man's
sanctification, and man is to cooperate with Him, putting
forth persevering efforts in the cultivation of right habits.
He is to add grace to grace; and as he thus works on the plan
of addition, God works for him on the plan of multiplication.
Our Saviour is always ready to hear and answer the prayer
of the contrite heart, and grace and peace are multiplied to
His faithful ones. Gladly He grants them the blessings•they
need in their struggle against the evils that beset them."—
"Acts of the Apostles," page 532.
    3. "Christ rejoiced that He could do more for His follow-
ers than they could ask or think. He spoke with assurance,
knowing that an almighty decree had been given before the
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY              19
world was made. He knew that truth, armed with the om-
nipotence of the Holy Spirit, would conquer in the contest
with evil; and that the blood-stained banner would wave tri-
umphantly over His followers. He knew that the life of His
trusting disciples would be like His, a series of uninterrupted
victories, not seen to be such here, but recognized as such in
the great hereafter."—"Desire of Ages," page 679.
    4. "Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make 'this
your very first work. Let your prayer be: 'Take me, 0 Lord,
as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me to-
day in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my work be
wrought in Thee.' This is a daily matter. Each morning
consecrate yourself to God for that day. Surrender all your •
plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence
shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving your life
into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more
and more after the life of Christ."—"Steps to Christ," pages
7-4, 75.

14. What will the Lord accomplish through a Spirit-filled
     church? Rom. 9: 28.
                             Notes
   1. "The religion that comes from God is the only religion
that will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must
be born of the divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and
renew the mind, giving us a new capacity for knowing and
loving God. It will give us a willing obedience to all His re-
quirements. This is true worship. It is the fruit of the
working of the Holy Spirit. By the Spirit every sincere
prayer is indited, and such prayer is acceptable to God.
Wherever a soul reaches out after God, there the Spirit's
working is manifest, and God will reveal Himself to that
soul. For such worshipers He is seeking. He waits to re-
ceive them, and to make them His sons and daughters."—
"Desire of Ages," page 189.
    2. "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His
church, and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first
disciples. But like every other promise, it is given on condi-
tions. There are many who believe and profess to claim the
Lord's promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy
Spirit, yet receive no benefit. They do not surrender the soul
to be guided and controlled by the divine agencies. We can-
not use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us. Through
the Spirit God works in His people 'to will and to do of His
good pleasure.' But many will not submit to this. They
want to manage themselves. This is why they do not receive
the heavenly gift."— Id., page 672.
    3. "Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch
for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power
of God awaits their demand and reception. This promised
       •    SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   21
 blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its
 train. It is given according to the riches of the grace of
 Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according to the
 capacity to receive."— Ibid.
     4. "Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the
 mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead, who would
 come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine
 power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been
 wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit
 that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer
 becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given
 His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and
 cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His . own char-
 acter upon His church."— Id., page .671.
     5. "The Comforter is called the Spirit of truth.' His
 work is to define and maintain the truth. He first dwells in
 the heart as the Spirit of truth, and thus He becomes the
 Comforter. There is comfort and peace in the truth, but no
 real peace or comfort can be found in falsehood. It is through
 false theories and traditions that Satan gains his power over
 the mind. By directing men to false standards, he misshapes
 the character. Through the Scriptures the Holy Spirit speaks
 to the mind, and impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He
 exposes error, and expels it from the soul. It is by the Spirit
 of truth, working through the word of God, that Christ sub-
 dues His chosen people to Himself."— Ibid.
     6. "As the disciples, filled with the power of the Spirit,
 went forth to proclaim the gospel, so God's servants are to
 go forth to-day. Filled with an unselfish desire to give the
 message of mercy to those who are in the darkness of error
 and unbelief, we are to take up the Lord's work. He gives
 us our part to do in cobpeiiation with Him, and He will also
 move on the hearts of unbelievers to carry forward His work
 in the regions beyond. Already many are receiving the Holy
 Spirit, and no longer will the way be blocked by listless indif-
 ference. Why has the history of the work of the disciples,
 as they labored with holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the
 Holy Spirit, been recorded, if it is not that from this record
 the Lord's people to-day are to gain an inspiration to work
'earnestly for Him? What the Lord did for His people in that
 time, it is just as essential, and more so, that He do for His
 people to-day. All that the apostles did, every church mem-
 ber to-day is to do. And we are to work with as much more
 fervor, to be accompanied by the Holy Spirit in as much
 greater measure, as the increase of wickedness demands a
 more decided call to repentance."—"Testimonies for the
 Church," volume 7, pages 32, 33.

                               Notes
   1. "Our heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the full-
ness of His blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at
the fountain of boundless love. What a wonder it is that we
pray so little! God is ready and willing to hear the sincere
prayer of the humblest of His children, and yet there is much
manifest reluctance on our part to make known our wants to
God. What can the angels of heaven think of poor helpless
human beings, who are subject to temptation, when God's
heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them
more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little,
and have so little faith? The angels love to bow before God;
they love to be near Him. They regard communion with God
as their highest joy; and yet the children of earth, who need
so much the help that God only can give, seem satisfied to
walk without the light of His Spirit, the companionship of
His presence."—"Steps to Christ," page 98.
    2. "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a
friend. Not that it is necessary, in order to make known to
 God what we are, but in order to enable us to receive Him.
 Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings us up to
Him."— Id., page 97.
               "0 strong, upwelling prayers of faith,
                   From inmost founts of life ye start,—
                 The Spirit's pulse, the vital breath
                ' Of soul and heart!
               "From pastoral toil, from traffic's din,
                  Alone, in crowds, at home, abroad,
                Unheard of man, ye enter in
                  The ear of God.
               "Ye brook no forced and measured tasks,
                 Nor weary rote, nor formal chains;
                The simple heart, that freely asks
                 In love, obtains."
                                            —Whittier.
    3. "We should pray in the family circle; and above all we
must not neglect secret prayer, for this is the life of the soul.
It is impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is neg-
lected. Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. In
solitude let the soul be laid open to the inspecting eye of God.
Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God."
—"Steps to Christ," page 102.
    4. "There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate
to offer -up a petition to God. There is nothing that can pre-
24         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
vent us from lifting up our hearts in the spirit of earnest
prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a busi-
ness engagement, we may send up a petition to God, and
plead for divine guidance, as did Nehemiah when he made
his request before King Artaxerxes. A closet of communion
may be found wherever we are. We should have the door
of the heart open continually, and our invitation going up
that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in the
soul."— Id., page 103.
    5. "Jesus said, 'Ye shall ask in My name: and I say not
unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father
Himself loveth you.' I have chosen you, . . . that whatso-
ever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it
you.' But to pray in the name of Jesus is something more
than a mere mention of that name at the beginning and the
ending of a prayer. It is to pray in the mind and spirit of
Jesus, while we believe His promises, rely upon His grace,
and work His works."— Id., page 105.
    6. "For the outpouring of the Spirit every lover of the
cause of truth should pray. And as far as lies in our power,
we are to remove every hindrance to His working. The
Spirit can never be poured out while variance and bitterness
toward one another are cherished by the members of the
church. Envy, jealousy, evil surmising, and evil speaking
are of Satan, and they effectually bar the way against the
Holy Spirit's working."—"Testimonies for the Church," vol-
ume 6, page 42.
    7. We should be broad but definite in our prayers. The
good not only of our immediate neighbors, but of the com-
munity at large, should have a place in our supplications.
Especially should we remember the poor and needy, the sick
and the afflicted, that God may kindly dispose toward them
the hearts of those who can and should serve them, including
our own naturally selfish hearts.
    The Scriptural injunction to pray for kings, and for all
that are in authority, presents a still wider field for our peti-
tions, a field not merely as wide as our own nation, but em-
bracing the whole world. The rulers of the world need the
prayers of Christian people, that they may be men loving
justice and hating covetousness.
    Clean, just government is a thing much to be desired, and
for this we should pray. Civil rulers, while charged with
heavy responsibilities, are surrounded by strong evil influ-
ences. We should pray for them not only that they may gov-
ern justly and administer wisely the affairs of state, but that
their hearts may be turned to God and their wills be surren-
dered to Him. Especially in these last days, this time of
crisis in the affairs of men and nations, should Christians
pray for their rulers that the wrath of men may be made to
praise God, and that the remainder of wrath may be re-
strained; that civil order perish not from the earth, and that
God's work be not hindered.

26         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
                              Notes
    1. " 'Man shall not live by-bread alone, but by every word
of God.' Often the follower of Christ is brought where he
cannot serve God and carry forward his worldly enterprises.
Perhaps it appears that obedience to some plain requirement
of God will cut off his means of support. Satan would make
him believe that . he must sacrifice his conscientious convic-
tions. But the only thing in our world upon which we can
rely, is the word of God. 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added
unto you.' Even in this life it is not for our good to depart
from the will of our Father in heaven. When we learn the
power of His word, we shall not follow the suggestions of
Satan in order to obtain food or to save our lives. Our only
questions will be, What is God's command? and what His
promise? Knowing these, we shall obey the one, and, trust
the other."—"Desire of Ages," page 121.
    2. "By looking constantly to Jesus with the eye of faith, we
shall be strengthened. God will make the most precious reve-
lations to His hungering, thirsting people. They will find
that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon His
word, they find that it is spirit and life. The Word destroys
the natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ
Jesus. The Holy Spirit comes to the soul as a Comforter.
By the transforming agency of His grace, the image of God
is reproduced in the disciple; he becomes a new creature.
Love takes the place of hatred, and the heart receives the
divine similitude. This is what it means to live 'by every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.' This is eat-
ing the Bread that comes down from heaven."— Id., page 391.
    3. "We cannot obtain wisdom without earnest attention
and prayerful study. Some portions of Scripture are indeed
too plain to be misunderstood; but there are others whose
meaning does not lie on the surface, to be seen at a glance.
Scripture must be compared with scripture. There must be
careful research and prayerful reflection. And such study
will be richly repaid. As the miner discovers veins of pre-
cious metal concealed beneath the surface of the earth, so
will he who perseveringly searches the word of God as for
hid treasure, find truths of the greatest value, which are con-
cealed from the view of the careless seeker. The words of
inspiration, pondered in the heart, will be as streams flowing
from the fountain of life."—"Steps to Christ," pages 95, 96.
    4. "There is but little benefit derived from a hasty read-
ing of the Scriptures. One may read the whole Bible through,
and yet fail to see its beauty or comprehend its deep and hid-
den meaning. One passage studied until its significance is
clear to the mind, and its relation to the plan of salvation is
evident, is of more value than the perusal of many chapters
with no definite purpose in view and no positive instruction
gained. Keep your Bible with you. As you have opportunity,
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   27
read it; fix the texts in your memory. Even while you are
walking the streets, you may read a passage, and meditate
upon it, thus fixing it in the mind."— Id., page 95.
    5. "The theme of redemption is one that the angels de-
sire to look into; it will be the science and the song of the
redeemed throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity. Is it
not worthy of careful thought and study now? The infinite
mercy and love of Jesus, the sacrifice made in our behalf,
                                     call for the most serious
                                     and solemn reflection. We
                                     should dwell upon the
                                     character of our dear Re-
                                     deemer and Intercessor.
                                     We should meditate upon
                                     the mission of Him who
                                     came to save His people
                                     from their sins. As we
                                     thus contemplate heavenly
                                     themes, our faith and love
                                     will grow stronger, and our
                                     prayers will be more and
                                     more acceptable to God, be-
                                     cause they will be more and
                                     more mixed with faith and
                                     love. They will be intelli-
                                     gent and fervent. There
                                     will be more constant confi-
                                     dence in Jesus, and a daily,
                                     living experience in His
                                     power to save to the utter-
                                     most all that come unto
                                      God by Him. As we medi-
                                     tate upon the perfections of
the Saviour, we shall desire to be wholly transformed, and
 renewed in the image of His purity. There will be a hunger-
ing and thirsting of soul to become like Him whom we adore.
 The more our thoughts are upon Christ, the more we shall
speak of Him to others, and represent Him to the world."—
 Id., pages 93, 94.
     6. "The teaching of Christ was the expression of an in-
wrought conviction and experience, and those who learn of
 Him become teachers after the divine order. The word of
 God, spoken by one who is himself sanctified through it, has
 a life-giving power that makes it attractive to the hearers,
 and convicts them that it is a living reality. When one has
 received the truth in the love of it, he will make this mani-
 fest in the persuasion of his manner and the tones of his
 voice. He makes known that which he himself has heard,
 seen, and handled of the word of life, that others may have
 fellowship with him through the knowledge of Christ. His
 testimony, from lips touched with a live coal from off the
 altar, is truth to the receptive heart, and works sanctification
 upon the character."—"Desire of Ages," page 142.

                                Notes
      1. "Here was a work for them to do,— to go to a heathen
  home, and tell of the blessing they had received from Jesus.
  It was hard for them to be separated from the Saviour. Great
  difficulties were sure to beset them in association with their
  heathen countrymen. And their long isolation from society
  seemed to have disqualified them for the work He had indi-
  cated. But as soon as Jesus pointed out their duty, they were
  ready to obey. Not only did they tell their own households
  and neighbors about Jesus, but they went throughout De-
. capolis, everywhere declaring His power to save, and de-
  scribing how He had freed them from the demons. In doing
  this work, they could receive a greater blessing than if,
  merely for benefit to themselves, they had remained in His
  presence. It is in working to spread the good news of salva-
  tion that we are brought near to the Saviour."—"Desire of
  Ages," pages 339, 340.
       2. "Intense earnestness should now take possession of us.
  Our slumbering energies should be aroused to untiring effort.
  Consecrated workers should go forth into the field clearing
  the King's highway, and gaining victories in new places. My
  brother, my sister, is it nothing to you to know that every
  day souls are going down into the grave unwarned and un-
  saved, ignorant of their need of eternal life and of the atone-
  ment made for them by the Saviour? Is it nothing to you
  that soon the world is to meet Jehovah over His broken law?
  Heavenly angels marvel that those who for so many years
  have had the light, have not carried the torch of truth into
  the dark places of the earth."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
  volume 9, page 44.
       3. "Those who give their lives to Christlike ministry know
  the meaning of true happiness. Their interests and their
  prayers reach far beyond self. They themselves are growing
  as they try to help others. They become familiar with the
  largest plans, the most stirring enterprises; and how can they
  but grow when they place themselves in the divine channel of
  light and blessing? Such ones receive wisdom from heaven.
   They become more and more identified with Christ in all His
  plans. There is no opportunity for spiritual stagnation.
  Selfish ambition and self-seeking are rebuked by constant
  contact with the absorbing interests, the elevated aspirations,
  which belong to high and holy activities."— Id., page 42.
       4. "When the reproach of indolence and slothfulness shall
  have been wiped away from the church, the Spirit of the Lord
  will be graciously manifested. Divine power will be revealed.
   The church will see• the providential working of the Lord of
   hosts. The light of truth will shine forth in clear, strong
   rays, and as in the time of the apostles, many souls will turn
  from error to truth. The earth will be lighted with the glory
   of the Lord."— Id., page 46.

    5. "Among professing Christians of to-day there is a fear-
ful lack of the sympathy that should be felt for souls unsaved.
Unless our hearts beat in unison with the heart of Christ,
how can we understand the sacredness and importance of the
work to which we are called by the words, 'Watch for souls,
as they that must give an account'? We talk of Christian
missions. The sound of our voices is heard; but do we feel
Christ's tender-heart-longing for souls?"— Id., page 45-
    6. "In the estimation of the rabbis, it was the sum of
religion to be always in a bustle of activity. They depended
upon some outward performance to show their superior piety.
Thus they separated their souls from God, and built them-
selves up in self-sufficiency. The same dangers still exist.
As activity increases, and men become successful in doing
any work for God, there is danger of trusting to human
plans and methods. There is a tendency to pray less, and
to have less faith. Like the disciples, we are in danger of
losing sight of our dependence on God, and seeking to make
a saviour of our activity. We need to look constantly to
Jesus, realizing that it is His power which does the work.
While we are to labor earnestly for the salvation of the lost,
we must also take time for meditation, for prayer, and for
the study of the word of God. Only the work accomplished
with much prayer, and sanctified by the merit of Christ, will
in the end prove to have been efficient for good."—"Desire of
Ages," page 862.

                            Notes
    1. "Christ was the only sinless one who ever dwelt on
earth; yet for nearly thirty years He lived among the wicked
inhabitants of Nazareth. This fact is a rebuke to those who
think themselves dependent upon place, fortune, or prosperity,
in order to live a blameless life. Temptation, poverty, adver-
sity is the very discipline needed to develop purity and firm-
ness. . . . Jesus did not shirk care and responsibility, as do
many who profess to be His followers. It is because they
seek to evade this discipline that so many are weak and in-
efficient. They may possess precious and amiable traits, but
they are nerveless and almost useless when difficulties are to
be met or obstacles surmounted. The positiveness and energy,
the solidity and strength of character manifested in Christ,
are to be developed in us, through the same discipline that He
endured. And the grace that He received is for us."—"De-
sire of Ages," pages 72, 73.
     2. "God, in His great love, is seeking to develop in us the
 precious graces of His Spirit. He permits us to encounter
 obstacles, persecution, and hardships, not as a curse, but as
the greatest blessing of our lives. Every temptation re-
 sisted, every trial bravely borne, gives us a new experience,
 and advances us in the work of character building. The soul
82         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
that through divine power resists temptation, reveals to the
world and to the heavenly universe the efficiency of the grace
of Christ."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," pages
170, 171.
    3. "The omnipotent power of the Holy Spirit is the de-
fense of eyery contrite soul. Not one that in penitence and
faith has claimed His protection will Christ permit to pass
under the enemy's power. The Saviour is by the side of His
tempted and tried ones. With Him there can be no such thing
as failure, loss, impossibility, or defeat; we can do all things
through Him who strengthens us. When temptations and
trials come, do not wait to adjust all the difficulties, but look
to Jesus, your helper."—"Desire of Ages," pages 490, 493.
    4. " 'The prince of this world cometh,' said Jesus, 'and
bath nothing in Me.: There was in Him nothing that re-
sponded to Satan's sophistry. He did not consent to sin.
Not even by a thought did He yield to temptation. So it may
be with us. Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He
was fitted for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
And He came to make us partakers of the divine nature. So
long as we are united to Him by faith, sin has no more do-
minion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to
direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we
may attain to perfection of character."— Id., page 123.
    5. "How this is accomplished, Christ has shown us. By
what means did He overcome in the conflict with Satan? —
By the word of God. Only by the Word could He resist temp-
tation. 'It is written,' He said. And unto us are given 'ex-
ceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might
be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the cor-
ruption that is in the world through lust.' Every promise in
God's word is ours. 'By every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God' are we to live. When assailed by tempta-
tion, look not to circumstances or to the weakness of self, but
to the power of the Word. .All its strength is yours. 'Thy
word,' says the psalmist, 'have I hid in mine heart, that I
might not sin against Thee.' B.y the word of Thy lips I have
kept me from the paths of the destroyer.' "—Ibid.
    6. "Let the soul be drawn out and upward, that God may
grant us a breath of the heavenly atmosphere. We may keep
so near to God that in every unexpected trial our thoughts
will turn to Him as naturally as the flower turns to the sun."
—"Steps to Christ," page 104.

                         This heart-gripping story of mis-
                      sion work in the "dark continent"
                      is written by Elder W. H. Anderson,
                      who has labored for over twenty
                      years as a pioneer in Africa.


                  A Letter of Appreciation
  "A copy of Brother Anderson's book, 'On the Trail of Living-
stone,' from your house, reached the headquarters of the Publishing
Department a few days ago. I began reading it at once, and could
hardly stop until I finished it. Somehow there is something about
the book and the way it is written that appeals to me from first to
last more than any other book I have ever read on missionary work
in Africa. It should have a very wide circulation, both outside and
within our denomination."             (Signed) W. W. Eastman.
