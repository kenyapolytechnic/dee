                             Notes
   t. It is characteristic of Jesus' teaching to draw upon the
things of common experience to illustrate spiritual truth. Here
He chooses the tenderest of human relations — that of parent
and child; and selects a touching incident in this relation — a
hungry child asking for something to eat. Parents will and
must refuse some things asked by children, but they do not
refuse food to children when they are hungry. So our heavenly
Father responds to the cry of him who hungers and thirsts after
rightedusness.
  0, We perhaps oftenest, in our thought of this illustration of
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        5
the broad way and the narrow way, apply the lesson to the
doctrinal side of religious confession. Certainly it is important
to follow true doctrine; and the many are prone to go the
broad road of popularity, disregarding the claims of God's law
and the message of truth for these last days. But our Saviour
uses the illustration in this connection to teach, those who are
in the right way doctrinally to be thorou hly in earnest to
walk the way of genuine Christian experience, not judging one
another, but loving and set-ling, and seeking the Lord for the
life of Christ to be revealed in them day ,by day. Thus only
can we keep in the narrow way that leads to life eternal.

Verse 28.
  16. What reason is given for this effect? Verse 29.

                                Notes
    i. With every wind of doctrine blowing, we are to know
 whether influences and teachings are drawing souls to the divine
 standard of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,
 and building up God's cause. See Isa. 8: 20 for the Bible rule.
 And we must not omit applying to our own personal habits of
 life this principle of deciding the nature of a thing by its fruits.
 We hall get no good fruit out of wrong habits of talking, or
 thinking, or. reading, etc. Let us bring ever' practice to the test:;
'gDoes it minister to my spiritual growth7 and yield fruit to
 holiness of life and earnestness in God's service?'"
    2. This wonderful sermon on the mount, so called, is really
 many sermons condensed into one, so full of meaning is every
 passage. Jesus may have given it more fully than is recorded
 here; but as it has come down to us, it is a compendium of
 gospel principles to live by. There could hardly be a more
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    7

fitting close, or climax, to this sermon than the parable of the
two houses. The mere hearing of truth dOes not edify nor
build strength into character. It is only when the truth takes
hold upon the heart and works itself out in the deeds- of life,
that it brings salvation to the hearer.

   18. What precious scripture was thus fulfilled?.
Verse 17.
                              Notes
   i. The leper showed his faith in Jesus' power in two ways :
 by breaking over the restraints of the law of isolation in case
•of leprosy, and coming near enough to be touched by Him;
 and by saying, "Thou canst make me clean." The only question
 in the leper's mind was whether it was the will of the Lord that
 he be healed, or if Jesus would shun him, as others had done.
 In this same way we may consult t; .e will of God when we ask
 for healing power.
   2. In touching the leper, Jesus disregarded the common sen-
 timent toward a leper, "Touch not the unclean thing." The
 same power that creates living tissue, can also restore diseased
 or dead tissue. So may the leprosy of sin be healed by the divine
 touch of grace.
   3. The leprosy was cleansed immediately because the words,
 "Be thou clean," carried in them the active power of cleansing.
   4. According to the Mosaic law, it was the duty of the priest
 to examine and pronounce upon a case of leprosy. Now that
 the leper was healed, Jesus directed him to comply with the
 law in giving the priest evidence of his being cured, and con-
 forming to ceremonial requirements. He was probably a well-
 known case of leprosy, and would gain advantage from the
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     9
 priest's indorsement of his cure, while the priest and the people
 would have evidence of Christ's power to save.
   5. The noble character of the centurion is indicated by his
 deep concern for a servant, by his sense of his own unworthiness,
 and by his unbounded confidence in Jesus' word.
   6. Observe that the centurion said he was "under" authority
 as well as in authority. He knew both how to obey and how to
 command. So he knew the palsy would obey the command of
 the Master.
   7. Verse II suggests the world-wide scope of the .message for
•our times, and ought greatly to encourage us to expect fruit of
 our labors.

                             Notes
  r. Jesus was a reader of men. No spirit or motive escaped
His discernment. We may judge, from Jesus' answer, that the
scribe was prompted by a desire to gain some personal advantage
from following Jesus. That he was one of the disciples seems
apparent from the expression, "another of His disciples," in
verse 21. We are told in "Desire of Ages," page 293, that this
scribe was Judas Iscariot. "Judas believed Jesus to be the
Messiah; and by joining the apostles, he hoped to secure a high
position in the new kingdom. This hope Jesus designed to cut
off by the statement of His poverty."
  2. How often has this cry for help in distress been echoed
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

by the follower of Jesus since tha,t stormy night on the sea!
One of His followers was passing the night in San Francisco at
the time of the great earthquake there. On being waked from
a sound sleep by dhe falling of plaster and debris upon his
bed, and seeing the strong brick walls swaying to and fro, he
cried out, "Lord, save me; I perish." And in the din of that
hour, as in the tempest on the sea, the Lord hearkened. In
tLe hour of temptation also, when the powers of darkness press
sorely upon him, the follower of Jesus cries for deliverance,
and the Master hears.
   3. The demoniacs recognized what even the "children of the
kingdom" failed to discern, that Jesus was the Son of God — the
first time He had been so called since His baptism, as far as
Matthew's record is concerned.
   4. "He allowed the evil spirits to destroy the herd of swine
as a rebuke to those Jews who were. raising these unclean
beasts for the sake of gain. 'Had not Christ restrained the de-
mons, they would have plunged into the sea not only the swine,
but also their keepers and owners. The- preservation of both
the keepers and the owners was due alone to His power, merci-
fully exercised for their deliverance. Furthermore, this event
was permitted to take place that the disciples might witness the
cruel power of Satan upon both man and beak. The Saviour
desired His followers to have a knowledge of the foe whom they
were to meet, that they might not be deceived and overcome
by his devices. It was also His will that the people of that
 region should behold His power to break the bondage of Satan
and release his captives. And though Jesus Himself departed,
the men so marvelously delivered, remained to declare the mercy
of their Benefactor."—"Great Controversy," page 555.

  20. By what parable did Jesus seek to win His hearers
from the Jewish traditions to His teachings? Verse 16. -
Note 6.
  21. Relate His second parable to the same end.
Verse 17.
                           Notes
   t. "Be of good cheer." These words imply that the palsied
man was in distress of mind. The cause of this distress is ,
seen in the words which follow : "Thy sins be forgiven thee."
This man was under conviction of sin. While he wanted to
be healed of palsy, he feared that his sins would bar him from
such a blessing. The reason for bidding him be of good cheer
was to assure him that his sins were forgiven: It was the
natural step, too, toward healing him of physical disease brought
on by sins. Sorrow for sin draws forgiveness and restoring
power from Jesus.
   2. Their cha.rge of blasphemy was based on the truth that no
one but God can forgive sing. Luke 5: 21. The evil in this
charge was that it virtually denied that Jesus was divine.
   3. The Pharisees might as well have asked, Who can heal
but God alone? They could actually see that the effects of sin
in this man's body were removed instantly by the power of
Jesus' word. Has not He who can remove the results of sin
the power to forgive the sin itself? If He can forgive sin,
is He not God? So were the Pharisees answered; and so ought
they to have been convinced on their own ground, that no one
but God can forgive sin.
   4. This is the Matthew who was numbered among the twelve,
and who became the author of the Gospel we are studying. '
Marvelous power in Jesus' bidding, "Follow Me"! The soil in
Matthew's heart had been prepared by the previous' teaching
of Jesus, as was that of thousands who responded to the preach-..
ing of Pentecost. "In the morning sow thy seed, and in the
evening withhold not thy hand."
   5. The fact that John's disciples included the Pharisees with
themselves in asking the question about fasting, indicates that
 the Pharisees had been seeking to create doubt and .disaffettion
among John's disciples as well as those of Jesus. Thus do blind
leaders, by secret and indirect means, seek to draw away dis-
 ciples after themselves.
   6. The traditions and ceremonies of the Jews were like• an
 old garment, threadbare and unsightly, bringing neither com-
 fort nor grace to the wearer. Jesus offered them a new robe
 of righteousness, like cloth of gold and fine twined linen. But
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

before they could wear the new garment, they must put off the
old entirely. The old could not be patched up with parts of
the new. Jesus, the true antitypical Lamb, was about to be
slain for the sins of the world. The typical sacrifices would
no longer have virtue. We must receive Jesus as a whole sacri-
fice, making no reserve to consume upon our selfishness.

 Verse 38.
                            Notes
  1. The tender and fatherly way in which Jesus addressed
those who were in distress, is particularly noticeable. As He
had called the palsied man "son," so. He called this suffering
woman "daughter." How. closely He identified Himself with
needy humanity, frequently calling Himself "Son of man"!
  2. "The maid is not dead, but sleepeth." So simple and tem-
porary a thing does death seem to the great Life-giver! The
i6         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Scriptures often speak of death as a sleep — a Most fitting
term for the state of those who sleep in Jesus, implying, as it_
does, rest, temporary ceasing of activity, a final awakening to
newness of life. The laugh of scorn must have been turned
into shame and surprise when the maiden arose.
  3. There would seem 'to have been no time in the history
of the world when laborers were fewer in comparison with the
greatness of the harvest, than is the case to-day. With a deep
sense of its necessity, we can pray the prayer commended by
our Lord to His -disciples.

                            Notes
  i. The primary meaning of "disciple" is learner, passing-over
into the meaning of one who follows another in, order to learn.
Up to this time, the twelve had been learners in the school of
Christ. Jesus had' chosen them to be intimately associated with
Him clang, that they might learn from the wonderful words
which fell from His lips; witness the exercise of His power to
comfort the sorrowing, heal the sick, and raise the dead; and
observe how to meet the accusations of critical and hostile men
under all sorts of conditions. Now Jesus was to send them forth
to do a similar work, and they were now called apostles —sent
ones.
  2. As Jesus had come to earth to seek and to save the lost
of His Father's universal house, so the apostles were first to
go to seek and to save the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Jews themselves won to Christ, their first mission was to their
Jewish brethren.
  3. The first message preached by John the Baptist, the first
by Jesus Himself, was to be the first preached by the apostles
also —"The kingdom of heaven is at hand." Heaven was truly
come down to earth. • The principles of the kingdom were
18          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

taught and lived. Earth was becoming lightened with its glory.
  4. "Freely." The meaning of this word is not liberally, in
large measure, without restraint, as we generally Use it now.
It is rather free, without pay, without desert. The free gift of
grace, of righteousness, of life, is not merited in any sense by
the recipient. What Christ brought to the world and had
bestowed upon the disciples was given freely — without price,
and without merit. So were they in turn to pass it on to others.
So it was said prophetically of Christ, "They have hated Me
freely," that is, without a cause, without His deserving it. So
also, "Whosoever will, let him take the water ..of life freely."
  5. In this first missionary effort, Jesus established the gospel
principle that "the laborer is worthy of his hire." The apostles
had great gifts to bestow, and these were to be given not as
a "reward ,of merit," but as an outright gift. In comparison
with this, the supplying of their temporal needs by those who
received the gospel, was but a trifle; and the laborer was worthy
of it.

                             Notes
  t. The mission of the worker for Christ is, to save men. For
this reason, he must go out among them, and mingle with
them, searching out those whom he can lead to the Saviour.
In this work, he will encounter those here called "wolves," ready
to intimidate and devour and destroy. Of this class, says Jesus,
"beware," that is, be wary, be watchful, be ready to meet them,
20           SAEBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

not in the spirit of fight, as wolf meets wolf, but as explained
in the following verses.
  2. Jesus says that the faithful worker will be called before
civil authorities "for My sake," or more exactly, "because of
Me." The teaching and ,preaching of Jesus stirs up the wolfish
nature in unrepentant or bigoted hearts. The purpose in allowing
His servants to be-persecuted is here made clear: "for a testimony
to them and to the Gentiles." The gospel must reach men in
authority, and often the only way to get their ear is through
civil process. The worker, then, is to recognize such an occasion
as his opportunity to bear vC,tness for Jesus.
  3. "Take no thought"— the same expression as in Matt. 6: 25-
31, rendered in the Revised Version, "Be not anxious." Its
root idea is, to divide or distract the mind; in short: Do not
worry. Be calm and self-possessed. Be not anxious over the
how or what you shall speak. Depend upon the help of the
Holy Spirit.
  4. Fleeing, though apparently an act of cowardice, is often
the better part of wisdom. There is such a thing as a masterly
retreat in time of battle, to save the lives of men, and conserve
fighting strength. In gospel work, the seeds of truth must be
scattered. Persecution scattered the early Christians away from
Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and they "went every-
where preaching the Word." The worker is not to "tarry at
all hazards," but to go where he can do the most good.
  5. What the disciples had learned from Jesus in quiet retreats,
in the still hours of the night, thcy were to teach openly and
boldly, keeping back ne-ing; and thi, in the face of the hard-
ships they should endure.
  6. "I will not fear what man shall do unto me," but I may
well fear the tempter and destroyer of souls, and find refuge in
the tender care and protection of the Father.

them out to labor for Him. This will help toward a better
understanding of the instruction given. Jesus would have the
disciples understand clearly His mission, that they might not
misapprehend their own as they go forth.
   2. "I came not to cast peace," Revised Version, margin. The
peace mentioned here is evidently social or political peace, for
it was the supreme purpose of Jesus to bring spiritual peace. The
disciples were looking for Jesus to set up a temporal kingdom,
free them from the Roman yoke, and give them rest -and peace
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

from their enemies; in short, to usher in a temporal millennium.
This was not the purpose of His coming. Those who advocate
peace on any other than a spiritual basis, are doomed to final
disappointment.
  3. Jesus never held out the idea that there is no cross-bearing
in His service. The cross comes before the crown. He who
accepts Jesus as his Saviour, not only obtains "remission of sins
that are past," but he enters upon a new experience, the work
of being transformed by His grace in meeting and overcoming
in the daily conflicts of life. The follower of Jesus must follow
Him in bearing the cross day by day, as well as in participating
in "the glory that should follow."
  4. In the service of Christ, nothing is too small to be taken
into account for reward, so long as it is done "in His name"
and for His sake. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these, . . . ye have done it unto Me." So the
giving of even a cup of water "in the name of a disciple" of
Jesus, islireckoned as done in the name of Jesus.

    18. What earnest admonition does Jesus then give?
 Verse 15.
                         'Notes
  t. After His first question, Jesus suggested an answer : "A
reed shaken with the wind." In this He doubtless anticipated
a question in their own minds after hearing the doubtful ques-
tion of John's disciples about the identity of Jesus as the
Messiah. Was John wavering? Did it sound that Way when
you heard his preaching, and his announcement, "Behold the
24          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Lamb of God"? Their answer seems to have been No; for
Jesus proceeds, "But what," etc.
   2. John had prophesied of Christ : "One mightier than I
cometh. . . . He shall baptize you with the Holy Gh6st." But
John was more than a prophet. Like Jesus, he was the fulfill-
ment of prophecy. Of himself he said, "I an't the voice of one
crying in the wilderness, . . . as said the prophet Esaias." He it
was, too, who first publicly proclaimed and, pointed out Jesus
as the Messiah. He vlso baptized Jesus, when the voice from
heaven declared His sonship.
   3. The meaning of this passage is made clearer in Luke i6: 16:
"The kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into
it." John's preaching of repentance and of the nearness of
the kingdom of heaven had stirred the people, and many were
pressing into the kingdom as if compelled by some unseen force.
He had begun a movement that was continuing and increasing
through the ministry of Jesus. Thus Jesus gave John credit
for his share in the work that Jesus Himself was following up.
   4. The prophets had foretold an Elias, a kingdom, and a
Messiah, to come. John was the Elias, "if ye will receive it;"
and he proclaimed a kingdom at hand, and a Messiah come.
In this work, he was more than a prophet.

   18: Why can we find rest in this way? Verse 3o.
                            Notes
   I. As on other occasions, Jesus here gives the principle of
testing a man's practices. "By their fruits ye shall know them."
It is not necessary that every one live and do exactly as others
about him do, nor even as others may think he ought to do.
One may have certain ways of eating or dressing or working
which are an advantage to him, while his neighbor may have
very different ways, but of equal advantage to him. It is the
result of living and doing that justifies or condemns a certain
course. It is the motive or .principle governing a course of
action that determines its character and its wisdom.
26           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   2. The expression "At that time" seems to connect this pas-
 sage with the upbraiding of the cities. If this is so, its application
.is probably to the prosperous merchants of these cities, with their
 worldly wisdom, in contrast with the poor fisher folk who had
 received Christ as the revelation of the Father, and become the
 "light of the world." Luke, 'however, with his stronger intro-
 duction, "In that hour," connects the passage with the return
 of the seventy. These had brought a very encouraging report,
 telling "with joy" how the devils had been subject to them
 through the name of Jesus. Then Jesus had exhorted them to
 rejoice rather that their names were written in heaven. Fol-
 lowing this comes His praise to the Father for reVealing these
 things to those who were poor in this world but rich in simple
 faith and trust in God.

                             Notes
  i. The Pharisees were always great sticklers fOr the law and
the letter. Here, however, the word "lawful" really contains
no reference to the law, but may be rendered "permitted."
What the law of God requires or forbids in spirit, often differs
widely from what the traditions of the Jews permitted, or what
man-made regulations now may allow. It was by a rule of their
own the Pharisees.were measuring the conduct of Jesus and His
disciples. By tradition, the Sabbath had been made a yoke of
28         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

bondage. The Author of the Sabbath swept away their tradi-
tions, arid taught the people true Sabbath keeping. The follow-
ing from Edersheim gives a few of the many traditions with
which the Pharisees had surrounded the Sabbath, till its true
object was lost:
  "Next, certain regulations are laid down to guide the Jew
when dressing •on the Sabbath morning, so as to prevent his
breaking its rest. Hence he must be careful not to_ put on any
dress which might become burdensome, nor to wear any 'orna-
ment which he might put off and carry in his hand, for this would
be a 'burden.' A woman must not wear s4ich headgear as
would require unloosing before taking a bath, nor go out with
such ornaments as could be taken off in the street, such as a
frontlet, unless it is attached to the cap, nor with a gold crown,
nor with a necklace or nose ring, nor with rings, nor have a
pin in her dress. The reason for this prohibition of ornaments
was, that in their vanity women might take them off to show
them to their companions, and then, forgetful of the day, carry
them, which would be a 'burden!.Women are also forbidden
to look in the glass on the Sabbath, because they might discover
a white hair and attempt to pull it out, which would be a
grievous sin ; but men ought not to use looking-glasses even
on week days, because this was undignified. A woman may
walk about her own court, but not in the street, with false hair."
  "A plaster might be worn, provided its object was to prevent
the wound getting worse, not to heal it, for that would have
been a work. Ornaments which could not easily be taken off
might be worn in one's courtyard. Similarly, a person might go
about with wadding in his ear, but not with false teeth, nor
with a7 gold plug in the tooth. If the wadding fell out of the
ear, it could not be replaced."
  "If a woman were to roll wheat to take away the husks, she
would be guilty of sifting with a sieve. If she were rubbing the
ends of the stalks, she would be guilty of threshing. If she were
cleaning what adheres to the side of a stalk, she would be
guilty of sifting. If she were bruising the stalk, she would be
guilty of grinding. If she were throwing it up in her hands,
she would be guilty of winnowing. Distinctions like the following
are made : A /radish may be dipped into salt, but not left
in it too long, since this would be to make pickle. A new dress
might be put on, irrespective of the danger that in so doing
it might be torn. Mud on the dress might be crushed in the
hand and shaken off, but the dress might not be rubbed (for
fear of affecting the material). If a person took a bath,
opinions are divided, whether the whole body should be dried at
once, or limb after limb. If the water had fallen on the dress,
some allowed the dress to be shaken but not wrung; others,
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      29

to be wrung but not shaken."— Edersheim, "The Life and Times
of Jesus," pages 781-783.
  2. Such a statement should not be interpreted loosely. The
Sabbath is a sacred institution, not to be regarded lightly. But
God's purpose in establishing it was man's .uplift and joy. It
was not meant for the terrible burden the Jews had made of
it with their many petty rules and regulations contrary to /its
spirit, and observed in form only. The Sabbath is a gift of God
to man— one,of the gifts of His love. Made for man, every man
ought to receive it as a gift. from his Creator.
