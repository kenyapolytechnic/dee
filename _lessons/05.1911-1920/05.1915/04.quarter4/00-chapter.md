                           Notes
   1. Not long before this, when Jesus walked on the rough
sea and saved Peter from sinking, the disciples had united
in saying to Jesus when He entered the ship and the wind
ceased, "Of a truth Thou art the Son of God." See Matt.
14: 32, 33. Now He would test their faith in Him without
any special manifestation of His power. Peter, who was fore-
most in the experience on the sea, now reaffirmed his faith
in still stronger terms than before.
 - 2. The word "Peter" means a fragment of rock, a movable
stone - not a fitting symbol for the foundation of a building.
The word "rock" in the same verse means solid mass of rock,
in its native state, immovable as a whole - fit symbol for a
stable, permanent foundation of the church. That "rock"
refers to Christ, Son of man, and Son of God, not to Peter,
cannot be doubted. Peter or any other bOi.cver may become
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5

by faith a "living stone" built into a spiritual house (1 Peter
2: 3-5), but "other foundation can no man lay than that is
laid, which is Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 3: 11.
   3. " 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of
Christ. All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are
here included. These words have power to open and to shut
heaven. They declare the conditions upon which men are
received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach
God's word is a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.
Theirs is a mission weighted with eternal results."—"Desire
of Ages," page 414.
   4. "The Saviour did not commit the work of the gospel to
Peter individually. At a later time [Matt. 18: 15-18], re-
peating the words that were spoken to Peter, He applied them
directly to the church. And the same in substance was spoken
alsO to the twelve as representatives of the body of believers.
If Jesus had delegated any special authority to one of the
disciples above the others, we should not find them so often
contending as to who should be the greatest. They would
have submitted to the wish of their Master, and honored the
one whom He had chosen."— Id., page 414.
   5. "This charge was given because of the determined op-
position of the scribes and Pharisees. More than this, the
people, and even the disciples, had so false a conception of
the Messiah that a public announcement of Him would give
them no true idea of His character or His work. But day
by day He was revealing Himself to them as the Saviour, and
thus He desired to give them a true conception of Him as
the Messiah."— Id., pages 414, 415.
   6. This prophecy refers to the transfiguration, and its ful-
fillment will be considered in the next lesson.

                            Notes
  1. The transfiguration of Christ took place while He was
praying. "As He prayed, the fashion of His countenance
was altered." It is by prayer that power comes.
  2. In saying, "It is good for us to be here," Peter uttered
a great and far-reaching truth. It is always good to be with
Jesus, whether in prayer and communion, or in the study
of His word, or in His active service. It is good also to have
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      7
fellowship with His tried and faithful • servants, such as
Moses and Elijah. We cannot wonder at Peter's desire to
prolong their stay.
   3. In this proposal, Peter made the mistake of planning
to settle down in a place of much light and of congenial as-
sociation, while others all through the land were perishing
for want of the light and truth which Peter could give them.
Peter and his companions were needed among the people, as
was also Jesus their Master. The multitude was already
gathering at the foot of the mountain. But the proposal was
more serious than this, for Peter thought Jesus was then to
be established in His kingdom, with Moses and Elijah as
protectors.
   4. One purpose of the transfiguration was to help these
three more intimate of the Lord's disciples, and through their
testimony, the church in every succeeding age, to understand
that though Jesus must suffer and die, yet His kingdom of
glory was assured.                            •
   "The revelation made to the disciples was to be pondered
in their own hearts, not to be published abroad. To relate
it to the multitudes would excite only ridicule or idle wonder.
And even the nine apostles would not understand the scene
until after Christ had risen from the dead."—"Desire of
Ages," page 426.

for Himself and Peter? Verse 27, last part.
                            Notes
   1. From the connection here it seems probable that the
disciples who could not cure the afflicted son were the nine
who did not go up into the mountain with Jesus. When
Jesus came down from the mountain, the father, together
with the disciples, brought the object of their failute to Him
- the best place to take all our failures.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    9

   2. "The selection of the three disciples to accompany Jesus
to the mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. In-
stead of strengthening their faith by prayer and meditation
on the words of Christ, they had been dwelling on their dis-
couragements and personal grievances. In this state of dark-
ness they had undertaken the conflict with Satan."—"Desire
of Ages," page 430.
   3. "This tribute was not a civil tax, but a religious con-
tribution, which every Jew was required to pay annually for
the support of the temple. A refusal to pay the tribute would
be regarded as disloyalty to the temple,— in the estimation
of the rabbis a most grievous sin."— Id., pages 432, 433.
   4. "While the people of a country are taxed for the main-
tenance of their king, the monarch's own children are exempt.
So Israel, the professed people of God, were required to main-
tain His service; but Jesus, the Son of God, was under no
such obligation. If priests and Levites were exempt because
of their connection with the temple, how much more He to
whom the temple was His Father's house."— Id., page 433.
   5. Jesus was the Creator and proprietor of all the earth;
yet in His humble station as the Son of man, He would not
offend civil rulers, even if to avoid so doing required the pay-
ment of money unjustly demanded by an oppressor. "While
Christians are not to sacrifice one principle of truth, they
should avoid controversy whenever it is p6ssible to do so."
   "If Jesus had paid the tribute without a protest, He would
virtually have acknowledged the justice of the claim, and
would thus have denied His divinity. But while He saw
good to meet the demand, He denied the claim upon which it
was based. In providing for the payment of the tribute He
gave evidence of His divine character. It was made mani-
fest that He was one with God, and therefore was not under
tribute as a mere subject of the kingdom."— /d., page 434.

  24. What promise is given to two or three gathered in

                              Notes
  1. In God's service, the desire to be first is a disqualifica-
tion for serving in the first place. The desire to be above
one's fellows is unchristian, and therefore unfits a man to
serve acceptably in a position of high responsibility or in-
fluence. It leads to putting self first in everything. It is
contrary to the spirit of Christ, who "humbled Himself."
If this desire to exalt self is put away, service for Christ in
any capacity will be found the most exalted of callings.
   2. The word "offend" used here and elsewhere means cause
to stumble, and is so rendered in the Revised Version. It
means literally the placing of an impediment or trap before
the feet so as to cause one to stumble and fall. Thus to treat •
a trustful or believing one is regarded by our Saviour as a
grievous sin.
   3. In the Revised Version, verse 7 reads as follows: "Woe
unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must
needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through
whom the occasion cometh!" The word "occasion" is used
here in rather the stronger sense of cause or thing over which
one stumbles. The world is full of such.
   4. "Any habit or practice that would lead into sin, and
bring dishonor upon Christ, would better be put away, what-
ever the sacrifice. That which dishonors God cannot benefit
the soul. The blessing of Heaven cannot attend any man in
violating the eternal principles of right. And one sin cher-
ished is sufficient to work the degradation of the character,
and to mislead others. If the foot or the hand would be cut
off, or even the eye would be plucked out, to save the body
12          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

from death, how much more earnest should we be to put
away sin, that brings death to the soul."—"Desire of Ages,"
page 439.
   5. Observe that we have a duty toward the brother who
has transgressed against us. Even if we are conscious of
having done no wrong toward him, it is our privilege and our
duty to go to him in the love of Christ and seek to win him
from his evil way. In this we have the example of Jesus, who
came to earth to seek and to save the lost sinner.
   6. " 'Henceforth,' said Jesus, 'let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican.' But he is not to be regarded
as cut off from the mercy of God. Let him not be despised
or neglected by his former brethren, but be treated with
tenderness and compassion as one of the lost sheep that Christ
is still seeking to bring to His fold."— Id., page 441.

  16. What conclusion did Jesus draw from this parable?
Verse 35. Note 5.
                           Notes
  1. If Jesus' answer to Peter had been meant to be mathe-
matically exact, it would probably cover every case, for it is
not likely that one brother would have to be forgiven more
than four hundred and ninety times. But forgiveness, like
other Christian virtues, has"no limits. Jesus doubtless meant
His answer to be interpreted, "As many times as he sinneth
against thee."
  2. "This talent was probably worth £200, or $1,000." Re-
vised Version.
  37-Note that the king granted his servant much more than
he asked, for the servant pleaded for time only, and promised
to pay all, but the king forgave him the entire debt.
  42 "The word in the Greek denotes a coin worth about eight
pence halfpenny, or nearly seventeen cents." Revised Ver-
sion. One hundred pence, therefore, was about seventeen
dollars.
   5. We do not understand this verse to mean that the Father
will commit the unforgiving to torment till they pay what
is due, for this would mean everlasting torment; but rather
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

that as the lord would not forgive the unforgiving servant,
so the Father will not — more, cannot — forgive one who
does not forgive his brother's trespass. One who does not
forgive, forfeits the blessing of being forgiven.

is better to let the Bible answer questions as far as possible.
It is our part to become familiar enough with its teachings
that we may readily quote from it, or refer to it on any oc-

Shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one,' He enun-
ciated the law of marriage for all the children of Adam to
the close of time. That which the eternal Father Himself
had pronounced good, was the law of highest blessing and
development for man."—"Mount of Blessing," pages 99, 100.
   3. There are striking points of likeness between the mar-
riage relation and the believer's relation with Christ: 1. It
is voluntary; "whosoever will," let him come. 2. It is for
life; "no man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking
back, is fit for the kingdom of God." 3. It is a holy alliance;
nothing but sin can break the tie. 4. It is a renouncing of
all others; "Christ, only Christ." 5. It is a sharing in sorrow
and in joy; "if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may
be also glorified together."

                               Notes
  1. This young man regarded himself as a commandment
keeper, but he seemed to fear that something might be over-
looked. He wanted eternal life; and here was the great
Teacher, who perhaps would make his duty still clearer, or
would at least commend his commandment keeping. So he
ventured the question.
   2, God's "commandments are righteousness" (Ps. 119:
172), and "in the way of righteousness is life" (Prov. 12: 28).
The only entrance to life is by the way of righteousness. That
we cannot of ourselves keep the law, does not lessen our obli-
gation, especially when the promise of God is that our right-
eousness is of Him. Isa. 54: 17. The sinner who truly seeks
with all his heart, over his repeated failures it may be, to do
God's will, shall find Christ the door. Rom. 7: 25. In seek-
ing to keep the commandments in their spiritual fullness, the
young man would have found Christ.
   3. According to the young man's testimony, he had observed
the commandment not to covet anything that was his neigh-
bor's, and so had caught the negative view of this command-
ment. But the idea that he should take his Own goods and
give them to the poor, was too severe a test for him, even
though Jesus had promised him "treasure in heaven" in re-
turn. There was an idol in his heart which stood in the way
of complete keeping of the commandments. Our idol may not
be riches, but still constitute some "other god before Me."
   4. The expression "shall hardly enter" is a little ambiguous
as it stands, as it may mean, according to common usage,
almost but not quite enter. The word "hardly," however,
means here with difficulty. As brought out in the next verse,
this difficulty is so great that man cannot overcome it in his
own strength; but by connecting himself with God, victory
is assured.

   17. How did Jesus sum up the lesson of this parable?
Verse 16.
                           Notes
  1. Most of the parables of Jesus, whether related in a
single sentence or in a chapter,. are given to illustrate one
distinct truth or phase of truth. In studying them, we do
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   19

well riot to lose the point among the details of the setting.
Jesus often makes the application Himself, as He did here.
In order to appreciate His conclusion, one must study the
setting carefully.
  2. The Roman denarius, here translated "penny," was
equivalent to about seventeen cents. In the parable this defi-
nite wage was agreed upon as satisfactory to both the house-
holder and the laborers first hired. The other laborers, hired
at various times through the day, were promised "whatsoever
is right." At settlement, these laborers received a "penny"
as their pay, and were satisfied that the promise of their em-
ployer had been fully kept.
   3. It is necessary, to the purpose of the parable, that settle-
ment for the day's labor should begin with the last employed.
If the laborers had received their pay in the order in which
they were hired, the first might have received their penny
and gone on their way satisfied. But settling with the last
first, gave opportunity for envy to display itself, and for the
lesson to be taught that in the kingdom of heaven reward is
not earned, but bestowed out of grace and love in the Giver.

   20. When Jesus in compassion touched their eyes; what

                            Notes
  1. By referring to Matt. 4: 21, we recall :that "Zebedee's
children" were James and John, whom Jesus had called next
after Simon Peter and Andrew, to become His disciples.
John is mentioned as "the disciple whom Jesus loved." "At
every possible opportunity, John took his place next the Sav-
iour, and James longed to be honored with as close connection
with Him. Their mother was a follower of Christ, and had
ministered to Him freely of her substance.- -With a mother's
love and ambition for her sons, she coveted for them•the most•
honored place in the new kingdom. For this she encouraged
them to make request."--"Desire of Ages," page' 548,,
  2. How far-reaching was Jesus' answer, "Ye knowtoeivhat
ye ask." The mother and her sons asked for 'a -ceitiin're-
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 21

suit, or final attainment, which was uppermost in their minds.
Jesus saw all that was implied in the question — the experi-
ence necessary to realize their wish. Our prayers are often
thus blind or limited in comprehension. We too often ask
for something we long for, without sensing what the answer
to our request would mean. Then when the Lord grants our
petition by sending us the experience by which it is necessary
for us to realize our own desire, we think that something
strange has happened to us, and take a rebellious attitude
toward it. Should not part of our prayer always be, "Lord,
make us to know what we ask, and to recognize the answer
when it comes"?
  3. Indignation at the request of the mother for her sons,
could have no other meaning than the revealing of a desire
by the ten to have those positions themselves. It would have
been easy fora strife to arise among the disciples, had not
Jesus tenderly set before them the recipe for true greatness.

  17. What answer did Jesus give? Verse 16, last part.
                            Notes
   1. The name "Bethphage" means, house of figs. It was a
village near Bethany, on or near the road from Jericho to
Jerusalem. Mark mentions both villages. Bethphage prob-
ably stood between Bethany and Jerusalem, near the descent
from the Mount of Olives, and not far from the old road that
crosses the mountain at the summit.
   2. The term "Hosanna" is derived from the Hebrew, and
means, Save, I pray, or, Save now. It is found in the open-
ing part of Ps. 118: 25. As used in the expression "Hosanna
to the Son of David," some think it should be rendered, "Look
with favor upon the Son of David." At any rate, it is a term
of triumph.
   Some of the Pharisees asked Jesus to rebuke the disciples
for crying out in praise; but Jesus answered, "I tell you that,
if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately
cry out." Luke 19: 40. "Prophecy had foretold that Christ
should be proclaimed as king, and that word must be fulfilled.
The priests and rulers of Israel refused to herald His glory,
and God moved upon the children to be His witnesses. Had
the voices of the children been silent, the very pillars of the
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 23

temple would have sounded the Saviour's praise."—"Desire
of Ages," page 592.
  3. The very question, "Who is this?" reveals an ignorance
of Jesus that is widespread to-day. When Saul, on the way
to Damascus, fell terror-stricken to the earth, and heard the
voice of Jesus, he cried out, "Who art Thou, Lord?" The
answer came clear and definite, "I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest." It was enough. Saul's next trembling ques-
tion was, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?" So here
the multitude answered, "This is Jesus." It is our privilege
to be part of a multitude to tell the world, by our lives and
by our words: "This is Jesus. Hear ye Him."
   4. "Christ was following the Jewish custom for a royal
entry. The animal on which He rode was that ridden by the
kings of Israel, and prophecy had foretold that thus the
Messiah should come to His kingdom. No sooner was He
seated upon the colt than a loud shout of triumph rent the
air. The multitude hailed Him as Messiah, their King.
Jesus now accepted the homage which He had never before
permitted, and the disciples received this as proof that their
glad hopes were to be realized by seeing Him established on
the throne. The multitude were convinced that the hour of
their emancipation was at hand. In imagination they saw
the Roman armies driven from Jerusalem, and Israel once
more an independent nation. All were happy and excited;
the people vied with one another in paying Him homage.
They could not display outward pomp and splendor, but they
gave Him the worship of happy hearts. They were unable
to present Him with costly gifts, but they spread their outer
garments as a carpet in His path, and they also strewed the
leafy branches of the olive and palm in the way. They could
lead the triumphal procession with no royal standards, but
they cut down the spreading palm boughs, Nature's emblem
of victory, and waved them aloft with loud acclamations and
hosannas."—"Desire of Ages," page 570.
   5. This is not the first cleansing of the temple, though it
is the only one recorded by Matthew. In John 2: 13-16 is
the account of an earlier cleansing, which probably took
place in the first year of Jesus' ministry. Though the two
accounts are similar, they should not be confused.

   19. What reasons did Jesus give for so saying?
Verse 32.
                             Notes
  1. The village of Bethany was aboift two miles from Jeru-
salem (John 11: 18, margin) , with Bethphage lying between
them. It was the home of Lazarus, with his sisters Martha
and Mary. Here Jesus resorted frequently, for the atmos-
phere of this home was restful and sympathetic. On this
occasion, He stayed all night, if not in the home of His
friends, at least in or about Bethany.
   2. The two simple words "He hungered" record an in-
tensely human experience of our Lord. Like men, He felt
hungry. Like men at times, He had not wherewith to satisfy
His hunger, and was obliged to search for food. But unlike
men, He made out of His disappointment at the fig tree a
lesson to His disciples, leading up to one of the most pre-
cious and comprehensive promises on prayer recorded in the
Scriptures.
   One may naturally wonder why Jesus should return to
Jerusalem in the morning hungry, since He had lodged at
Bethany, the home of Lazarus and his sisters, with whom He
often stayed. But seemingly, He did not pass the night at
their home, for "Desire of Ages," page 581, says, "The
entire night Jesus spent in prayer, and in the morning He
came again to the temple."
   3. Here is illustrated the kind of reasoning that has re-
spect to selfish interests only, that seeks to avoid a trap in
pursuing a wrong course. It is right to reason. Faculties
of mind are given us to reason with, but our reasoning is
not to be the kind that darkens and weakens faith. When
we reason with the Lord, let our reasoning not be of the
Pharisaical kind that seeks to justify self, but let it be
rather the kind that seeks how we and the Lord can come
together, how we can be fully reconciled.

                              Notes
   1. The householder is represented as planting the vineyard
and supplying all the conditions essential to producing fruit.
In Isa. 5: 1, the vineyard of the Lord is represented as
planted "in a very fruitful hill." Our part is to care for
and cultivate the vineyard, whether we think of it as our
individual growth or as the work of the Lord for others.
   2. This third act of the husbandmen in refusing to render
to their lord his own, brings out the terrible results of start-
ing upon a course of evil. Probably when they maltreated the
first servants, they did not purpose to go so far in wickedness.
Their greed extended to seizing only upon the crop of the
season. This greed indulged, the way soon opened for greater
evil — they would seize upon the vineyard itself and make
it their own possession. Crime against the servants hardened
them for the greater crime of killing the son. So sin of any
kind grows rapidly when allowed to come into the life in
any degree.
   3. The Lord will not be disappointed of fruits. If His
offers of grace are rejected by one, they will be made to
another. The vineyard misused by the first husbandmen
passed into the hands of others, who will deal justly with
their lord. The stone rejected by the builders, ultimately be-
comes the chief corner stone.
   4. Symbols in the parable: a. The householder represents
God. b. The vineyard represents the Jewish nation. c. The
hedge represents the divine law. d. The tower represents
the temple.

     A Minister in Western Oregon
  was recently called over to the coast to baptize some
  people. When he got there, he found an old lady who
  had been using five copies of the Signs, and had five
  candidates. She continued her work with her Signs
  club, and now has five more ready.
    Yes, "the Signs does bring people into the truth."
  Are you taking and using your quota — two copies?

                  Bear This in Mind
    Every cent of profit from the Signs is turned over
  to the conference for use in foreign missionary work.
  Over $2,500 profits used this way last year. This is
  another reason why our pioneer missionary paper
  should have your hearty support.
