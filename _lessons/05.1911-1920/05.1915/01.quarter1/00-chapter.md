         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSONS

Life and Teachings of Jesm
       As Recorded in the Book of Matthew
                    SENIOR DIVISION
                    FIRST QUARTER
                             1915
                      Introductory Note
   This series of lessons is to continue six quarters. The senior
and the junior lessons cover the entire text of Matthew, while
the intermediate and the primary are based on the same scrip-
tures, or selected parts of the same, that are studied by the
seniors each Sabbath. This will make it possible for family
study to be enjoyed together to a considerable degree. Fathers
and mothers can study the primary and the intermediate lesson
with their children, and at the same time be getting a large part
of their own lesson —in many cases all of it.
   The plan of these lessons is to make them simple, direct, and
  onnected. It is not an attempt to study all the teachings of
  esus, nor to introduce all the recorded events of His life and
;'°ek to follow them in strictly chronological order. The aim is
  .ther to take the record as Matthew gives it, and concentrate
  (fort upon obtaining the greatest practical lessons possible.
Matthew's narrative is simple, compact, and highly spiritual, but
not always in chronological order. He records twenty miracles,
twenty parables, and more distinct events in the life of Christ
 than any other writer. If we assimilate well the teachings of
the Master as presented by Matthew, the converted tax-collector
and true disciple, we shall doubtless gain more practical help
 for daily living than if we sought to follow in our study histor-
 ical sequence or a harmony of the Gospels. "The words that I
 speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."

   ESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew
                          Questions

           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5
   1. Who was this Jesus, born into the world by the
Holy Spirit? I Tim. 3: 16.
  12. How does John declare His eternal existence and
His manifestation in the flesh? John I : 1-3, 14.
  13. Being thus Emmanuel, "God with Us," creative
power manifested in human flesh, what was He to do for
those who put their trust in Him? Verses 12, 13.
                               Notes
  T. Whether this title is meant for the entire hook or not, it is
very suitable for the first part. As the book of Genesis includes
much more than the genesis of the heavens and the earth, so
may the book of Matthew contain much more than the mere
generation or lineage of Jesus.
  2. Abraham and David were two great lights in the history
of the Jews. All Jews prided themselves on being sons of Abra-
ham and subjects of the royal house of David, especially as the
Messiah was promised as the seed of both. Jesus being of the
lineage of both according to the flesh, it was fitting that He
should be called Son of Abraham and Son of David. Abraham
is the spiritual father of all that believe (Rom. 4: II), and
David was the prototype of Christ as the King of the true
Israel. Christ was frequently addressed as "Thou Son of
David," but preferred to style Himself more broadly "the Son
of man," emphasizing His relationship to the human family as
elder Brother.
  3. Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua. See Acts 7:45 and
Heb. 4: 8, where reference is plainly made to Joshua. The
meaning of Joshua is Jehovah-salvation, or Jehovah-saviour.
Thus Matthew interprets the name Jesus, when he says, "He
shall save His people from their sins."
  4. Christ is the Greek equivalent of Messiah, meaning anointed.
This is why the expression "the Christ" is sometimes used, the
term Christ not being originally a proper name.. Thus Jesus
Christ means Jesus the anointed.
   "Should Christ a thousand times in Bethlehem be born,
    If He's not born in thee, thy soul is still forlorn.
    If thou wilt give thy heart a manger for the birth,
    Christ will again become a child upon the earth,"

                              Notes
   i. Bethlehem was the city of David. Here David was born, had
his shepherd experience, and was anointed king. Christ was of
the seed of David, and of the royal line. Bethlehem means
house of bread. Jesus was the "bread of life," sent down from
heaven. Joseph was also "of the house and lineage of David,"
and so went up to Bethlehem, the city of David, to be enrolled
In such a wonderful manner do the providences of God work out
His purposes in the fulfilment of prophecy.
   2. "Wise men," or better, "Magi." The word is Persian or
Median. They were from a priestly caste, who doubtless had
received light from the Holy Scriptures, through the influence
of the Jews of the dispersion.
   "As these Magi studied the starry heavens, and sought to
fathom the mystery ,hidden in their bright paths, they beheld
the glory of the Creator. Seeking clearer knowledge, they
turned to the Hebrew Scriptures. In their own land were
treasured prophetic writings that predicted the coming of a divine
teacher. Balaam belonged to the magicians, though at one time
a prophet of God ; by the Holy Spirit he had foretold the pros-
perity of Israel and the appearing of the Messiah; and his
prophecies had been handed down by tradition from century to
century. But in the Old Testament the Saviour's advent was
more clearly revealed. The Magi learned with joy that• His
coming was near, and that the whole world was to be filled with
a knowledge of the glory of the Lord."—"Desire of Ages,"
pages 59, 6o.
   3. "The wise men had seen a mysterious light in the heavens
 upon that night when the glory of God flooded the hills of
 Bethlehem. As the light faded, a luminous star appeared, and
 lingered in the sky. It was not a fixed star nor a planet, and
 the phenomenon excited the keenest interest. That star was a
 distant company of shining angels, but of this the wise men
 were ignorant. Yet they were impressed that the star was of
 special import to them. They consulted priests and philoso-
 phers, and searched the scrolls of the ancient records. The
 prophecy of Balaam had declared, 'There shall come a star out
 of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel.' Could this
8            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

strange star have been sent as a harbinger of the Promised One?
The Magi had welcomed the light of heaven-sent truth; now
it was shed upon them in brighter rays. Through dreams they
were instructed to go in search of the new-born Prince."— Id.,
page 6o.
   4. "The Magi had been among the first to welcome the Re-
deemer. Their gift was the first that was laid at His feet.
And through that gift, what privilege of ministry was theirs!
The offering from the heart that loves, God delights to honor,
giving it highest efficiency in service for Him. If we have
given our hearts t Jesus, we also shall bring our gifts to Him.
Our gold and silver, our most precious earthly possessions, our
highest mental and spiritual endowments, will be freely devoted
to Him who loved us, and gave Himself for us."—Id., page 65.

requested by him? Matt. 2: 12.

Lord instruct Joseph to do? Verses 19,20.
    8. What did Joseph again promptly do? Verse 21.
    9. Where did Joseph evidently desire to make their

   10. How was he again directed by the angel of the

first part.
   12. What prophecy was thus fulfilled? Verse 23, last

   13. What is the Scripture record of the child life of
Jesus ? Luke 2 : 40,52.
                              Note
  The only direction given Joseph by the angel was, "Go into
the land of Israel." That he desired to return to Judea and dwell
at Bethlehem seems evident from the record that he was afraid
to go there when he heard that Herod's son was ruling, and
"turned aside" into Galilee. Here again prophecy was to be
fulfilled.

  I. "It was a lonely region where he found his home, in the
midst of barren hills, wild ravines, and rocky caves. But it was
his choice to forego the enjoyments and luxuries of life for the
stern discipline of the wilderness. . . . But the life of John
was not spent in idleness, in ascetic gloom, or in selfish isolation.
From time to time he went forth to mingle with men; and he
was ever an interested observer of what was passing in the
world. From his quiet retreat he watched the unfolding of
events. With vision illuminated by the divine Spirit he studied
the characters of men, that he might understand how to reach
their hearts with the message of heaven. The burden of his
mission was upon him. In solitude, by meditation and prayer,
he sought to gird up his soul for the life-work before him."—
"Desire of Ages," pages IOI, 102.
  2. As John was to come in the spirit of Elijah (Mal. 4:5, 6;
Matt. 17: 12, 13), so was it suitable that he should wear the
dress of the ancient prophet. 2 Kings 1:8.• This would help
impress the people of his time with the force of his message.
  3. The Revised Version reads : "I indeed baptize you in water
unto repentance: but He that cometh after me . . . shall baptize
you in the Holy Spirit and in fire."

   17. How was Jesus strengthened after this ordeal ?
Verse II, last part.
                             Notes
   i. Three reasons may be given: 1. He was hungry, and needed
nourishment. 2. He was able to turn the stones into bread.
3. His sonship was challenged.
  "Satan was seeking a dispute with Jesus concerning His
being the Son of God. He referred to His weak, suffering con-
dition, and boastingly affirmed that he was stronger than Jesus.
But the word spoken from heaven, 'Thou art My beloved Son;
in Thee I am well pleased,' was sufficient to sustain Jesus through
all His sufferings. I saw that Christ had nothing to do in con-
vincing Satan of His power, or of His being the Saviour of the
world. Satan had sufficient evidence of His exalted station and
authority. His unwillingness to yield to Christ's authority had
shut him out of heaven."—"Early Writings.".
   2. This temptation was a crafty one. Jesus had just used the
Word to meet the first temptation. Satan now uses the Word as
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   13
a means of temptation. Jesus might vindicate the reliability of
the Word quoted by Satan, and show His favor with God. In-
stead, He uses the Word to condemn Satan's use of it and at the
same time affirm His own divinity.
  "If Jesus had cast Himself from the pinnacle of the temple, it
would not have glorified His Father; for none would have wit-
nessed the act but Satan and the angels of God. And it would
have been tempting the Lord to display His power to His bitterest
foe. It would have been condescending to the one whom Jesus
came to conquer."—"Early Writings."
  3. Satan had usurped the dominion of the earth and man,
which Christ came to redeem. Jesus is here tempted to receive
this dominion back without enduring the cross.
   4. Jesus asserted His divine authority in the command, "Get
thee hence," and Satan quailed before it.

   17. How great a following did He have? Verse 25.
                               Notes
   i. "The power of the Spirit." Jesus followed the leading of the
Spirit into the wilderness of temptation, and was delivered by
His ministry through the Word in the hour of temptation. No
leading of the Spirit is ever responded to, and no temptation en-
dured and overcome by the believer, that does not leave him
stronger for life and service than before.
  2. "His word was with power." Nothing will give greater
power to the teaching or preaching of the Word, than ex-
periencing the power of that Word for deliverance in personal
conflicts under temptation.
  3. "I will make you fishers of men"— a wonderful adaptation
of the call to circumstances! How could Jesus have made
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       15
clearer or more impressive the meaning of His call than by this
simple language in terms of familiarity to these catchers of fish?
  4. Two elements. of action in responding to the call of the
Master are noticeable: (1) making no delay; (2) leaving the
former life and following the new way.
  5. Here the two brothers not only left their ship and nets,
and left them immediately, but they also left "their father"— a
still greater test for every missionary who goes out into the
service of Christ. But what compensation came to James and
John in this life, and what rewards await them at the Master's
call in the day of resurrection!
  6. One feature of the Master's work is noticeable — He went
about all the country, seeking out opportunities for teaching,
preaching, and healing. So will His true followers do in our day.

                              Notes
   i. The term "blessed" indicates a state of solemn joy, of deep
satisfaction, of supreme favor. It is the fruit of experience—of
grace applied, of power received and appropriated.. It is the
prerogative of the believer. It is unknown to the world. It
is the gift of God. It is the blessed antepast of heaven itself.
  The 'poor in spirit" are those who recognize that they are
nothing and have nothing outside of Christ. They feel their
entire dependence upon One who is mighty to save. To them is
promised the greatest and best of all riches — the kingdom of
heaven "within you," and "in the world to come, eternal life."
  2. "They that mourn": (I) For their sins. Sorrow for sin
is the first condition of forgiveness. It is the best assurance
that the sin will not be willingly repeated. The mourning state
is blessed because it is a necessary step to the more blessed
state of forgiveness. (2) For temporal losses. Mourning for
a dear one that death has taken, or in sympathy with the afflicted,
or even for property loss, mellows the spirit, and tends to lead
the mourner to sorrow for sin. And there is comfort for the
sorrowing from the "God of all comfort."
  3. "The meek." Those who are patient and gentle under trial
or under wrong. They show no spirit of retaliation, no resent-
ment, no bigotry, no hardness. Self and self-consciousness are
subdued. The spirit is not contentious, or quarrelsome, or irri-
table. Self-possession, calmness, and peace° mark all they say
and do.
  4. "The merciful." In human experience, only those who know
how to exercise mercy may obtain mercy; and these who do
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       17

exercise mercy are sure to obtain mercy. The Lord exercises
mercy toward us, that we may learn the meaning of mercy, and
so become better acqUainted with Him, and, like Him, exercise it
toward our fellow men. "If ye forgive men their trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
  5. "The peacemakers." Where contention and strife and irrita-
bility make life miserable, the one who possesses the gift of
composing differences, who has the happy faculty of "pouring
oil on the troubled waters," has indeed a blessed ministry. The
world is so full of unrest and conflict that peacemakers are
needed everywhere, in the home, in the church, in the community.
  6. No joy is so great as that of victory under trial, no peace so
blissful as that which follows the storm. The degree of joy is
proportionate to the intensity of the struggle passed through.

                              Notes
  1. For "fulfilled" in this verse, the Revised Version reads "ac-
complished," and the original Greek is "come to pass." The law,
then, is not to be modified in the slightest degree. This is
emphasized by the use of the terms "jot" and "tittle." The word
"jot" is for jod, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet. See
JOD in Psalm 559, between verses 72 and 73. In the Greek,
the word used is iota, the smallest letter in the Greek alphabet,
and a term familiar to us in every-day speech. Not one iota of
the law is to pass away. The Greek word rendered "tittle" is
kerea, meaning a little horn. The term was used by Greek
grammarians to denote a mere accent or diacritical mark on a
word, and in Hebrew refers to the mere tip or hornlet of a
Hebrew character. Not one iota, nor the tip end of a letter or
accent, is to pass away from the law, till all things come to pass,
           SABI1ATH-SCHOOL LESSON OUARTERLY                      19

   2. The Revised Version omits the phrase "without a cause."
This simplifies and makes definite the meaning of the text, for no
one gets angry who does not think he has a cause for it. Does
not the Scripture teach us elsewhere that true patience does not
admit anger even with a just cause for it?
   The Greek word rendered "in danger of" is the usual word for
"guilty," and is so rendered in James 2: ro; I Cor. II : 27; Matt.
26: 66; etc. Anger, then, brings guilt, because it contains the
essence of what would bring forth death, if allowed to develop.
One who is angry feels an impulse to injure the object of his
anger, and unrestrained anger easily leads to murder. This
illustrates the filling out, or amplifying, of the meaning of the
law, which Jesus came to accomplish. He did not make the
law mean less, but more. What a contrast to the efforts of men
nowadays to tone down or smooth away the meaning of the
law till sin all but disappears!
   3. Note the language here: not, "that thou hast aught against
thy brother," but, "that thy brother hath aught, against thee";
not, "reconcile thy brother to thee," but, "be reconciled to thy
brother." If we know that a brother feels wrong toward us, we
are to take the initiative in reconciliation, even though we have
nothing against him. So .would the Lord have us live void of
offense toward God or man.

                              Notes
   I. While the word "magnify" is doubtless not confined to the
idea of amplifying or opening up thje meaning of the law, yet it
is a very fitting and suggestive term in this connection. As we
use the microscope to magnify and bring into the range of vision
things too small for the unaided eye to see, so here Jesus en-
larges upon the meaning of the law, bringing into view, principles
and applications which the unaided mind does not easily grasp.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        21

  2. "I saw that some of God's children have made a mistake in
regard to oath-taking, and Satan has taken advantage of this
to oppress them, and take from them their Lord's money. I saw
that the words of our Lord, 'Swear not at all,' do not touch the
judicial oath.'.',.„"I saw that if there is any one on earth who can
consiStently testify under oath, it is the Christian. He lives in
the light of God's countenance. He grows strong in His strength.
And when matters of importance must be decided by law, there
is no one who can so well appeal to God as the Christian.:'.
"Jesus submitted to the oath in the hour of His trial.4" The high
priest said unto Him, 'I adjure Thee by the living God, that Thou
tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the Son of God.' Jesus
said unto him, 'Thou halt said.' "—"Testimonies for the Church,"
volume I, pages 201-203.
  3. That the Saviour's instruction here includes profane, slangy,
and careless speech is evident from the tenor of His words,
especially in verse 37. The Christian should take this instruction
to heart; for while he would not use the name of God in profane
or careless ways, he may fall into the habit of using bywords,
slang, or uncouth expressions which have in them the principle
or spirit of profanity, just as anger has in it the germ of
murder, and the lustful look the seed of impurity.
  "Some exaggerate in their language. Some swear by their
own life; others swear by their head, as sure as they live; as
sure as they have a head. Some take heaven and earth to witness
that such things are so. Some hope that God will strike them
out of existence if what they are saying is not true. It is
this kind of common swearing against which Jesus warns His
disciples."—"Testimonies," volume 1, page 201.

                              Notes
  s. The law in Leviticus requiring the offender to restore in
kind, was a civil law, to be administered by proper authority.
Its supreme justice is evident. It does not, however, justify a
man's seeking to requite the wrong himself, for in so doing he
might commit a greater wrong. The exacting of the penalty
must be left to disinterested persons.
  2. The Revised Version reads, "Resist not him that is evil,"
or, more literally, "Resist not the evil one." This instruction
was especially fitting to the Jews under the Roman yoke, and
was evidently meant to teach them not to resist the authority of
their rulers. How wonderfully Jesus exemplified the principle
during His trial and crucifixion, not only toward authorities,
but toward any who did Him evil! See Isa. so: 6. Such a
course will often cause him "that is of the contrary part" to
be ashamed.

16-18.
  19. How does this instruction compare with that on
doing good deeds and on praying?
                              Notes
   1. The first verse lays down a general principle which is en-
larged upon and applied in the following instruction on doing
alms, on praying, and on fasting. When such deeds are prompted
by wrong motive, they "have no reward" of our heavenly Father.
   2. The reading of the Revised Version, "They have received
their reward," brings out a little more clearly the meaning of
this passage; that is, they have received the reward they seek
for — the glory of men —but nothing more.
   3. In the Revised Version, the word "openly" is omitted in
verses 4, 6, and 18. It is not necessary to the meaning. To
know that "thy Father . . . shall reward thee," is enough. We
can leave to Him how and when and where to do it.
   4. "The Lord's prayer was twice given by our Saviour, first
to the multitude in the sermon on the mount, and again some
months later, to the disciples alone. . . . The Saviour does not,
however, restrict us to the use of these exact words. As one
with humanity, He presents His own ideal of prayer,— words so
simple that they may be adopted by the little child, yet so com-
prehensive that their significance can never be fully grasped
by the greatest minds. We are taught to come to God with
our tribute of thanksgiving, to make known our wants, to con-
 fess our sins, and to claim His mercy in accordance with His
promise."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," pages
151-153.
   "Our Father"—"an evidence of the eagerness of the Saviour's
 heart to welcome us as members of the family of God." "The
 first step in approaching God is to know and believe the love
 He bath to us." I John 4: 16. "In calling God our Father, we
 recognize all His children as our brethren."
   "Which art in heaven." "Shall I lift up mine eyes to the hills?
 whence should my help come?" No. "My help cometh from
 the Lord, which made heaven and earth." Ps. 121: I, 2, margin.
   "Hallowed be Thy name"— a prayer that God's name and
 character (Ex. 34 : 5-7) may be reverenced by both yourself
 and the world. "We are called by Thy name," said Jeremiah;
 therefore pray that you do no dishonor to "the worthy name
 by which ye are called"; pray that you rightly represent the
 character of God to those about you.
26         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   "Thy kingdom come." By this prayer, we pledge ourselves to
work for the upbuilding of the kingdom of grace in the hearts
of men, that the kingdom of God may be thereby hastened.
   "Give us this day our daily bread." Having made God's
service our first interest, we now ask for the supplying of our
needs. This prayer, uttered in sincerity, will never fail of an
answer. Little children, men, and women have brought angels
of God to earth many times by pleading this petition in faith.
It is not, Give me, but, Give us. We thus ask for others as well
as ourselves, that we may give to the needy as we have oppor-
tunity. It is also a prayer for spiritual food.
   "Forgive us our debts [sins]." Christ said, Forgive to be for-
given. Paul said, Forgive because forgiven. Eph. 4: 32.
   "And lead us not into temptation." David offered a similar
petition. Ps. 141: 4. God tempts no man. James I : 13. "Do
not suffer us, or permit us, to be tempted to sin," is Barnes's
comment on this text. God would empty heaven of every angel,
and even come personally to our assistance, before He would
permit a trusting child of His to be led unwillingly into sin.
Only seek for keeping power, and it is yours.
   5. All through the scriptures of this lesson, the manner of
serving God is emphasized — the spirit, the motive, the method.
Of this prayer it is said definitely, "After this manner" pray ye.
How? — Simply, reverently, definitely. If so done, public prayer
may usually be short. Often it is much better for a few to pray
briefly than for one to pray at length. Personal or private
prayer may be according to the need of the suppliant. Jesus
sometimes "continued all night" in prayer. John 17 is all a
prayer. In "Early Writings" it is said, "Ye let go of the arm
of the Lord too soon." Jacob wrestled in prayer till break of
day. Prevailing prayer is the standard for the suppliant in
private devotion.
   6. The merciful shall obtain mercy. Matt. 5: 7. "Forgive us
our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors." Matt. 6: 12,
R. V. Askinc, forgiveness of God implies our having forgiven
              ' another against us. If we have not done this,
the trespass of
our prayers "have no reward."

                              Notes
   T. The word "serve" used here means be a slave or servant 10.
The term "Mammon" is an Aramaic word meaning wealth or
riches, corresponding to the Greek name for the god of riches,
Plu10. The term is evidently used here to refer to the material
things of life, such as food, drink, and clothing. The contrast
between the service of the two masters, God and Mammon, is
carried through the rest of the chapter, the one a tender Father,
the other a worker of evil through "gnawing care."
  2. For "Take no thought," in these verses, the Revised Ver-
sion reads, "Be not anxious." The original word means to
divide the mind, and is used in Phil. 4: 6; i Cor. 7: 32, 33; and
elsewhere. The noun form of the same word is used in Matt.
13: 22; I Peter 5: 7 (for the word "care") ; and elsewhere.
