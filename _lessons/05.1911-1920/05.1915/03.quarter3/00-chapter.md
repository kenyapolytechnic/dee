   18. What will justify or condemn in the Judgment?
Verse 37.
                            Notes
  1. Although this verse does not specifically mention the cast-
ing out of the devil, this was included in the miracle, as shown
by the contention taken up by the Pharisees on this occasion.
In fact Luke makes the casting out of the devil the principal
feature, with the restoration of speech a result. Luke Is: 14. •
  2. After showing the charge by the Pharisees to be absurd
in the nature of the case, Jesus put them to further confusion
by revealing their hypocrisy. They were condemning in Him
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    5
what they sanctioned in their own children, or disciples. These
latter could therefore be judges of such a two-faced course.
   3. Even Christians are in danger of assuming that there is
a middle course of action, some neutral ground to walk upon.
They do not want to be reckoned against Christ, are not ready
to admit in their own hearts that they are; yet many are not
positively enough for Him to leave no man, nor their own con-
sciences, without doubt as to where they stand. Christ is satis-
fied with nothing less than the whole man —body, soul, and
spirit.
  4. In commenting on the unpardonable sin, Dean Mansel says:
"The sin is not a single act, but a spirit of hostility to Christ
manifesting itself in continued acts. If this be the case, there
is no reason why any repentant sinner should despair of salva-
tion under the fear that he has committed this sin. The fact
of his repentance itself shows that his state of mind has not
been that of entire enmity, that he has not so grieved the Holy
Spirit as to be finally forsaken by Him." The unpardonable sin
is the sin that refuses pardon.
  "There are none so hardened as those who have slighted the
invitation of mercy, and done despite to the Spirit of grace. The
most common manifestation of the sin against the Holy Spirit,
is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation to repent. Every
step in the rejection of Christ is a step toward the rejection of
salvation, and toward the sin against the Holy Spirit. In re-
jecting Christ the Jewish people committed the unpardonable
sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy, we may commit the
same error."—"Desire of Ages," page 324.

   14. What did He then do and say? Verse 49.
   15. What impressive lesson did He make of this simple
incident? Verse 5o. Note 3.

                              Notes
  T. In the record of both Matthew and Luke, this conversation
between Christ and' the Pharisees seems to be connected with
that arising from the casting out of devils. If so, their asking
a sign in the face of His healing the demoniac was all the more
significant of hard-heartedness and unbelief.
  2. In applying this parable to that generation, Jesus points
out the awful condition into which the unrepentant heart will
finally come. The heart that is unyielding to the wooing of the
Holy Spirit, exposes itself to the attack of evil spirits, and ulti-
mately yields to their complete control.
  3. Jesus does not deny that it was a signal blessing to be His
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7
earthly mother. Luke i i : 27, 28. He rather confirms it. Yet
it was small in comparison with the blessing that comes from
hearing and keeping the word of God.

  19. What is suggested by the various degrees of fruit

                            Notes
  I. "That with which the parable of the sower chiefly deals is
the effect produced on the growth of the seed by the soil into
which it is cast. By this parable Christ was virtually saying to
His hearers, It is not safe for you to stand as critics of My
work, or to indulge disappointment because it does not meet
your ideas. The question of greatest importance to you is, How
do you treat My message? Upon your reception or rejection
of it your eternal destiny depends."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
pages 43, 44.
  2. Bear in mind through this interpretation that the seed
represents the "word of the kingdom," and the soil the heart
of the hearer. The various conditions of the soil indicate con-
ditions of the heart. The fruitage itself represents elements of
character, and deeds of love in the life, not only of the in-
dividual who receives the word, but also of every other to
whom he may minister that word. In the missionary sense, the
hundredfold, the sixtyfold, and the thirtyfold may represent the
souls brought to a saving knowledge of the gospel by various
workers.

   3. The words "forthwith" (verse 5), "anon" (verse 20), and
"by and by" (verse 21), are all the same word in the original,
and mean immediately. It is sometimes translated elsewhere
straightway.
  4. The word "offended" here, as usually elsewhere in the Gos-
pels, means caused to stumble, or, more literally still, entrapped,
ensnared.

                              Notes
  1. The "tares" here mentioned are a kind of darnel, a poison-
ous weed. During growth, it is very similar in appearance to
wheat; but when it heads out, the grains are black, and easy
to distinguish from wheat.
  2. Of the darnel it is said that the roots of ten grow so closely
intertwined with those of the wheat that it is impossible to pull
up the one without rooting out the other. Not 'in this life is
the line drawn. The Lord sends rain on the just and the un-
just. But the harvest time is sure to come, and then will come
the separation.
  "Christ has plainly taught that those who persist in open sin
must be separated from the church; but He has not committed
to us the work of judging character and motive. He knows our
nature too well to intrust this work to us. Should we try to
uproot from the church those whom we suppose to be spurious
Christians, we should be sure to make mistakes. Often we re-
gard as hopeless subjects the very ones whom Christ is draw-
ing to Himself. Were we to deal with these souls according to
our imperfect judgment, it would perhaps extinguish their last
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        II


hope. Many who think themselves Christians will at last be
found wanting. Many will be in heaven who their neighbors
supposed would never enter there. Man judges from appear-
ance, but God judges the heart. The tares and the wheat are
to grow together until the harvest; and the harvest is the end
of probationary time."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 71, 72.
  3. For "declare," the Revised Version has "explain." The
meaning of the parable was not clear to the disciples, especially
the feature of the tares. As they frequently did, so here they
asked Him for an explanation in private.

it? Verses 45, 46.
                             Notes
  i. It was proverbial among the Jews to employ the mustard
seed to denote anything very small, as Jesus also did in this
parable and in Matt. 17: 20 and Luke 17: 6.
  2. The common mustard of Palestine grows wild, attaining the
height of a horse and rider, as travelers have noticed.
  3. From the parable of the mustard seed we may gather
several lessons: that the word of God may lodge in a man's
heart, take root, and grow, before its fruits become outwardly
apparent in that man's life; that no matter how small a part of
the Word may be received (by word of mouth, in a tract, or
otherwise), it has in itself power to work a great transformation
in the life; that the working of the Spirit on a man's heart may
not be discernible to others at first, even when he is sensible
of it himself. We must sow in faith, and God will give the
increase.
  "Not only is the growth of Christ's kingdom illustrated by
the parable of the mustard seed, but in every stage of its growth
the experience represented in the parable is repeated. For His
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     13

church in every generation God has a special truth and a special
work. . . . And in this last generation the parable of the mus-
tard seed is to reach a signal and. triumphant fulfillment. The
little seed will become a tree. The last message of warning and
mercy is to go to 'every nation and kindred and tongue,' to
take out of them, a people for His name.' And the earth shall
be lightened with His glory."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages
78, 79.
   4. The lesson of the mustard seed is here repeated in a dif-
ferent form. The farmer may think upon the power of God's
word as he sows the little seed, placing it out of sight beneath
the soil, to come forth later as a tender plant, which under his
care and God's blessing bears a hundredfold. The housekeeper
may meditate upon the silent working of the Spirit upon the
indifferent heart, as she mixes the leaven in her flour, and waits
patiently for the rising of the dough till she can bake her bread
and distribute it to the needy.

                             Notes
  1. How true it is that the gospel net, when it is cast into the
sea of humanity, gathers of every kind! The church has always
had its foes within as well as its foes without. Among the
twelve disciples were the bad as well as the good. Peter and
Paul were troubled with false brethren, while supported in their
labors by.loyal ones. So will it doubtless be to the end.
  2. This effort of Jesus to teach in His own country recalls
the first recorded instance of His standing up in the synagogue
at Nazareth, when He read from the book of Isaiah with such
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   15

effect that the eyes of all were fastened on Him. Luke 4: 16 and
onward. At that time, the people began to talk of His family
connection; and as He sought to explain the meaning of what
He had read, they were filled with wrath, and rose up and
thrust Him out of the city. So here His longing to save His
own countrymen was disappointed by their foolish reasoning and
their unbelief.

   19. What did He do for them? Same verses.

                              Notes
   1. Everywhere Jesus went, His teaching and miracles stirred
the people, and set them to thinking and talking of what He
taught and did. This is the true meaning of fame. How often
it is said of Jesus that His fame went throughout the cities,
villages, and coasts of Palestine!
   2. Herod had not come into personal contact with Jesus, but
he had come into contact with His forerunner, John the Bap-
tist. The power accompanying the work of Jesus was so simi-
lar to that accompanying the work of John, that Herod mis-
took Jesus for John. So ought the life of every representative
of Jesus to be such that it will reveal the spirit and character of
the Master.
   3. The resentment of John's reproof by Herod and Herodias
was an indication of their guilt. As the Jews, when Christ
pointed out their sins, sought to kill Him, so would these rulers
put John out of the way. It would be just as reasonable for
a man to break a mirror because it showed that his face needed
washing.
   q. The mother had long cherished enmity against John. When
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    17

a wicked desire is cherished in the heart, Satan will usually see
that an opportunity is given to carry it out.
  5. Here is evidence that Herod himself had some conscience
about his wicked deed. This is shown also in his fear that
John had beer raised from the dead, and was clothed with power
to do even mightier works than before. Matt. 14: 2.
  6. "To many minds a deep mystery surrounds the fate of John
the Baptist. They question why he should have been left to
languish and die in prison. The mystery of this dark providence
our human vision cannot penetrate; but it can never shake our
confidence in God when we remember that John was but a
sharer in the sufferings of Christ. . . . Though no miraculous
deliverance was granted John, he was not forsaken. He had
always the companionship of heavenly angels, who opened to
him the prophecies concerning Christ, and the precious promises
of Scripture. . . . Not Enoch, who was translated to heaven,
not Elijah, who ascended in a chariot of fire, was greater or
more honored than John the Baptist, who perished alone in the
dungeon. . . . And of all the gifts that Heaven can bestow upon
men, fellowship with Christ and His sufferings is the most
weighty trust and the highest honor."—"Desire of Ages," pages
223-225.

  17. Where was He when evening came? Verse 23,
last part.
                             Notes
   I. Mark says, "that they may go into the country round about,
and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have
nothing to eat." Luke adds the idea of finding a lodging place.
Luke 9: 12. Evidently the multitude had brought no food with
them, not expecting, perhaps, to stay so long, but held by the
words and works of Jesus, they had lingered all day; or if they
had brought anything, it was eaten at midday, and they were
now hungry and faint.
  2. Jesus would have the feeding of the multitude proceed
decently and in order. They were to sit down in a clean place
— upon "green grass"; and "by companies"— that is, in the cus-
tomary form observed at a feast, as the Greek word symposia,
"drinkings together," indicates. And they sat down "in ranks"
— that is, in squares or double rows, with fifty in each single
row, or a hundred in each double row, the latter probably fac-
ing one another. This would make it easy for the disciples to
distribute the food, and for the multitude to be counted, fifty
of the double rows making five thousand.

18. How was their faith rewarded? Verse 36, last part.
                              Notes
   i. The night was divided into four watches of three hours
each. "In the fourth watch" would therefore mean from, three
to six o'clock in the morning. From this record we may infer
that Jesus spent most of the 'night in prayer,' while the disciples
had been battling against contrary winds, making so little head-
way that in the fourth watch they were only in the midst of
the sea."
   2. The word translated "spirit" here is not the one generally
used in the New Testament in such expressions as "Holy Spirit,"
or, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of," or, "Her
spirit came again." In these expressions, the word pneuma is
used; but in this exclamation of fear by the disciples, the word
used is phantasma, from which we get "phantom," with about
the same meaning as "apparition" or "specter." In our language
and time, the natural expression would have been, "It's a ghost."
Just what the disciples thought it was, need not trouble us. It
is sufficiently clear that they could not explain the phenomenon
of a man walking on the sea, and as some of us might have done,
called it a ghost. How cheering must the familiar voice of
Jesus have seemed to them in their strait!
   3. Peter's failure in the physical act of walking on the sea,
was owing to the same thing that brings failure to us many
times on the sea of life — doubt. It would teem to us an act of
great faith to step out of a boat upon a rough sea in the dark-
ness ; but Jesus called it an act of "little faith" for a man to
do what Jesus bade him, and with Jesus there personally to help.
It makes all the difference in the world whether our faith is based
on the definite word of God, or whether we look upon condi-
tions around us that seem contrary. It makes as great a differ-
ence whether we attempt a thing in our owfri strength or with
Jesus present to help.

   22. What was His conclusion? Verse 20.
                              Notes
  i. The charge brought against the disciples, that they did not
wash their hands when they ate, evidently referred to cere-
monial washing, not to the ordinary washing of the hands. The
complaint' was that in neglecting to wash their hands before
eating, the disciples transgressed the tradition of the elders ; but
so common and necessary a thing as the washing of the hands
could not have been a tradition. Jesus says, in verse 20, that
"to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man." That He
referred to moral, not physical defilement, is clear from what He
said of the things that do defile a man, in verse 19.
  2. "They set aside the fifth commandment as of no conse-
quence, but were very exact in carrying out the traditions of the
elders. They taught the people that the devotion of their prop-
erty to the temple was a duty more sacred than even the sup-
port of their parents; and that, however great the necessity, it
was sacrilege to impart to father or mother any part of what
had been thus consecrated. An undutiful child had only to pro-
nounce the word `Corban' over his property, thus devoting it
to God, and he could retain it for his own use during his life-
time, and after his death it was to be appropriated to the temple
service. Thus he was at liberty, both in life and in death, to
dishonor and defraud his parents, under cover of a pretended
devotion to God."—"Desire of Ages," pages 396, 397.
  A person might thus exempt himself from any inconvenient
obligation. The Jews permitted debtors to defraud creditors
by consecrating their debt to God.
24         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  3. The Jews had formulated so many regulations of a cere-
monial and often trivial nature, whose disregard was said to
bring defilement, that there was, much confusion in the people's
minds between the commandments of God and the command-
ments of men. This is made evident by Peter's request for an
explanation of Jesus' statement about what "goeth into" and
what "cometh out of" the mouth. Jesus did not leave the dis-
ciples in any doubt about His meaning. Neither do His words
contradict the plain statement of the Bible with reference to
certain things that are "unclean" and thus unfit to eat.

                             Notes
   T. The complaint of the disciples 'that the woman cried after
Jesus, indicates her earnest determination to obtain what she
sought. If the Lord does not answer our prayers immediately,
it is for some wise purpose. "I hid My face from thee for a
moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on
thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer." Isa. 54 : 8. It is pleasing
to the Lord and a blessing to us to press our petitions to the
throne of mercy, if we as according to His will. Men were
annoyed at the woman's importunity, but Jesus pronounced her
of great faith and granted her request.
   2. Notice how fully the woman identified herself with the in-
terests of her daughter. Her cry was, "Have mercy on me,"
"Help me," when her supplication was for the deliverance of
her daughter.
   3. It is likely that Jesus here made use of a familiar saying.
It is in the form of a parable. The "children" doubtless refer
26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY


to God's chosen people Israel (see verse 24), and the "dogs"
to the gentiles, or unbelievers. Compare Rev. 22: 15. By her
faith in Jesus' power to heal, and by her perseverance in pray-
ing that He exercise it upon her daughter, this woman showed
that though a Canaanite by race, she was really a member of the
spiritual house of Israel.

  io. What did Jesus say to them? Verse 6.
11. How did they reason about His saying? Verse 7.
12. How did Jesus reprove them? Verse 8.
13. What pointed question did He ask them? Verse 9.
14. Of what other miracle did Jesus remind them?
Verse io.
15. What further question did He ask them? Verse 11.
16. How did they understand Jesus' saying in verse 6?
Verse 12.
                              Notes
  i. Though the Pharisees and the Sadducees were opposed to
each other in many of their beliefs, and were often at enmity in
their dealings, yet they frequently united in their efforts to over-
throw the teachings of Jesus and weaken His influence. Here
they sought to "tempt" or test Him, that they might entangle
Him in His talk.
  2. The sign that the Jews most needed had already been given
them — the sign of the prophet Jonah, with the lesson of Jonah's
message of repentance to Nineveh. This was also the message
of John the Baptist. If the Pharisees and the Sadducees could
have the experience of "repentance, this would clear up their
spiritual perceptions ; but without repentance and belief on the
Lord Jesus Christ, it would be useless to give them other signs.

                          Your first burden, upon
Take Heart                  learning of the blessed
                            truth, was to present it to
                            your relatives and friends,
wasn't it? You talked with them, .sent them the Signs,
prayed for them. But in thousands of cases, your ef-
forts have been in vain.
  Times are changing. Many of these loved ones are
now looking to us for the very thing they once spurned.
  "For twenty-six years we have done everything we
could to interest our relatives," one brother writes.
"Last fall I sent the Signs to my cousin again. I was
rejoiced a few days ago to receive a letter from him
assuring me of his intention to obey the truth."
  A brother in southern California sent the Signs to
a prejudiced sister-in-law who had been a devout
Methodist. For a long time she wouldn't look at the
Signs. Last September he sent her the Home Mis-
sionary Series. In a recent letter, she said: "I found
that I was keeping the wrong day for the Sabbath.
The children and I now attend the Sabbath school
here in —."
  Again we say, Take heart.




A Man in Iowa Did It Hefive
                         sent thirty
                            subscrip
                                      tions for the
Signs Magazine to his tract society. The very next
week eighty more followed, some for eighteen months,
some for one year, some for six months.
  But the point is this: He again proved that it is pos-
sible to make a living—a good one, too—by taking
subscriptions for and selling this message-filled maga-
zine. Easier than ever before, in fact. Why? — Be-
cause the Signs Magazine answers those very questions
that people are so perplexed about.
  Tell your tract society secretary that you would like
to emulate the Iowa brother's good example.
GREAT NEEDS of the HOUR

pictures can do. The best temperance publication
that we know of.

            "THE WORLD'S CRISIS"

swers that often asked question, "What do these
things mean?" Its message appeals to thinking
men and women. Nearly 250,000 copies sold by
April I.
