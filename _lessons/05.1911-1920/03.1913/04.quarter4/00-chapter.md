                        Introductory Note

    The epistle of Paul to the Romans is placed first of all among
his writings, because of its great doctrinal importance. It prob-
ably was written in Corinth in the spring of A.D. 57 or 58. It is
one of the most systematic and comprehensive of religious trea-
tises and withal a mighty appeal. It sets forth man's sinful and
lost condition, whatever his race or pretension, hi's hopelesSness
without God, and God's mercy in justification through Christ
Jesus. It shows how God can be just, and yet justify the be-
lieving sinner; not that he may continue in sin, but that he may
develop a sinless, Christian character. While a profound book,
it is not difficult for the heart of faith to apprehend.
    Study the book, its chapters, its sections, its verses, its clauses,
its phrases, its words. Do not hurry. Do not seek to give a whole
verse for an answer to a question when a word will suffice. Use
only that part of the Scripture necessary to answer the question.
Get all you can out of the words of life. Review often. Re-
member the " theref ores" and "Wherefores; " and find the rea-
sons for their use. May the study of this wonderful epistle bring
the multiplied blessings of faith to all.

                               Notes
     1. Paul, the former Saul of Tarsus, is the author of the epistle
 to the Romans. It is quite generally agreed that it was written
 from Corinth, in A.D. 57 or 58, when the apostle was about to go
 up to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. Conybeare and Howson
 say:
     " The date of this epistle is very p5operly fixed by the fol-
 lowing statements contained in it:
     " (1) St. Paul had never yet been to Rome (chap. 1:11, 13,
15).
     " (2) He was intending to go to Rome, after first visiting
 Jerusalem (chap. 15:23-28). This was exactly his purpose during
 his three months' residence at Corinth. See Acts 19:21.
     " (3) He was going to bear a collection of alms from Mace-
 donia and Achaia to Jerusalem (chap. 15:26, 31). This he did
 carry from Corinth to Jerusalem at the ,close of his three months'
  visit. See Acts 24:17.
     " (4) When he wrote the epistle, Timotheus, Sosipater, Gaius,
 and Erastus were with him (chap. 16:21, 23) ; of these, the first
 three are expressly mentioned in the Acts as having been with him
  at Corinth during the three months' visit (see Acts 20:4); and
• the last, Erastus, was himself a Corinthian, and had been sent
 shortly before from Ephesus (Acts 19:22) with Timotheus on the
  way to Corinth. Compare 1 Cor. 16:10, 11."—"Life and Epistles
  of St. Paul," People's Edition, pages 544, 545.
     The object of the epistle is to teach the meaning of salvation
  through the gospel of Jesus Christ in all its fulness.
    2. "A servant."— God calls His children sons, daughters,
 saints, friends; but the devoted saint of God finds joy in calling
 himself "a servant," literally, a bond-servant, a bought slave,
 purchased by the blood of Christ, and bound to Him by Spirit-
 born love.
    3. "Called to be an apostle."— The word "apostle" means
 one who is sent. It is a term which our Lord gave to each of the
 twelve, and on the failure of Judas Iscariot, Matthias was chosen
 and numbered with the eleven. But it is a mistake to suppose that
 apostleship was confined to the twelve, or that Paul was one of
 the twelve. The twelve were sent to Israel. Paul was an apostle
 — one authoritatively sent, a messenger — to the Gentiles. Bar-
6 '         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

nabas, Epaphroditus, Timothy, and Silvanus are called apostles-
also. The first twelve apostles, bearing witness that Jesus was the
living Christ, must as a necessary qualification have seen the Lord,
and Paul refers to his experience to show he was not behind the
other apostles in this respect (1 Cor. 9:1; 15:8). But that this '
is not necessary to apostleship is shown (1) in the calling of
Barnabas and others, and (2) in the fact that the gift of apostle-
ship is to be in the church to the end. "The Greek," says Vin-
cent, "indicates that the writer was actually in the apostolate —
a called apostle."
    4. "Separated un10."—"Separated unto" also implies sep-
arated from, a distinct marking off, a cleavage from the mass.
So Paul and Barnabas were separated unto God's work (Acts
13:2), and Paul was set apart for his work from his birth (Gal.
1:15, 16). So God calls every one to some work, and separates
them to that in His own good time if they are but submitted to
His will.
    5. "Of the seed of David."— Chris't was, therefore, of the
royal line through His mother. But He was more than this; He
was the same flesh as the seed of David, in and through which
for generations had flowed the blood of sinful humanity,— Solo-
mon, and Rehoboam, and Ahaz, and Manasseh, and Amon, and
Jeconiah, and others. The Son of God took this same flesh in
order that He might meet temptation for, us, and overcome with
divine power every trial we must meet. Christ is our Brother in
the flesh, our Saviour from sin.
    6. "Declared to be."— Jesus was the Son of God before
He was born of the virgin Mary. He was the only-begotten Son
of God from the days of eternity. When on earth He was di-
vinity incarnate in humanity, clothed with its weaknesses. To
the unbeliever He was but a man. Selfish hearts could not
read His motives; sin-blinded souls could not see His divinity of
character. Yet it was there, though the world — nay, His own
people — knew it not, and crucified Him. But His resurrection
from the dead declared His holiness, His power over sin, His
dominion over death, His divinity. Acts 2:24.
    7. "The Spirit of holiness."— The Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters when the world was created. Jesus was
born of the Spirit. In Him "the spirit is life because of right-
eousness; " and if His Spirit dwell in us there will be manifest in
us the same fruits as were witnessed in the life of Jesus. Rom.
8:10, 11.
    8. "For obedience to the faith."— Better as given in the
American Revised Version, "unto obedience of faith." There
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      7
is no other obedience acceptable to God. "Obedience of faith is
the obedience which characterizes and proceeds from faith."—
Vincent.
    9. "Called to be saints."— The word "saints" does not nec-
essarily imply perfect persons. "The term hagioi, saints, is applied
to Christians in three senses in the New Testament: (1) as mem-
bers of a visible and local community (Acts 9:32, 41; 26:10) ;
(2) as members of a spiritual community (1 Cor. 1:2; Col. 3:12) ;
(3) as individually holy (Eph. 1:18; Col. 1:12; Rev. 13:10)."
—" Word Studies," Vincent. The saints are those who are sep-
arated from the world, and set apart to God and His service. As
we are called to be saints, the lessons of this .epistle are for us.
    10. "Grace." God's unmerited favor; "peace." God's proc-
lamation to us as rebels. His thoughts toward us are thoughts of
mercy and peace. Jer. 29:11. If we are not at peace with God,
it'is because our hearts are in rebellion. All heaven desires to be
at peace with us.

                             Notes
   1. "I thank God."— Paul carried a burden for souls. He
was not among those who could preach a sermon and then lightly
"leave it and the people with the. Lord." He not only longed
for the conversion of souls, but for their growth and progress as
well. For this he labored night and day, that he might present
every man perfect in Christ Jesus. Acts 20:19, 20, 26, 27, 31.
He rejoiced, therefore, in the prosperity of the church in wicked,
idolatrous Rome.
   "The whole world," that is, the civiliied world. Just as far
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       9
as Rome's dominion extended, so far had gone the fame of the
faithful in Rome. See Acts 28:22; Rom. 16:19; 1 Thess. 1:8.
    2. "Some spiritual gift"— Vincent remarks that the Greek
word for gift, charisma, means "gift of grace, a favor received
without merit on the recipient's part. Paul uses it both in this
ordinary sense (chapter 5:15, 16; 6:23) and in a special, tech-
nical sense, denoting extraordinary powers bestowed upon indi-
viduals by the Holy Spirit, such as gifts of healing, speaking with
tongues, prophecy, etc. See Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 1:7; 12:4, 31;
1 Peter 4:10. In 1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6, it is used of the sum
of the powers requisite for the discharge of the office of our evan-
gelist."—"Word Studies."
    God sometimes imparted these gifts through His ministers,
not to satisfy ambition, or to glorify man. but to establish the
receiver in the faith. See Acts 8:17; 19:6; 1 Cor. 1:6-8.
    3. "Comforted."— It has been suggested that while Paul had
not seen Rome, he had met many of the disciples there. This is
indicated by the names mentioned in chapter 16. In fact it is
quite probable that many members of the congregation in Rome
had been converted through the labors of Paul in other places,
and had been brought together by a common faith, as is often
the case in large. central cities. He would not have them think
his previous statement was a reflection upon them, but that the
impartation of the gift would be a Comfort to both.
    4. "Debtor."—Paul was "sold under sin," a bond-slave,
powerless to help or save himself. The Lord Jesus bought him,
redeemed him, purchased him with His own precious blood. Paul
belonged to Christ. But Christ died for all, and made a way
whereby all might be saved. Therefore Paul, the purchased, be-
came debtor to do the work of Christ to the fullest extent of his
ability and power. Being through Christ debtor to all, Paul was
as ready to preach the gospel in Rome as in Jerusalem. No race
or national prejudices can limit the soul which has been baptized
into the life and love of Christ.
    "We owe a great debt and it is long overdue!           am debtor
both to the Greeks. and to the barbarians,' said Paul. What had
he received of them? — Absolutely nothing. But he had what they
needed and must have. and he had met that need. We have in
our hand a pardon for a man condemned, and we are his debtor
until 'we put it in his hand. It was for this purpose that we re-
ceived it, and with it went the message, Go quick anywhere! "—
"Pastoral and Personal Evangelism," page 52.
    5. "Not ashamed."— There are many things for which hu-
man beings ought to be ashamed, but are not. Drinking, smoking,
profanity, filthiness, gossip, talebearing, broken promises, false-
10          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

hood, ill feelings toward others, malice, envy, folly, and a multi-
tude of other sins, are things of which gospel-enlightened, judg-
ment-bound people ought to be ashamed. Of the opposite of these
one ought never to be ashamed. Who ever heard of one ashamed
of being honest, upright, clean, sober, temperate, and true? But
it is just such a character as this that the gospel will develop.
Why should one be ashamed of the gospel? Paul was ready to
preach the gospel because he was not ashamed of it.
    6. "The Gospel."— The word "gospel" means "good ti-
dings." So the angel calls it in Luke 2:10. See also Isa. 52:7.
God designed that His message of salvation should ever be "good
tidings" to those in sin, in helplessness, and in the shadow of
death. The powerlessness of men to help themselves was seen
in the wickedness of the world in the apostle's day, and set forth
in this book. The gospel came with good tidings of available
power, even the power of God. The whole material universe is a
witness to this power. "The heavens declare the glory of God;
and the firmament showeth His handiwork." Ps. 19:1. The
stars rolling on their sublime courses is a manifestation of God's
power. "For that He is strong in power; not one faileth." Isa.
40:26. The gospel of God is the good tidings to every soul that
this same power is pledged to the salvation of the sinful, the hope-
less, the helpless. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation.
It comes not to crush but to lift up, not to destroy but to save.
    7. "To every one."— There is no exception to this. All may
be recipients of God's power, if they will but believe His word
and submit to His will. Those who make a free channel for His
power, whether Jew or Gentile, will receive strength for every
need.
    8. "From faith to faith."— Faith is more than mere belief
or assent to a statement. Faith accepts God's forgiveness, or
God's covering righteousness, for all past sins. We are justified
from sin by faith only. And the faith that accepts this re-
nounces sin and accepts the power of the life of God for holy
living, and a new heart which that life creates. The old life of
the believer is changdd for the life of Christ, and the Father sees
upon the sinner only the righteousness of the Divine.

truth who is unrighteous. The Revised Version gives the correct
sense, "hold down," that is, to hinder or repress the truth. They
do not receive the truth into their lives, and by the false profes-
sion, often hinder it from reaching other lives.
    2. "Manifested."— God's power and influence are manifested
in men, in conscience, in judgment, in reason, in love, in a desire
after holiness. His wisdom and power are manifest unto men in
sun and stars, in wood and field, in sea and land, in rock and
plain, in all His works. And the manifestation of His invisible
power in visible things, enables thoughtful men to grasp the love,
righteousness, and life of God.
    3. "Invisible things."— There is always enough light and
truth for one step more. All the visible things of God that are
manifest to us argue for the invisible perfections of God which
we can not see, even His eternal power to save, His divine, ever-
lasting love.
    4. "Heart was darkened."— Darkness does not come from
God. "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all." Our
path becomes darkened when we turn from the light and inter-
pose our own shadow between our pathway and God. Those who
knew iod might have retained Him in their hearts, and glorified
Him. But instead, by taking glory to themselves, they shut away
God's glory, and their foolish heart was darkened. "He that
walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth."
    5. "Gave them up."— When men will not have God, He per-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    13
'nits them to have their own way; He leaves them to the power
and fruitage of the sin they have chosen.
    6. "Changed the truth."— The Revised Version reads, "For
that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie." Godet instead
of "changed" gives "travestied." Conybeare and Howson say,
"This is nearly a quotation from Ps. 106:20 (Septuagint) ; the
phrase used there and here meaning to forSake one thing for an-
other, to change one thing against another." They utterly per-
verted the truth of God to degrading, debasing lies. Vincent says
that "the truth of God" is equivalent to "the true God." They
made of the .true God a lie in their own hearts; they travestied
His truth, and turned from His infinite perfections to the wor-
ship of the lowest and basest. Their gods were their passions per-
sonified. They "passed by" the Creator. The Revised Version
reads they worship the creature "rather than" the Creator. They
deliberately chose sin instead of God.
    7. "Gave them up."— The expressions in these verses are
terrible in their intensity, and ought to help us to see what it
means to cast off God. Bengel remarks, "In stigmatizing we
must often call a spade a spade. The unchaste usually demand
from others an absurd modesty." Yet Paul's reserve is in strong
contrast with the freedom of pagan writers. See Eph. 5:12.
"Men gave not God thanks, gave not God reverence, gave not God
obedience; therefore God gave them up to their own awful way."
— Vincent.

                        Notes
   1. "Gave them over."— This is the third time this expres-
sion has appeared in this chapter. God gave them up to unclean-
ness, to a reprobate mind, a mind void of judgment, with no
power to see, or choose 'the right. The reprobate mind is the last
stage of evil.
  , 2. "To do those things."— Every kind of mind bears its
fruitage. The reprobate mind leads inevitably to the doing of
those things which are "not fitting," as given in the Revised
Version.
    3. "Filled with all unrighteousness."— The list of sins
which are given are manifestations of unrighteousness. Study
them; they may not belong to the heathen world alone. "For-
nication," transgression of the seventh commandment, which may
be in cherished thought. "Wickedness," dangerous, destructive
sin. "Covetousness," greed, "the sinful desire which goes out
after things of time and sense of every form and kind." "Idol-
atry." " Covetousness and impurity may be said to divide be-
tween them nearly the whole domain of selfishness and vice."—
Lightfoot. "Maliciousness," baseness, badness, malice, ill will,
a disposition to do evil. "Full of envy," filled with ill feeling
toward those who seem better circumstanced than ourselves.
"Murder," hatred cherished in the heart which leads to murder.
"Debate," "to beat down," strife. "Deceit," living a lie.
"Malignity," a malicious, actively hating disposition. "Whis-
perers," those who make trouble (Prov. 16:28), tattlers, tale-
bearers.
    4. "Backbiters,"— detractors of character, those who say evil
things against the person not present. "Haters of God," not
only feeling but showing hatred, hating God because of His char-
acter. "Despiteful," insolent, arrogant. "Boasters," vain boast-
ing of shallow things, "swaggerers." "Inventors of evil
things," "inventors of vices'' (Rotherham), new ways of sin-
ning. "Disobedient to parents," the beginning of a life of
disobedience.
    .5. "Without understanding."— God gave them up to such
a condition. "Covenant-breakers," those who will not keep their
word. Failure to keep one's word is a marked feature in the
commercial, political, and social worlds. "Without natural af-
16          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
fection," no true love for one's own kin, affection perverted by
lust and selfishness. "Implacable," stubborn in enmity, that
which will not be reconciled, in need of mercy but unmerciful.
What an awful list of sins,— twenty-two in number! They are
descriptive of the heathen world to-day. But they are not con-
fined there.
    6. A similar list of sins is found in 2 Tim. 3:1-5, and is there
applied to the professed children of God in the last days. These
sins are but the product of the natural, unregenerate heart, and
can be restrained only by the power of God. The gospel is the
only remedy for this condition.
    7. "They which commit such things."— Rotherham renders
this verse: "Who, indeed, having acknowledged the righteous
sentence of God, that they who do such things as these do practise
are worthy of death, not only the same things are doing, but are
even delighting together with them who are practising them."

    1. "To them."— There are two classes of persons. One class
is composed of those who by patient continuance in well-doing
are seeking God's glory and honor, and the immortality, or in-
corruption which He only can give. To all such He will give
eternal life. God does this now in answer to faith. See John
3:16; 1 John 5:11, 12. In the great day of final reward He will
give the believers eternal life absolutely forevermore, and make
their frail bodies immortal. To the other class who have been
contentious and disobedient He will render the fruitage of their
doings. They have refused to obey the truth, but have followed
unrighteousness. To them belongs indignation and wrath, tribu-
18         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

lation and anguish. It is at awful cost that man identifies him-
self with sin.
    2. "Upon every soul."— To the Jew first, because his privi-
leges have been greater, his light stronger and clearer. To the
one to whom first comes the great revelation of God's grace, to'
him first comes judgment.
    3. "Glory, honor, and peace."— God's glory of character,
God's honor upon the faithful, God's peace to him who lays down
his arms of rebellion. Surely this is worth striving for.
    4. "Without law."— That is, without the written law. Every
responsible human being has some consciousness of wrong. If
followed it will lead to clearer light. If turned from it will
lead to greater darkness. God watches over those whose heart
(not wisdom) is perfect toward Him. 2 Chron. 16:9. Every
soul is given light enough to save him if he will but follow it;
and according to the light rejected will he be judged.
    5. "Law unto themselves."—' This does not mean that God
will accept a human standard; but that the Gentile finds in his
own conscience and mind all the standard he knows. God by His
Spirit and providence will work all He can in such hearts and
will regard the motive. One ray of light permitted to dominate
the soul will bring salvation.
    6. "In the day."— There is a close connection between
verses 12 and 16, verses 13 to 15 being simply parenthetical and
explanatory. The two classes named in verse 12 "shall be
judged . . . in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel." All cherished evil,
all human secrets, will be hidden no longer. The One by wliom
we are judged has been over the road before us. Absolute justice
will then be done. It is in view of the judgment we should live,
not what our neighbor may say or do.

                              Notes
    1. "Thou art called a Jew."— This was an honorable name.
Resting in the law, and glorying in God, were good, as far as they
went. But they did this only in form, and an empty form can
bring only condemnation. The law referred to was doubtless God's
primal law, or Decalogue, of which the apostle cites three pre-
cepts later on. Verses 21-23.
    2. "Being instructed."— From the outward teaching of the
law the Jew had to a great extent learned right doctrine. He
approved the excellent things of the law, having learned that the
law is an expression of God's will. Ps. 40:7, 8.
    3. "Form of knowledge in the law."— We must not make
the mistake with the Jew that the outward form is sufficient; nor
should we make an equal mistake with the liberalist, or antinomian,
that no form, or rule, is necessary. Paul expressly affirms that
the Jew had in the law "the form of knowledge and of the
truth." The form therefore was correct. The seventh-day Sab-
bath, observed by the Jew, was the correct form, the right outward
observance. What was needed was the spirit, the life of the word
in the form. A form though it be a true form, if alone, has
no life.
    4. A form of godliness without the power leads to all manner
of sin, and brings reproach upon God's name and cause. If the
life of the professed people of God is what it ought to be, we
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    21
 need not fear for the doctrine of truth. It is extremely sad when
 God's own people by unconsecrated lives dishonor His name and
 cause.
     5. Circumcision was given as a sign of righteousness, a mark
 of separation from the world. Rom. 4:11. The Jew who boasted
 of his conformity to that rite declared in words that he was
 righteous. If his claim was true, the token was of great profit.
 It spoke of a righteous man. In other words, the profession of
 circumcision would have been a true token if the life was in har-
 mony with God. If not, the circumcision was nothing. The cir-
 cumcised man was a sinner the same as others.
     6. The word "judge" is used in the sense of condemn. The
 obedient though uncircumcised condemned the disobedient though
 he be circumcised.
     7. "Not a Jew."— Merely the name Jew could not save any
 one. Outward profession alone counted for nothing in God's
 sight.
     S. The true Jew is the one who is Christ's, a true, converted
 Christian. The cleansed, loyal heart is alone accepted in God's
 sight. The true Jew is the man of faith. The true circumcision
 is.that crucifixion with Christ which separates from sin.
     9. "The Pharisees and the Pharisaic. Judaizers sought to gain
 the praise of men by their outward show of sanctity; which is
 here contrasted with the inward holiness which seeks no praise
'but that of .God. The same contrast occurs in the Sermon on the
 Mount."— Conybeare and Howson.

                                 Notes
    1. "Much every way."— Surely it is of great advantage to
have access to all the wonderful truth and teaching of God
throughout the centuries, from the time of the Promised Seed
till- our Lord's first advent. But chief among these advantages to
the Jews were the holy precepts and oracles of God, which were
entrusted to them, all of which were inseparably interwoven with
the gospel.
     2. "Let God be true."— The thought of the text is not that
we shall ascribe truth to God at all hazards, whether He speaks
truth or not; but that God speaks truth always and forever,
whatever man may say or do. The great fact should be recog-
nized, that God is the very truth itself. Then will we discern
truth in His words, righteousness in His acts, justice in His
 judgment.
     3. All things shall work finally to God's glory. Even the wicked,
by doing as God declares they will, by reaping the fruits He
declares they will reap, are thus commending the truthfulness and
the righteousness of God. The psalmist declares, "The wrath of
 man shall praise Thee." Nor is God unrighteous, who punishes
 the wicked. They are only reaping the fruit of that which they
 have sown.
     4. "All under sin."—All are condemned by sin. Man, by
 nature and apart from Christ, is its slave. For proof of his
 statements the apostle quotes from the Holy Scriptures.
     5. Ey a series of quotations from the Scriptures, which the
 Jews held to be sacred, the apostle proved the sinfulness, depravity,
 and helplessness of humanity These scriptures speak of the world
 without Christ, not of God's devoted people.

  15. How then does faith affect the law? Verse 31.
Note 7.
                              Notes
    1. "To them who are under the law."— Literally, to them
"within" the law, that is, subject to its jurisdiction. This would
.nclude all responsible beings. in heaven and earth, for all are
amenable to God. As all the world have transgressed the law,
they have no defense before God, and stand guilty in His sight.
A law that condemns all therefore must be universal and uniform
in its claims.
    2. It is quite evident to the thoughtful student that no law
can justify its transgressor; it can only condemn him. No trans-
gressed human law even can justify the criminal. It can only pro-
nounce him guilty. No intelligent Bible student will look to the
law for justification. It is by the light which shines from the
law that the exceeding sinfulness of sin is made known.
    3. Man is sin-sick and helpless. The righteousness which will
justify must come from without the sinner, apart from his own
imperfections. This is the righteousness which comes to us
through the gospel (chapter 1:16). But this righteousness must
be in harmony with God to be acceptable to Him. it is the
gift of God, through faith, apart from works, and is the same
righteousness that is in the law. But man because of his weak-
ness and sinfulness, can not of hiinself attain unto this righteous-
ness. But thanks be to God, Ile meets our need, and gives unto
us His own eternal righteousness.
    4. "All have sinned."— All have sinned, or " missed the
mark." All have come short of the glory of God's character,
and only the glory of His character through grace can save us,
and enable those who have come short to attain unto the mark of
His high calling in Christ.
    5. "Set forth,"— margin " foreordained." 1 Cor. 2:7, 8.
Jesus is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Bev.
13:8. His suffering and death were but steps in the great plan of
redemption. He was ordained to be a propitiation — a mercy-
seat — where justice and mercy meet,— and the sin-burdened soul,
finds forgiveness through Him. But the mercy freely given of God
comes only through faith in Jesus' bioou as the great sin cleanser.
 When faith grasps Jesus as the Saviour, His righteousness be-
comes our rignteousness, and all past sins are forgiven. J esus was
toreordained, set forth, to do this for all who believe.
    6. Jesus is the Justifier of the believer. In the graphic words
26          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
of Bishop Lowth's translation, He stoops and says to the hopeless
sinner on his way to the judgment, "Come on now, and let us
plead together." He will be our daysman, our mediator before
the judge. Jesus is the Saviour who is to wash white as snow the
scarlet sins, and "all the fitness He requireth is to feel our need
of Him." As our Justifier He has willingly paid the penalty
which was our due, and His sacrifice is acceptable with God.
It is ours to accept the Substitute, and be delivered from the
tyranny of sin.
    7. "Establish the law."— Where is the law established?
Not in God's government or plan; for His law is eternal, whether
men believe or disbelieve (see verse 3; Ps. 119:89; 111:7, 8).
But the law is established in the heart of the believer, and if he
goes on from "faith to faith" it is then written in the heart
in all its fulness forever.

   1. "Hath whereof to glory."— If one is saved by his own
efforts he surely can glory in himself. But the apostle acids, "but
not before God," for the apostle had before proved that all, both
Jews and Gentiles, are under sin. There can be no self-glorifica-
tion in God's presence.
28          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    2. Though Abraham could not understand how the promise
God made could be fulfilled, yet he believed the word of God.
And God counted the faith he had righteousness. Abraham was
therefore made righteous by faith only and not works. In like
manner are all the children of Abraham justified from sin.
    "A check, though signed by the richest man, will not do any
good unless one has faith to present' it. The doctor can not cure
a man who will not trust bins enough to take his medicines and
obey his directions. A guide can not lead us through the forest
unless we believe him enough to follow him. "— Peloubet.
   .3. "Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written
for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures might have hope." Abraham believed God, believed
His promise, His power, His love. His faith was reckoned unto
him as the righteousness of God. Even so it is reckoned unto us
if we believe. Abraham is set forth as an example as the father
of all them that believe. By the same faith in Christ we become
his children.

   16. For what was He raised from the dead? Verse
25, last part. Note 7..
                             Notes

    1. "Heir of the world."— This is the ultimate of God's
promise in both type and declaration. The earth was given to
man in the beginning. Gen. 1:26; Ps. 115:16. Adam lost it
through sin, but our Lord bought it back by sacrifice. Luke
19:10. The holy seed are to inherit it, of whom the preeminent
One is Christ Jesus our Lord. The usurper possesses it for a time,
for man by transgression lost to the enemy the dominion given
him in Eden. Gen. 3:6, 7; Luke 4:5, 6. But the Seed will at
last crush the serpent's head and cleanse the kingdom. Gen. 3:15;
Rom. 16:20. This was promised to Abraham repeatedly. After
his great test he was told that his seed should possess the gate —
the place of judgment and power — of his enemies. Gen. 22:16-18.
And all this will be wrought out through Christ when He comes
again. At the close of the 1,000 years of Revelation 20 the saints
will possess the earth made new, and God's will will be done on
earth as in heaven.
    2. "Of the law" and "through the law" means through the
works of the law. If man could earn his inheritance, what need
would there be of faith? There would be no need of God's
promise, if man could work out his own salvation. But man can
neither work righteousness, nor earn his inheritance, for he is a
sinner "without strength."
    3. "Worketh wrath."— God did not give the law for this
purpose; it was "ordained to life." Gravitation is a beneficent
force. It holds things stable and in equilibrium on the earth.
But if man should hurl himself from a high cliff, the force of
gravitation would prove his destruction. Electricity in proper
channels may be and is one of the most usefifl agents in the
world to-day, but misdirected it proves destructive. The heart
in harmony with God's law finds it a lamp to the feet and a light
to the path; but the heart set against that law finds its working
condemnation and death.
   4. "No law — no transgression."— There has been trans-
gression in this world since Adam sinned. There must therefore
have been law. And as sin has ever been against our heavenly
Father, the law transgressed must be. God's law. And as the sin
has been universal, so far as man is concerned, the law must be a
universal law.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      31

    5. "Of faith."— The promise must be appropriated by faith.
If the Jew could work out his salvation by works, he would boast
in himself. The Gentile would, if able so to do, boast in himself.
But faith puts all upon the same basis, both Jew and Gentile.
When it is all of faith, to God will be all the glory.
    6. "Who quickeneth the dead."—"Who giveth life to the
dead" (A.R.V.). All that is in God's purpose is to Him a reality.
All those who sleep in Him are counted as living, because in His
purpose they live. He calleth things that are not as though they
were, because in His purpose they are, and when He speaks they
exist.
    7. "Our Justification."— All the promises and blessings of
the past and the present center in our blessed Lord. He died to
deliver us from our sins, from our trespasses .against Him. He
was raised for our justification to righteousness, to life and power.
All this was written for our sake, that we might hope in Him.

                               Notes

   1. "We have peace."— Faith sees the holiness of God's law,
sees sin as evil, denies self, and confesses and renounces sin. Faith
yields all to God, and lays hold of the righteousness of God in
the place of sin. Then there is peace. Peace is not merely a feel-
ing; it is more; it is a condition. When the soul surrenders to
God, there is peace. God has naught against us, and if the en-
mity of the carnal heart is yielded to Him, whether there is feel-
ing or not, whether in joy or sadness, there is peace. Peace
abides. It is found in Christ, and if Christ is ours we have peace.
   2. "Have access."— Through faith we have entrance to the
great treasures of God's grace. Faith in .Christ admits us into
the audience-chamber of the Most High, and introduces us, also,
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        33
into God's marvelous storehouse of riches. Through Christ we
may enter and partake freely of all things.
    3. "Tribulation."— The English word comes from the old
Latin word tribulum, a thrashing instrument, used to pound out
the grain. The Greek word means to squeeze, or press. So God
permits the pounding, the thrashing, the squeezing, to ssparate the
chaff, to press out the choice wine, or oil of rich experience. Only
in trial and tribulation can we obtain experience; only in the test-
ing of experience can we obtain hope. Therefore let us rejoice
in tribulation.
    4. "The love of God."— The love of God is.what many long
for. They desire to serve God; but confess that they do not love
Him nor His service. They are trying to do this by human effort,
which is doomed to failure. The love of God is of heavenly birth,
and must be fed on heavenly manna. Do we really desire it It
comes by the indwelling of His Spirit. Do we desire the Spirit?
"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and
it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth;
and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be
opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father,
 will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give
him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a
scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give
the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him'?" Luke 11:9-13.
     5. There are times in the experience of every child of God
 when the sense of our lost, awful condition almost overwhelms us,
 and we are tempted to feel that there is no hope for us. But •be
 of good courage. It was for sinners, for the most ungodly, that
:fesus died, for those who are lost, who have strayed the farthest
 from the Father's house. Every returning prodigal will find a wel-
 come and a father's blessing.
     6. "Atonement."—"Reconciliation" is given in the margin
 and Revised Version. Surely there is reason to be joyful in God.
 It was while we were enemies that He died to save us. Much more
 when reconciled we shall be saved by His life. When reconcilia-
 tion to Him brings all the blessings named, and gives access to all
 the blessings we need, why should not our hearts be filled with
 thanksgiving to God"?

                             Notes
   1. "Until the law."— These words do not mean that there
was no law before God spoke His law at Sinai, but "until the
law" was given in written form at that time. As God imputed sin
to Adam in the garden, there must have been a law.
    2. "Death reigned."— That the law existed previous to Sinai
is shown by the fact that death reigned from the time that Adam
sinned. But sin is the transgression of God's law. 1 John 3:4;
Born. 7:7. Therefore God's law existed unchangeably from the
beginning. Every commandment of the Decalogue may be traced
either in its observance or transgression previous to Sinai. Apart
from law there is no transgression, therefore if no law was given
36          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 to man before the Decalogue was spoken from Mount Sinai, there
 were no sinners previous to that time, for there was no law to
 transgress. But death reigned, and therefore there was sin, and
 being sin, a law.
    3. "A figure."— Adam was the head and father of the fleshly
 race, which follow him into sin and death. Christ Jesus is the
 head of the spiritual race of men, which follow Him in righteous-
 ness and life.
     4. The free gift is not to be compared to the trespass. In
 that one trespass Satan thought to destroy the race forevermore,
 but the unspeakable gift of Jesus Christ, the grace of God that
 was manifest in Him, abounded unto the many over the trespass.
 The one trespass led to many sins, the one free gift brought de-
liverance and victory over many trespasses. The glory of God's
 grace is triumphant over all the multiplied powers of sin.
     5. The unreserved giving of Himself by Jesus Christ involved
 and included in principle• all His righteous life. The one giving
 of all things brought life and justification to all men, and it has
 ever been the privilege of all men to lay hold of them.
     6. "Much more."— We not infrequently hear persons say,
 "If I but possessed the nature Adam did before he.fell I might
 win the victory." But if we could be victorious then, we can now.
 God was to Adam no more than He is now to Adam's sons and
 daughters. Above all the abounding sin is the 'superabounding
 grace.
