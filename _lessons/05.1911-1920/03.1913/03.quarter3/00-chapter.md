                       Juuv 5, 1913
              LESSON SCRIPTURE : Joel 1 : 1-13
                         Questions
   1. When, probably, did Joel prophesy? Note 1.
   2. What came to the prophet Joel in like manner as

parted to us? 1 Thess. 2: 13. Compare 1 Peter 2: 1, 2.
    5. What class of persons are especially addressed by

    6. How many generations are mentioned? Verse 3.
Compare Ps 78: 1-7. .

are especially called upon to mourn? Joel 1: 8, 9.
Compare Joel 2: 17. Note 4.
   13. When God calls for mourning, what are the

   14. What desolated condition of the fields is here
described? Joel 1: 10-12. Note 5.
   15. What may be the experience of God's people
amid the desolations of the last days? Hab. 3 : 17, 18.
   16. What are the priests exhorted to do? What
reason is assigned for mourning? Joel 1: 13.
                               Notes
    1. There are no definite statements in the prophecy of Joel
which furnish a basis for determining with any exactness the time
when this book was written. The great subject of the prophecy
is the "day of the Lord," an expression which is repeated several
times; and although the warnings and exhortations doubtless had
an application to the people of Judah at the time when they were
written, yet, they look onward to the events connected with the day
of the Lord. It seems altogether probable that Joel prophesied
toward the end of the kingdom of Judah, when the destruction of
Jerusalem and the Babylonish captivity were impending events.
They would then serve as a sort of background for that complete
destruction which awaits unrepentant sinners at the end of the
world.
    2. "Drunkards often stand as representing all self-indulgent
sinners."—"The Biblical Museum," volume 9, comments on Joel
1:5-7.
    3. God's people are compared tea vineyard. Isa. 5:1-7. They
are branches of the true Vine. John 15:5. The awful desolations
of a nation hostile to God's people are here vividly portrayed.
    4. " 'Virgin' is a very improper version here. The original
. . . signifies a young woman or bride."—"Clarke's Com-
mentary."
    "Some of the priests would piously lament the suspension of
sacred ordinances on so melancholy an occasion, the rest would
naturally mourn over the diminution of their revenue."— Scott's
Comments on Joel 1:9.
    5. While the judgments here described have no doubt an appli-
cation to that time, "they are written for our admonition, upon
whom the ends of the world are come" (1 Cor. 10:11), and, like
the prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, have an
application to the closing scenes of the last days. We should
keep this point before us in the study of this prophecy.
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5

   "In the plague that follows [the fourth plague, Rev. 16:8],,
power is given to the sun 'to scorch men with fire. And me),:it,,wele
scorched with great heat.' The prophets thus describe the condi-
tion of the earth at this fearful time: 'The land mourneth; . . .
because the harvest of the field is perished.' All thd trees of. the
field are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons
of men.' The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are
laid desolate.'    How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle
are perplexed, because they have no pasture. . . . The rivers of
waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of
the wilderness.' 'The songs of the temple shall be howlings in
that day, saith the Lord God: there shall be many dead bodies in
every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.' "—"Great
Controversy," page 628.
    "We are so dependent upon God in everything, that no human
wisdom or power can provide plenty, when He pleases to send
scarcity; without His rain, the seed-corn must perish, the trees of
the field must wither, and all our temporal joys must sicken and
die; and such judgments are emblems of the great day of retri-
bution, which will soon come as a destruction from the Almighty."
—"Scott's Commentary" on Joel 1:8-20.

                              Notes
    1. Sanctify—"To set apart as holy or for holy purposes; con-
secrate; hallow; as the Sabbath was sanctified by God."—" Stand-
ard Dictionary."
     2. "Whither should we go but to Him from whom the judg-
ment we dread comes? There is no fleeing from Him but by fleeing
to Him; no escaping destruction from the Almighty but by ma-
king our submission and supplication to the Almighty. This is
taking hold of His strength that we may make peace."— Matthew
Henry.
     We have here a picture of the doom which overshadows the
world as the coming of the Lord draws nigh. The call to "cry
unto the Lord" should not be passed by lightly. Read Zeph. 2:1-3.
     3. "It is just with God to take away those comforts which
are abused to luxury and excess, to recover the corn and wine
which are prepared for Baal, which are made the food and fuel
of a base lust. And to them endowments of that kind are most
grievous. The more men place their happiness in the gratifications
of sense, the more pressing temporal afflictions are upon them.
The drinke rs of water needed not to care when the vine was laid
waste, they could live as well without it as they had done; it was
no trouble for the Nazarites; but the drinkers of wine will weep
and howl. The more delights we make necessary to our satisfac-
tion, the more we expose ourselves to trouble and disappointment."
— Matthew Henry.
     4. As the sounding of the trumpet anciently was a signal for
the chosen people of God to move on together toward the land of
promise, so now the call to "blow the trumpet" is a call to the
people of God to make a mighty forward movement through all
 the earth with 'a warning message so solemn and terrible that
all the inhabitants of the world should tremble.
     5. The expression, " There hath not been ever the like," is
 rendered in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testa-
 ment from which the New Testament writers quoted so extensively,
"There hath not been forever the like." This will indicate the
 accepted, or correct, usage of the term "forever." It may refer
 to a limited time, and that time be entirely in the past. Like
 instances are to be found in Ezra 4:15, 19, where the expression
 "of old time" is rendered in the Greek, forever; also in Ps.
143:3, where the expression "those that have been long dead" is
 translated "those that have been dead forever."
     6. "Not paleness, which may be occasioned by sickness, or
 fainting, or slighter terror; but blackness, like that of the coun-
 tenance of those who are expiring in convulsions, or whose blood
 is suspended from circulation by some inward or outward violence.
 The extremity of horror and anguish is intended."— Scott's Notes
 on Joel 2:6.

                                Notes
     1. "What will the outward expressions of sorrow avail, if the
inward impressions be not agreeable," "When the heart is rent
for sin, and rent from it, then it is prepared to turn entirely to
God."— Matthew Henry.
     2. "It was needful that men should be awakened to their
danger; that they should be roused to prepare for the solemn
events connected with the close of probation. The prophet of God
declares: 'The day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and
who can abide,' . . .
  /"In view of that great day the word of God, in the most solemn
and impressive language, calls upon His people to arouse from
their spiritual lethargy, and to seek His face with repentance
and humiliation': 'Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an
alarm in My holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land
tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand.'
'Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: gather the people, sanc-
tify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children:
 . . . let, the bridegroom go forth of his hamber, and the bride
 out of her closet. Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep
 between the porch and the altar.' Turn ye even to Me with all
your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourn-
ing: and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto
 the Lord your God: for He is gracious and merciful, slow to
 anger, and of great kindness.'
      "To prepare a people to stand in the day of God, a great work
 of reform was to be accomplished. God saw that many of His
 professed people were not building for eternity, and in His mercy
 He was about to send a message of warning to arouse them from
 their stupor, and lead them to make ready for the coming of the
 Lord."—"Great Controversy," pages 310, 311.
      "Let the servants of the Lord weep between the porch and
 the altar, crying, 'Spare Thy people, 0 Lord, and give not Thine
10           SABBATH-SCHOOU LESSON QUARTERLY

heritage to reproach.' God has always wrought for His people
in their greatest extremity, when there seemed the least hope that
ruin could be averted. The designs of wicked men, the enemies
of the church, are subject to His power and overruling providence.
He can move upon the hearts of statesmen; the wrath of the tur-
bulent and disaffected, the haters of God, His truth, and His
people, can be turned aside, even as the rivers of water are
turned, if He orders it thus. Prayer moves the arm of Omnip-
otence. He who marshals the stars in order in the heavens, whose
word controls the waves of the great deep,—the same infinite
Creator will work in behalf of His people if they call upon Him
in faith. He will restrain the forces of darkness, until the warn-
ing is given to the world, and all who will heed it are prepared
for the conflict."—" Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, pages
452, 453.
    "I was shown the people of God, and saw them mightily
shaken. Some, with strong faith and agonizing cries, were plead-
ing with God. Their countenances were pale, and marked with
deep anxiety, expregsive of their internal struggle. Firmness and
great earnestness were expressed in their countenances, while
large drops of perspiration fell from their foreheads. Now and
then their faces would light up with the marks of God's appro-
bation, and again the same solemn, earnest, anxious look would
settle upon them."—Id., volume 1, pages 179, 180.
    " The priests and rulers were again, and more particularly and
earnestly, excited to announce the observance of a solemn fast,
to be kept as a holy day to the Lord. Let them convene the
congregation of Israel into the courts of the temple, and prepare
the people, by external purifications and proper instructions, for
the profitabl
           e solemnizing of the day..- Not only the elders and
the grown people, but even the children and the sucking infants,
must be present, as a part of the congregation, and that the con-
sideration of the calamities in which they would be involved, might
more affect the minds of their parents. Newly married persons,
forgetful of the concerns and satisfactions peculiar to their situa-
tion, must be wholly engaged in the public humiliation and lamen-
tation of their people. /The priests, as the ministers of God, were
to take the lead; and standing between the porch of the temple
and the altar of burnt offering, where they might most conven-
iently be seen and heard, they were required to weep for the sins
and troubles of the nation, and to beseech the Lord to spare His
people and heritage, though deserving of punishment."— Scott's
Comments on Joel 2 :15-17.
   3. The words "zeal" and "jealousy" are both translated by
the same word in the Septuagint and German versions. And, as
will be seen by Consulting the dictionary, they are both derived
from the some original word. This will help us to understand
better the meaning of the word "jealous."

                              Notes
    1. The Septuagint version, latter part of verse 23, reads, "And
He will rain on you the early and the latter rain as formerly."
With this the German translation also agrees. It will be noticed
that the word "month" is a supplied word.
    2. "As the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of the
Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing
of the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given at its
close, for the ripening of the harvest. 'Then shall we know, if
we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is prepared as
the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter
and former rain unto the earth.' 'Be glad then, ye children of
Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for He hath given you
the former rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for
you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain.' In the last
days, saith God, I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.' And
it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the
Lord shall be saved.' The great work of the gospel is not to close
with less manifestation of the power of God than marked, its
opening. The prophecies which were fulfilled in the outpouring
of the former rain at the opening of the gospel, are again to be

fulfilled in the latter rain at its close/ Here are 'the times of
refreshing' to which the apostle Peter looked forward when he
said, 'Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may
be blotted out [in the investigative judgment] when the times of
refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He
shall send Jesus.'    "
    "Servants of God, with faces lighted up and shining with holy
consecration, will hasten from pla‘ce to place to proclaim the mes-
sage from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the
warning will be given."—"Great Controversy," pages 611, 612.
    "Let Christians put away their dissensions, and give them-
selves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them in faith ask
for the Messing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit
in apostolic days was the 'former rain,' and glorious was the
result. But the 'latter rain' will be more abundant.
    "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God, will be
constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental
power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their com-
mand. Christ gives them the breath, of His own spirit, the life
of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies
to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and mul-
tiplies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature
comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls."—"Desire
of Ages," page 827.
   3. "The locusts in Languedoc were about an inch in length,
and of a gray color. The earth in some places was covered four
inches thick with them in the morning, before the heat of the sun
was considerable; but as soon as it began to grow hot, they took
wing, and fell upon the corn, eating up both leaf and ear; and
that with such expedition, by reason of their number, that in three
hours they would devour a whole field. After which they again
took wing, and their swarms were so thick that they covered the
sun like a cloud, and were whole hours in passing. After having
eaten up the corn they fell upon the vines, the pulse the willows,
and even the hemp, notwithstanding its great bitterness."—
"Scott's Commentary."
    4. From this prediction, it is plainly to be seen that it was
the design of God that in the last days the gift of prophecy, as
well as other gifts, should be in the church. When the Saviour
ascended to heaven, instead of taking away from the church the
spiritual gifts it then possessed, He "gave gifts unto men," thus
increasing the supply. Eph. 4:8-13. The gift of the Spirit of
prophecy, which is the testimony of Jesus, has been exercised in
the remnant church. Rev. 12:17; 19:10.
   "Then the glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the
uttermost bounds of the inhabited world. The church beheld con-
verts flocking to her from all directions. Believers were recon-
verted. Sinners united with Christians in seeking the pearl of
14          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

great price. The prophecy was fulfilled, The weak shall be 'as
David, and the house of David 'as the angel of the Lord.' Every
Christian saw in his brother the divine similitude of benevolence
and love. One interest prevailed. One object swallowed up all
others. All hearts beat in harmony. The only ambition of the
believers was to reveal the likeness of Christ's character, and to
labor for the enlargement of His kingdom. 'The multitude of
them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. . . . With
great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the
Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.' And the Lord
added to the church daily such as should be saved.' The Spirit
of Christ animated the whole congregation; for they h.kd found
the pearl of great price.
   "These scenes are to be repeated, and with greater power.
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost was
the former rain, but the latter rain will be more abundant. The
Spirit awaits our demand and reception. Christ is again to be
revealed in His fulness by the Holy Spirit's power."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," pages 120y 121.
     5. Concerning the signs to be seen in the heavenly bodies as
signs of the end, note the following historical evidences:
                              THE SUN
     "I refer to the dark day of A.D. 1780, May 19. That was a
day of supernatural darkness. It was not an eclipse of the sun,
for the moon was nearly at the full; it was not owing to a thick-
ness of the atmosphere, for the stars were seen. The darkness
began about 9 A.M., and continued through the day. Such was the
darkness that work was suspended in the field and shop, beasts
and fowls retired to their rest, and the houses were illuminated
at dinner-time. . . . The sun was supernaturally darkened."—
Josiah Litch in "Prophetic Expositor."
     "The dark day, May 19, 1780, so called on account of a re-
markable darkness on that day, extended all over New England.
. . . The true cause of this remarkable phenomenon is not
known."—"Webster's Dictionary," edition 1869.
    "The 19th of May, 1780, was unprecedented in New England
for its great darkness. . . . The darkness extended over several
thousand square miles, though differing much in intensity in
different places. Nowhere, perhaps, was it greater than in this
vicinity. The day was appropriately called and is still known as
`THE DARK DAY.' "- From "History of the Town of Hampton,
New Hampshire," by Joseph Dorr, Salem, Massachusetts, printed
by the Salem Press and Printing Company, 1893, volume 1, page
217. (Boston Public Library.)
     "There appears to have been absence of clouds for the most
part, though light rain occurred. Though known as the 'Black
             SABBATH-SCHOOIJ LESSON QUARTERLY                   15
 Friday of New England,' the area covered by darkness also ex-
 tended west of that section."—"Encyclopedia Americana," the
 Americana Company, New York, 1903, article "Dark Day."
                             THE MOON
     " The darkness of the following evening was probably as deep
 and dense as ever had been observed since the Almighty first gave
 birth to light; it wanted only palpability to render it as ex-
 traordinary as that which overspread the land of Egypt in the
 days of Moses. If every luminous body in the universe had been
 shrouded in impenetrable shades, or struck out of existence, it was
 thought the darkness could not have been more complete. A sheet
 of white paper, held within a few inches of the eyes, was equally
 invisible with the blackest velvet."— Article by R. M. Devens,
 "Our First Century," 1776-1876; "Great and Memorable
 Events," pages 89-96. (Boston Public Library.)
                             THE STARS
     "Compared with the splendors of this celestial exhibition, the
 most brilliant rockets and fireworks of art bore less relation than
.the twinkling of the most tiny star to the broad glare of the sun.
 The whole heavens seemed in motion, and little need have been
 borrowed from the morbid sensibility, to imagine that the opening
 of the sixth seal was indeed at hand when the stars of heaven fell
 unto the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when
 she is shaken of a mighty wind. Never before has it fallen to our
 lot to observe a phenomenon so magnificent and sublime."— New
 York "Commercial Advertiser," quoted in the "Eastern Argus"
 (Portland, Maine) of November 18, 1833.
     "We pronounce the raining fire which we saw on Wednesday
 morning last an awful type — a sure forerunner — a merciful
 sign of that great and dreadful day which the inhabitants of the
 earth will witness when the sixth seal shall be opened.
     "That time is just at hand described not only in the New
 Testament but in the Old; and a more correct picture of a fig-tree
 casting its leaves when blown by a mighty wind, it was not pos-
 sible to behold.
     "Many things now occurring upon the earth tend to convince
 us that we are in the 'latter days.' This exhibition we deem to be
 a type of an awful day fast hurrying upon us. This is our
 sincere opinion; and what we think, we are not ashamed to, tell."
  — The "Old Countryman," New York, printed in the New York
 "Star," and quoted in the Portland "Evening Advertiser," No-
 vember 26, 1833. (Portland Public Library.)

1, 2. Note 6.
   17. Of what will the "peace and safety" cry be a
sign? 1 Thess. 5: 3. Note 7.
                              Notes
   1. "The following prophecy relates to the latter times of the
world. . . . Since all nations are summoned to answer the im-
peachment here mentioned, we may suppose the word 'Israel' to
comprehend the faithful of all ages; and then we may observe
that the judgments denounced against the church's enemies, are
chiefly for their hatred and cruelty against His servants."—
Scott.
   2. ''The enemies of the Jews took them captives and enslaved
them. Yet they valued them so little that they made them the
stake in games of chance; nay, they used to sell a boy or girl
into perpetual bondage, for the hire of a harlot, or for wine to
make them drunk."— Scott.
   3. The term "Philistines" occurs in Joel 3:4 instead of "Pal-
estine," in the Septuagint and the German version.
18           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   4. This is the earliest inspired mention we have of the Gre-
cians, with whom the people of God afterward became so closely
associated. The Sabeans are mentioned in Job 1:15 as the people
who, more than seven centuries before the time of Joel, robbed
the patriarch of his herds, and cruelly murdered his servants. In
the German version they are said to be from Arabia.
   "There are no events recorded in history, that entirely cor-
respond with these predictions; perhaps the ruin of the pagan
Roman Empire, which had destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed the
Jews, might be adverted to; but the grand accomplishment seems
to be in futurity, and the event alone can fully clear them up."
— Scott's Comments.
    5. The Septuagint and the German version read Sanctify war;
and as will be seen by the marginal reading of the Revised Ver-
sion, this is the meaning of the Hebrew original.
    6. As is indicated by the marginal dates, Isaiah and Micah
prophesied later than Joel. This declaration from the mouth of
the Lord telling the world war was coming was given about one
half a century before we were told concerning the false predic-
tion of peace and safety that the people, the nations, would make
while the most gigantic preparations for war are being made. The
warlike preparation of the nations to-day is on so vast a scale
that it can not be adequately expressed in figures. Navies and
standing armies are being increased more rapidly than ever before.
The nations are waking up and preparing for war. The world is
one vast arsenal, and none can tell when a spark will be kindled
that will result in an international explosion. All about us we
see evidences that the time foretold by the prophet Joel is at hand.
   7. The cry of peace, safety, and stability of the things around
us is of itself a striking sign that the end is near. The people are
crying peace,— the settlement of national disputes by arbitration.
But the preparation for slaughter goes on, and the mustering for
Armageddon is heard.

                            Questions
  1. In the warlike preparations, what will the nations

be the condition of Jerusalem? Who will then be ex-
cluded? Joel 3 : 17.
    10. When will this blessed state of things be realized?
Rev. 21 : 10, 23-27 ; Isa. 52 :1.
    11. How is the redeemed condition of the world
further described? Joel 3: 18. Compare Rev. 22 : 1, 2.
    12. Why were Egypt and Edom desolated? Joel
3 : 19.
    13. How long will God's people dwell in their land?

   14. How thorough will be the work of cleansing ac-
complished? Joel 3 : 21. Compare Eze. 36 : 25, 26.
   15. When will God avenge His elect? Luke 18 :
7, 8. Note 5.
                              Notes
    1. The words "nations," "gentiles," and "heathen," as
found in Joel 3:2, 9, 11, are the same word in the Septuagint,
the French, and the German version, and are all translated na-
tions" in the Revised Version, and have reference to those nations
outside of Judea, or of God's people.
    The Valley of Jehoshaphat is "a valley mentioned by Joel
only, as the spot in which, after the return of Judah and Jeru-
salem from captivity, Jehovah would gather all the heathen (Joel
3:2), and would there sit to judge them for their misdeeds to
Israel (Joel 3:12). For many centuries the name has been given
to the deep ravine which separates Jerusalem from the Mount of
Olives. Both Moslems and Jews believe that the last judgment
is to take place there."—"A Concise Cyclopedia of Religious
Knowledge."
     2. ''Valley of• decision" is rendered in the Septuagint "valley
 of judgment." The German translation is the same, the valley of
 judgment.
     3. "December 16, 1848, the Lord gave me a view of the
 shaking of the powers of the heavens. I saw that when the Lord
 said 'heaven' in giving the signs recorded by Matthew, Mark, and
 Luke, He meant heaven, and when He said 'earth' He meant
 earth. The powers of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars. They
 rule in the heavens. The powers of earth are those who rule on
 the earth. The powers of heaven will be shaken at the voice of
 God. Then the sun, moon, and stars will be moved out of their
 places. They will not pass away, but be shaken by the voice of
God."—"Early Writings."
    4. "But amid the tempest of divine judgment, the children of
 God will have no cause for fear. 'The Lord will be the hope
of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.' The
day that brings terror and destruction to the transgressors of
God's law, will bring to the obedient, 'joy unspeakable, and full
of glory.' 'Gather My saints together unto Me,' saith the Lord,
'those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice. And
the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God is judge
Himself.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 341.
    "An earthquake marked the hour when Christ laid down His
life, and another earthquake witnessed the moment when He took
it up in triumph. He who had vanquished death and the grave
came forth from the tomb with the tread of a conqueror, amid
the reeling of the earth, the flashing of lightning, and the roaring
of thunder. When He shall come to the earth again, He will
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     21
shake 'not the earth only, but also heaven.'         The earth shall
reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a
cottage.' 'The heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; "the
elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the
works that are therein, shall be burned up.' But 'the Lord will
be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of
Israel.'' '—"Desire of Ages," page 780.
   "Soon I heard the voice of God which shook the heavens and
the earth. There was a mighty earthquake. Buildings were shaken
down, and fell on every side. I then heard a triumphant shout of
victory, loud, musical, and clear. I looked upon this company,
who, a short time before, were in such distress and bondage.
Their captivity was turned. A glorious light shone upon them.
How beautiful they then looked! All weariness and marks of
care were gone; health and beauty were seen in every countenance.
Their enemies, the heathen around them, fell like dead men. They
could not endure the light that shone upon the delivered, holy
ones. This light and glory remained upon them until Jesus was
seen in the clouds of heaven, and the faithful, tried company were
changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, from glory to
glory. The graves were opened and the saints came forth, clothed
with immortality, crying, 'Victory over death and the grave!' and
together with the living saints they were caught up to meet their
Lord in the air, while rich, musical shouts of glory and victory
proceeded from every immortal tongue."—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 1, page 184.
   5. The last verse of Joel's prophecy reads thus in the Septua-
gint version: ''And I will make inquisition for their blood, and
will by no means leave it unavenged: and the Lord shall dwell in
Zion." With this agrees the German translation: "And I will
not leave their blood unavenged." Thus the question, "Shall not
God avenge His own elect?" as propounded by our Lord, the
repetition of which was heard by the seer of Patmos, "How long,
O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood
on them that dwell on the earth'!" finds its answer in advance.
Glorious clay of deliverance from sin and Satan!

               Lessons on the Book of Titus
                        Introductory Note
    "It is remarkable that Titus, of whom the apostle repeatedly
speaks in terms of the highest approbation and most cordial affec-
tion in his epistles, is not once mentioned in the Acts of the
Apostles. Nor is anything recorded concerning St. Paul's labors
in Crete, now called Candia, a large island in the Mediterranean
Sea. It is indeed probable that the gospel was made known there
at an early period, as there were Cretes present on the day of Pen-
tecost, to witness the stupendous miracles of that day, and to hear
the unanswerable sermon of St. Peter on that wonderful ()session.
22           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 . . . But no information is given us of what passed in that island
at that time, or afterwards, except as this epistle shows that St.
Paul had labored there with great success. Probably this was
subsequent to his first imprisonment at Rome, and before his
second. He seems to have had very great success in his ministry
in that island, but by some means to have been hurried thence
before he could order the state of the churches in a regular manner.
He therefore left Titus there, to settle the churches in the several
cities of the island according to the apostolical plan in other
places. . . . The postscript states that the epistle was written
from Nicopolis in. Macedonia; but had this been the ease, the
apostle would have said,       have determined here to winter,' not,
`there to winter.' "— Scott's Commentary.
      The island of Crete is about 150 miles long and from 7 to 36
miles wide. It is said to have had one of the most salubrious
climates in.,the world, with no ferocious beasts or poisonous rep-
 tiles. The soil was very fertile. It is supposed that it was
peopled from Palestine. In the Septuagint version we find Crete
and Cretians mentioned (Eze. 25:16; Zeph. 2:5, 6) as associated
with the Philistines. Hence it is understood that people from that
section of country carried the name with them in migrating to
                                                   Crete became one
that island. It is stated by Adam Clarke that "Crete
of the most celebrated republics in antiquity." In 1645 it was
attacked by a force of 60,000 Turks. The Cretes, with an army
of less than one tenth that number, held out so tenaciously that
it took thirty years to subdue them fully, with a loss to the Turks
of 200,000 men. Since then it has been under Turkish rule.
Crete was called the island of one hundred cities. There must
consequently have been a large number of churches there.
     " This epistle seems to have been dispatched from Ephesus at
the moment when St. Paul was on the eve of departure on a west-
ward journey, which was to take him as far as Nicopolis (in
Epirus) before winter."—"Life and Epistles of Paul," Cony-
beare and Howson, People's Edition, page 879.

 The former was his general character, the latter his special em-
 ployment. His apostolical office accorded with the faith of God's
 elect, and was intended to bring numbers to believe in Christ.
      2. The marginal reading for "wanting," is "left undone."
 Rather than do anything prematurely himself, the apostle would
 prefer to leave important matters for others less competent, per-
 haps, than himself to perform. In this is an example worthy of
 imitation.
      That the office of "elder" is the same as that of "bishop"
 may be seen by comparing 1 Tim. 3:1-7 with Titus 1:5-9. The
 correct meaning of the term "bishop" may be seen by reference
 to the marginal reading of these passages as given in the Revised
 Version, where the word "overseer" is substituted for "bishop."
 That the elder is an overseer is shown by 1 Peter 5:1, 2, where
 it is stated that he is to take the oversight of the flock, or church.
\ The terms "oversight" and "bishop" are derived from the same
 word.
      3. In a note on this verse "Conybeare and Howson" says,
 "Not simply 'set in order,' but set in order farther." Paul no
 doubt, so far as time had permitted, established order and system
 among the churches here, but desiring that this work should be
 perfected, left Titus to finish the work. It was the aim of the
 great apostle, not alone in Crete, but everywhere, to leave order
 and perfect organization behind him.
     4. The definition of the Greek word here rendered "striker"
 is a "quarrelsome person; a disputer, fighter, railer." Rother-
 ham renders the expression "no striker," "not ready to wound."
 It is thought by some to have reference to the matter of striking
 hands for debts, or becoming surety for other persons, as con-
 demned by such passages as Prov. 17:18; 22:26.
     5. The gainsayers, or as most versions have it, the contra-
 dictors, or opposers. How necessary that those holding respon-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      25
sible positions in the church be able to show the difference between
truth and error!
  " The same principles of piety and justice that were to guide
the rulers among God's people in the time of Moses and David,
were also to be followed by those given the oversight of the newly
organized church of God in the gospel dispensation. In the work
of setting things in order in all the churches, and ordaining suit-
able men to act as officers, the apostles held to the high standards
of leadership outlined in the Old Testament Scriptures. They
maintained that he who is called to stand in a position of lead-
ing responsibility in the church, 'must be blameless, as the steward
of God.' "—"Acts of the Apostles," page 95.

                                Notes
   1. The apostle uses strong language, and paints a dark picture
of the defiling power of an unsanctified tongue. That which can
kindle the "fire of hell" in the family, the church, and the neigh-
borhood, by talebearing, tattling, gossiping, and backbiting, is a
thing to be dreaded as we would dread a plague or a pestilence.
    "Naturalists tell us that the snail has its teeth on its tongue,
and that upon the tongues of some snails as many as thirty thou-
sand teeth have been found. The snail rolls its tongue up like a
ribbon, and, of course, its teeth are very small, but they saw
through the toughest leaves with ease. There are some men and
women who have teeth on their tongues, and are ever ready to use
them. There are pillows wet with tears, and eyes red with weep-
ing, and hearts broken, and homes ruined, and lives blasted, all
because of the unbridled human tongue. And the devil has no
more remorseless instrument of torture at his hand than the tongue
of the gossip, the backbiter, or the slanderer. Shame to say,
some professing Christians become the ready tools of Satan, and
bring disgrace upon their Master 's name, and keep many a soul
out of the kingdom."—"The Victory Life," pages 47, 48.
   2. The same power that stopped the mouths of lions (Dan.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    27
6:22; Heb. 11 :33) can also stop the mouths of unreasonable op-
posers of the truth, who, according to the statement of the Cretian
prophet, may properly be called "evil beasts."
   3. This prophet is said to be Epimenides, who lived about B.C.
538, or at the time when Babylon was taken by Cyrus. Paul, in
this instance and at Athens, referred to heathen authors. See
Acts 17:23, 28.
    4. While Titus was instructed to "rebuke them sharply,"
Timothy was told that the servant of the Lord must be ''gentle
unto all men, . . . patient, in meekness instructing those that
oppose themselves." 2 Tim. 2:24, 25. Different dispositions and
different circumstances demand a large amount of divine wisdom
for one to know how to treat each case properly. " Of some have
compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pull-
ing them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the
flesh." Jude 22, 23.
    5. "It would seem from this that the heretics attacked taught
their followers to abstain from certain acts, or certain kinds of
food, as being impure. We must not, however, conclude from this
that they were ascetics. Superstitious abstinence from certain
material acts is quite compatible with gross impurity of teaching
and of practise, as we see in the case of Hindu devotees, and in
those impure votaries of Cybele and of Isis, mentioned so often in
Juvenal and other writers of the same date."—"Life and Epistles
of Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 881, note.

    16. How have opposers,. or adversaries, been put to
shame? Jer. 8: 9 ; Luke 13 : 17 ; Isa. 66: 5.
                             Notes
   1. The Greek word rendered "doctrine" is the same as that
translated "teaching." The expression in Matt. 15 : 9 and Mark
7:7, "teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," could
properly be read, "teaching for teachings the commandments of
men." The verb "teaching" and the noun "doctrines" are from
the same original word, one being in the form of a verb, the
other of a noun. This will be proved by reference to Rom. 12:7,
where the word elsewhere rendered "doctrine" is correctly trans-
lated "teaching."
    2. The expression "keepers at home" is rendered by some,
"keepers of the home;" by others "workers at home," which is
            SABRAg'11-SCEtOOTJ LtSSON ;WARMLY                   29
fully in accord with the original text. Such members are a great
commendation to the church, and are in striking contrast to those
thus described by Paul in 1 Tim. 5:13: "And withal they learn
to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only
idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they
ought not."
    3. "I entreat the youth for their souls' sake to heed the
exhortation of the inspired apostle. All these gracious instruc-
tions, warnings, and reproofs will be either a savor of life unto
life or of death unto death. Many of the young are reckless in
their conversation. They choose to forget that by—their words
they are to be justified or condemned. . . . The young generally
conduct themselves as though the precious hours of probation, while
mercy lingers, were one grand holiday, and they were placed in
this world merely for their own amusement, to be gratified with a
continued round of excitement. "—''Testimonies for the Church,"
volume 1, pages 499, 501.
    The word "sober" occurring in verses 2, 4, and 6 of this
lesson is from two different words in the original, the meaning of
which is given in the marginal reading by the different terms,
"vigilant," "wise,"and "discreet." The idea is not to be
associated with that expressed in Matt. 6:16 by the words "of
a sad countenance," taken from an entirely different word.
    4. "There is nothing more precious in the sight of God than
His ministers, who go forth into the waste places of the earth
to sow the seeds of truth, looking forward to the harvest. None
but Christ can measure the solicitude of His servants as they seek
for the lost. He imparts His Spirit to them, and by their efforts
souls are led to turn from sin to righteousness."— ' Acts of the
Apostles," pages 869, 370.
    5. The term "sound," used in the expressions, "sound doc-
trines," "sound speech," "sound words," so often occurring in
Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus, is rendered in 1 Tim. 6:3 by
the word "wholesome.' In such passages as Luke 7:10 it is
translated "whole" as contrasted with 'sick." The word has
the meaning of health or healthy. Sickly sentimentalism and
sound speech are radically different from each other. Adam
Clarke states that some forty different authorities render the last
word of verse 8 "us" instead of "you." This is the rendering
of the Revised Version.

Note 6.
                               Notes
    1. The word here translated "answering again" is given in
other passages as "contradicting," which is its true meaning.
The Revised Version gives the word "gainsaying." It might be
interesting to note that the word "masters" in this text is from
the Greek word "despot." But this word is, in the Septuagint,
sometimes applied to the Lord Himself, and does, not originally
mean an oppressive ruler.
     2. The expression "not purloining" is translated by Rother-
ham, "not keeping [anything] back." The French version gives
it, "not misappropriating anything that belongs to their masters."
     3. "There is a beauty and energy in the word epephane, hath
shined out ["hath appeared"], that is rarely noted. It seems
to be a metaphor taken from the sun. As by his rising in the
east and shining out, he enlightens successively the whole world;
so the Lord Jesus, who is called the Sun of Righteousness (Mal.
4:2), arises on the whole human race with healing in His wings."
— Adam Clarke.
    "The doctrine of the divine decrees, unalterably fixing the
 character of men, had led many to a virtual rejection of the law
 of God. Wesley steadfastly opposed the errors of the Antinomian
 teachers, and showed that this doctrine which led to Antinomi-
 anism was contrary to the Scriptures. ' The grace of God that
.bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men."—"Great Contro-
versy," pages 261, 262.
   Claiming that all men have not had an opportunity to be saved,
some argue for a "second probation," or "second chance," in
order that the gospel may be brought within reach of all. Such
overlook the statement in this text which says that the "grace
of God bath appeared, bringing salvation to all men." (Ameii-
can Revised Version.)
32           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   4. It may help us in getting more fully the idea of self-denial,
to notice that the original word for "deny" occurs in Heb. 11:24,
and is there translated "refused." The passage could correctly
be read, "By faith Moses . . . denied to be called the son of.
Pharaoh's daughter." For Christ's sake, he denied himself of
the throne of Egypt.
   5. The original of Titus 2:13 reads thus: "Looking for the
blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of the great God, and
our Saviour Jesus Christ." See also Revised Version. The Sa-
viour, when He comes to gather home His people, will come in all
the glory of the Father, the Son, and the angels. Luke 9:26.
    6. Paul gives the same exhortation to Timothy as to Titus to
let no man despise him, and he tells Timothy how to do this.
It is by taking such a commendable course as to live above re-
proach. "Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example
of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
faith, in purity." When teachers of religion dishonor their pro-
fession by doing the things against which they warn others, they
may expect to be despised. These young apostles were liable not
to be fully appreciated; so Paul wrote the church, concerning this
matter, that they should not despise young workers who were doing
the work of the Lord the same as the older veterans.
    "Does any man inquire what is the duty of a gospel minister'?
Send him to the second chapter of the epistle to Titus for a com-
plete answer. There he will find what he is to believe, what he
is to practise, and what he is to preach. Even his congregation
is parceled out to him. The old and the young of both sexes,
and those who are in their employment, are considered to be the
objects of his ministry; and a plan of teaching in reference to
those different descriptions of society is laid down before him."
— Adam Clarke.

34           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   16. When and how was this hope of eternal life
given to us? Titus 1: 2; 2 Tim. 1: 1.
   17. How sure is this hope'? What is it to us?
Heb. 6: 18-20.
                               Notes
    1. As noted by some Bible students, the original of the ex-
pression "Put them in mind," used in this verse, is etiuivalent to
the one found in John 14:26, where it is stated tha
                                                 t the Comforter
would "bring all things to your remembrance" that Christ had
spoken; making it evident 'that Paul had amply instructed the
Cretian believers on the subject of civil government while he was
with them, and Titus was to call their attention to what the
apostle had taught them.
    2. "We are to recognize human government as an ordinance
of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty,
within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with
the claims of God, we must obey God rather than man. God's
word must be recognized as above all human legislation. A 'Thus
saith the Lord' is not to be set aside for a Thus saith the church'
or a Thus saith the state.' The crown of Christ is to be lifted
above the diadems of earthly potentates.
    "We are not required to defy,authorities. Our words, whether
spoken or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place
ourselves on record as uttering that which would make us appear
antagonistic to law and order. We are not to say or, do anything
that would unnecessarily close up our way."—"Acts of the Apos-
tles," page 69.
    "We would also humbly represent that the only proper objects
of civil government are the happiness and protection of men in
the present state of existence; the security of the life, liberty,
and property of the citizens; and to restrain the vicious and to
encourage the virtuous by wholesome laws equally extended to
every individual: but the duty that we owe to our Creator, and
the manner of discharging it, can only be directed by reason and
conviction, and is nowhere cognizable but at the tribunal of the
universal Judge. To judge for ourselves, and to engage in the
exercise of religion agreeably to the dictates of our own con-
science, is an inalienable right, which, upon the principles on
Which the gospel was first propagated, and the reformation from
popery carried on, can never be transferred to another."— From
Memorial of the Presbytery of Hanover to the General Assembly
of Virginia, quoted in "American State Papers," page 94.
    3. The martyrs who were tortured in so many inhuman ways,
and who died at the stake, were condemned by the "laws of the
land" where they had lived. Concerning Jesus the Jews said,
"We have a law, and by our law He ought to die."
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    35

    4. The word translated "sometimes" in the text and "once"
in the American Revised Version, in harmony with former usage,
here means formerly. We are to consider not only what manner
of persons we ought to be, but also what manner of persons we
used to be.
    5. "Righteousness conies before holiness in the order of re-
demption, the one being imputed to us on the ground of our faith,
and the other being imparted to us by the operation of the Holy
Spirit."—"The Twofold Life," page 129.
    Concerning the word in verse 5 translated "washing," "Cony-
beare and Howson" says, "The word does not mean washing
but layer • i.e., a vessel in which washing takes place." The
Revised Version gives "laver" in the margin.
    6. Regeneration is twice mentioned in the Scriptures (Matt.
19:28; Titus 3:5), and is twofold in its nature. The first re-
generating act is the spiritual new birth, as mentioned in 1 Peter
1:23, where the idea of being generated again is presented in the
original. The second regeneration is when all things are gener-
ated, or created anew, and the new heavens and new earth appear.
This is the event to which our Lord refers in Matt. 19:28.

                               Notes
    1. "Beeping the commandments of God requires of us good
works, self-denial, self-sacrifice, and devotion for the good of
others; not that our good works alone can save us, but that we
surely can not be saved without good works. After we have done
all that we are capable of doing, we are then to say, We have done
no more than our duty, and at best are unprofitable servants, un-
worthy of the smallest favor from God. Christ must be our right-
eousness, and the crown of our rejoicing."—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 3, page 526.
    "Some may say it is exalting our own merits to expect favor
from God through our good works. True, we can not buy one
victory with our good works; yet we can not be victors without
them. The purchase which Christ recommends to us is only com-
plying with the conditions He has given us. True grace, which
is of inestimable value, and which will endure the test of trial
and adversity, is only obtained through faith, and humble, prayer-
ful obedience."— Id., volume 4, page 89.
    "You may believe all the truth, yet if its principles are not
carried out in your lives, your profession will not save you. Satan
believes and trembles. He works. He knows his time is short,
and he has come down in great power to do his evil works accord-
ing to his faith. But God's professed people do not support their
            SABBATH-SCHOOli LESSON QUARTERLY                   37
faith by their works. They believe in the shortness of time, yet
grasp just as eagerly after this world's goods as though the world
was to stand a thousand years as it now is."—Id., volume 2,
page 161.
    2 The law mentioned by Paul in Rom. 7:12, 14, is spiritual
and holy, "and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
That which is holy, just, good, and spiritual must be moral, hence
the designation ''moral law." The law referred to by him in
Eph. 2:15 and Heb. 9:10 is one of carnal ordinances, or rites,
or ceremonies. (Marginal reading.) A law that consists of rites
and ceremonies is very properly called a ritual or ceremonial laW.
That is evidently the law referred to in Titus 3:9.
    3. We have here the only instance in which the word "her-
etic" occurs in the Bible. The term "heresy" is found in a
few passages. But those holding or teaching unscriptural doc-
trines (heretics) are merely to be avoided. Rom. 16:17. Nothing
whatever is said about inflicting upon them any other punishment
than to part company with them.
    4. The subject of ''good works" is especially emphasized in
this epistle. Titus was to be "a pattern of good works." God
will have "a people zealous of good works," and it is stated ,that
we should learn to "maintain good works." The marginal read-
ing in Titus 3:14 is "profess honest trades." Every one should
have some useful occupation. This is for the purpose of meeting
the temporal needs of ourselves and, others. Our Father knows
we have need of these things, and will "add" them to us„ but
we must work to help provide them.
    5. "We see, from the above letter, that Titus was desired to
join St. Paul at Nicopolis, where the apostle designed to winter.
We learn from an incidental notice elsewhere, that the route he
pursued was from Ephesus to Miletus, where his old companion
Trophimus remained behind from sickness, and thence to Corinth,
where he left Erastus, the former treasurer of that city, whom,
perhaps, he had expected, or wished, to accompany him in his
farther progress. The position of Nicopolis would render it a
good center for operating upon the surrounding province; and
thence St. Paul might make excursions to those churches of Illyr-
icum which lie perhaps founded himself at an earlier period. The
 city which was thus chosen as the last scene of the apostle's
labors, before his final imprisonment, is more celebrated for its
origin than for its subsequent history. It was founded by Au-
gustus, as a permanent memorial of the victory of Actium, and
stood upon the site of the camp occupied by his land forces bfore
that battle."—"Life and Epistles of St. Paul," Conyb.eare and
Howson, People's Edition, page 884.
