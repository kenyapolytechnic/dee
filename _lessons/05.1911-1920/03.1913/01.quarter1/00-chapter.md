nize the need of this creative work? Ps. 51: 10.
    20. In what way will the curse be removed from the
earth? Isa. 65 : 17. Compare 2 Peter 3 : 13.
    21. To whom should those in trouble commit their
souls? 1 Peter 4 : 19. Note 4.
                                Notes
   1. In the first chapter of the Bible, God is revealed as the Cre-
ator. The test by which the true God may be known is here fur-
nished, and the foundation is laid for the true gospel. This record
of the creative work was not introduced into the Scriptures in
order to teach physical science, but because redemption is a work
of creation, and only He who created the heavens and the earth,
and man in His image, in the first place, can create a new man in
Christ Jesus, and new heavens and a new earth. That hope which
rests upon any other basis is a false hope.
    2. The gospel of the restoration which is proclaimed in Isaiah,
chapters 40-66, opens with an appeal to God as the Creator, re-
peats this appeal many times, and closes with the prophecy of
the creation of the new heavens and the new earth. It fully sets
forth the gospel of the re-creation.

    3. The fact that salvation from sin can be accomplished only
through a new creation, is fully recognized in the New Testament;
and in the closing part of the last book, a description is given
of the new heavens and the new earth, and the new Jerusalem.
    4. He alone can save and deliver who can create, and there-
fore believers should find encouragement in contemplating the
creative works of God, and should put their confidence in the
Creator alone. No created being can save the soul from death or
send deliverance in time of trouble.

    20. Who is the one Mediator? 1 Tim. 2 : 5. Note 3.
                              Notes
   1. " The Lord possessed Me as the beginning of His way."
In all the creative work, "I was by Him, as a master workman."
Prov. 8 : 22, 30, R. V., margin. The eternal Son, the Wisdom of
God (1 Cor. 1:24), was the channel through which every revela-
tion of God was made, and the agent through whom the Father
wrought in all His working. He was thus the Mediator between
the Father and all that is, using the word "mediator" in its
broad sense as meaning "one who is a means of intercourse be-
tween two other parties, and through whom action passes from'
either to other." It thus appears that the mediation of Christ
grew out of the very nature of His being and His relation to the
Father as the eternal Son; and the great truth that it was
through the mediation of the Son that God wrought in the orig-
inal creation, when all things were brought into being, becomes
the pillar and ground of the central principle of the gospel —
the mediatorial principle.
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      7
      2. The gospel provision for mediation in behalf of man after
 sin had entered into the world, did not require the introduction
 of a new principle into the divine administration, but simply a
 new application of a principle already in operation. "The re-
.striction of the thought of mediatorship and sacrifice to the gra-
 cious intervention of the eternal Son on behalf of fallen and sin-
  ful man, has narrowed and thrown out of proportion our thought
 of the dignity and glory of the Son, and of the grandeur of His
 work. Sin, of course, brings another element into worship and
 sacrifice. Sin creates a gulf between the creature and God; and
  only a mediator, a priest, can bring the creature back to God even
  when it wills to be brought, or can make atonement and satisfac-
  tion on its behalf for the injury and wrong done to the majesty
  of the supreme Lawgiver by an act of disobedience. There is a
  new need, that of expiation; and there is a greater, and to us a
  more evident, need of a mediator.
      "But the standing truth, that from the first instant of crea-
  tion there has been a Mediator between the Father and creation,
  One through whom, necessarily, creation came into being, renders
  it easier for us to apprehend alike the necessity, and (such is
  the love of God) the probability, of an atoning Mediator who
  should undo the mischief of sin; and, this being so, the impossi-
  bility that it can be any other than the uncreated Mediator,
  through whom and for whom were all things made, the eternal
  Son."—" The One Mediator," P. G. Medd, M.A., London, 1884,
   page 69.
       3. It was through the mediation of the Son of God that all
  things were brought into existence, and it is through the same
  mediation that all things are upheld. Heb. 1:3. The Son was
  and is the Mediator (in this larger sense) for all unfallen beings,
   through whom they were created and through whom they are
   sustained in life. He was the Mediator for the human family
   before sin entered into the world; and in order to carry on this
   mediation in behalf of man and restore him to fellowship with
   God, it was necessary that the Son should take' the flesh (Heb.
   2:14, 15), and thus He became the Man Christ Jesus, the Mediator
   between God and sinful man. Thus He who was the Mediator in
   the original creation, is the Mediator in the new creation; and
   the fact of the original creation is the promise of the new crea-
   tion.
       The full truth concerning the mediation of Christ, precludes
   the possibility of there being any other mediator between God
   and man, as He only can mediate in the new creation who was' the
   Mediator in the original creation. No created being can act as
   mediator for sin, and this shuts out the whole mediatorial system
   of the papacy.

       LESSON III — The Continual Mediation

    8. What rendered Christ's priesthood continual and
unchangeable?. Verse 24. Note 3.
    9. What assurance is given of the efficacy of the

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      9
   13. For the same reason, what was the showbread
declared to be? Num. 4 : 7.
   14. What is the true continual sacrifice? Heb. 10 : 12.
Note 5.
   15. Through His continual mediation, what does
Christ bestow upon His people John 10 : 28 ; Acts 2 : 33.
   16. How is this gift of life received? John 20: 30, 31.
                              Notes
    1. There is a very close connection between the working of
God in nature and His working in grace. Through the mediation
of the eternal Son, the power of God is manifested in upholding
all things and in preserving order. throughout the material uni-
verse. Were it not for the constant working of this power, there
would be chaos in the universe, and the character of God would be
impugned. Whatever names may have been given to the mani-
festation of the power of God in nature, such as "adhesion,"
"cohesion," "gravity," " gravitation," etc., it is well to remem-
ber that all things hold together in Christ, and this fact is made
the basis of confidence in the power of God to uphold all those who
put their trust in Him.
    2. Christ did not become a priest on account of the operation
of that law of the priesthood which made one a priest who was
a descendant of Aaron after the flesh, but His priesthood grew
out of "the power of an endless life," out of the eternity of His
being. He was able to swallow up death, and to minister life to
all, because He had life in Himself.
     3. While the typical service was a temporary object-lesson, and
was perverted into formalism, yet it was designed to teach the
 truths of salvation through faith in Christ, the One to whom all the
 typical ritual pointed. The experience of present salvation from
 sin was real to one who entered into that typical service in the
 spirit of it, and who exercised that faith in a personal Redeemer
 which the sanctuary service was intended to teach. It was the per-
 version of the Levitical system which interfered with the purpose
 of God in giving it to His people.
     4. "Every morning and evening a lamb of a year old was
 burned upon the altar, with its appropriate meat-offering, thus
 symbolizing the daily consecration of the nation to Jehovah, and
 their constant dependence upon the atoning blood of Christ. . . .
  The incense, ascending with the prayers of Israel, represents the
 Merits and intercession of Christ, His perfect righteousness, whieli
10          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
through faith is imputed to His people, and which can alone make
the worship of sinful beings acceptable to God. Before the veil
of the most holy place was an altar of perpetual intercession; be-
fore the holy, an altar of continual atonement. By blood and by
incense God was to be approached,— symbols pointing to the great
Mediator, through whom sinners may approach Jehovah, and
through whom alone mercy and salvation can be granted to the
repentant, believing soul."—" Patriarchs and Prophets," pages
352, 353.
    5. The mediation of Christ is a continual mediation, both in
nature and in grace, and the sacrifice which He offered was one
sacrifice which was itself continual. The phrase which is trans-
lated "forever" in Heb. 70:12 is the very same phrase which is
translated "continually" in verse one of the same chapter. The
very nature of Christ's mediation forbids the Substitution of any
human system of mediation, such as that of the papacy, in its
place; and the very nature of the one sacrifice for sin, which is
continual, renders both unnecessary and impossible such a pre-
tended sacrifice as that of the mass. Christ Himself is both priest
and sacrifice in fulfilment of all types and shadows of the Levit-
ical system, and there can now be no other.

 further described? Heb. 7 : 26. Note 3.
12 .        sA0Atit-8011Oot, LtssOic QUAlittALT
  18. In view of our having such a High Priest, to
what exhortation may we well take heed? Heb. 3: 1.
                                Notes
                            •
    1. Although the priests appointed under the Levitical system
were compassed with infirmity and subject to death, yet they served
"that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things," and
their priesthood was typical of the priesthood of the Son of God.
They did not represent any other created being, but only Him
who was made a priest "after the power of an endless life,"
even "Jesus the Son of God."
    2. Jesus did not become a priest by a merely arbitrary ap-
pointment. He could enter upon His work as priest in behalf of
sinful men because He was the eternal Son of God, and the Scrip-
ture recognized this fact by making the declaration concerning
His sonship the basis of the oath which appointed Him to the
priesthood. When the Lord declared Jesus to be His Son, He
established the basis of the priesthood.
    3. From the description given in the first chapter of the
epistle to the Hebrews, it is perfectly clear that no created being
could be "a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true taber-
nacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man." Any interpretation
of the Scriptures, therefore, which requires that some other person
than the Son of God should at any time minister in the heavenly
sanctuary, must be discarded as being untrue to the inspired ex-
planation of the typical priesthood.

14           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
                              Notes
  • 1. It is very important that we should have a clear understand-
 ing of the relation of the incarnation of Christ to His mediatorial
work. He was made priest "after the power of an endless life,"
in order that He might minister grace, mercy, and power to the
weak and erring. This is accomplished by making such a dose
 union with those needing help, that divinity and humanity are
 brought into personal relation, and the very Spirit and life of
God dwell in the flesh of the believer. In order to establish this
 relation between God and sinful flesh, it was necessary for the Son
of God to take sinful flesh; and thus was bridged the gulf which
separated sinful man from God.
     "In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to hu-
manity•by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal
 ages He is linked with us. 'God so loved the world, that He
gave His only-begotten Son.' He gave Him not only to bear our
sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race.
To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His
only-begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to
retain His human nature. This is the pledge that God will fulfil
His word. 'Unto us a Child is born; unto us a Son is given;
and the government shall be upon His shoulder.' God has adopted
human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried the same
into the highest heaven. It is the 'Son of man' who shares the
throne of the universe. It is the 'Son of man' whose name shall
be called 'Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting
Father, the Prince of Peace.' The I AM is the Daysman between
God and humanity, laying His hand upon both. He who is 'holy,
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,' is not ashamed to call
us brethren. In Christ the family of earth and the family of
heaven are bound together. Christ glorified is our brother. Heaven
is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is infolded in the bosom of
Infinite Love."—"Desire of Ages," pages 25, 26.
    By its dogma concerning the immaculate conception of the
Virgin Mary, the Roman Catholic Church gives to the Son of God
in the incarnation a "perfect human nature," and thereby sepa-
rates Him from those whom He came to save. Note this extract:
"Who can believe that, it being in the power of God the Son to
prepare a spotless holy temple wherein to dwell incarnate for nine
months, He preferred to have one which had been first profaned by
the stain of original sin?' '—`'`Catholic Belief," page 218.
    This denial of the perfect union of Christ with sinful flesh
opens the way for a series of subsidiary mediators whose duty it
is to bring the sinner into saving touch with Christ. Here is the
proof of this statement: Catholics "believe that union with Jesus
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     15
Christ is the highest and noblest aim of man, and that only the
Holy Catholic Church supplies the means for this union with
Jesus Christ"— Id., page 33.
    2. The Son of God manifested Himself in behalf of man in
ancient times, as to Abraham (Genesis 18), to Moses (Exodus 3),
to Joshua (Joshua 5:13-15), etc.; but in order that He should be-
come a great High Priest to minister in the heavenly sanctuary,
"to make reconciliation for the sins of the people," it was neces-
sary that He should take the flesh of, and in all things "be
made like unto His brethren." Here is revealed "the mystery of
godliness."
    3. By assuming sinful flesh, and voluntarily making Himself
dependent upon His Father to keep Him from sin while He was
in the world, Jesus not only set the example for all Christians, but
also made it possible for Him to minister to sinful flesh the gift
of His own Spirit and the power for obedience to the will of God.
By this union with the human family in their state of weakness
and dependence, He became "a merciful and faithful High
Priest," who can "be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,"
having been "in all points tempted like as we are."

29, 30.
    24. In fulfilment of this type, when did the cleans-
ing of the heavenly sanctuary (or the. ministry in the
most holy place) commence? Dan. 8 : 13, 14. Note 6.
    25. In view of the provision made for us through
Jesus, our great High Priest, what are we exhorted to
do? Heb. 10: 19-22.
                              Notes
    1. When Jesus was "at the right hand of God exalted," He
"sat down on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens," as
a minister of the heavenly sanctuary; and the outpouring of the
Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost was the evidence upon earth
that His work of intercession in behalf of man in the sanctuary
above had commenced. The minds of the disciples, illuminated
by the Holy Spirit, grasped the great fact that their former Com-
panion and Friend was now their High Priest in the heavenly
courts.
     2. From the texts used in answering questions 9, 10, and 11,
it is evident that the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews used the
expressions "within the veil," "into the holy place," and "into
heaven itself" as conveying the same general meaning; namely,
18          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

as designating the sanctuary in heaven as the place where Jesus
had entered upon His work as High Priest. When he referred to
the hanging which separated the holy from the most holy place
he called it the second veil. The hanging at the entrance of the
holy place would therefore necessarily be the first veil.
    3. In this epistle, the word "veil" is applied in three dif-
ferent ways: first, it is used in chapter 6:19 in the expression
"within the veil," which denotes the sanctuary as a whole; sec-
ond, it is used in the expression "the second veil" (Heb. 9:3) to
designate the hanging between the holy and the most holy place;
and third, it is used in chapter 10:20 as meaning "His flesh."
It is therefore manifestly unsafe to give to the word "veil" in
Heb. 6:19, 20 the limited and technical meaning which attaches
to the expression "within the veil" in some cases in the Old Tes-
tament, where definite reference had already been made to the
hanging between the holy and the most holy place in other state-
ments.
    4. The whole ceremonial system was a shadow of good things
which were yet future while that system was in force by divine
appointment. To say that the ministry in the holy place of the
heavenly sanctuary was in progress during the four thousand years
before the cross, not only involves the incongruity of having the
typical service introduced twenty-five hundred years after the real
service was instituted, but it is also a plain contradiction of the
teaching of the Scriptures.
    5. The first comma in verse 11 should be omitted, and the
phrase "through the greater and more perfect tabernacle" (R. V.)
should be connected directly with the verb "to come." This is the
punctuation of the revised Greek text. "The greater and more
perfect tabeinacle" through which these good things were to
come would then refer to the heavenly sanctuary.
    6. The cleansing of the earthly sanctuary was accomplished on
the great day of atonement, which came at the end of the yearly
round of services, and the vital part of this special service was
carried on in the most holy place of the sanctuary. What was true
of the type is true also of the reality. The cleansing of the
heavenly sanctuary is accomplished on the great day of atonement,
and this service is carried on in the most holy place. But accord-
ing to the prophecy of Daniel (Dan. 8:13, 14), the cleansing of
the heavenly sanctuary commenced at the end of the twenty-three
hundred days (or in 1844), and therefore the ministry in the most
holy place of the heavenly sanctuary began at that time. To say
that Christ entered upon His ministry in the most holy place when
He ascended, would involve a plain contradiction of the state-
ment in this prophecy.

   LESSON VII — The High Priest as Builder of the
                         House of God
                      FEBRUARY 15, 1913
                            Questions
    1. By being made "like unto His breihren," what
kind of High Priest did Jesus become? Heb. 2 : 17.
    2. In what exhortation was special attention directed
to the faithfulness of Jesus the High Priest? Heb.
3 : 1, 2.
    3. In what statement is reference made to the work
of the priest as the builder of God's house? Verse 3.
     4. From what statements of the Scriptures is it
clear that this building of the house of God is a cre-
ative work identical with the new creation through the
mediation of the eternal Son? Verse 4; Eph. 3 : 9 ;
John 1 : 1, 3 ; Ps. 102 : 18. Note 1.
     5. What is the house of God declared to be?
1 Tim. 3 : 15.
     6. By what other name is the church known? 2
Cor. 6 : 16.
     7. What did the prophet Zechariah declare that the
priest upon the throne would do? Zech. 6 :12, 13.
     8. What statement of Christ's corresponds to this
prophecy? Matt. 16 : 18.
     9. How is an earthly house built? Ruth 4 : 11.
 Note 2.
     10. In order that the Son of God might bUild the
 house of God, whose Son did He become? Matt. 22 :
42 ; 21 : 9 ; Luke 9 : 58.
     11. What was the Son of God able to accomplish
 20          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

as the result of taking the flesh? Gal. 4 : 4, 5. Note 3.
    12. How is this work of building the church defined
in another scripture? Ps. 147: 2.
    13. At the council at Jerusalem, what instruction was
given by the apostle James which shows that the build-
ing of the church is accomplished by the creative power
of the Spirit of God? Acts 15 : 7-9, 13-16.
    14. By the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of
Pentecost, how many were built into the house of God?
Acts 2: 37-41.
                              Notes
   1. The same God who is said to be the Builder of all things is
also declared to be the Creator of all things; and this creative
work is accomplished through the eternal Son, the Word of God.
The work of building the church is also a creative work (2 Cor.
5:17, R.V., margin), and this is accomplished through the media-
tion of the same eternal Son.
    2. An earthly -house or family is built up by having children
born into the family. This is emphasized in the Hebrew language
in the fact that the root of the verb " to build" and the root of
the noun "son" are the same.
    3. Jesus was none the less the Son of God after He bad been
born in the flesh through the agency of the Holy Spirit. Luke
1:35. He was both Son of man, or Son of David, and the Son of
God. Through His mediatorial work as priest, and the gift of the
Holy Spirit, all believers are born again as children of God (1 John
3:1), and the house of God is thus built.

prayer? Verse 27.
   8. For what great blessing did David then ask?
Verse 29.
    9. What enemy of the human family would pre-
vent its continuance 1 Cor. 15 : 26.
   10. What is the cause of death? James 1 : 15.
   11. In order, therefore, that the family of David
should not be cut off by death, from what does the Son
of David save His people? Matt. 1: 21.

the heavenly sanctuary Heb. 9 : 24.
22          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   17. What other name is given to this High Priest?
1 John 2 : 1.
   18. What position does Jesus, our High Priest, thus
occupy? 1 Tim. 2 : 5.
    19. When will this mediatorial work in behalf of
sin be finished? Rev. 10 : 7.
    20. What announcement is then made which indi-
cates the fulfilment of the prophecy in Dan. 2 : 44?
Rev. 11 : 15.
                               Notes
                        •
    1. It is evident that it is the house which Jesus has built, nr
established, through His work as High Priest, over which He will
reign forever, and that when this is accomplished, the prophecy
in Dan. 2:44 will be fulfilled. There is therefore the plainest con-
nection between the mediatorial work of the high priest and the
fulfilment of all those prophecies relating to the establishing of the
everlasting kingdom. This should not be overlooked in a study of
the sanctuary and the priesthood.
    2. The house of David, the kingdom of David, and the throne
of David are all established by the same means; namely, by the
work of Jesus the High Priest as the one Mediator between God
and man. In this way He builds the house of God, which is the
church.
    3. When God promised to build a house for David, and to es-
tablish his house and his kingdom forever, it constituted another
assurance of the gift of His Son to take away sin. Unless death
is destroyed, it will destroy any human family. Death is the result
of sin. The promise that David's house should continue forever,
was therefore to be fulfilled through the mediatorial work of
Christ; and the blessing for which David prayed, was the blessing
of salvation from sin.
    4. The mediatorial work of Christ in behalf of the individual
is in vain unless there is a personal acceptance of the gift min-
istered thereby—the gift of righteousness. The members of that
house which continues forever are made righteous by faith.

  LESSON IX —The Gospel in Type and in Reality
               MARCH 1, 1913

    14. What results follow the gift of Jesus in the
flesh? Heb. 2 :14, 15.
    15. In His more excellent ministry, what has Jesus
become? Heb. 8 : 6. Note 2.
    16. What are the "better promises" of the "better
covenant"? Verse 10.
    17. What experience results from having the law of
God in the heart? Ps. 37 : 31; 119: 11.
    18. In what language is this whole experience clearly
set forth? Rom. 8 : 2-4.
                                 Notes
    1.. All the services of the earthly sanctuary had reference to the
law of God which was in the ark under the mercy-seat. The work
of Christ as a priest in the heavenly sanctuary, which was fore-
shadowed in the earthly sanctuary and its services, was to "make
reconciliation for the sins of the people," and "sin is the trans-
gression of the law." By His death on the cross, Jesus became
the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and "through
faith in His blood" remission of sins is obtained. Jesus is also
the Mediator of the new covenant; and through His ministry as
the great High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, the law of God
is written in the heart; and the repentant sinner is enabled to live
a life in obedience to that law. Thus the work of Christ is not to
set aside the law, but to bring the life of the believer into har-
mony with it. This is the real gospel.
    2. The covenant was not the Law of God, but it "was simply
an arrangement for bringing men again into harmony with the
divine will, placing them where they could obey God's law."



     LESSON X — Taking Away the Typical Service
                 MARCH 8, 1913
                             Questions
      What shows that the ritual service of the earthly
     1.
sanctuary was not to be maintained permanently?
Heb. 9 :10.
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY              25
    2. What time is meant by {`the time of reforma-
tion"? Verse 11.
    3. What statement indicates the insufficiency of the
sacrifices which were offered according to the ritual
service? Heb. 10 : 1.
    4. What proves that there was no perfection through
the Levitical. priesthood? Heb. 7: 11. Note.
   •5. What became necessary on account of this in-
herent weakness of the ceremonial system? Verse 18.
    6. Who took the place of the priests of the typical
service Verse 28.
    7. What sanctuary took the place of the earthly
sanctuary? Heb. 8 : 1, 2.
    8. What sacrifice took the place of the many sacri-
fices offered by the priests in the earthly sanctuary?
Heb. 10 : 11, 12 ; 9 : 26.
    9. What expressions show that the new order of
things brought in at "the time of reformation" was
 better than the old? Heb. 7 : 19, 22 ; 9 : 23.
    10.. What prediction made through the prophet
 Daniel concerning the taking away of the typical serv-
 ice by the Messiah was thus fulfilled? Dan. 9 : 27.
    11. At the death of Christ, what remarkable occur-
 rence indicated that the sacrifice of the earthly sanc-
 tuary      to cease? Matt. 27 : 50, 51.
    12. What indicates that Stephen, in his preaching,
 explained to the people that the typical service had been
 taken away? Acts 6 : 13, 14.
     13. What charge brought against the apostle Paul
 shows that he was teaching that the real service had
 taken the place of the typical? Acts 21 : 27, 28.
26           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    14. What blessed experience is made possible through
the one true offering? Heb. 10 : 14.
    15. When Jesus had made purification of sins,. where
did He take His position? Heb. 1: 3.
    16. Upon what work did He then enter? Heb. 8 : 1, 2.
    17. Where and to whom are we now to look for
help in overcoming sin and living the triumphant life?
Heb. 12 : 1, 2.
    18. What prayer of David will thus be granted?
Ps. 20 : 1, 2.
                               Note
    The Levitical priesthood was not an end, but a means. There
was no spiritual efficacy in the ceremonies of the ancient ritual, and
salvation could not be secured by following the duties prescribed
in the Mosaic law. This whole system was intended to reveal
Christ and His salvation to the people. To those who discerned
this purpose, and looked beyond the type to the reality, a pres-
ent salvation was just as real an experience as is possible since
Christ was manifested in the flesh.

tablish? Verse 9, last clause. Note 3.
    11. In what written form is the will of God for man

heaven? John 6:38.
    14. In what statement did Jesus show that He car-

    15. What prayer has Jesus taught all His disciples
to pray? Matt. 6 : 10.
    16. What promise will be fulfilled through the work
of Christ as Minister of the true tabernacle, and Medi-
ator of the new covenant Heb. 8 : 10. Note 5.
28          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   17. What necessary connection is there between
keeping the law of God and the gift of eternal life?
1 John 2 : 17.
   18. What connection is established between the medi-
atorial work of Christ and the receiving of eternal life?
Heb. 9 :15.
   19. What special blessings have been secured through
the entrance of Christ upon His ministry in the heav-
enly sanctuary? Heb. 12 : 22-24.
                              Notes
    1. The services of the earthly sanctuary were designed to reveal
to the people the gospel of Christ, the Saviour from sin. When-
ever they degenerated into mere formalism, and took the place of
repentance and faith, they became an abomination in the- sight
of God. Nothing less than heart service was acceptable to Him.
The performance of certain gospel ordinances is no excuse for sin;
they are rather intended as a means of helping the sinner to lay
hold upon Him who saves from sin.
    2. The happiness of all God's creatures depends upon their
being in perfect harmony with His will. The purpose of the
gospel is to make believers "perfect in every good work to do
His will." This required that Christ should "put away sin by
the sacrifice of Himself," and that He should become the Mediator
of the new covenant in order that the law of God might be writ-
ten in the heart.
    3. The contrast in Heb. 10:8, 9 is between the performing of a
ritual service and the performing of the will of God. This is
plainly indicated in Rotherham's translation: "Sacrifices and
offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin Thou
willedst not. . . . Behold! I am come to do Thy will." The sac-
rifices and offerings for sin, which God did not design as a sub-
stitute for doing His will, constitute "the first," which was taken
away; while the doing of God's will constitutes "the second,"
which He came to establish.
    4. Christ took the flesh, and became a doer of the will of God,
not in order that man should be excused from doing that will,
but in order to provide a way by which it would be possible for
man to do the will of God, or keep His law. Through that faith
which brings one into vital union with Christ, and which accepts
the blessings that come through His ministry in the heavenly sanc-
tuary, the believer is empowered to do the will of God.

    5. The thunders of Sinai, and the voice which spoke the law
that demanded perfection of character, meant only condemnation
apart from the mediatorial work of the Son of God. The ministry
of our great High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary means recon-
ciliation to God, and forgiveness through the blood of sprinkling,
and the fulfilment. of the new covenant promises.

Matt. 5 : 17-19.
    12. Instead of abolishing the law, what did Christ
abolish? 2 Tim. 1: 10.
    13. From His throne in the heavenly sanctuary, what
does our High Priest minister to those who seek it?
Heb. 4 : 15, 16.
    14. In what other statement is this same idea ex-
pressed? Rom. 5: 5.
    15. When mercy, grace, and love have thus been
ministered from the heavenly sanctuary, what experi-
ence will result? Rom. 13 : 8-10. Compare 1 John 5:

plish as Mediator of the new covenant Heb. 8 : 10.
    17. What is known by those who have God's law in
the heart? Isa. 51: 7.
    18. What inspired prayer is thus answered? Eph.
3 : 16, 17.
    19. What mystery is made manifest in this experi-
ence? Col. 1: 26, 27. Note 4.
    20. How is peace with God obtained? Rom. 5; 1.
    21. What is assured to those who love God's law?
Ps. 119: 165.
                              Notes
    1. The law of God is called the testimony because it bears tes-
timony either to sin or to righteousness. The two tables of stone
are called the tables of testimony because the testimony or the
law was nrittem upon them. And the ark was called the ark of
the testimony because the testimony, or the law, was deposited in
it. In the 119th psalm, " testimonies," "commandments," "pre-

cepts," "statutes," "ordinances," "judgments," "word," and
"law" are all used to designate the same thing.
   2. The Greek word which is translated "propitiation" in Rom.
3:25 is the same word as is translated "mercy-seat" in Heb.
9:5. The same Greek word is used in the Greek translation of
the Old Testament to represent the Hebrew word translated
"mercy-seat" in the English version. In the typical service, the
mercy-seat was between the law and the people, and they dealt with
the law over the mercy-seat. In the real service, Christ is the
mercy-seat between the law and the people, and they deal with
the law through Christ.
    3. Through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, all blessings are
bestowed. Grace, mercy, and love, which come in this way, are
not abstract qualities, but are the very spirit of life in Christ
Jesus; and they are made manifest in a life in harmony with the
law of God, just as Christ lived that law on earth.
    4. The writing of the law of God in the heart, and the dwell-
ing of Christ in the heart, are simply different forms of expres-
sion for the same experience. They both involve the restoration
of the image of God in the soul of the believer.

                              Notes
    1. Sin separated between God and man, but in the gospel
the provision is made whereby we can draw near to God. In the
typical service of the earthly sanctuary this provision was set
forth in figure. When the glory of God was revealed as a con-
suming fire the great truth was taught that neither sin nor sin-
ners could endure the presence of God, and the need of separa-
tion from sin in order to dwell with God was emphasized.
    2. The veil which separated the holy from the most holy place
also protected the priests from being consumed by the manifesta-
tion of the glory of God in the most holy place, and they were
therefore able to draw near and to minister in the holy place.
When the high priest entered into the most holy place, the cloud
of incense served the same purpose, and enabled him to draw near
to the mercy-seat, and to make the atonement for the people who
were represented by him.
    3. In order that the glory of God might be manifested among
men without consuming them, the Son of God veiled His divin-
ity with the veil of the flesh. When divinity broke through this
veil, then the glory became, as of old, a consuming fire, and men
were terrified by the sight.
    4. The way into the holy place of the heavenly sanctuary was
opened when Jesus ascended on high and became a Minister of
the true tabernacle; but in the closing work of the goipel, His
ministry is transferred to the most holy place, as is indicated
by the fact that the ark of His covenant was visible in the temple.
    5. Jesus has not laid aside the veil of His flesh; and hidden in
Him, and protected by this veil, believers may enter into the
34          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

sanctuary, and draw near to God, even into the most holy place,
without being consumed. Every one who accepts Christ as his
Mediator, is exhorted thus to draw near to God. Only those,
however, who understand the work of Christ in the heavenly
sanctuary, can intelligently avail themselves of this great privi-
lege.


   The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for this quarter will benefit
two extremely needy fields.
                            KOREA
   A very urgent call comes from Korea for $6,500 for the school
work and the building of a hospital. The present school building
at Soonan, which cost about four hundred dollars, is entirely
inadequate to accommodate the school. The houses that the girls
live in are used for the girls' school. In a room eight by twelve
feet, from six to eight girls sleep at night, and live in the day-
time, eating, studying, and reciting therein. The students are
limited to the number that, lying side by side, can find sleeping
space on the floor. Such congested conditions are unpleasant,
insanitary, and positively dangerous if a student is ill. How
happy we should all be for the privilege the Sabbath-schools have
of answering this call!
                      THE PHILIPPINES
   As more will be given on this thirteenth Sabbath than is asked
for in the special call from Korea, it has been decided to place
with it an imperative need in the Philippines; namely, the es-
tablishment of a mission headquarters at Manila. A little band
of workers has been placed in that field, and the development and
organization of the work demands a center — a "headquarters."
The estimated cost is $4,000. Our Sabbath-schools can easily
supply this.
    If a larger amount is given than is needed to meet these
calls, the surplus will go to the missionary work in these fields.
   Let us pray for the work in Korea and the Philippines as we
make this offering to the Lord's work.

Struggles of Religious
       Liberty
           How Maintained in California
   California has long been the scene of a struggle between those
believing in full liberty of conscience and those who advocate
Sunday laws. Last summer this latter class endeavored, through
                                       the initiative and referen-
                                       dum, to place a Sunday law
                                       measure on the ballot. The
                                       Signs of the Times pro-
                                       tested against this proposal
                                       in a series of special num-
                                       bers, which had a powerful
                                       influence in temporarily de-
                                       laying the measure. One of
                                       the strongest series of ar-
                                       ticles in these papers was on

                                       Elder J. 0. Corliss. So con-

                                       are unanswerable.
    They are now published in booklet form for more permanent
circulation and reference, and will be eagerly secured and read
by those interested in this great question.
   As California and the recently admitted state of Arizona are
the only states without Sunday laws at the present time, this his-
tory and the incidents connected with it will be of intense interest.
