Lessons on the Book of Acts
                     SENIOR DIVISION
                     FOURTH QUARTER
                           1916
                           Introductory Note
   As we progress in the study of the book of Acts, careful and frequent note
should be made of the three agencies that are foremost in building up the
church and carrying on the work of God. These three are the Holy Spirit,
angels, and prayer. Prayer is the appeal of the soul to Heaven for help.
The gift of the Spirit and the ministry of angels are Heaven's response.
Prayers ascend from earth to heaven; the Holy Spirit and angels descend
from heaven to earth. Thus the "way into the holiest" is kept open, and
heaven is indeed brought close to earth.
   It will be profitable to note the .various instances of special`-prayer, and
the various times that the Spirit or angels show Heaven's interest in the
welfare and work of men.
                                   1. PRAYER
   The disciples prayed in unity and with heart-searching in the upper room.
   The disciples prayed for guidance in the selection of a successor to Judas.
   The believers continued "steadfastly . . . in prayers" after Pentecost.
   Peter and John went up to the temple to pray.
   The company of believers prayed on the return of Peter and John after
their first imprisonment.
   The apostles gave themselves "continually to prayer" and the ministry of
the Word after the appointment of the deacons.
   The apostles prayed in setting apart the deacons to their work.
   Stephen died with prayer 'on his lips.
   Peter bade Simon the sorcerer to pray for forgiveness.
   Simon asked Peter to pray for him.
   Saul prayed the Lord at his conversion to show him what to do.
   Peter prayed when he raised Dorcas to life.
   Cornelius "prayed to God alway."
   Peter went up on the housetop to pray.
   The prayer of Cornelius was "heard."
   While Peter was strongly guarded in Herod's prison, "prayer was made
without ceasing" by the church for his deliverance.
   While many were gathered together praying at Mary's house, the angel
delivered Peter out of prison, and he came and knocked at the door.

                            2. THE HOLY SPIRIT
   Through the Holy Spirit, Jesus gave the great commission, to the apOstles.
   Jesus promised a baptism of the Holy Spirit soon after His ascension.
   The baptism of the Holy- Spirit should endue them with power for wit-
nessing.
   David prophesied through the Holy Spirit concerning the end of Judas.
   The Holy Spirit descended in power on the day of Pentecost.
   God promised, through Joel, to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh in die
latter days.
   The Holy Spirit is promised to all who repent and are baptized.
   Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit when tried before the Sanhedrin for
the healing of the impotent man.
   The believers were filled with the Holy Spirit while praying for boldness
to speak the Word in the face of commands from the authorities not to do so.
   Ananias and Sapphire lied to the Holy Spirit.
   Stephen was a man full of the Holy Spirit.
4            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  The believers in Samaria received the Holy Spirit through the laying on of
hands by Peter and John.
   Simon the sorcerer sought to buy the gift of the Hoiy Spirit.
   The Spirit directed Philip to join himself to the Ethiopian's chariot, and
"caught away Philip" when his work was done.
   Saul was filled with the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands of
Ananias of Damascus.
   The Holy Spirit comforted the churches after the period of persecution.
   The Spirit directed Peter to go down from the housetop and receive the
messengers of Cornelius.
   God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.
   The Holy Spirit fell on the household of Cornelius and his friends while
Peter preached to them.
   Barnabas was full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.
  Agabus prophesied through the Spirit concerning a dearth throughout
the world.
                                  3. ANGELS
  Angels received Jesus out of sight at His ascension.
   Angels will announce Jesus' coming again.
   The angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought Peter
and John forth to continue preaching Jesus.
   The angel of the Lord directed Philip to go down to meet the Ethiopian
eunuch.
   In his vision, Cornelius saw an angel of the Lord coming to him, and
heard the angel speak to him.

speaking to him.

14-17; Acts 2: 38.
                           Notes
  1. The "church" as an organized body of believers was a
matter of development. The apostles had been calldd as
leaders of the flock. Of the call of the twelve by Christ we
are told: "The first step was now to be taken in the organiza-
tion of the church that after Christ's departure was to be
His representative on earth. . . . As in the Old Testament the
twelve patriarchs stand as representatives of Israel, so the
twelve apostles were to stand as representatives of the gospel
church." ("The Desire of Ages," page 291.)
   As believers were raised up and churches established, we
see the Holy Spirit guiding in the organization of the work.
In the sixth chapter of Acts, we find the church organized,
with elders and deacons to look after its varied interests in
an orderly way. It is such a "church" that was scattered out
from Jerusalem, as described in this lesson. (Acts 8: 1, 4.)
The term "church" is not used again - the fifth time - till
6           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

chapter 11: 22. It is used again in verse 26, this time refer-
ring to the believers at Antioch, where the disciples were first
called "Christians."
   2. This experience marks the beginning of the second stage
of witnessing for Jesus. In promising His disciples the gift
of the Holy Spirit, He had said, "Ye shall be witnesses unto
Me both [1] in Jerusalem, and [2] in all Judea, and [3] in
Samaria, and [4] unto the uttermost part of the earth." Acts
1: 8. They have now borne their witness in Jerusalem, and
been scattered by persecution "throughout the regions of
Judea." In these parts they now go "everywhere preaching
the Word."
   3. "Christ's message to the Samaritan woman with whom
He had talked at Jacob's well, had borne fruit." ("The Acts
of the Apostles," page 106.) In the carrying of the gospel
into Samaria, the work of witnessing enters upon its third
stage. Watch for the beginning of the fourth.
   4. In the light of Paul's testimony to Timothy, it is fitting
that we consider these two questions: Are we living "godly
in Christ Jesus" to the fullness that we ought? Will it re-
quire persecution to scatter *us abroad to preach the gospel
everywhere as it must be preached before the end will come?
Of the early church it is said, "To scatter His representatives
abroad, where they could work for others, God permitted per-
secution to come upon them." ("The Acts of the Apostles,"
page 105.)
   5. The word "they" in this verse does not include the
apostles. (See verse 1.) It must therefore refer largely to
the lay members of the church, and includes at least part of
the deacons, of whom Philip was one. What a modern miracle
it would seem for the entire church membership to go out
and make a business of giving the gospel! Will such an ex-
perience come to Seventh-day Adventists? How? When?

                           Notes
  1. Gaza was near the border of Palestine and Egypt.
Ethiopia lay south of Egypt, in the region of modern Nubia
and Abyssinia. Candace is said to be a common name for
the queens of Ethiopa, as Pharaoh was a title for the kings
of Egypt.
  2. Azotus is the Greek name of the city which in Hebrew
was called Ashdod, in the land of the ancient Philistines. It
was about thirty miles from Gaza, near the coast of the Medi-
terranean. Philip probably worked along the coast, passing
8          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

through such towns as Joppa, Lydda, Ashkelon, Arimathea,
etc., till he reached Cwsarea, about sixty miles from Azotus.
   3. "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for
light, and who was ready to receive the gospel; and to-day
angels will guide the footsteps of those workers who will
allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify their tongues and refine and
ennoble their hearts. The angel sent to Philip could himself
have done the work for the Ethiopian, but this is not God's
way of working. It is His plan that men are to work for
their fellow men."—"The Acts of the. Apostles," page 109.
   The Spirit directed Philip what to do when he met the
eunuch, and where to go when his work for him was done.
   4. Philip is spoken of in "The Acts of the Apostles" as a
type of missionaries "who will hear the voice of God, and
go where He sends them." (Page 109.) When the angel
directed him to go on the way toward Gaza, he did not tell
him how far he should go, nor what he was going for; but
Philip "arose and went." The Spirit bade him join himself to
the Ethiopian's chariot, "and Philip ran thither." He found
the work to do as soon as he came within hearing distance.
After the Spirit separated him from the Ethiopian officer,
"Philip was found at Azotus," whither he was led of the
Spirit. What wonder that so aggressive a missionary was
intrusted with carrying the gospel into new fields, even ahead
of the apostles! From Acts 21: 8 we learn that he became
known as "Philip the evangelist."
   5. Consider the work accomplished by one man. Then con-
sider what might be accomplished if all church members were
active missionaries.
   "It is a fatal mistake to suppose that the work of soul
saving depends alone upon the ministry. The humble, conse-
crated believer upon whom the Master of the vineyard places
a burden for souls, is to be given encouragement by the men
upon whom the Lord has laid larger responsibilities. Those
who stand as leaders in the church of God are to realize that
the Saviour's commission is given to all who believe in His
name. God will send forth into His vineyard many who have
not been dedicated to the ministry by the laying on of hands."
  "Hundreds, yea, thousands, who have heard the message of
salvation, are still idlers in the market place, when they might
be engaged in some line of active service. To these Christ is
saying, 'Why stand ye here all the day idle?' and He adds, 'Go
ye also into the vineyard.' Why is it that many more do not
respond to the call? Is it because they think themselves ex-
cused in that they do not stand in the pulpit? Let them un-
derstand that there is a large work to be done outside the
pulpit, by thousands of consecrated lay members.
   "Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take
possession of the whole church, so that every one shall be
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON.QUARTERLY                       9
working for Him according to his ability. When the members
of the church of God do their appointed work in the needy
fields at home and abroad, in fulfillment of the gospel com-
mission, the whole world will soon be warned, and the Lord
Jesus will return to this earth with power and great glory.
`This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.' "
—  Id., pages 110, 111.

the believers from Jerusalem. "Among the cities to which
they went was Damascus, where the new faith gained many
converts." ("The Acts of the Apostles," page 113.)
   2. For the expression, "of this way," the marginal reading,
"of the way," is better, and is used in the text of the Revised
Version, "of the Way." This expression, "the Way," came
to be commonly used to designate the Christian religion.
Jesus had said,     am the Way," that is, the way into truth,
the way into life, the only way to salvation from sin. It was
therefore very fitting to speak of the faith and practice of
Iris followers as the "Way." For other examples of its use,
see Acts 19: 9, 23; 22:4; 24: 14, 22.
   3.' By caravan road Damascus was about 136 miles from
Jerusalem, and six days were required to make the journey.
The vision did not take place till Saul and his company were
approaching Damascus.
   4. In Acts 26: 13, Paul himself says that the vision oc-
curred "at midday." In the clear atmosphere of the East,
the sun itself is exceedingly bright, but Paul says in the
same connection that the light was "above the brightness of
the sun." Saul understood the voice, and "to him was clearly
revealed the One who spoke — even the Son of God. . . .
When the glory was withdrawn, and Saul arose from the
ground, he found himself totally deprived of sight. The
brightness of Christ's glory had been too intense for his mor-
tal eyes; and when it was removed, the blackness of night
settled upon his vision. He believed that this blindness was
a punishment from God for his cruel persecution of the
followers of Jesus. In terrible darkness he groped about,
and his companions, in fear and amazement, `led him by the
hand, and brought him into Damascus.'" (Id., pages 115,
117.)
   In the same book it is said that Saul spent the three days
of blindness in "soul-agony," recalling with anguish his part
 in the martyrdom of Stephen and others, "shut away from
all human sympathy," sensing that "his only hope of help
 was in a merciful God,", and that "to Him, he appealed in...
 brokenness of heart."
   5. Saul was "fired with mistaken zeal" when he persecuted
 the church, but after he had a vision of Jesus as his only
 Saviour, and "yielded himself fully to the convicting power of
the Holy Spirit," he became equally "zealous of good works."
 The Lord wants His people to work, to do good work, and to be
 zealous in its doing.
   6. It is as much the privilege of the believer to know what
 the Lord would have him do, as it was Saul's. The Lord does
12         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

not always tell us in a vision, or in prayer, but as with Saul,
His will may be revealed to us through leaders and counselors
of His own choosing.
  7. At the very time while Saul was praying in blind se-
clusion, in brokenness of heart,•with intense desire for pardon
and acceptance, the Lord was preparing the answer through
another.
  8. "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution"- - that is, "suffer for My name's sake."

   3. "Jesus Christ maketh thee whole"— in soul and in
body.
   4. Jesus rewards a life "full of good works," even
though these works may seem humble in the eyes of some.
It is the spirit of loving service rather than the mere
deeds done, that wins the approval of Heaven — even if
it be expressed only in the giving of a cup of cold water.
                            Notes
   1. What a marvelous change in the experience of Saul —
from persecutor to preacher, from preacher to persecuted,
 from haling men and women into prison to being lain in wait
 for, from consenting to the death of Stephen to being watched
 for day and night to be killed! How soon did Saul the
"chosen vessel" begin to "suffer for My name's sake"!
   2. According to Paul's testimony in Gal. 1: 13-17, the ex-
treme measures taken by the Jews against his life, and his
subsequent escape, did not take place during his first period
of preaching Christ in Damascus (Acts 9: 20-22), but after
he went for a season into retirement in Arabia, then returned
to Damascus. See also "The Acts of the Apostles," pages
125-128.
   3. In Gal. 1: 18, 19, Paul states that his purpose in going
up to Jerusalem was "to see Peter," but that he saw none of
the other apostles "save James the Lord's brother." This
would make it appear that "the apostles" to whom Barnabas
brought him were these two, the others probably being absent
in evangelistic work during the "fifteen days" Paul remained
with Peter. Barnabas is doubtless the same as the one men-
tioned in Acts 4: 36, who accompanied Paul on his first mis-
sionary journey (Acts 13: 2), and is often mentioned by Luke.
The "Grecians" are the same Greek Jews who, with Saul's
consent, were instrumental in putting Stephen to death. Now
they turn upon Saul for the same purpose — a remarkable
change in affairs.
   4. It is probable that these "saints which dwelt at Lydda"
were the fruit of Philip's labor in his evangelistic tour up the
coast. Peter would naturally follow up Philip's work as he
did in Samaria.
   5. Periods of retirement for communion with God were
frequent in the life of Jesus, of Daniel, of Elijah, of Moses,
of Enoch, as well as in that of Paul and Peter and John and
Luther and Muller, and of every man of prevailing power in
leadership in God's work. No less vital are such periods for
every man or woman who will live a triumphant Christian
life,

                            Notes
   1. "Cornelius was a Roman centurion. He was a man of
wealth and noble birth, and his position was one of trust and
 honor. A heathen by birth, training, and education, through
contact with the Jews he had gained a knowledge of God, and
he worshiped Him with a true heart, showing the sincerity
of his faith by compassion to the poor. He was known far.•
and near for his beneficence, and his righteous life made him
of good repute among both Jews and gentiles."—"The Acts
of the Apostles," page 132.
   2. "Though Cornelius believed the prophecies, and was look-
ing for the Messiah to come, he had not a knowledge of the
gospel as revealed in the life and death of Christ. He was not
a member of the Jewish church, and would have been looked
upon by the rabbis as a heathen and unclean. But the same
 Floly Watcher who said of Abraham, 'I know him,' knew
 Cornelius also, and sent a message direct from heaven to
him."— Id., page 133.
   3. "It was not for physical food alone that Peter hungered.
As from the housetop he viewed the city of Joppa and the
surrounding country, he hungered for the salvation of his
countrymen. He had an intense desire to point out to them
from the Scriptures the prophecies relating to the sufferings
and death of Christ."— Id., page 135.
   4. "This vision conveyed to Peter both reproof and instruc-
tion. It revealed to him the purpose of God,— that by the
death of Christ the gentiles should be made fellow heirs with
the Jews to the blessings of salvation. As yet none of the
disciples had preached the gospel to the gentiles. In their
minds, the middle wall of partition, broken down by the death
of Christ, still existed, and their labors had been confined to
the Jews; for they had looked upon the gentiles as excluded
from the blessings of the gospel. Now the Lord was seeking
to teach Peter the world-wide extent of the divine plan."—
Id., pages 135, 136.
  5. The first six verses of this chapter reveal the intimate
knowledge that Heaven has of the names, abode, occupation,
and heart longings of men. From the Roman officer in the
chief Roman city of Palestine to the humble tanner in Joppa,
the Lord took knowledge of all their circumstances, and gave
specific directions to each, even to the location of Simon's
house. Truly "the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,"
and "the Lord knoweth them that are
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       17

   6. How often in the book of Acts so far has it been made
evident that the Lord comes near to His children and reveals
Himself to them in wisdom and power, when their hearts are
bowed in humility and supplication at the. throne of grace!
It is when the soul feels its helplessness and dependence most
that God can fill the aching void with His presence.
   7. It was not Cornelius alone who "feared God" and "prayed
to God alway," but also "all his house." This evidently in-
cluded his servants and some of the soldiers (verse 7), for
his relations were such with them in spiritual matters that
he could relate the details of his vision to them and send them
on the important mission to Peter. Like Abraham, he com-
manded his household after him, as it is the privilege of every
father to do who fears God and trains his children for Him.
   8. That this experience was a severe test for Peter, with
his strong Jewish training and prejudices, is evident from his
conversation with the Lord, and from the fact tha,t the vision
was presented three times, leaTing him still in doubt of its
meaning. Yet he obeyed the voice of the Spirit in going to
"keep company" with a gentile for perhaps the first time in
his. life. But what a rich experience followed this act of
obedience!

  1. "As Peter entered the house of the gentile, Cornelius did
not salute him as an ordinary visitor, but as one honored of
Heaven, and sent to him, by God. It is an Eastern custom to
bow before a prince or other high dignitary, and for children
to bow before their parents; but Cornelius, overwhelmed with
reverence for the one sent by God to teach him, fell at the
apostle's feet, and worshiped him. Peter was horror-stricken,
and he lifted the centurion up, saying, 'Stand up; I myself
also am a man.' "-"The Acts of the Apostles," page 137.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       19

   2. The situation at this point is very interesting, almost
dramatic. Peter and his brethren from Joppa have assembled
for the first time, perhaps, in company with gentiles, in the
house of a gentile, in response to the definite call of a gentile
and to the direct bidding of the Lord. This marks a new era
in the spread of the gospel. Jesus had said to the disciples
before His ascension that they should be witnesses to Him "in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the
uttermost part of the earth." The first three steps have been
taken, and now the fourth is about to begin. It is true that
Saul had preached in Damascus of Syria already, and was
now doing likewise in Cilicia, and that Csarea is still in Sa-
maria; but Saul had preached to the Jews largely, and so had
Peter and others till this hour. (Chapter 11: 19.) Peter is
now about to preach the first Christian sermon to a gentile au-
dience, the beginning of a distinctive world-wide movement.
What wonder that he felt it a matter of expediency to take six
Jewish brethren with him for witnesses!
   3. Peter's first statement was as much a confession on his
part as it was instruction to his hearers. The truth was as
new to him as to those who listened. It had just been sent
fresh from heaven, but it is still as fresh and forceful and
applicable to-day as then.
   4. The gathering at the house of Cornelius was really a
"cottage meeting," for he had invited in his friends and rela-
tives and neighbors to hear the message sent of God. The
results were wonderful, and suggest that we "upon whom the
ends of the world are come" ought to do far more of this kind
of work.
    5. Many scriptures teach this same truth. Read especially,
Deut. 10: 17; 2 Chron. 19: 7; Rom. 2: 6-11; James 2: 1-9.
How much respect of persons really lingers in the hearts of
most of us! The picture drawn by James is not an ancient
one alone. When we can look upon every man in the light of
Calvary, we shall pay less attention to the artificial distinc-
 tions of society and pay due respect to all we meet. The mis-
sionary who goes abroad should be "all things to all men,"
that he "may win some."

Verse 29. Note 8.
                           Notes
   1. Peter had foreseen that such a contention would be raised
by those who were "of the circumcision" when they heard that
he, like his Master, had consorted with "men uncircumcised,"
and had "eaten with publicans and sinners." For this reason,
he took the precaution of taking with him to Cmsarea six of
the Joppa brethren, whom he had evidently brought with him
to Jerusalem as witnesses of the work done at the house of
Cornelius.
   It is interesting to note how careful the leading apostles
were to keep harmony between the field and the church at
Jerusalem. After his experience at Damascus, Saul went up
to Jerusalem "to see Peter" and to acquaint him and others
with his work. Peter went back and forth from Jerusalem
to various places where work was going on, and now, on this
special occasion of extending the gospel to the gentiles, he
goes up with witnesses and makes his report.
   2. "To-day God is seeking for souls among the high as
well as the lowly. There are many like Cornelius, men whom
the Lord desires to connect with His work in the world. Their
sympathies are with the Lord's people, but the ties that bind
them to the world hold them firmly. It requires moral courage
for them to take their position for Christ. Special efforts
should be made for these souls, who are in so great danger,
because of their responsibilities and associations."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pages 139, 140.
   3. Phenice is Phoenicia, the country of Tyre and Sidon ;
 Cyprus is a large island off the coast of Syria; Antioch was
 the capital of Syria, next in importance to Jerusalem as a
church center, and the starting point of Paul's three mis-
 sionary journeys; Cyrene is far to the west on the north
coast of Africa. The "Grecians," or "Hellenists," were either
Jews born abroad and speaking Greek, or proselytes. Since
there were many Greek-speaking Jews at Jerusalem among
the believers (see chapter 6: 1), the fact that Grecians are
 specially mentioned at Antioch suggests that they may have
 been gentiles preached to by Cyprian and Cyrenian brethren,
who did not share the strong prejudices of the Jews at Jerusa-
 lem. It will be recalled here that Barnabas was a Cyprian.
   4. "It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called
 Christians. The name was given them because Christ was the
 main theme of their preaching, their teaching, and their
 conversation. Continually they were recounting the inci-
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 dents that had occurred during the days of His earthly mm-
 istry, when His disciples were blessed with His personal pres-
 ence. Untiringly they dwelt upon His teachings and His
 miracles of healing. With quivering lips and tearful eyes
 they spoke of His agony in the garden, His betrayal, trial,
and execution, the forbearance and humility with which He
had endured the contumely and torture imposed upon Him
 by His enemies, and the Godlike pity with which He had
prayed for those who persecuted Him. His resurrection and
ascension, and His work in heaven as the Mediator for fallen
man, were topics on which they rejoiced to dwell. Well might
the heathen call them Christians, since they preached Christ,
and addressed their prayers to God through Him.
    "It was. God who gave to them the name of Christian. This
is a royal name, given to all who join themselves to Christ"—
Id., page 157. See James 2: 6, 7; 1 Peter 4: 16, 14.
    5. It is the Lord's plan to carry on His work through human
agencies, and He therefore desires a spirit of harmony and
unity to prevail among His workers. He sent Peter to Cor-
nelius, and Philip to the eunuch, though angels were already
on the ground and might have done the, work. He specially
guided Philip, but led Peter down from Jerusalem to bind
off his work. Saul went up to counsel with Peter. With
such experiences as Saul and Peter had in being specially
called of the Lord to lead out in giving the gospel to the gen-
tiles, they, if any one, would seem justified in going their own
way, without counsel. But here is Peter carrying out a de-
liberate plan to maintain unity between workers and believ-
ers. Those who profess nowadays a special call to lead off
from the body into some way of their own, may well take
heed to the lesson. God is not the author of confusion.
   6. The power of the Spirit working with Peter among the
gentiles, and accompanying, his rehearsal of this work to the
church, broke down prejudices cherished by the Jews for cen-
turies. Can we not depend on the same power to break down
the strongest and most deep-seated prejudices, as we give the
last message of warning to the world?
   7. How many times we read in these chapters that the
early apostles "preached Christ," or preached the Lord Jesus,
or preached the Word, or similar expressions! Their preach-
ing was simple and direct, and often resulted in many con-
versions from a single sermon or in a single day. In these
days of much learning, we may well beware of departing
from the simplicity of Christ and of preaching Christ.
   8. If every man who believes the third angel's message
would give according to his ability, how quickly the work
could be finished! Some do, but not every one. Some give
money, some give their children, some give themselves. Let
all be sure they give according to their ability

                            Notes
  1. "The government of Judea was then in the hands of
Herod Agrippa, subject to Claudius, the Roman emperor.
Herod also held the position of tetrarch, of Galilee. He was
professedly a proselyte to the Jewish faith, and apparently
very zealous in carrying out the ceremonies of the Jewish law.
 Desirous of obtaining the favor of the Jews, hoping thus to
make secure his offices and honors, he proceeded to carry out
their desires by persecuting the church of Christ, spoiling the
houses and goods of the believers, and imprisoning the leading
members of the church. He cast James, the brother of John,
into prison, and sent an executioner to kill him with the sword,
as another Herod had caused the prophet John to be beheaded.
Seeing that the Jews were well pleased with these efforts, he
imprisoned Peter also."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 143.
  2. A quaternion was composed of four soldiers. Four
quaternions would make sixteen. One quaternion was on duty
at a time, the four being provided to cover the four watches
of the day and night.
  The word "Easter" is a mistranslation. The Revised Ver-
sion renders it "Passover."
  3. When each quaternion was on duty, two of the soldiers
were fastened to Peter with chains, while the other two kept
guard, one immediately before the door, and the other farther
on. These two are mentioned in verse 10 as "the first and the
second ward," or guard.
  "Peter was confined in a rock-hewn cell, the doors of which
were strongly bolted and barred; and the soldiers on guard
were made answerable for the safe-keeping of the prisoner.
But the bolts and bars and the Roman guard, which effectually
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  25

cut off all possibility of human aid, were but to make more
complete the triumph of God in the deliverance of Peter.
Herod was lifting his hand against Omnipotence, and he was
to be utterly defeated. By the putting forth of His might,
God was about to save the precious life that the Jews were
plotting to destroy."— Id., page 146. '
   4. The coming of the angel into the prison is thus described
in "Acts of the Apostles," page 146: "It is the last night be-
fore the proposed execution. A mighty angel is sent from
heaven to rescue Peter. The strong gates that shut in the
saint of God open without the aid of human hands. The
angel of the Most High passes through, and the gates close
noiselessly behind him. He enters the cell, and there lies
Peter, sleeping the peaceful sleep of perfect trust."
   5. According to Col. 4: 10, the Mary to whose house Peter
went, was a sister of Barnabas. Here Mark is spoken of as
"sister's son to Barnabas," that is, nephew of Barnabas. The
James mentioned by Peter is doubtless the one 'spoken of in
Acts 15: 13 as presiding over the council at Jerusalem. He
is supposed to have been "the Lord's brother" mentioned by
Paul in Gal. 1: 19.
    6. Peter and James and John, the most privileged of the
twelve disciples, were also among the most active leaders of
the church. Herod had put James to death with the sword
 in the effort to ingratiate himself into the favor of the
Jews. Now he seized the "veteran apostle" for the same pur-
pose. It is at this point that it is said "the entire church
 engaged in fasting and prayer. . . . They prayed without
 ceasing for Peter, for they felt that he could not be spared
 from the cause. . . . While all their energies and sympathies
 were called out in fervent appeals for help, angels of God
 were watching over the imprisoned apostle." (Id., pages
144, 145.)
    7. Pray believing. Praying should not be merely the per-
 formance of a religious duty, or the means merely of easing
 the conscience or of attaining certain relief of mind. The
 Lord is pleased to have us pray believing that we shall receive
 what we ask for when we pray according to His will. While
 the believers at Mary's house were fasting and praying for
 Peter's deliverance, they evidently expected deliverance, for
 it came doubtless as an answer to their prayers. Yet they
 seemed hardly to expect it in the way it came; for when Peter
 appeared at the door delivered, they were "astonished" at
 the answer to their prayers, and could not believe the word
 of Rhoda till they saw Peter themselves. It is our part to
 pray believing, and let the Lord answer in His own way.
    8. "The experience of Philip, directed by an angel from
 heaven to go to the place where he met one seeking for truth;
 of Cornelius, visited by an angel with a message from God;
26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

of Peter, in prison and condemned to death, led by an angel
forth to safety,— all show the closeness of the connection be-
tween heaven and earth.
  "To the worker for God, the record of these angel visits
should bring strength and courage. To-day, as verily as in
the days of the apostles, heavenly messengers are passing
through the length and breadth of the land, seeking to comfort
the sorrowing, to protect the impenitent, to win the hearts of
men to Christ. We cannot see them personally; nevertheless
they are with us, guiding, directing, and protecting."— id.,

                            Notes
   1. "After the disciples had been driven from Jerusalem by
persecution, the gospel message spread rapidly through the
regions lying beyond the limits of Palestine; and many small
companies of believers were formed in important centers.
. . . Among the places mentioned where the gospel was gladly
received, is Antioch, at that time the metropolis of Syria. The
extensive commerce carried on from that populous center
brought to the city many people of various nationalities. Be-
sides, Antioch was favorably known as a resort for lovers of
ease and pleasure, because of its healthful situation, its beau-
tiful surroundings, and the wealth, culture, and refinement
to be found there. In the days of the.apostles, it lad become
a city of luxury and vice."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages
155, 156.
  "In the populous city of Antioch, Paul found an excellent
field of labor. His learning, wisdom, and zeal exerted a pow-
erful influence over the inhabitants and frequenters of that
city of culture; and he proved just the help that Barnabas
ne9c19d. F9r a year the two disciples labored unitedly in faith-
28         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

ful ministry, bringing to many a saving knowledge of Jesus
of Nazareth, the world's Redeemer."— Id., pages 156, 157.
   2. "God had abundantly blessed the labors of Paul and
Barnabas during the year they remained with the believers
in Antioch. But neither of them had as yet been formally or-
dained to the gospel ministry. They had now reached a point
in their Christian experience when God was about to intrust
them with the carrying forward of a difficult missionary en-
terprise, in the prosecution of which they would need every




advantage that could be obtained through the agency of the
church."— Id., page 160.
   "Both Paul and Barnabas had already received their com-
mission from God Himself, and the ceremony of the laying
on of hands added no new grace or virtual qualification. It
was an acknowledged form of designation to an appointed
office, and a recognition of one's authority in that office. By
it the seal of the church was set upon the work of God.
   "To the Jew, this form was a significant one. When a
Jewish father blessed his children, he laid his hands rever-
ently upon their heads. When an animal was devoted to
sacrifice, the hand of the one invested with priestly authority
was laid upon the head of the victim. And when the ministers
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 29
of the church of believers in Antioch laid their hands upon
Paul and Barnabas, they, by that action, asked God to bestow
His blessing upon the chosen apostles, in their devotion to the
specific work to which they had .been appointed."— Id., pages
161, 162.
   3. salamis was the chief city of Cyprus, situated on the
eastern coast. Cyprus was a large island about eighty miles
southwest of Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, the latter being
the capital of Syria. We are now beginning to follow the
labors of Paul on his first missionary journey.
   4. Paphos was the capital city of Cyprus, on the west coast.
   5. "The sorcerer had closed his eyes to the evidences of
gospel truth; and the Lord, in righteous anger, caused his
natural eyes to be closed, shutting out from him the light of
day. This blindness was not permanent, but only for a season,
that he might be warned to repent, and seek pardon of the
God whom he had so grievously offended. The confusion into
which he was thus brought, made of no effect his subtle arts
against the doctrine of Christ. The fact that he was obliged
to grope-about in blindness, proved to all that the miracles
which the apostles had performed, and which Elymas had de-
nounced as sleight of hand, were wrought by the power of
God. The deputy, convinced of the truth of the doctrine
taught by the apostles, accepted the gospel."— Id., page 168.
   6. "God has made His church on the earth a channel of light,
and through it He communicates His purposes and His will. •
He does not give, to one of His servants an experience inde-
pendent of and contrary to the experience of the church itself.
Neither does He give one man a knowledge of His will for the
entire church, while the church — Christ's body — is left in
darkness. In His providence, He places His servants in close
connection with His church, in order that they may have less
confidence in themselves, and greater confidence in others
whom He is leading out to advance His work."— Id., page
163.
   7. "There have ever been in the church those who are con-
stantly inclined toward individual independence. They seem
unable to realize that independence of spirit is liable to lead
the human agent to have too much confidence in himself, and
to trust in his own judgment rather than to respect the coun-
sel and highly esteem the judgment of his brethren, especially
of those in the offices that God has appointed for the leader-
ship of His people. God has invested His church with special
authority and power, which no one can be justified in disre-
garding and despising; for he who does this despises the voice
 of God.
   "Those who are inclined to regard their individual judgment
 as supreme, are in grave peril. It is Satan's studied effort to
 separate such ones from those who are channels of light,
  30         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   through whom God has wrought to build up and extend His
   work in the earth. To neglect or despise those whom God has
   appointed to bear the responsibilities of leadership in connec-
   tion with the advancement of the truth, is to reject the means
   that He has ordained for the help, encouragement, and
   strength of His people. For any worker in the Lord's cause to
   pass these by, and to think that his light must come through
   no other channel than directly from God, is to place himself in
   a position where he is liable to be deceived by the enemy, and
   overthrown. The Lord in His wisdom, has arranged that by
   means of the close relationship that should be maintained by
   all believers, Christian shall be united to Christian, and church
   to church. Thus the human instrumentality will be enabled
   to cooperate with the divine. Every agency will be subordi-
   nate to the Holy Spirit, and al] the believers will be united in
  an organized and well directed effort to give to the world the
   glad tidings of the grace of God."— Id., pages 163, 164.
     8. "The fallen foe ever works to keep in his ranks men
  of influence who, if converted, might render effective service
  in God's cause. But the faithful gospel worker need not fear
   defeat at the hand of the enemy; for it is his privilege to be
  endued with power from above to withstand every satanic
  influence."— ht, pages 167, 168.
     9. "Mark's mother was a convert to the Christian religion,
  and her home at Jerusalem was an asylum for the disciples.
. There they were always sure of a welcome and a season of
  rest. It was during one of these visits of the apostles to his
  mother's home, that Mark proposed to Paul and Barnabas that
  he should accompany them on their missionary tour. He felt
  the favor of God in his heart, and longed to devote himself
  entirely to the work of the gospel ministry."— Id., pages
  166, 167.
     "It was here [at Perga] that Mark, overwhelmed with fear
  and discouragement, wavered for a time in his purpose to give
  himself whole-heartedly to the Lord's work. Unused to hard-
  ships, he was disheartened by the perils and privations of the
  way. He had labored with success under favorable circum-
  stances; but now, amidst the opposition and perils that so
  often beset the pioneer worker, he failed to endure hardness
  as a good soldier of the cross. He had yet to learn to face
  danger and persecution and adversity with a brave heart. As
  the apostles advanced, and still greater difficulties were appre-
  hended, Mark was intimidated, and losing all courage, refused
  to go farther, and returned to Jerusalem.
     "This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and
  even severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was
  inclined to excuse him because of his inexperience. He felt
  anxious that Mark should not abandon the ministry, for he
  saw in him qualifications that would fit him to be a useful
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        31
worker for Christ. In after years his solicitude in Mark's
behalf was richly rewarded; for the young man gave himself
unreservedly to the Lord and to the work of proclaiming the
gospel message in difficult fields. Under the blessing of God,
and the wise training of Barnabas, he developed into a val-
uable worker.
  "Paul was afterward reconciled to Mark, and received him
as a fellow laborer."— Id., pages 169, 170.

                       Lessons for Us
   1. It is our privilege to receive the message of salva-
tion as personal. Verse 26. Note 5.
   2. Religious formalism is one of our greatest spiritual
dangers. Verses 27-29. Note 6.
   3. The risen Christ is our only hope. Verses 32, 33.
                            Notes
  1. Observe how Paul, in making this declaration, appeals
to both the Jews and the gentiles in his audience: "Children
of the stock of Abraham" (Jews), and "whosoever among you
feareth God" (including gentiles).
  2. The result of formalism in worship is easily seen from
this passage. The very prophecies which the Jews read or
heard read "every Sabbath day" in their assemblies for wor-
ship, they themselves became the instruments for fulfilling.
  3. Here Paul turns to the cheering side of the picture, that
God had fulfilled to the children His promise made to their
fathers, "in that He bath raised up Jesus again:" To those
who were listening to these burning words, there was still hope
of salvation through the risen Christ.
  4. And now, Paul declares, be it known unto you that we
are here to-day as His witnesses to testify that through this
same Jesus ye are offered "the forgiveness of sins." All this
terrible record of sin against Christ, He stands ready to wipe
away if you will only repent and be baptized for the remission
of sins. Truly this was exceedingly "glad tidings" that Paul
brought the Jews of Antioch. What wonder that "the gentiles
besought that these words might be preached to them the next

   5. "To you is the word of this salvation sent," declares Paul.
It is easy to read the promises of God in an impersonal way,
but it is far more helpful to receive them as addressed to us
personally; for verily they are so addressed. We can never
know their blessedness and their power till we apply and ap-
propriate them to ourselves.
   6. It is necessary to have form and order in our religious
services. This implies a set time and a set place to hold them,
and a more or less regular way of conducting them. , Yet in
this very uniformity lurks gredt danger. The Jews could read
the prophecies of the Messiah with great regularity and faith-
fulness for centuries, yet when it came up to the crisis, they
"knew Him not, nor yet the voices [meaning] of the prophets!'
We are secure from the same fatal result only as we find the
words of God and eat them, as Jeremiah expresses it, and this,
too, in our daily walk.

His name. Acts 14: 3. Note 7.
   4. The straight word of testimony will bring division.
Verse 4; Luke 12: 51-53.
                           Notes
  1. It may be recalled from last week's lesson that the Jews
did not invite Paul and Barnabas to preach again the next
Sabbath. This was the first step toward the open hostility
that finally drove the apostles away from Antioch. The gen-
tiles, however, warmed and cheered with the first preaching of
Paul", desired to hear more of the word of God, and invited the
apostles to speak again the following Sabbath. This was their
first step- toward the larger blessing that awaited them in be-
coming the special subjects of Paul's labor.
   2. The bold announcement, "Lo, we turn to the gentiles,"
ushers in a new era in the history of God's people. For cen-
turies the Jews had been the special recipients of God's favors,
and His chosen people to preserve a knowledge of Him in the
earth. But now they had forfeited all title to these favors by
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                        35

openly rejecting Christ and the glad tidings of forgiveness
and salvation brought to them by the apostles. So now Paul
enters definitely upon that special mission committed to him
of revealing the mystery that had been hidden for ages — com-
plete salvation to all mankind through Christ.
  3. The response of the gentiles to their new privileges was
very marked. They received the tidings with gladness; and
joined with the apostles in publishing the word of the Lord
"throughout all the region."
   4. In this verse is the first use of the terms "Jews" and
"Greeks," as distinguishing Jews and gentiles, which we shall
find frequently hereafter, and which are often used through-
out Paul's epistles.
   5. Here is a marked instance of the division that Jesus said
His coming and teaching would create, even to the dividing of
members of the same family.
   6. "The hearts of Paul and his associate workers were
drawn out in behalf of those who were 'without Christ, being
aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from
the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in
the world.' Through the untiring ministrations of the apostles
to the gentiles, the 'strangers and foreigners,' who 'sometimes
were far off,' learned that they had been 'made nigh by the
blood of Christ,' and that through faith in His atoning sacri-
fice, they might become 'fellow citizens with the saints, and
of the household of God.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page -
175.
   7. As we may come boldly to the throne of grace in our
intercessions, that is, with courage and confidence born of
faith, so would the Lord have us labor for Him, so can He
manifest His power through us for the winning of souls.

  4. "We .must through much tribulation enter into the
kingdom of God." Verse 22; Rom. 8: 17; 2 Tim. 3: 12.

                            Notes
  1. "At one time, while Paul was telling the people of Christ's
work as a healer of the sick and afflicted, he saw among his
hearers a cripple, whose eyes were fastened on him, and who
received and believed his words. Paul's heart went out in
sympathy toward the afflicted man, in whom he discerned one
who 'had faith to be healed.' In the presence of the idolatrous
assembly, Paul commanded the cripple to stand upright on
his feet. Heretofore the sufferer had been able to take a
sitting posture only; but now, he instantly obeyed Paul's com-
mand, and for the first time in his life stood on his feet.
Strength came with this effort of faith, and he who had been
a cripple 'leaped and walked.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
page 181.
   2. "The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men."
Verse 11.
   "This statement was in harmony with a tradition of theirs
that the gods occasionally visited the earth. Barnabas they
called Jupiter, the father of gods, because of his venerable
appearance, his dignified bearing, and the mildness and be-
nevolence expressed in his countenance. Paul they believed
to be Mercury, 'because he was the chief speaker,' earnest
and active, and eloquent with words of warning and exhorta-
tion."—Id., page 181.
   3. "In this dark and trying hour, the company of Lystrian
believers, who through the ministry of Paul and Barnabas
had been converted to the faith of Jesus, remained loyal and
true. The unreasoning opposition and cruel persecution by
their enemies served only to confirm the faith of these de-
voted brethren; and now, in the face of danger and scorn,
they showed their loyalty by gathering sorrowfully about the
form of him whom they believed to be dead.
   "What was their surprise when, in the midst of their
lamentations, the apostle suddenly lifted up his head, and
rose to his feet, with the praise of God upon his lips. To the
believers this unexpected restoration of God's servant was
regarded as a miracle of divine power, and seemed to set
the signet of Heaven upon their change of belief. They re-
joiced with inexpressible gladness, and praised God with re-
newed faith."— Id., page 184.
   4. "As an important factor in the spiritual growth of the
new converts, the apostles were careful to surround them
with the safeguards of gospel order. Churches were duly
organized in all places in Lycaonia and Pisidia where there
were believers. Officers were appointed in each church, and
38         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

proper order and system was established for the conduct of
all the affairs pertaining to the spiritual welfare of the be-
lievers.
   "This was in harmony with the gospel plan of uniting in
one body all believers in Christ, and this plan Paul was care-
ful to follow throughout his ministry. Those who in any
place were by his labor led to accept Christ as the Saviour,
were, at the proper time, organized into a church. Even when
the believers were but few in number, this was done. The
Christians were thus taught to help one another, remember-
ing the promise, 'Where two or three are gathered together
in My name, there am I in the midst of them.' "— Id., pages
185, 186.
   5. In His miracles of healing, Jesus often said, "Accord-
ing to thy faith be it unto thee," or words of similar import.
Often, too, the power of the Spirit was so present with Him
that He discerned the longing of the afflicted one to be healed,
and took the first step toward healing him. Paul, in his ef-
forts to have the darkened heathen mind comprehend Jesus,
often rehearsed to the people His wonderful deeds of healing.
Merely telling the story often called forth in his hearers,
through the Spirit, faith and longing to be healed, as with the
impotent man. Then through the Spirit, Paul discerned his
state of mind, and ministered healing to him. Thus do faith
and the Spirit work together upon the hearts of minister
and hearer.
   6. Apostles and prophets found it necessary, on occasions
when the power of God was specially manifested through
them, to assure the people that they were only ordinary men,
of like passions with other men, and that what the people
saw of mighty works was altogether the Lord's doing. Thus
did Paul to the Lycaonians. Thus does James testify con-
cerning Elijah where in answer to his prayer rain was with-
held for three years and a half. James 5: 17. Thus did
Peter assure Cornelius. Acts 10: 26.
   On the other hand, we may say, that we are men of like
passions with the apostles and prophets. God was able to
do mighty works through them because they maintained liv-
ing communion with Heaven. God is as willing and ready
to reveal Himself in and through us if only our lives are in
harmony with His will.
  7. It is significant that on this remarkable occasion Paul
should appeal to nature for evidence of the living God to the
heathen mind.
  "The most effective way to teach the heathen who know not
God, is through His works. In this way, far more readily
than by any other method, they can be made to realize the dif-
ference between their idols, the work of their own hands, and
the true God, the maker of heaven and earth. . . . There is
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                39

a simplicity and purity in these lessons directly from nature
that make them of the highest value to others beside the
heathen."—"Special Testimonies on Education," page 60.
