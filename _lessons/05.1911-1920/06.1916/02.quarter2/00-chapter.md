    Jesus Himself, while He dwelt among men, was often
in prayer. Our Saviour identified Himself with our needs
and weakness, in that He became a suppliant, a petitioner,
seeking from His Father fresh supplies of strength. . . .
And if the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need
of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel
the necessity of fervent, constant prayer.—Stepr to Christ.

                            Notes
  1. When Jesus comes the second time, the event is to be
so glorious that heaven will be emptied of all its inhabitants
to form His escort of honor. Our finite imagination can gain
but a faint conception of what the glory of that event will
be. Jesus is to bring "all the holy angels with Him." Rev.
5: 11 gives some idea of what their number is, for it says,
"The number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand,
and thousands of thousands," or as the original gives it, more
vividly, "myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands."
A myriad in Greek is the definite number ten thousand, so
that this text really says, "ten thousands of ten thousands,
and thousands of thousands." The smallest total number this
could make would be 404,000,000, but the actual number of
angels is beyond enumeration. Well may we conclude that
"all the holy angels" who will escort the coming King on
His glorious return, will be, as the translator of Hebrews
puts it, "innumerable hosts of angels." Heb. 12: 22, R. V.
  2. The angels do not come with Jesus as an escort of honor
alone. In Matt. 24: 31, it is said that "they shall gather
together His elect from the four winds, from one end of
heaven to the other." Grand and glorious gathering that
will be!
  3. It is important to notice that the service on which the
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   5

King will base His commendation or condemnation, is service
that is within the reach of every one, even of the least. The
words "these My brethren" may seem to indicate that this
service is to be given to Christ's followers only, but we should
not interpret them narrowly. While there is a special bond
of love between Christ and His followers, and a special
promise to any who give them as much as a "cup of cold
water" (Matt. 10: 42), yet Christ will recognize the spirit
of unselfish, service that ministers to any one in distress,
even when the service is performed by one who is not ap-
parently a follower of Christ.
  'Even among the heathen are those who have cherished the
spirit of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon
their ears, they have befriended the missionaries, even min-
istering to them at the peril of their own lives. Among the
heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom
the light is never brought by human instrumentality, yet they
will not perish. Though ignorant of the written law of God,
they have heard His voice speaking to them in nature, and
have done the things that the law required. Their works are
 evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and
 they are recognized as the children of God."—"The Desire of
 Ages," page 638.
    4. The word "everlasting" in verses 41 and 46, and the
 word "eternal" in verse 46, are the same word in the original.
 It must be understood in each case as everlasting in effect.
 The fire will be everlasting in effect by consuming the wicked,
 as Malachi 4 says it shall "burn them up," and "they shall
 be ashes under the soles of your feet." Verses 1, 3. The
 punishment thus inflictedswill be everlasting in effect — there
 will be no recovery from this destruction. Life can be ever-
 lasting in effect, only by never being cut off. In short, there
 are only two results — everlasting death and everlasting life.
 The means and process of producing death need not be con-
 fused with the result — death.

                            Notes
  1. Matthew's wonderful record of the teachings and mira-
cles of Jesus is largely closed with chapter 25. The remaining
four chapters narrate the events connected with the betrayal,
crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, closing with the great
world commission to His disciples. The words of Jesus at the
opening of our lesson are filled with sublime pathos, fore-
shadowing as they did the solemn events then near at hand.
  2. The person mentioned by Luke as "one of the Pharisees"
was Simon the leper. He is called Simon by Jesus in Luke's
record, chapter 7, verse 40 and onward. He had been healed of
his leprosy by Jesus, but had not yet fully accepted Jesus as
the Saviour. See "The Desire of Ages," page 557.
   3. At this feast, there sat with Jesus both Simon, the
healed leper, and Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the
dead. Then Mary also, who had been cleansed of seven devils,
and had been led into sin by this same Simon the leper, was
there to pour out her soul in deep gratitude for the forgive-
ness of sins,•as symbolized by the precious ointment she used.
Simon, too, repented on this occasion, and obtained forgive-
ness. Wonderful gathering of objects of Jesus' mercy at this
His last visit to Bethany!
   4. "Simon was touched by the kindness of Jesus in not
openly rebuking him before the guests. He had not been
treated as he desired Mary to be treated. He saw that Jesus
did not wish to expose his guilt to others, but sought by a
true statement of the case to convince his mind, and by pitying
kindness to subdue his heart. Stern denunciation would have
hardened Simon against repentance, but patient admonition
convinced him of his error. He saw the magnitude of the
debt which he owed his Lord. His pride was humbled, he
repented, and the proud Pharisee became a lowly, self-sacri-
ficing disciple."—"The Desire of Ages," pages 567, 568.

                           Notes
   1. The expression "He sat down" reads literally, in the
original, "He was reclining," that is, at table, according to
the customs of the times to recline on couches while eating.
The Revised Version reads, "He was sitting at meat," which
gives the true idea.
   2. This answer of Jesus does not necessarily point out the
individual traitor. As they were eating the Passover supper,
all would dip unleavened bread and bitter herbs into a dish of
sauce made up probably of fruits and vinegar. Judas could
hardly be pointed out by Jesus' words unless he was dipping
with Jesus at the particular time He spoke. It is more likely
that Jesus was here giving the substance of the prophecy
quoted in John 13: 18, without identifying the individual. It
was after this that Judas asked if he was the betrayer. See
 also Luke 22: 21.
   3. "Judas the betrayer was present at the sacramental serv-
ice. He received from Jesus the emblems of His broken body
and His spilled blood. He heard the words, 'This do in remem-
 brance of Me.' And sitting there in the very presence of the
 Lamb of God, the betrayer brooded upon his own dark pur-
 poses, and cherished his sullen, revengeful thoughts.
   "At the feet-washing, Christ had given convincing proof
 that He understood the character of Judas. 'Ye are not all
I0         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

clean,' He said. These words convinced the false disciple
that Christ read his secret purpose. . .
  "As they realized the import of His words, and remembered
how true His sayings were, fear and self-distrust seized them.
They began to search their own hearts to see if one thought
against their Master were harbored there. With the most
painful emotion, one after another inquired, 'Lord, is it I?'
But Judas sat silent. John in deep distress at last inquired,
`Lord, who is it?' And Jesus answered: 'He that dippeth his
hand with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me. The Son
of man goeth as it is written of Him: but woe unto that man
by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for
that man if he had not been born.' The disciples had searched
one another's faces closely as they asked, 'Lord, is it I?' And
now the silence of Judas drew all eyes to him. Amid the con-
fusion of questions and expressions of astonishment, Judas
had not heard the words of Jesus in answer to John's question.
But now, to escape the scrutiny of the disciples, he asked as
they had done, 'Master, is it I?' Jesus solemnly, replied,
`Thou hast said.'
  "In surprise and confusion at the exposure of his purpose,
Judas rose hastily to leave the room. !Then said Jesus unto
him, That thou doest, do quickly. . . . He then having re-
ceived the sop went immediately out: and it was night.'
Night it was to the traitor as he turned away from Christ
into the outer darkness."—"The Desire of Ages," pages 653,
654.
  4. "Christ was standing at the point of transition between
two economies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless
Lamb of God, was about to present Himself as a sin offering,
and He would thus bring to an end the system of types and
ceremonies that for four thousand years had pointed to His
death. As He ate the Passover with His disciples, He insti-
tuted in its place the service that was to be the memorial of
His great sacrifice. The national festival of the Jews was to
pass away forever. The service which Christ established was
to be observed by His followers in all lands and through all
ages."—"The Desire of Ages," page 652.

  17. What did Jesus say further to the disciples? Verse

                        Notes
   1. Over the dark Kidron passed David in sorrow and agony
in his flight from Jerusalem a thousand years before; over
the Kidron to His awful agony for a lost world passed David's
Son, the promised Seed. Gethsemane was an inclosure at the
foot of the Mount of Olives. Here our Lord was accustomed
to go with His disciples for prayer and instruction. Little
did they realize the meaning of this last journey across the
historic brook.
   2. The humanity of our Lord shrank from the awful agony
before Him; not the physical suffering alone; not the mock-
ing, the shame, the anguish; but from the awful sense of sin
which hid the Father's face, and weiglied upon the Son of
man like the agony of a lost soul. No wonder He prayed that
if possible the cup be removed. God did not condemn Him
for that. He does not condemn us when. we, in human weak-
ness, pray for deliverance from some.awful trial. God pities
and loves us still; "for He knoweth our frame; He remem-
bereth that we are dust." He loved not less His Son in dark
Gethsemane than on the shining mount of transfiguration.
   3. The angel could not lessen the load, could not take the
burden upon the Saviour's heart, could not bear the cross,
though he would willingly have done so; but he brought
strengthening grace and cheer from the throne. Even so with
us. For our own good, there may be burdens, heavy to bear,
laid upon us, that we may draw needed strength from the
infinite Source.
   4. "The hour is come." Mark 14: 41. The long delayed
hour had come, the crisis of the world, when divinity, com-
passed about with the infirmities of humanity, met its su-
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY .               13
preme test. The Saviour had anticipated the struggle before;
He had talked of it with Moses and Elijah; He had poured
out His soul in prayer during entire night seasons concern-
ing it; now the reality had come.
   "Yet a third time He left them, to pray as before. And
now He returned victorious. After three assaults had the
tempter left Him in the wilderness; after the threefold con-
flict in the garden he was vanquished. Christ came forth
triumphant. No longer did He bid His disciples watch. They
might — nay, they should — sleep and take rest, ere the near
terrible events of His betrayal — for the hour had come when
the Son of man was to be betrayed into the hands of sinners."

  15. What does the record say all the disciples did?
Matt. 26: 56, last .part.
                             Notes
   1. Judas could hardly have played the part of a betrayer
better. His words of greeting mean literally, Rejoice, Rabbi,
or, Be well, Rabbi. He had given the mob a sign —"Whom-
soever I shall kiss." The record says he "kissed Him." But
the latter word "kiss" is an intensive form, meaning he kissed
Him fondly or heartily.
   "Judas did not, however, believe that Christ would per-
mit Himself to be arrested. In betraying Him, it was his
purpose to teach Him a lesson. He intended to play a part
that would make the Saviour careful thenceforth to treat
him with due respect. But Judas knew not that he was giving
Christ up to death. How often, as the Saviour taught in
parables, the scribes and Pharisees had been carried away
with His striking illustrations! How often they had pro-
nounced judgment against themselves! Often, when the truth
was brought home to their hearts, they had been filled with
rage, and had taken up stones to cast at Him; but again and
again He had made His escape. Since He had escaped so
many snares, thought Judas, He certainly would not now
allow Himself to be taken.
   "Judas decided to put the matter to the test. If Jesus really
was the Messiah, the people, for whom He had done so much,
would rally about Him, and would proclaim Him king. This
would forever settle many minds that were now in uncer-
tainty. Judas would have the credit of having placed the
king on David's throne. And this act would secure to him
the first position, next to Christ, in the new kingdom."—"The
Desire of Ages," pages 720, 721.
   2. The import of the words, "Suffer ye thus far," spoken to
His captors, seems to be as if Jesus said, "Bear with Me a
little till I correct Peter's mistake." The officers were al-
ready laying hands upon Him ; but He would have them desist
a little, till He did one more deed of mercy. Sublime nobility
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 15
and matchless love, that could put forth to heal the wound of
an enemy, that very hand which was so soon to be pierced
through by the cruel nail upon the cross! Dark and dead
must have been the souls of men who could remain unmoved
at so divine a deed.
  3. The Master was not seized because He could not escape.
More than once during His ministry, He "passed out of the
midst" of those 'who would do Him violence. He did not
need any physical protection by His disciples; for if it were
necessary, or in keeping with the occasion, He could receive
from the Father more than twelve legions of angels for His
deliverance. But His hour had come, and He suffered Him-
self to be taken. It was a completely voluntary act on' His
part.
   4. Jesus knew how severe a test it would be to His dis-
ciples to see their Master seized and taken away by His
murderers. It was for this reason He had bidden them
watch and pray that last night in Gethsemane, lest they enter
into temptation. Always thus mindful of others, He re-
quested that the disciples be permitted to depart.

                           Notes
  1. John's record (John 18: 14) identifies this Caiaphas as
the one who had declared that it was expedient that one man
should die for the people. The occasion of this utterance is
found in John 11: 47-54, where it is said that the expression
did not originate with Caiaphas, but that as high priest, he
had been used of the Lord to utter a prophecy concerning
Jesus' death. Now he takes a leading part, by illegal and
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  17
unbecoming means, in bringing about the condemnation of
Jesus.
   2. Peter's first mistake was that he "followed Him afar off,"
and then "sat with the servants" instead of openly following
his Master into the trial room as John did. John 18: 15.
Here the rougher element would be gathered, and this bad
company became the means of his downfall, though his own
lack of courage brought him into the place of trial.
   3. According to Jewish law, as cited in the "Cambridge
Bible for Schools and Colleges," "the penalty for procuring
false witnesses was death." Other violations of these rules
were, "the trial by night, the sentence on the first day of
trial, the trial of a capital charge on the day before the
Sabbath, the suborning of witnesses, the direct interrogation
by the high priest." Also, "the condemned was not to be
executed on the day of his. trial."
   4. When asked directly by the proper person to declare
His identity, Jesus did not hesitate to answer. His words,
"Thou hast said," are equivalent to an affirmative answer, as
when He used the same expression in answering Judas in
verse 25.
   5. Luke says (Luke 22: 61) that when the cock crew, "the
Lord turned, and looked upon Peter." That sad, tender look
melted the heart of Peter to sincere repentance. He went out
where he could be alone, and wept aloud bitterly, as the ex-
 pression means.

                            Notes
   1. The Jewish leaders thirsted for the life of Jesus.
Though the Sanhedrin could come to the decision that 14e
was worthy of death, it had not the authority to carry out
its own sentence. The leaders therefore took counsel as to
how they could present Jesus to the Roman governor so as
to secure His condemnation. Their charge against Him must
be a political one. Evidently they made the charge of con-
spiracy against Caasar.
   2. There are several things which show that the repent-
ance of Judas was not of the genuine kind that brings re-
mission of sins: 1. It did not come till he saw that Jesus was
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  19

condemned — it was based on consequences, not on the sin-
fulness of betrayal. 2. If the repentance had been of the
right kind, he would not have taken his own life. 3. The
word "repented" used here is not the usual one for repent-
ance of sin, but rather denotes a growing anxious over a
thing after it is done, and could very properly be rendered
here "filled with regret or remorse."
    3. This is a striking example of straining at a gnat and
swallowing a camel. See Matt. 23: 24. It was a matter for
serious counsel what to do with this "tainted" money —
tainted by themselves in taking it out of the Lord's treasury
and using it to bribe the betrayer of Jesus. It was not
"lawful" to put it back into the treasury, but it was lawful
to murder the innocent Son of God. "We have a law, and
by our law He ought to die." John 19: 7.
    4. Jesus' answer, "Thou sayest," is similar to that used be-
fore Caiaphas when urged to say whether He was the Son
of Grid or not. See Matt. 26: 64. It is equivalent to an af-
firmative answer. Jesus could not deny that He was the Son
 of God or King of the Jews.
    5. "Pilate expected an answer. He knew the substantial
 falsehood of both charges, but he would have them met by
 a reference to well-known facts, that he might have osten-
 sible grounds for requittal, which from first to last it was
 evidently his wish to pronounce. But our Lord was silent."
 — Dean Mansel.
     6. "The Roman authorities at this time held a prisoner
 named Barabbas, who was under sentence of death. This man
 had claimed to be the Messiah. He claimed authority to
 establish a different order of things, to set the world right.
 Under satanic delusion, he claimed that whatever he could
 obtain by theft and robbery was his own. He had done won-
 derful things through satanic agencies, he had gained a fol-
 lowing among the people, and had excited sedition against the
  Roman government. Under cover of religious enthusiasm,
  he was a hardened and desperate villain, bent on rebellion and
  cruelty. By giving the people a choice between this man and
  the innocent Saviour, Pilate thought to arouse them' to a
  sense of justice. He honed to gain their sympathy for Jesus
  in opposition to the priests and rulers. So, turning to the
  crowd, he said with great earnestness, 'Whom will ye that I
  release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ??
     "Like the bellowing of wild beasts came the answer of the
  mob, Release unto us Barabbas. Louder and louder swelled
  the cry, Barabbas! Barabbas! Thinking that the people had
  not understood his question, Pilate asked. 'Will ye that I
  release unto you the King of the Jews?' But they cried out
  again, 'Away with this Man, and release unto us Barabbas!'
   `What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?'
20         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Pilate asked. Again the surging multitude roared like de-
mons. Demons themselves, in human form, were in the crowd,
and what could be expected but the answer, 'Let Him be
crucified'?"—"The Desire of Ages," page 733.

                            Notes
   1. In "The Desire of Ages," page 732, is found the fol-
lowing comment on the dream of Pilate's wife, Claudia Pro-
cula: "Pilate was not left to act blindly. A message from
God warned him from the deed he was about to commit. In
answer to Christ's prayer, the wife of Pilate had been visited
by an angel from heaven, and in a dream she had beheld the
Saviour and conversed with Him. Pilate's wife was not a
Jew; but as she looked upon Jesus in her dream, she had no
doubt of His character and mission."
   After describing how there passed before her in the dream
the scenes in the judgment hall, the crucifixion, and the second
coming of Christ in glory, the record continues: "With a cry
of horror she awoke, and at once wrote to Pilate words of
warning. While Pilate was hesitating as to what he should
do, a messenger passed through the crowd, and handed him
the letter from his wife, which read, 'Have thou nothing to
do with that just Man; for I have suffered many things this
day in a dream because of Him.' "
   2. The question, "What shall I do with Jesus?" is one• which
every man must ask himself and answer for himself. Pilate's
 mistake was in asking others what he should do with Jesus,
 and letting them answer it for him.
   3. The ceremony of washing the hands with water as a
 declaration of innocence was a familiar one to the Jews, and
 would be readily understood. See Deut. 21: 1-9 and Ps. 26: 6.
   4. "At this time a stranger, Simon a Cyrenian, coming in
 from the country, meets the throng. He hears the taunts and
 ribaldry of the crowd; he hears the words contemptuously
 repeated, Make way for the King of the Jews. He stops in
 astonishment at the scene; and as he expresses his compas-
 sion, they seize him and place the cross upon his shoulders.
   "Simon had heard of Jesus. His sons were believers in the
 Saviour, but he himself was not a disciple. The bearing of
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY'
the cross to Calvary was a blessing to Simon, and he was ever
after grateful for this providence. It led him., to take upon
himself the cross of Christ from choice, and ever cheerfully
stand beneath its burden."—"The Desire of Ages," page 742.
   5. "Golgotha. This is a Hebrew word, signifying the place
of a skull. This is the word which in Luke is called Calvary.
The original Greek, there, also means a skull. The word
calvary is a Latin word meaning skull, or place of skulls. It
is not known certainly why this name was given to this place.
Some have supposed that it was because the mount resembled
in shape a human skull. The most probable opinion, however,
is that it was a place of execution; that malefactors were
beheaded there or otherwise put to death, and that their bones
remained unburied or unburned. Golgotha, or Calvary, was
probably a small eminence on the northwest of Jerusalem,
without the walls of the city, but at a short distance. Jesus
was put to death out of the city, because capital punishments
were not allowed within the walls."— Barnes's Notes.
   The vinegar mingled with gall, or wine drugged with myrrh,
as Mark gives it, was "a drink given by a merciful custom
before execution to deaden the sense of pain. . . . Jesus de-
clines the drink, desiring to suffer with a clear mind."—
Bruce.
   On this point, "The Desire of Ages," page 746, says: "He
[Jesus] would receive nothing that could becloud His mind.
His faith must keep fast hold upon God. This was His only
strength. To becloud His senses would give Satan an ad-
vantage."
   6. "The evangelists differ in the account of this title.,Mark
(15: 26) says it was 'The King of the Jews'; Luke (2: 38),
`This is the King of the Jews'; John (19: 19), `Jesus of
Nazareth the King of the Jews.' -But the diff'i'culty may be
easily removed. John says that the title was written in
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. It is not at all improbable that
the inscription varied in these languages., One evangelist
may have translated it from the Hebrew, another from the
Greek, a third from the Latin, and a fourth may have trans-
lated one of the inscriptions a. little differently from another.
Besides, the evangelists all agree in the main point of the
inscription; viz., that He was the King of the Jews."—

                            Notes
   1. "The enemies of Jesus vented their 'rage upon Him as
 He hung upon the cross. Priests, rulers, and scribes joined
 with the mob in mocking the dying Saviour. At the baptism
 and at the transfiguration, the voice of God had been heard
 proclaiming Christ as His Son. Again, just before Christ's
 betrayal, the Father had spoken, witnessing to His divinity.
 But now the voice from heaven was silent. No testimony in
 Christ's favor was heard. Alone He suffered abuse and
 mockery from wicked men."—"The Desire of Ages," page 746.
   2. The first part of verse 40 doubtless refers to the false
 testimony against Jesus at His trial, as recorded in Matt.
26: 59-61. What He did say and mean is found in John
2 : 18-21.
   The expression, "If Thou be the Son of God," in the second
part of verse 40, recalls the temptation scene in the wilder-
ness, in which Satan personally sought to overcome Jesus.
Then Jesus was weakened through fasting forty days, and
Satan would take advantage of His condition. Here at the
cross also he again sought to make Jesus' intense suffering
an occasion for gaining long coveted superiority over Him.
"The Desire of Ages," page 746, says on this point: "Satan
with his angels, in human' form, was present at the cross.
The archfiend and his hosts were cooperating with the priests
and rulers. The teachers of the people had stimulated the
ignorant mob to pronounce judgment against One upon whom
many of them had never looked until urged to bear testimony
against Him. Priests, rulers, Pharisees, and the hardened
rabble were confederated together in a satanic frenzy. Re-
ligious rulers united with Satan and his angels. They were
doing his bidding."
   3. "To Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one
gleam of comfort. It was the prayer of the penitent thief.
Both the men who were crucified with Jesus had at first
railed upon Him; and one, under his suffering, only became
more desperate and defiant. But not so with his companion.
This man was not a hardened criminal; he had been led astray
by evil associations, but he was less guilty than many of those
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  25

who stood beside the cross reviling the Saviour. He had seen
and heard Jesus, and had been convicted by His teaching,
but he had been turned away from Him by the priests and
rulers. Seeking to stifle conviction, he had plunged deeper
and deeper into sin, until he was arrested, tried as a criminal,
and condemned to die on the cross. . . .
   "When condemned for his crime, the thief had become
hopeless and despairing; but strange, tender thoughts now
spring up. He calls to mind all he has heard of Jesus, how
He has healed the sick and pardoned sin. He has heard the
words of those who believed in Jesus and followed Him weep-
ing. He has seen and read the title above the Saviour's head.
He has heard the passersby repeat it, some with grieved,
quivering lips, others with jesting and mockery. The Holy
Spirit illuminates his mind, and little by little the chain of
evidence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and
hanging upon the cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh
away the sin of the. world. Hope is mingled with anguish
in his voice as the helplesp, dying soul casts himself upon a
dying Saviour. 'Lord, refilember me,' he cries, 'when Thou
comest into Thy kingdom.'
   "Quickly the answer came. Soft and melodious the tone,
full of love, compassion, and power the words: Verily I say
 unto thee to-day, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise."—"The
 Desire of Ages," pages 749, 750.
    4. "In that thick darkness God's presence was hidden. He
 makes darkness His pavilion, and conceals His glory from
 human eyes. God and His holy angels were beside the cross.
 The Father was with His Son. Yet His presence was not
 revealed. Had His glory flashed forth from the cloud, every
 human beholder would have been destroyed. And in that
 dreadful hour, Christ was not to be comforted with the
 Father's presence. He trod the winepress alone, and of the
 people there was none with Him.
    "In the thick darkness, God veiled the last human agony
 of His Son. All who had seen Christ in His suffering had
 been convicted of His divinity. That face, once beheld by
 humanity, was never forgotten. As the face of Cain ex-
 pressed his guilt as a murderer, so the face of Christ re-
 vealed innocence, serenity, benevolence,— the image of God.
 But His accusers would not give heed to the signet of heaven.
 Through long hours of agony, Christ had been gazed upon
 by the jeering multitude. Now He was mercifully hidden
 by the mantle of God."—"The Desire of Ages," pages 753, 754.
    5. "All His life, Christ had been publishing to a fallen
 world the good news of the Father's mercy and pardoning
  love. Salvation for the chief of sinners was His theme.
  But now with the terrible weight of guilt He bears, He can-
  not see the Father's reconciling face. The withdrawal of
  the divine countenance from the Saviour in this hour of
26         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

supreme anguish pierced His heart with a sorrow that can
never be fully understood by man. So great was this agony
this His physical pain was hardly felt.
  "Satan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus.
The Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb.
Hope did not present to Him His coming forth from the grave
a conqueror, or tell Him of the Father's acceptance of the
sacrifice. He feared that sin was so offensive to God, that
Their separation was to be eternal. Christ felt the anguish
which the sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer plead
for the guilty race. It was the sense of sin, bringing the
Father's wrath upon Him as man's Substitute, that made the
cup He drank so bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of
God."— Id., page 753.
  6. The meaning here seems to be that graves were opened
by the earthquake, "and the dead were cast out of their
tombs" ("The Desire of Ages," page 756). Then when Jesus
arose on the morning of the resurrection, these saints came
back to life with Him at the time of the earthquake recorded
in Matt. 28: 2, and went forth to bear testimony of His res-
urrection, and to serve, like Moses, as a type of the general
resurrection of all who sleep in Jesus. See "The Desire of
Ages," page 786.
  7•. The seven sayings of Jesus on the cross form a remark-
able index to the Christ life, and a striking •epitome of
Christian experience:
   (1) "Father, ,forgive them; for they know not what they
do." Luke 23: 34.
   (2) "Woman, behold thy son!" "Behold thy mother!"
John 19: 26, 27.
   (3) "Verily I say unto thee to-day, Thou shalt be with
Me in Paradise." , Luke 23: 43.
   (4) "My God; My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"
Matt. 27: 46.
   (5) "I thirst." John 19: 28.
  (6) "It is finished." John 19: 30.
  (7) "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit."

                          Notes
1. The expression "ministering unto Him" should not be
understood as applying at the time of the crucifixion, but
28         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
during the Saviour's period of ministry among the people.
Luke introduces the idea much earlier, associating these
women with the twelve disciples, and declaring that they
"ministered unto Him of their substance." Luke 8: 2, 3.
This opens a chapter in the work of Christ not usually much
dwelt upon. These women "had been healed of evil spirits
and infirmities"; and as an expression of their gratitude
and devotion to the great Healer, they became His followers,
contributing and preparing food and clothing for the physical
comfort of Jesus and His disciples.
   2. Among these women were:
   (1) Mary Magdalene, out of whom Mark and Luke say
Jesus had cast seven devils, who is usually mentioned first
in each of the Gospels (John alone excepted), who was first
at the sepulcher on the morning of the resurrection, first
to discover that the tomb was empty, first to be addressed
by Jesus as He revealed to her His identity, first to carry
to the disciples, "as they mourned and wept,' the joyful news •
that Jesus had risen.
   (2) Mary the mother of James and Joses, generally ac-
cepted as identical with the one whom John calls "Mary the
wife of Cleophas," of whom but little is known.
   (3) The "mother of Zebedee's children," whose name is
given by Mark as Salome, and who was very probably iden-
tical with the woman mentioned in John 19: 25 as "His
mother's sister," that is, sister to Mary, the mother of Jesus.
In "The Desire of Ages," page 548, it is said that she "was
a follower of Christ, and had ministered to Him freely of
her substance." If it be true that Jesus' mother and John's
mother were sisters, it affords an added reason why Jesus
commended His mother to John's care at the cross, and why
John's mother made the special request for her sons to sit
next to Jesus in His kingdom.
  3. At this point John introduces Nicodemus, who "brought
a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound
weight," and adds, "Then took they [Joseph and Nicodemus]
the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the
spices." John 19: 39, 40. Thus did two rich men contribute
to the fulfillment of Isa. 53: 9, "He made His grave . . .
with the rich in His death."
   Nicodemus at first came to Jesus by night; but it was a
night which brought light to his soul. He next dared to
raise his voice before the Sanhedrin, demanding fair treat-
ment of Jesus. "Doth our law judge any man, before it
hear him, and know what he doeth?" he said. Now he comes
forward in this time of peril and utter need, to identify
himself with the Crucified One, who was lifted up.
  4. How singular that these murderers of Jesus should
remember His repeated prediction that He should rise again
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 29
in three days, while His own disciples, according to the
testimony of one of the most devoted of them, "knew not
the scripture, that He must rise again" (John 20: 9), but
were found mourning and weeping when Mary Magdalene
came to announce the resurrection, and even then "believed
not." Mark 16: 9-11.
  5. The surer the sepulcher, the surer the witness to the
resurrection.

  16. What message did He send to His brethren? Verse

                        Notes
  1. Here is definite, convincing testimony that the original
Sabbath of the fourth commandment was still observed by
the disciples of Christ.
  2. Some have difficulty with the expression "in the end of
the Sabbath," or "late on the Sabbath day," as given in both
the English and the American Revised Version. In nar-
rating the same event, Mark says, "when the Sabbath was
past"; Luke, "upon the first day of the week, very early
in the morning"; John, "the first day of the week . . .
early, when it was yet dark." Matthew's phrase may be
rendered, with authority of scholarship equal to any other,
"after the Sabbath."
  3. In the words of the angel, "as He said," there is a gentle
reproof to the women and the twelve disciples, who seem to
have forgotten, in their sorrow, that Jesus had said repeatedly
He should rise again the third day; while the chief priests
and the Pharisees, in their restless anxiety on the Sabbath,
remembered His prediction.

Christ be of good courage? Joshua 1: 9.
                             Notes
  1. By the base means of bribery, the priests had bargained
in a private way with Judas, a Jew and a disciple, for the
betrayal of Jesus. Now in a formal council, the vote was
taken to bribe heathen soldiers, with a large sum of money,
to circulate a false report about the resurrection of Jesus.
32         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   2. A stupid and self-contradictory lie. Who of the dis-
ciples would have dared attempt to break the Roman seal,
roll away the stone, and steal the body of Jesus, with an
armed guard set to watch against this very thing? If the
guard had fallen asleep, would not the removal of the body
have waked them? Or if it had not waked them, how would
they know who did it?
   3. By reporting that they fell asleep on guard duty, the
soldiers would proclaim their own death warrant, for the
Roman punishment for sleeping on guard was death. There-
fore the priests promised to "persuade" the governor — with
money, of course — thus using a corrupt disciple, corrupt
soldiery, and a corrupt governor to accomplish their wicked
end.
   4. "At the time appointed, about five hundred believers
were collected in little knots on the mountain side, eager to
learn all that could be learned from those who had seen Christ
since His resurrection. From group to group the disciples
passed, telling all they had seen and heard of Jesus, and
reasoning from the Scriptures as He had done with them.
Thomas recounted the story of his unbelief, and told how his
doubts had been swept away. [See John 20: 24-29.] Sud-
denly Jesus stood among them. No one could tell whence or
how He came. Many who were present had never before
seen Him; but in His hands and feet they beheld the marks
of the crucifixion; His countenance was as the face of God,
and when they saw Him, they worshiped Him.
   "But some doubted. So it will always be. There are those
who find it hard to exercise faith, and they place themselves
on the doubting side. These lose much because of their un-
belief."—"The Desire of Ages," page 819.
   5. The Revised Version reads, more exactly, "All authority
hath been given unto Me." Satan had questioned in heaven
the authority, or right of Jesus to participation in the counsels
of the Father to the exclusion of himself. He had usurped
the dominion of man over the earth, and offered it to Jesus as
one of the temptations in the wilderness. But "when he saw
Christ come forth in triumph [from the tomb], he knew that
his kingdom would have an end." ("The Desire of Ages,"
page 782.) By His incarnation, death, and resurrection, Jesus
had won undisputed authority in heaven and upon earth. He
therefore had full right to send forth His representatives to
win back His alienated subjects to His kingdom. His au-
thority was doubtless fully conferred on Him at the time of
 His acceptance by the Father, when He ascended for this
 purpose immediately after the resurrection.
   6. " 'Always' is literally 'all the days'; days of strength and
 of weakness, days of success and of failure, of joy and of
 sorrow, of youth and of age, days of life and day of death —
all the days."— Broadus.

                             Note
  This quarter's study brings to a climax the most wonder-
ful story of the most wonderful Personage among men, told
in what is in some respects the most wonderful narrative in
the Bible. If the end of the six quarters we have spent upon
the book of Matthew finds us with a clearer, fuller compre-
hension of the matchless life and teaching of Him whose
"name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God,
The everlasting Father, The Prince of peace,"— even Jesus,
our complete Saviour,— then we have reasons for the deepest
gratitude for the privilege of studying these wonderful
themes together, and for the blessing of the divine Giver
upon our efforts to know Him better. Let us determine to
read often Matthew's sublime story of King Jesus, and let
us press firmly on in the race that is set before us, till that
glad day when we shall behold our King in His matchless
beauty.

TEN REASONS WHY,i
EVERY CHURCH and COMPANY SHOULD
HAVE A CLUB OF THE SIGNS .0 <A .0•Jit
1. Because the Signs is our pioneer missionary
    paper, and every church needs equipment for'
    their missionary work.
2. Because it has demonstrated its effectiveness in
    soul winning; it has brought more people into
    the truth than any other publication.
3. Because it gives the great message a clear, defi-
    nite ring. Its strong doctrinal articles, stirring
    prophetic studies, interesting mission stories
    showing the progress of this movement, and its
    other departments, qualify it to enter any home
    as a representative Seventh-day Adventist.
4. Because the Signs is of invaluable assistance to
    the church in their missionary activities.
5. Because it is the church's connection with the
    field; the tool with which the church works.
6. Because it is the multiplication table of the
    church's missionary efforts.
7. Because the Signs is the church's evangelist
     where there is no living evangelist, and his in-
     dispensable helper where there is one.
8. Because people, including our relatives, will read
     the Signs when they cannot be reached in any
     other way.
9. Because every member can take from one to five
     or more copies, which can be read, and then
     passed on in their mission of winning souls. A
     believer should not be satisfied unless he is get-
     ting the benefits of its splendid sermons in their
     interesting variety every week.
10. Because the Signs does bring people into the
     truth.

Every church and every company should take a club of the Signs.
Every member should take at least two copies.
The Signs one year, $1.75. Two or more copies one year, each $1.20.
Two or more copies one year to separate addresses, each $1.25.
