                            Notes
   1. According to an Oriental custom, guests were invited
some time before the wedding took place, then summoned
when everything was ready for the ceremony. So here the
servants went out to call those who had been bidden. The
language in our text, "They would not come," seems a little
strong, considering the force our idiom gives to "would."
A more exact translation of the expression "would not" is,
"did not desire" or "were not disposed" to come.
   2. The second message of the king, with more detail, was
designed to awaken their desire to come; but they were in-
different, did not care to come, rather than "made light of
it" in the modern acceptation of these words.
  3. This statement anticipates the Saviour's final comment
on the parable, that many are called, but few are worthy to
be chosen. The sinner can never be worthy; but when Jesus
calls him, that call implies that His own worthiness will avail
for the sinner, for "worthy is the Lamb that was slain."
   4. Notice that the king was not thwarted in his plan
properly to celebrate his son's marriage. Since those to whom
he gave preference were not worthy, he filled their places
 with others not included in the first invitation. This was
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5

strikingly fulfilled in the rejection of Christ by the Jews, and
the response of the gentiles to the gospel call. It is equally
true of individuals to-day that when the gospel is rejected
by those who are favored with the first call, it is carried to
those who may, outwardly at least, seem of less promise.

                           Notes
   1. "The Herodians were a political party rather than a
religious sect. They were the partisans of the Idumean
dynasty, which, springing from heathenism, remained, in
taste, inclination, barbarity, and licentiousness, heathen still,
though from state policy they outwardly conformed to the
Jewish ritual observances."—"Oxford Helps to Bible Study."
   2. In this reply, Jesus drew a clear distinction between the
sphere of the church and the sphere of the state, and es-
tablished as a Christian principle an absolute separation of
one from the other. He was not laying down any new princi-
ple, but was putting into the form of a direct statement the
lesson which had already been taught in a concrete way in the
experience of the three worthies under Nebuchadnezzar's
rule in Babylon. During all the centuries since this state-
ment was made, there has been a more or less close union of
the church with the state, until the birth of the American
nation, when, for the first time, the principle enunciated by
Christ was adopted. For many years, an organized effort
has been made to reverse this new order of things, and to
use the power of the state to enforce the observance of re-
ligious dogmas. This has all been foretold in prophecy, and
the message against the beast and his image involves an
intelligent opposition to every effort to establish those false
principles which found their highest expression in the Middle
Ages, when the church and the state were but different as-
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7
pects of the same power, and the pope and the emperor were
bound together in the closest union.
  3. The use of this text by Jesus to prove the resurrection
of the dead is an indication of the depth of meaning and far-
reaching application of some scriptures which are entirely
overlooked by the ordinary mind. The argument runs thus:
Many years after the death of these three patriarchs, the
Lord said to Moses, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." The statement of Jesus, in
His use of this scripture, "God is not the God of the dead,
but of the living," instead of proving that these patriarchs
were then living in heaven, indicates that they were then
dead, but that a resurrection would be necessary in order that
they might be living again. Here is definite proof that those
who are in their graves are not regarded as living.

                             Notes
   1. The Pharisees stood in no more friendly relation with
the Sadducees than with the Herodians, but they could make
common cause with them in seeking to entrap Jesus. His
plain, pointed teaching had often rebuked bpth sects, and
they sought to break His influence as a teacher, and to dis-
prove His claim to being the Messiah, by entangling Him in
His talk — by leading Him to say something upon which they
could seize to condemn Him as an impostor. Disputes, too,
often arose between these sects, and they sometimes carried
these to Jesus, to secure His influence on one side or the other.
They never came to Him for any purpose without receiving
instruction, which, if heeded, would have worked salvation
for them.
   2. The Pharisees were much more concerned about the
technical classification of the commandments than about the
practical observance of them in \daily life. On artificial
grounds, they had divided the commandments of the law into
tilt; great and the small; and this lawyer in effect asked the
question, "What kind of commandment in the law is great?"
It i4; evident that his purpose was, to show to the people the
ignonee of this alleged prophet of Nazareth concerning
what the teachers of the synagogue regarded as a most im-
portant matter. Jesus, in His reply, brushed aside all these
merely technical distinctions, and taught the great principle
that love is the fulfilling of the law; and although He did
not in 'plain words reprove the Pharisees for substituting
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   9

formalism for a heart experience, yet His reply could not
fail to suggest their lack of that which is vital in religion.
   3. This is a very sweeping statement. Not only are the
first four commandments based on love to God, and the last
six on love to man; but all that the prophets wrote, and in
fact all that Jesus taught and the New Testament writers
wrote, was but the unfolding, in one way or another, of these
two great principles.
   4. "What think ye of Christ?" is a practical question,
which the Christian may ask himself every day. Our real
estimate of Christ is based upon experience in receiving and
appropriating the riches of His grace in our daily walk. We
should meditate much upon His character and words, for in
beholding we become changed into the same image.

                             Notes

  1. Moses was a giver and interpreter of the law. The
scribes and the Pharisees were successors to Moses, or pre-
tended to be. As Jesus goes on to show, their sitting in
Moses' seat was little more than a form.
   2. In directing the people to observe and do what the
Jewish teachers bade them, Jesus honored the office of "Moses'
seat"; but from what follows, we must understand the ex-
pression "all . . . whatsoever" to mean only that which was
in harmony with Moses' law. The teaching and the practice
of these interpreters of the law were so at variance that Jesus
bade the people, in brief, to do what the teachers said, but
not to do what the teachers did. This has an important ap-
plication to-day. The inconsistent life of a minister or teacher
excuses no one from observing what he teaches according
to the Word. The vital thing for us is to receive the im-
planted Word with meekness, and order our own lives accord-
ingly, leaving the Lord to deal with the inconsistencies of the
teacher.
  3. To the children of Israel, the Lord had given, through
Moses, the following direction concerning His words: "Thou
shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  11

as frontlets between thine eyes." Losing sight of the spiritual
meaning of this scripture, the Jews applied it literally in the
wearing of phylacteries: Of these, Carr, in his notes on
Matthew, says: "They were slips of parchment inscribed
with four portions of the law (Ex. 12: 3-10, 11-16; Deut.
6: 5-9; 11: 13-21) , inclosed in little cases or boxes made of
calfskin, and fastened by leather straps to the left arm and
on the forehead. . . . To make the phylacteries, or rather
the cases which contained them, broad and conspicuous, was
to assume a character of superior piety."
   4. The love of prominence, and the seeking of distinctive
titles, is contrary to the spirit of the gospel. Much greater
is the honor of being simply a servant of God, as the New
Testament writers often call themselves.

Verse 25.
  19. How can so blind a course be corrected? Verse 26.
                           Notes
  1. Repetition is one of the strongest ways of emphasizing.
It is a way that is much used in the Scriptures. It is an
idiom in the Hebrew of the Old Testament; as, "Blessing
I will bless thee." It is employed in the Greek of the New
Testament; as, "Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I
say, rejoice;" "Babylon is fallen, is fallen;" "Woe, woe, woe
to the inhabiters of the earth." In the twenty-third chapter
of Matthew, the woe pronounced upon the scribes and the
Pharisees is repeated seven times in the same words, and
uttered once with a little variation, making eight times in
all. We must conclude that the sins enumerated under these
woes are particularly offensive. They should be carefully
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   13

studied, lest the principle of some of them be found in our
own lives.
   2. Jesus does not condemn the zeal of the scribes and the
Pharisees in making proselytes, that is, worshipers, or con-
verts. Paul was a Pharisee of the most zealous type. When
converted, his zeal never flagged, carrying him to all parts
of the known world, through much peril and suffering, to
win souls to Christ. Jesus Himself traveled to and fro from
Bethany to Sidon, and from beyond Jordan to the coast,
seeking and saving the lost. It was the hypocritical example
and influence of the Pharisees over converts that Jesus
condemned.
   3. The avarice of the Pharisees is made plain in this twofold
denunciation. The gold of the temple and the gift on the altar
had commercial value. Taking advantage of religious scruples
for gain is one of the most wicked methods of the hypocrite.
Jesus encountered it on the occasion when He drove the money
changers and the stock dealers from the temple.
   4. Jesus does not here denounce scrupulous painstaking to
tithe the smallest income, as is shown by the next expression.
We cannot be too particular to render to God every whit that
belongs to Him as the special portion of our income that He
has asked. Our failure is, rather, to grow careless in this mat-
ter. But along with this, Jesus would have us heedful of
things of greater moment as affecting the building of char-
acter — the exercising of the Christlike qualities of impartial
judgment, of plenteous mercy, and of faith that works by love.
   5. The Revised Version states it thud: "Ye blind guides,
that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel !"

Verse 39.
                            Notes
  1. A more modern expression for "whited sepulchers"
would be "whitewashed tombs." According to the cere-
monial law, those who had touched anything belonging to
the dead were unclean. The Jews kept their tombs white-
washed, that they might be easily seen and avoided. It
served also to give them a pleasant outward appearance.
These tombs were a fitting symbol of persons wearing their
religion on the outside to conceal inner guilt.
  2. In a very proper sense, the Pharisees and scribes of
Christ's time were said to fill up the measure of their
fathers. They not only continued and added to the wicked
deeds of their fathers in their treatment of God's messengers,
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  15
 but they filled their nation's cup of iniquity so full, by re-
jecting and crucifying the Messiah, that this great cul-
minating crime marked their rejection as the peculiar people
of God.
   3. "By prophets, wise men, and scribes, our Lord intends
the evangelists, apostles, deacons, etc., who should be em-
 ployed in proclaiming the gospel; men who should equal the
ancient prophets, their wise men and scribes, in all the gifts
and graces of the Holy Spirit."— Clarke.
   4. The Jews of Christ's time were the more guilty because
they had a knowledge of what their fathers had done, and
condemned it, yet centered upon themselves the guilt of all
the blood of righteous men that had been shed from Abel
 down, by taking the life of the sinless Son of God.

Verse 14.
                          Notes

   1. In order to understand the teaching of Matthew 24,
especially to avoid confusing the sequence of events, we
should keep the following considerations in mind:
   a. The disciples had not given up the idea that Jesus
would deliver the Jews from the Roman yoke, and set up a
temporal kingdom of His own.
   b. The disciples were amazed when Jesus told them plainly
that not one of the stones in the magnificent temple walls
would be left upon another.
   c. Through parables and otherwise, Jesus had repeatedly
spoken of His coming again. This coming had been repre-
sented in type at the transfiguration, and in miniature at
the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, when the disciples and
the multitude thought He was in the very act of making.
Himself king. When Jesus left the temple the last time, He
had declared to the people that they would not see Him again
till they should say, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  17

of the Lord," thus calling up anew the scene of His tri-
umphal entry, and tending to revive the hope of the disciples
that they might see Him established in His kingship.
  d. Seemingly with the idea in mind that these three events
— the destruction of the temple, the coming of Jesus, and the
end of the world — might occur at the same time, the dis-
ciples inquire of Jesus privately-about "these things."
  e. There are two particular points in their question —
when shall these things take place, and what shall be the
sign of their approach?
  f. In His answer, Jesus "mingled the description of these
two events"— the destruction of Jerusalem and the second
coming of Christ -- giving the signs by which the time could
be discerned.
  g. Since events connected with the first advent of Christ,
culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem and the deliv-
erance of the Christians, resembled in many respects the
events that precede His second coming, many of the words
of Christ in answer to the disciples' question have a double
application: (1) to the events leading up to the destruction
of Jerusalem; (2) to the events leading up to the second
coming of Christ.
  "Jesus did not answer His disciples by taking up separately
the destruction of Jerusalem and the great day of His com-
ing. He mingled the description of these two events. Had
He opened to His disciples future events as He beheld them,
they would have been unable to endure the sight. In mercy
to them He blended the description of the two great crises,
leaving the disciples to study out the meaning for themselves.
When He referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, His pro-
phetic words reached beyond that event to the final confla-
gration in that day when the Lord shall rise out of His
place to punish the world for their iniquity, when the earth
shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
This entire discourse was given, not for the disciples only,
but for those who should live in the last scenes'of this earth's
history."—"The Desire of Ages," page 628.
  Ina general way, the answer of Jesus might be outlined
thus:
  Verses 4-20 apply primarily to Jerusalem, but also, in
large part, to the second advent.
  Verses 21, 22 apply to the persecution of Christians, es-
pecially during the Dark Ages.
  Verses 23-51 apply unmistakably to the last days.

   2. The disciples had been disturbed in mind by the words
of Jesus while yet in the temple, "Behold, your house is left
 unto you desolate." It did not seem possible to them that
so magnificent a structure as the temple would or could be
made desolate. Therefore on going out of the temple, they
called the attention of Jesus to the immense stones of the
temple, so firmly and compactly put together that the wall ap-
peared almost like solid rock. The great Nebuchadnezzar,
with his war machines, had not been able to break down much
of it, and all he did break down had been rebuilt. What
catastrophe could bring desolation to it now? Then came
Jesus' amazing answer.
  3. Observe that the disciples asked Jesus two questions,
or a double question: 1. "When shall these things be?" This
question evidently referred to what He had said in the hearing
of many about the throwing down of the temple walls. 2.
"What shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the
world?" There is no record that Jesus had_ spoken directly
of the end of the world in connection with the destruction of
the walls of the temple, but He had foreshadowed His second
coming in the triumphal entry, and had referred to the words
used on that occasion in telling the people when they should
see Him again. See Matt. 23: 39. These words, too, were
fresh in the minds of the disciples, so they asked Jesus at
the same time about the time of the throwing down of the
temple walls, and about the sign of His coming and the end
of the world, probably having it in mind that these three
events would occur together. As the question was a double
one, so also was the answer somewhat twofold, some passages
referring to the destruction of Jerusalem only, some to both
this and the last days, and some to the last days only.
  4. Josephus says that there were many who, pretending to
divine inspiration, deceived the people, leading out numbers
of them to the desert, pretending that God would there show
them the signs of liberty—meaning redemption from the
Roman power. See "Wars," book 2, chap. 3.
  "Christ's words were fulfilled. Between His death and
the siege of Jerusalem, many false messiahs appeared."—
"The Desire of Ages," page 628.
  That this prophecy applies also to the last days is evident
from its being virtually repeated in verses 23, 24. "The
Desire of Ages" continues: "But this warning was given
also to those who live in this age of the world. The same
deceptions practiced prior to the destruction of Jerusalem
have been practiced through the ages, and will be practiced
again."

  5. In the statement in this verse, as also in verses 13 and
14, Jesus does not draw a distinction between the end of
the Jewish nation and the end of the world, for the reason
that both are included. There is a striking parallel between
the events which led up to the destruction of Jerusalem and
the end of the Jewish nation before the generation then living
had passed away, and the events which lead up to the end of
the world and the personal advent of Christ. Hence some of
the leading signs which would mark the approaching end
of the Jewish nation would also, by their recurrence in the
latter days, serve as signs of the approaching end of the
world. Among these signs having a double application would
be strife among nations, and the proclamation of the gospel
throughout the world.

                             Notes
   1. The 2,300 prophetic days, or literal years, began with
the command to restore and build Jerusalem, in the spring of
457 B. C. Seventy weeks, or 490 full years, from that time,
reaches to the spring of 34 A. D., when Stephen was stoned
to death, the church at Jerusalem was scattered by perse-
cution, and the apostles "went everywhere preaching the
Word," to gentiles as well as to Jews.
   2. Christ caused "the sacrifice and the oblation to cease'',
by His death upon the cross, when the veil of the temple was
rent in twain, and the typical service of the sanctuary came
to an end. Of what Jesus formerly had called "My Father's
house," He said, shortly before HiS crucifixion, "Behold, your
house is left unto you desolate." Matt. 23: 38. "Desolate"
means unoccupied, empty after being occupied. God no
longer manifested His presence there.
  3. At the siege of Jerusalem, a pagan power, the Roman,
set up its own gods in the holy place,— fitting sequel to the
rejection of the Messiah by those who once were God's "pe-
culiar people"! This is what Jesus refers to as "the abomina-
tion of desolation," a type of the greater abominations to
follow in the Dark Ages. This "holy place" means a limited
space around the city occupied by the Roman army.
  4. Verses 21 and 22 cover the "long centuries of darkness"
between the destruction of Jerusalem and the second coming
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 21

of Christ, especially the period of persecution known as the
Dark Ages. (Compare Luke 21: 24.) "For more than a
thousand years, such persecution as the world had never
before known, was to come upon Christ's followers. Millions
upon millions of His faithful witnesses were to be slain.
Had not God's hand been stretched out to preserve His people,
all would have perished."—"The Desire of Ages," page 631.
   5. Commenting on verse 23, "The Desire of Ages," page
631, says: "Now, in unmistakable language, our Lord speaks
of His second coming, and He gives warning of dangers to
precede His advent to the world."

                             Notes
    1. The persecution of Christians had come to a close by
 the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1780 occurred the
 darkening-of the sun, known in history as the "Dark Day."
 It was followed the same night (May 19) by darkness of
 unparalleled density. In 1833 (November 13) occurred the
 falling of the stars.
   "The nineteenth of May, 1780, was unprecedented in New
 England for its great darkness. . . . The darkness extended
over several thousand square miles, though differing much
in intensity in different places. Nowhere, perhaps, was it
greater than in this vicinity. The day was appropriately
called, and is still known as, the 'Dark Day.' "—"History of
the Town of Hampton, New Hampshire," by Joseph Dorr,
Salem, Massachusetts, volume 1, page 217. Printed by the
Salem Press and Printing Company, 1893. (Boston Public
Library.)
   "But the year 1833 is memorable for the most magnificent
display [of falling meteors] on record. This was on the same
night of November [13] also, and was visible over all the
United States, and over a part of Mexico, and the West India
Islands. Together with the smaller shooting Stars, which
fell like snowflakes, and produced phosphorescent lines along
their course, there were intermingled large fireballs, which
darted forth at intervals, describing in a few seconds an arc
of thirty or forty degrees.
   "These left behind luminous trains, which remained in
view several minutes, and sometimes half an hour or more.
One of them seen in North Carolina appeared of larger size
and greater brilliancy than the moon. Some of the luminous
bodies were of irregular form, and remained stationary for a
considerable time, emitting streams of light.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 23

  "At Niagara the exhibition was especially brilliant, and
probably no spectacle so terribly grand and sublime was ever
before beheld by man as that of the firmament descending
in fiery torrents over the dark and roaring cataract."—"The
American Cyclopedia," article "Meteor," New York. D. Ap-
pleton and Company, 1891.
  2. Just what the "sign of the Son of man" will be is not
directly stated, but rather implied. Verse 30 speaks of Jesus
as "coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great
glory." The "clouds of heaven" are probably angels reflect-
ing the glory of heaven's courts. The first visible sign of
Christ's approach in the heavens will be a cloud of glory,
increasing in size and brightness as it comes nearer. This
may therefore be thought of as the very last and conclusive
sign of His coming, or as a part of the coming itself.
  3. "The sins that called for vengeance upon the antedilu-
vian world exist to-day. The fear of God is banished from
the hearts of men, and His law is treated with indifference
and contempt. The intense worldliness of that generation
is equaled by that of the generation now living. . . . God
did not condemn the antediluvians for eating and drinking;
He had given them the fruits of the earth in great abundance
to supply their physical wants. The sin consisted in taking
these gifts without gratitude to the Giver, and debasing them-
selves by indulging appetite without restraint. It was lawful
for them to marry. Marriage was in God's order; it was
one of the first institutions which He established. He gave
special directions concerning this ordinance, clothing it with
sanctity and beauty; but these directions were forgotten, and
marriage was perverted, and made to minister to passion. A
similar condition of things exists now. That which is lawful
in itself is carried to excess."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
page 101.

   13. Draw the contrast between the rewards of the two
servants. What causes led to the final reward of each?
                            Notes
  1. This very definite instruction of Jesus is directed to
His own servants, not to the world. There is danger that
those who have long been looking for the end, will become
drowsy, and fail to "watch." This time mentioned, the hour
when "your Lord doth come," therefore must apply espe-
cially to the close of probation, rather than to the personal
appearing of Jesus on the cloud.
  "Jesus has left us word, 'Watch ye therefore; for ye know
not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at mid-
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   25

night, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning; lest coming
suddenly He find you sleeping. And what I say unto you,
I say unto all, Watch.' [Mark 13: 35-37. Mark's record of
this same instruction we are studying in Matthew.] We are
waiting and watching for the return of the Master, who is to
bring the morning, lest coming suddenly He find us sleeping.
What time is here referred to? Not to the revelation of
Christ in the clouds of heaven to find a people asleep. No;
but to His return from His ministration in the most holy
place of the heavenly sanctuary."—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 2, page 190.
    2. These words of Jesus are a loving admonition to the
people who, apart from all others, are expecting their Lord.
He desires that we shall be prepared for this hour that comes
so suddenly upon all.
    "In a view given June 27, 1850, my accompanying angel
said: 'Time is almost finished. Do you reflect the lovely
image of Jesus as you should?' Then I was pointed to the
 earth, and saw that there would have to be a getting ready
 among those who have of late embraced the third angel's
message. Said the angel: 'Get ready, get ready, get ready.
 Ye will have to die a greater death to the world than ye have
 ever yet died.' I saw that there was a great work to do for
 them, and but little time in which to do it."—"Early Writ-
 ings," page 64.
    3. Not Jesus, nor the angels in heaven, nor God's people
 on the earth, know the day and hour when Jesus is to lay
 down His censer in the most holy place in the heavenly sanc-
 tuary. That perhaps most important day of all days to the
 children of men, the Father keeps in His own power. See
 Acts 1: 6, 7. On that day, the destiny of every soul is fixed
 for either weal or woe, life or death, beyond the possibility
 of recall. A most solemn hour!
     "When Jesus ceases to plead for man, the cases of all are
 forever decided. . . .. This time finally comes suddenly upon
 all, and those who have neglected to purify their souls by
 obeying the truth are found sleeping. They became weary
 of waiting and watching; then became indifferent in regard
  to the coming of their Master."—"Testimonies for the
  Church," volume 2, page 191.
                                          •
     4. The servant "ready" and "watching" when the gospel
  is being finished in all the world will be at work seeking to
  rescue perishing souls. His heart yearns for those without
  Christ, without hope of everlasting life. His life is dedicated
  to his Master for service. Heaven's blessing will rest upon
  such. They shall hear the words from Jesus' lips, "Well
 26         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 done, thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into
 the joy of thy Lord."
  5. "They [the evil servants] longed not for His appear-
ing, and thought there was no need of such continued, perse-
vering watching. They had been disappointed in their ex-
pectations, and might be again. They concluded that there
was time enough yet to arouse. They would be sure not to
lose the opportunity of securing an earthly treasure. It
would be safe to get all of this world they could. And in
securing this object, they lost all anxiety and interest in the
appearing of the Master. They became indifferent and
careless, as though His coming were yet in the distance. But
while their interest was buried up in their worldly gains, the
work closed in the heavenly sanctuary, and they were unpre-
pared."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 2, page 191.
   6. "If such had only known that the work of Christ in the
heavenly sanctuary would close so soon, how differently
would they have conducted themselves! how earnestly would
they have watched! The Master, anticipating all this, gives
them timely warning in the command to w'atch. He distinctly
states the suddenness of His coming [from His mediatorial
work]. He does not measure the time, lest we shall neglect
a momentary preparation, and in our indolence look ahead
to the time when we think He will come, and defer the
preparation. 'Watch ye therefore; for ye know not.' . . .
Those not found waiting and watching, are finally surprised
in their unfaithfulness. The Master comes, and instead of
being ready to open unto Him immediately, they are locked
in worldly slumber, and are lost at last."—"Testimonies for
the Church," volume 2, pages 191, 192.
   7. "I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so
needful, and were looking to the time of 'refreshing' and the
`latter rain' to fit them to stand in the day of the Lord, and
to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw in the time of
trouble [after the sudden coming of Jesus out of the heav-
enly sanctuary] without a shelter! They had neglected the
needful preparation, therefore they could not receive the re-
freshing that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of
a holy God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets,
and fail to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth, and
who are willing to believe that their condition is far better
than it really is, will come up to the time of the falling of
the plagues, and then see that they needed to be hewed and
squared for the building. But there will be no time then to
do it, and no Mediator to plead their cause before the•Father."

                           Notes
  1. "Then" refers to the time described/ in the previous
verses. There is a very evident relation(between this parable
and the theme of the preceding .1:esson\ Two notes sound
forth clearly throughout the parable and its application:
Watch and get ready. Watching — that is, keeping wide
awake — is the main essential to being ready. This repre-
sents a class of people who are looking for the coming Bride-
groom, and waiting to go out to meet Him. Note that all
the waiting ones are virgins — pure in faith. The parable
is therefore for the church, not for the hypocrites or the
heathen. In your study, watch for the one cause of the
failure of half the waiting ones.
  2. Mark the difference, in the parable, betWeen the prepara-
tion of the foolish and that of the wise, for on this differ-
ence turns the meaning of the whole parable: the foolish
"took no oil"; the wise "took oil." All had lamps, and the
lamps were all filled with oil to start with; but only half of
the virgins provided against delay in the coming of the
bridegroom.                      ottA.P tal
  3. In the parable, no blame isA attached to the virgins-4i--
Typtly for falling asleep; they all went to sleep. Yet the
peril of sleeping on the eve of the great and solemn event
just before them is evident from the outcome. If the foolish
had taken the time of the delay to go and replenish their
oil, instead of spending this time in sleep, they would have
gone in to the marriage with the wise.
   4. At first thought, the answer 01 the wise may seem
selfish. But these virgins were to have an important part
in making the wedding a success. Their first duty was, to
discharge this responsibility faithfully. It had to be an
individual work. So with the Christian: he cannot say to
another, Give me of your supply of grace; he is to go to
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  29
"them that sell," to the Source of grace, and buy for himself.
"Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the
Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they
shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness."
Eze. 14: 20.

                              Notes
  1. The introduction of this parable with "For" indicates
a continuation of the Saviour's theme as to how it will be at
His coming. The-par-able-of-the•faithful.and the evil-servant
in.-chapter_24would-seeni-to apply.primarily-10.leaders%-t-hase
made-responsible.for-others, and/shoTs the evil.result of-mis-
ustighthe.time_6f-delay.beforellie-LorTs.coming. The para-
ble of the ten virgins shows the danger of being thoughtless
or careless, during the tarrying time, in making necessary
a complete preparation for the Bridegroom's coming. -In
both-these-parables,-it. is-urged -that-the . only.mearts-of-satEty
is-to-wa,tch. Now this parable of tie ten talents shows how
to use the time till the Lord's return. The best way to watch
is to engage actively in work for the Lord.
   2. The lord is represented here as giving his goods to
each servant according to his ability. No more is required
of any man than the faithful, energetic use of his God-given
ability, whatever that ability may be. Ability, talents, grow
by use. It is not the Lord's plan that we merely preserve
from waste the ability He gives us, if that were possible, with-
out using it, but He expects an increase.
