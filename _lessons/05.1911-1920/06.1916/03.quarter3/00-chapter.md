Lessons on the Book of Acts
                 SENIOR DIVISION
                 THIRD QUARTER
                       1916
                     Introductory Note
   There are excellent reasons why our Sabbath schools should
give earnest study to the book of Acts. Some of these reasons
are:
   1. We have just completed an extended study of the life
and teachings of Jesus, and have felt afresh the spiritual up-
lift of that life and instruction. According to Acts 1: 1,
while Jesus was upon earth, He only "began both to do and
teach" what is comprehended in the gospel 'plan. He com-
mitted the finishing of the work to the apostles, and to us
"upon whom the ends of the world are come." The book of
Acts records the achievements of the early church in begin-
ning the work that Jesus left for His followers to do. Ours
is the finishing of that work.
   2. Jesus taught that it was expedient for us that He go
away, so that He might send the Holy Spirit to us. He bade
the disciples not to take up His work till the Holy Spirit
came. Then they were to carry the gospel to the ends of the
earth. The book of Acts records their waiting for "the
promise of the Father," the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,
and their going forth in its power, in the face of the greatest
difficulties, and winning a bountiful harvest of souls. That
was the "former rain." We are now in the time of the "latter
rain," and must renew the apostolic achievements in soul
winning.
   3. In order to accomplish such a work, we must employ the
same means as did the early disciples. Jesus provided the
means in authorizing us to follow up His work. "As My
 Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. . . . Receive ye the
 Holy Ghost." Jesus is ready to do His part in developing
last-day acts of the apostles, but they must be acts of the
 Holy Spirit, "whom the Father," said Jesus, "will send in My
 name." Our part is a preparation of heart to receive pente-
 costal power.
    4. Since we last studied the book of Acts in the Sabbath
 school, the new book by Mrs. E. G. White, "The Acts of the
 Apostles," has come from the press. It throws a flood of
4            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

light upon the Bible record, especially in its relation to our
own time. These lessons draw upon it freely, besides giving
references for reading by those who have the book.
   Shall we not "with one accord in prayer and supplication"
seek for copious showers of the latter rain, that the work
committed to the remnant church may be speedily finished?

hood, among our own friends and acquaintances. Note 5.
                              Notes
   1. That the "former treatise" refers to the Gospel of Luke
there can be little doubt. Both that Gospel and the Acts are
addressed to Theophilus. The content of Luke is what it is
said in Acts 1: 1, 2 to be. The two books connect historically,
Luke closing and the Acts beginning with the same instruc-
tion and event — the commission and the ascension. The lan-
guage and style of the two are very similar. "That the
author of both is Luke is the universal testimony of an-
tiquity."— Abbott's Commentary.
   2. There seems little doubt that Theophilus was a person of
note, since Luke uses the customary salutation for persons
holding high civil office or social rank. See Acts 23: 26; 24:
3; 26: 25. If we bear in mind the meaning of his name,
 friend of God, lover of God, it may help us to receive Luke's
testimony in the book of Acts as addressed to us personally
as friends of God.
   3. Perhaps the most wonderful fact that will face us all
through the book of Acts is that Jesus intrusted to converted
 sinners the mission of carrying on to completion the work He
 had begun. The entire book is a record of what He accom-
 plished through fallible man by the power of the Holy Spirit
 in the early rain, and is an example of what He can and will
 do in the time of the latter rain. See John 14: 12; 20: 21, 22.
    4. Doing and teaching must go together. In point of order,
 doing comes first. The principles of the gospel cannot be
6           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

learned except by doing, by experience, by living them. It
would be folly to attempt teaching what we have not learned.
   5. Unless the Christian is a witness for Christ in his own
home, and among his neighbors, unless he takes part in the
church missionary work in the community where he lives, it
would be folly to send him across the continent to work for
strangers, or into heathen lands, where the darkness is still
denser, to teach and to preach the gospel. The true test of
love and service for Christ is found in the life at home.

                              Notes
   1. As Christians, it is our high privilege to "look stead-
fastly toward heaven" when the things of daily life press sore
upon us. Jesus our risen Lord is there, "at the right hand of
God," and "He is able also to save them to the uttermost that
come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make inter-
cession for them." Heb. 7: 25. As Jesus spent His life upon
earth ministering to human needs, so now He is spending His
life in heaven interceding for us. He is "parted from" us
in person, but "lo, I am with you alway" in spirit and in
power, He assures us.
   2. " 'I will come again, and•receive you unto Myself.' Those
who have loved Him and waited for Him, He will crown
with glory and honor and immortality. The righteous dead
will come forth from their graves, and those who are alive
will be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air.
They will hear the voice of Jesus, sweeter than any music
that ever fell on mortal ear, saying to them, Your warfare
is accomplished. 'Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 34.
   3. "As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the prom-
ise, they humbled their hearts in true repentance, and con-
fessed their unbelief."— Id., page 36.
   "The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness
to meet men, and in their daily intercourse to speak words
that would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differ-
ences, all desire for the supremacy, they came close together
in Christian fellowship. They drew nearer and nearer to
God, and as they did this, they realized what a privilege had
been theirs in being permitted to associate so closely with
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  9

Christ. Sadness filled their hearts as they thought of how
many times they had grieved Him by their slowness of com-
prehension, their failure to understand the lessons that, for
their good, He was trying to teach them.
  "These days of preparation were days of deep heart-search-
ing. The disciples felt their spiritual need, and cried to the
Lord for the holy unction that was to fit them for the work
of soul-saving. They did not ask for a blessing for them-
selves merely. They were weighted with the burden of the
salvation of souls. They realized that the gospel was to be
carried to the world, and they claimed the power that Christ
had promised."— Id., page 37.
  4. "Christ's visible presence was about to be withdrawn
from the disciples, but a new endowment of power was to be
theirs. The Holy Spirit -was to be given them in its fullness,
sealing them for their work."— Id., page 30.

  4. Who shall be saved? Verse 21.
                              Notes
  1. "Christ's ascension to heaven was the signal that His
followers were to receive the promised blessing. For this
they were to wait before they entered upon their work.
When Christ passed within the heavenly gates, He was en-
throned amidst the adoration of the angels. As soon as
this ceremony was completed, the Holy Spirit descended upon
the disciples in rich currents, and Christ was indeed glorified,
even with the glory which He had with the Father from
all eternity. The Pentecostal outpouring was Heaven's com-
munication that the Redeemer's inauguration was accom-
plished. According to His promise He had sent the Holy
Spirit from heaven to His followers, as a token that He
had, as priest and king, received all authority in heaven and
on earth, and was the Anointed One over His people."—'The
Acts of the Apostles," pages 38, 39.
   2. The "third hour of the day" was 9: 00 A. m., according
to Jewish reckoning. This was the hour of morning prayer.
Before this hour, the Jews did not partake of food; and on
festal days, such as Pentecost, they abstained from food and
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       11

drink till the sixth hour, noon. Peter refers to the early
hour as proof that the charge of drunkenness was contrary
to all probability. Compare 1 Thess. 5: 7.
  3. This is a special promise for our time. It includes
young men and women as well as old. The Spirit is not
promised in small measure, but God declares, "I will pour
out of My Spirit." It is a promise applying to the time when
special signs are being fulfilled, to the period just "before
that great and notable day of the Lord come." Is not the
time of the latter rain fully due?

  5. In what ought we to be steadfast? — In doctrine,
in fellowship, in breaking of bread, in prayer. Verse 42.
                            Notes
   1. David here voices beautifully the hope of every one who
dies in the Lord. His flesh "shall rest in hope," because
it was impossible that Jesus, the Life-giver, should be holden
of death. He passed through the portals of the tomb, and
"tasted death for every man." But He "arose triumphant"
over the foe of all mankind, death; and "at the last trump,"
He will call forth the sleeping saints, who shall arise from
their dusty beds "with songs and everlasting joy upon their
heads," and "sorrow and sighing shall flee away."
   2. To show that this prophecy did not refer to David him-
self, but to Christ, the "Holy One," Peter appealed to the
fact that David was still dead and in his tomb. Jesus had
been raised without seeing corruption, and was now exalted
at the right hand of God, shedding forth the Pentecostal
blessing promised when He ascended.
   "Peter did not refer to the teachings of Christ to prove
his position, because he knew that the prejudice of his hearers
was so great that his words. on this subject would be of no
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     13

effect. Instead, he spoke to them of David, who was re-
garded by the Jews as one of the patriarchs of their nation."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 41.
   3. Death could not hold Jesus in the tomb, neither can it
hold those who "sleep in Jesus." "For if we believe that
Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep
in Jesus will God bring with Him." 1 Thess. 4: 14. Some
will not even pass under the power of death at all, for "we
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord
. . . shall be caught up together with them [the dead in
Christ] in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
shall we ever be with the Lord." Verses 15, 17.
   4. By our lives, we are to witness that Jesus is not in the
tomb, but is a living Saviour, and that by the ministry of
His Spirit, He "always causeth us to triumph." We are to
be so linked up with His power, that He "maketh manifest
the savor of His knowledge by• us in every place"— by our
life, our words, our faithful distribution of truth-filled writ-
ings, our offerings, our children.
   5. If we are not experiencing the power of the Holy Spirit
in our lives, we are not living up to our high privileges; for
the prom,ise is to "as many as the Lord our God shall call."
We may obtain that power by the same means as did the
disciples on the day of Pentecost.

  1. "This unfortunate man had long desired to see Jesus,
that he might be healed; but he was almost helpless, and was
far removed from the scene of the great Physician's labors.
His pleadings at last induced some friends to bear him to the
gate of the temple; but upon arriving there, he found that
the One upon whom his hopes were centered, had been put to
a cruel death.
  "His disappointment excited the sympathy of those who
knew for how long he had eagerly hoped to be healed by
Jesus; and daily they brought him to the temple, in order
that passers-by might be induced by pity to give him a trifle
to relieve his wants."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pages
57, 58.
  2. Greater than our material gifts for the carrying of the
gospel, is the outflowing of words of truth and power, and
deeds of kindness. We can tell the story "Saved by grace,"
16           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

and become channels of spiritual light and power to those
who are in darkness.
  3. We do not praise God enough. The story is told of a
man's horses' becoming frightened as he was driving with his
family to church. As the horses ran, the carriage wheels
came within an inch of running off a high bridge. At church
he arose and bore testimony of gratitude to God for deliver-
ance. A brother then arose, saying he had still greater
reason to be thankful, for his horses brought him quietly to
the place of meeting.
  4. "I. Faith performs the miracle (Peter and John). 11.
Faith experiences the miracle (the lame man). I11. Faith
comprehends the miracle (the believing hearers)."— Lange.

                             Notes
    1. The grievance of the priests and Sadducees was twofold:
 first, because Peter and John "taught the people"• second,
 because they preached the resurrection of the dead. 'The first
 grievance was chiefly that of the priests, who were the au-
 thorized teachers of the people, and who denounced any man
 who ventured to teach without "having learned" in the rab-
 binical schools and received the proper credentials; for if
 this were allowed, their own influence would be in jeopardy.
 The second grievance was especially that of the Sadducees,
 who did not believe in the resurrection, though both priests
 and Sadducees were put to confusion by the undisputed resur-
 rection of Jesus, whom they had condemned and crucified.
    2. This was evidently a formal gathering of the Sanhe-
 drin, before which Peter and John were brought for trial,
 and in the same place where Jesus had been tried.
   3. In comparing these verses with the original prophecy
 in the second psalm, two differences will be noted: first, the
 changing of the verbs from present to past time, since the
 prophecy is regarded as fulfilled; second, the use of "Christ"
 instead of "anointed," these two words meaning the same
 thing.
   4. It is worthy of note that this first recorded prayer of the
church was most impressively answered.
   5. The great harvest of souls on this occasion and on the
day of Pentecost was not the result of merely the day's
preaching. In reference to the work of Peter and John, we
have this testimony:
   "Thus the disciples preached the resurrection of Christ.
Many among those who listened were waiting for this testi-
mony; and when they heard it, they believed. It brought to
their minds the words that Christ had spoken, and they took
their stand in the ranks of those who accepted the gospel.
The seed that the Saviour had sown sprang up and bore
fruit."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 60.
   In reference to the day of Pentecost:
   "During His life on this earth, He [Jesus] had sown the
seed of truth, and had watered it with His blood. The con-
versions that took place on the day of Pentecost were the
result of this sowing, the harvest of Christ's work, revealing
the power of His teaching."— Id., page 45.
   It is the privilege of every one to sow seed continually, so
that when the Word is preached with power, there may re-
sult a large ingathering of souls.
   6. Peter was here witnessing fearlessly for Christ, in the
very room where he shamefully denied His Lord, and before
many of the same men who were present then. God, in His
mercy, had brought him over the same experience, with the
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 19

uifference that Peter himself was now on trial, and had given
him the opportunity to turn defeat into victory.
    "Those present who remembered the part that Peter had
acted at the trial of his Master, flattered themselves that he
could now be intimidated by the threat of imprisonment and
death. But the Peter.who denied Christ in the hour of His
greatest need was impulsive and self-confident, differing
widely from the Peter who was brought before the aii-
hedrin for examination. Since his fall, he had been con-
verted. He was no longer proud and boastful, but modest
and self-distrustful. He was filled with the Holy -Spirit;
and by the help of this power, he was resolved to remove the
stain of his apostasy by honoring the name he had once dis-
owned."— Id., page 63.
   7. It must be borne in mind that while Peter and John had
not received a rabbinical education, and were of the lay class
rather than the priesthood, yet for three years they had been
in the most wonderful school and under the greatest Teacher
the world has ever known. There is no justification, in this
passage, for our remaining in ignorance because the truth
found us there; but there is evidence that God can signally
use those who have little natural or cultivated ability, if
they are consecrated to Him, yoke up with Christ in earnest
study of His teachings, and open a repentant heart to the
working of His Spirit.
   8. The leaders of the church had _encountered serious ob-
stacles in their work of witnessing for Jesus. They reported
the circumstances to the company of believers, and they all
"lifted up their voice to God with one accord," pleading His
rulership over earth as well as heaven, and basing their en-
treaty on the Word. They were heard immediately, and the
response came with power.
   9. The authorities had "let go" the apostles, but on condi-
tion that they stop doing what they had plainly said they
could not help doing. Now, lest their courage might fail
under these new and harder conditions, they laid the situation
before the believers, and they all prayed with one accord for
boldness to do the very thing they had been commanded, with
threats, not to do. That they were right in praying thus is
shown by the remarkable answer they received, and its after
effect upon them; for "they spake [literally, kept on speak-
ing] the word of God with boldness."

                             Notes
  1. "In sharp contrast to the example of benevolence shown
by the believers, was the conduct of Ananias and Sapphira,
whose experience, traced by the pen of inspiration, has left
a dark stain upon the history of the early church. With
others, these professed disciples had shared the privilege of
hearing the gospel preached by the apostles. They had been
present with other believers when, after the apostles had
prayed, 'the place was shaken where they were assembled to-
gether; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.' Deep
conviction'had rested upon all present; and under the direct
influence of the Spirit of God, Ananias and Sapphira had
made a pledge to give to the Lord the proceeds from the sale
of certain property.
  "Afterward, Ananias and Sapphira grieved the Holy
Spirit by yielding to feelings of covetousness. They began to
regret their promise, and soon lost the sweet influence of the
blessing that had warmed their hearts with a desire to do
large things in behalf of the cause of Christ. They thought
they had been too hasty, that they ought to reconsider their
decision. They talked the matter over, and decided not to
fulfill their pledge. They saw, however, that those who
parted with their possessions to supply the needs of their
poorer brethren, were held in high esteem among the be-
22          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

lievers; and ashamed to have their brethren know that their
selfish souls grudged that which they had solemnly dedicated
to God, they deliberately decided to sell their property, and
pretend to give all the proceeds into the general fund, but
really to keep a large share for themselves. Thus they
would secure their living from the common store, and at the
same time gain the high esteem of their brethren."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pages 71, 72.
   2. "Infinite Wisdom saw that this signal manifestation of
the wrath of God was necessary to guard the young church
from becoming demoralized. Their numbers were rapidly in-
creasing. The church would have been endangered if, in the
rapid increase of converts, men and women had been added
who, while professing to serve God, were worshiping mam-
mon. This judgment testified that men cannot deceive God,
that He detects the hidden sin of the heart, and that He will
not be mocked. It was designed as a warning to the church,
to lead them to avoid pretense and hypocrisy, and to beware
of robbing God."— Id., pages 73, 74.
   3. The Holy Spirit is the connecting link between heaven
and earth. Through it life and power and truth are com-
municated. It is by the Holy Spirit that the believer is to
be "sealed unto the day of redemption." It therefore must
not and cannot be trifled with. Men may deceive one another,
but God looks upon and into the heart. The grieving away of
the Holy Spirit brings spiritual and eternal death.
   4. The case of Ananias was a clear case of hypocrisy. He
was not compelled to contribute his property to the common
cause. He might keep his possessions, or he might sell them
and keep the money. Under the influence of the Spirit, he
pledged his property, but did not have the courage to keep
his pledge. Yet he loved the appearance of paying it, and
the esteem of men that would follow. So he adopted a course
of hypocrisy — attempted to serve God and mammon, with
the result that he lost both this life and the next. His wife,
"being privy" to the deed, met a like fate.

     2. "If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute
  you," Jesus had said to His disciples. This lesson recordg
  the first one of the many persecutions the apostles suffered
  as Jesus had forewarned them.
     3. "Some little time ago, a writer reported an interview he
  had had with Kang Yu Wei, the Chinese reformer, who had
  to flee for his life from Peking in 1898. He said: 'I asked
  Kang Yu Wei, who had studied the Gospels profoundly, what
  seemed to him the most striking quality in Jesus. He an-
  swered, somewhat to my surprise, that what appealed to him
.most in the personality of Jesus was His courage — the man-
  liness which could so quietly and dauntlessly face the hatred
  of so many of His fellow countrymen, the fierce enmity of the
  proud Pharisees, and above all, the certainty of death, and
  of the outward failure of His mission; the courage which
  undertook a work so constructive, the valor which could make.
 and could ask from others, such large sacrifices.' "—"Tarbell's
  Teachers' Guide," page 96.
     And what of the men who followed Jesus? Timid and
  weak at the outset, they became lionlike in their courage, as
  they went forward in the power of the Spirit to do the work
 that had been committed to them.
     4. "The high priest and those with him had 'called the
 council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel.'
. The priests and rulers had decided to fix upon the disciples
 the charge of insurrection, to accuse them of murdering
  Ananias and Sapphira, and of conspiring to deprive the
 priests of their authority. They hoped so to excite the mob
 that it would take the matter in hand, and deal with the dis-
 ciples as it had dealt with Jesus. They were aware that many
 who did not accept the teachings of Christ were weary of
 the arbitrary rule of the Jewish authorities, and anxious for
 some change. The priests feared that if these dissatisfied
 ones were to accept the truths proclaimed by the apostles, and
 were to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, the anger of the
 entire people would be raised against the religious leaders,
 who would then be made to answer for the murder of Christ.
 They decided to take strong measures to prevent this."—
 "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 80, 81.
     5. The apostles were again teaching in the temple, in
 obedience to a direct command of the angel. Their prompt-
 ness and earnestness were shown by their beginning to teach
 "early in the morning" after being released from prison,
 though they could hardly expect otherwise than that they
 should suffer for their obedience.
    "Although the apostles were miraculously delivered from
 prison, they were not saved from examination and punish-
 ment. Christ had said, when He was with them, 'Take heed
 to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils.' By
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   25
sending an angel to deliver them, God had given them a
token of His love, and an assurance of His presence. It was
now their part to suffer for the sake of the One whose
gospel they were preaching."— Id., page 81.

   1. "Tell the birds amidst the bursts of spring not to sing;
 tell the waters welling from the depths not to flow; tell the
 happy child not to laugh and jump; tell sun and stars not to
 shine; and when these have obeyed you, then tell the soul
 which has been baptized with the love of God that it must
 not speak of Him, arid it will laugh you to scorn. It cannot
 but speak what it has seen and heard."
   2. In the case of Peter and John, a direct issue was drawn
between obedience to man and obedience to God. The council
had charged them with threats "not to speak at all nor teach
in the name of Jesus." An angel of the Lord had said, "Go,
stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of
this life." When arrested and brought again before the
council, to account for their disobedience to its orders, Peter
answered simply, "We ought to obey God rather than men,"
thus giving us a working principle for all time. So long as
the commands of men in authority do not conflict with God's
commands, the Christian obeys.
   3. "In the history of prophets and apostles are many noble
examples of loyalty to God. Christ's witnesses have endured
imprisonment, torture, and death itself, rather than break
God's commands. The record left by Peter and John is as
heroic as any in the gospel dispensation. As they stood for
the second time before the men who seemed bent on their
destruction, no fear or hesitation could be discerned in their
words or attitude."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 81.
   4. In ourselves alone, we are unworthy to bear the name
of Christ at all. We might count it a great honor to be
adopted into some royal family and receive the king's name.
But Christ is a king, and we are adopted by faith into the
family of heaven, and bear His royal name. If Jesus "de-
spised the shame" He had to suffer for our sakes, how much
less should we be ashamed to suffer for Him! See Matt. 5:
11, 12.

                             Notes
  1. "The early church was made up of many classes of
people, of various nationalities. At the time of the outpour-
ing of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, 'there were dwelling at
Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under
heaven.' Among those of the Hebrew faith who were gath-
ered at Jerusalem were some commonly known as Grecians,
between whom and the Jews of Palestine there had long
existed distrust and even antagonism."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 87.
  2. Up to this time, the apostles themselves had looked after
the distribution of assistance to the needy. But the num-
ber of believers had now increased to such extent that if the
apostles continued to give personal attention to this work, it
would virtually mean that they should "leave the word of
God," and give all their time to business matters. This it did
not seem right to them to do.
  3. "These officers gave careful consideration to individual
needs as well as to the general financial interests of the
church; and by their prudent management and their godly
example, they were an important aid to their fellow officers
in binding together the various interests of the church into a
united whole."— Id., page 89.
  4. "Learned Jews from the surrounding countries were
summoned for the purpose of refuting the arguments of the
prisoner. Saul of Tarsus was present, and took a leading
part against Stephen. He brought the weight of eloquence
and the logic of the rabbis to bear upon the case, to convince
the people that Stephen was preaching delusive and dan-
gerous doctrines; but in Stephen he met one who had a full
understanding of the purpose of God in the spreading of the
gospel to other nations.
  "Because the priests and rulers could not prevail against
the clear, calm wisdom of Stephen, they determined to make
an example of him; and while thus satisfying their revenge-
ful hatred, they would prevent others, through fear, from
adopting his belief."— Id., page 98.
           SAMATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    29
   5. "The hearts of those who had been converted under the
labors of the apostles, were softened and united by Christian
love. Despite former prejudices, all were in harmony with
one another. Satan knew that so long as this union con-
tinued to exist, he would be powerless to check the progress
of gospel truth; and he sought to take advantage of former
habits of thought, in the hope that thereby he. might be able
to introduce into the church elements of disunion. Thus it
came to pass that as disciples were multiplied, the enemy
succeeded in arousing the suspicions of some who had for-
merly been in the habit of looking with jealousy on their
brethren in the faith, and of finding fault with their spiritual
leaders."— Id., pages 87, 88.
   6. It is worthy of note that those who were to handle the
finances of the church, should have three leading qualifica-
tions: a reputation for honesty, practical wisdom, possession
of the Holy Spirit. The business of the church can no more
be done successfully without the aid of the Holy Spirit than
can the preaching from the desk.
   7. "Stephen, the foremost of the seven deacons, was a man
of deep piety and broad faith. Though a Jew by birth, he
spoke the Greek language, and was familiar with the customs
and manners of the Greeks. He therefore found opportunity
to preach the gospel in the synagogues of the Greek Jews.
He was very active in the cause of Christ, and boldly pro-
claimed his faith. Learned rabbis and doctors of the law en-
gaged in public discussion with him, confidently expecting an
easy victory. But 'they were not able to resist the wisdom
and the spirit by which he spake.' Not only did he speak in
the power of the Holy Spirit, but it was plain that he was a
student of the prophecies, and learned in all matters of the
law. He ably defended the truths that he advocated, and
utterly defeated his opponents."— Id., page 97.

                             Notes
  1. During His life upon earth, Jesus ever sought to make
plain that little dependence can be placed upon our own wis-
dom or power in the Christian experience. He expressly said
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  31

that what He taught was not His own: "The words that I
speak unto you I speak not of Myself : but the Father that
dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works." John 14: 10. So like-
wise He would have us depend upon the Holy Spirit for our
guidance in spiritual crises, especially when brought before
authorities to answer for our faith. Luke says, literally,
"not to study out beforehand the defense to be made." Luke
21: 14. Yet we do not understand that Jesus or any of the
gospel writers means that we should not diligently study the
teachings of Christ, the prophecies, and principles of gospel
liberty, at all times. One purpose in Jesus' sending the Holy
Spirit is that it may "bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you." John 14: 26. This seems
to have been Stephen's experience. "It was plain that he was
a student of the prophecies, and learned in all matters of the
law. . . . To him was the promise fulfilled" as recorded in
Luke 21: 14, 15. See "The. Acts of the Apostles," page 97.
Jesus would have us calm and trustful under trial. "When
they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall
speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye
shall speak." Matt. 10: 19. The expression used here, "Take
no thought," is the same as that in Matt. 6: 25, 31, 34, ren-
dered in the Revised Version "Be not anxious."
   2. There was never before a time, perhaps, when the call
of Abraham was extended to so many of God's people, as is
the case to-day. An entire world lying in sin is to be warned
of the shortness of probation and the soon coming of Christ.
Hundreds have already responded to the Abrahamic call to
leave home and kindred, and go into a strange land to preach
the gospel. Hundreds more must be sent, and that right
early. A fitting prayer for our times is, "Pray ye therefore
the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth laborers into
His harvest." Matt. 9: 38.               •
   3. The fulfillment of God's promises does not depend upon
prospects. The value or reliability of any promise depends
directly upon the ability of the maker to perform it; yet not
upon this alone, for the maker may be able, but not faithful
about keeping his promises. God is both able and willing,
and is "not slack concerning His promises"; every promise of
 God is inspired by love. Study the circumstances of Abra-
 ham when God promised him "all the land" and "seed as the
 dust of the earth."
   4. Consider Joseph, a tender youth, favorite son of his
 father, sold as a slave in a foreign country, by the treachery
 of his brothers, cut off from home and communication with
 his father. "But God was with him," and delivered him, and
 gave him favor with the king, and made him governor of
 Egypt, and the savior of a nation, and of his father and
 kinsmen, from starvation.

                            Notes
  1. By rehearsing the story of Moses in the deliverance of
Israel from Egyptian bondage, Stephen showed his full belief
in the divine appointment and in the work of Moses, embody-
ing, as it did, so many of the historical facts and principles
of the Jewish religion. 1While thus expressing his confidence
in Moses, against whom he had been charged with speaking
blasphemous words, Stephen skillfully introduces the proph-
ecy of Christ as uttered by Moses. With the charge that he
was blaspheming the temple, he deals in our next lesson.
  2. The experiences of Israel were "written for our ad-
monition, upon whom the ends of the world are come." 1 Cor.
10: 11. With Israel under_ the hard hand of the oppressor in
Egypt, in the bondage of slavery, sunken in idolatry, with
the knowledge of the true God all but lost, truly it would
seem fitting to say that she was forsaken of God, an aban-
doned vine in Egypt. But in that hour of "gross darkness,"
a deliverer was born, and God made good His promise never
to leave or forsake His people. So it may be in our individual
experience: we may pass through dark waters; but "when
the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord
shall lift up a standard against him."
  3. While the ways of the Lord are "past finding out" (Rom.
11: 33), yet we may discover "parts of His ways." Moses
understood that the Lord would deliver Israel through him,
but he did not understand the Lord's way of doing it.
Moses' way was the Egyptian way, which he had learned at
the court of Pharaoh — military force. Had he not led the
Egyptian armies to victory? Why not lead the Lord's host
out with a mighty hand? By attempting it on his plan, he
succeeded in exiling himself, and delaying the deliverance
forty years — till he could be rid of his way, and learn the
Lord's way. How often do we stunt our spiritual growth,
and delay the Lord's work, by persisting in our own way, in-
stead of letting the Lord have His way in our lives!
   4. It is not too much for us to believe that the Lord has
a plan for every life, and• that He sets out early to develop
that plan. If we do not thwart His purpose, He will do a
quick work. He began to prepare Moses for his life work
from the day of his birth, using even his enemies to protect
his life and provide for his rearing, but reserving his early
34         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

education for his godly mother. While Moses erred later in
following the Egyptian way, yet in the final crisis, he chose
"to suffer affliction with the people of God" in carrying out
the Lord's plan. He made the choice, however, only after the
severe discipline of a humble life in the desert, learning and
unlearning. Shall we not endure with patience the disci-
pline necessary to prepare us for the divine call to our larger
service for God?

                       Lessons for Us

   2. "The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with
hands." Acts 7: 48 ; Isa. 57: 15. Note 6.

trial. Acts 7: 55-57, 59, 60. Note 7.
   4. Cherish the spirit of forgiveness. Verse 60; Luke
23: 34.
                            Notes
  1. By "host of heaven" is meant the stars, or heavenly
bodies, common objects of worship among the heathen. The
question in verse 42 is understood to be a form of emphatic
denial, "Ye have not," etc.; that is, Israel did not serve God
continuously through the forty years of wilderness wander-
36         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

ing, but had frequent lapses into idolatry, both then, and
later in Canaan, as mentioned in verse 43. It was for this
reason chiefly that they went into Babylonish captivity.
   2. Stephen is here approaching the charge that he was
speaking "blasphemous words against this holy place," that
is, the temple.
   3. Stephen was not introducing something new in speak-
ing thus of the temple. The same thought was expressed in
Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple. But he
was touching upon a vital point with the unbelieving Jews.
Witnesses at the trial had testified, "We have heard him say,
that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place," which
in a sense was true; for though Jesus did not destroy the
temple building, He did, by His sacrifice, remove the necessity
of keeping up the sacrificial round of service in the temple.
   "When Stephen reached this point, there was a tumult
among the people. When he connected Christ with the
prophecies, and spoke as he did of the temple, the priest,
pretending to be horror-stricken, rent his robe. To Stephen,
this act was a signal that his voice would soon be silenced
forever. He saw the resistance that met his words, and
knew that he was giving his last testimony. Although in .
the midst of his sermon, he abruptly concluded it."—The
Acts of the Apostles," page 100.
    4. Note that in verse 52 is made the first direct mention
of Jesus and His murderers. The word "Jesus" in verse 45
is the Greek form of "Joshua," and refers to him as the
leader of Israel into the promised land.
    5. It is one office of the Holy Spirit to strive with men, in
order to convict them of sin, and to keep them in the path
of obedience to God. But when the sinner persists in sin,
and does not heed the Spirit's wooings, God may turn away
from him, and give him up to reap the fruits of his own
cou/ 3e, till such time as he finds repentance. Ancient Israel
 persisted in idolatry till God permitted them to be carried
captive into a land of idolatry, where they hung their harps
on the willows, and wept when they remembered Zion. Psalm
137. The time is soon coming when the Spirit of God will
be withdrawn from the earth, and the destiny of men will be
sealed forever.
    6. Both the tabernacle in the wilderness and the temple at
Jerusalem were built at the Lord's direction, and He promised
to meet His people there. But the Jews in the time of Christ
 honored the temple above its Lord. Solomon recognized that
 the temple could not "contain" God, or confine His presence
 there; and the Lord Himself assures us that He dwells "with
 him also that is of a contrite and humble. spirit" It is
 fitting that we meet God in the appointed place of worship,
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 37
but the chief thing to remember is that His essential abiding
place is in the heart.
   7. Stephen had lived a life "full of faith and of the Holy
Ghost," and filled with fruitful service. Acts 6: 5, 8. In the
hour of supreme trial, a special vision of Jesus, his inter-
cessor, was granted him, he prayed for acceptance while his
life was being cruelly taken, and fell asleep with a prayer
on his lips of forgiveness for his enemies.

   We should endeavor to recall and fix in mind the great
outstanding principles and promises in these seven chap-
ters, for our daily life and work; such as:
    1. This same Jesus shall come again. (Memorize
Acts 1:11.)
    2. "Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost
is come upon you."
    3. "Ye shall be witnesses unto Me" at home and "unto
the uttermost part of the earth."
    4. Pentecostal power comes upon believers when they
"continue with one accord in prayer and supplication,"
in confession, and in study of the promises.
    5. The gift of the Holy Spirit is promised to converts
on repentance and baptism. (Memorize Acts 2: 38, 39.)
    6. "Such as I have give I."
    7. "Your sins may be blotted out." (Memorize Acts
3:19.)
    8. Salvation in Christ only. (Memorize Acts 4: 12.)
    9. "We ought to obey God rather than men." (Mem-
orize Acts 5: 29.)
   10. "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge." (Memo-
rize Acts 7: 60.)

                                 "They gather honey,
                                   and sting if you
                                   don't look out"
                                     This is all that a certain
                                  little boy knew about bees.
                                  Few of us older ones know
                                  much more, do we? But Uncle
                                   Ben, in one of his fifty-four
                                   nature stories, tells us they
                                  have two sets of eyes, one for
                                   near objects and another for
                                  distant ones; he tells us what
                                  makes them hum, why the
drones are ejected in the wintertime, where they get wax for the
honeycombs; and ever so much more, in the new children's book,

             UNCLE BEN'S CLOVERFIELD
  Like "Cobblestones," its companion volume, this book imparts
useful information in story form, and suggests attainable ideals.
Some who have seen the book say it is as good as "Cobblestones,"
others says it is better.
  Seventy-four pages more than "Cobblestones," but sells at the
same price in the United States, $1.00 postpaid; 10% higher in
Canada. The good that it may do your boy or girl cannot be
computed in dollars and cents.
