     BOOK OF ACTS
                    INTRODUCTORY NOTE
    The book of Acts is the most remarkable church history ever
written; one which is full of lessons for the remnant people.
"The great work of the gospel is not to close with less mani-
festation of the power of God than marked its opening. The
prophecies which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former
rain at the opening of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in
the latter rain at its close."—"Great Controversy," page 611.
    That the author was Luke is acknowledged by nearly all Bible
students. He was probably a Greek. He was a physician,— a pro-
fession of honor among the Greeks. Jerome speaks of him as "a,
physician of Antioch." He was doubtless a well-educated ma.n
and of a lovable and modest disposition. He is called "the
beloved physician." He does not mention his own name in the
book.
    It is commonly thought that the book was written- about A.D.
63, as the narrative breaks off suddenly at the end of Paul's
first imprisonment at Rome. It is generally believed that the
book was written at Rome, as the author mentions his arrival
at Rome (Acts 28:16), and does not mention his departure. This
is not conclusive however.
    Well might the book be called the "Acts of the Holy Spirit."
The Holy Spirit is mentioned seventy-one times. It is a con-
tinuous record of a great spiritual revival accomplished by the
superhuman power of the Holy Spirit through ordinary men.
    The missionary lessons of this book ought to stir the church
to-day to such activity as it has not yet experienced. Everything
is ' ready for the quick finishing of the gospel work. What is
needed is apostolic supplications, the forsaking of sins, and Pente-
costal power.

                             Notes

   1. No attempt will be made in these lessons to give exact
chronological data for the various events. Chronologists are not
agreed. The events of this quarter's study begin with the as-
cension of Christ and extend to the great persecution that fol-
lowed the death of Stephen. The former event we understand
to have occurred in A.D. 31. The "New Standard Dictionary"
6           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

gives the date of Paul's conversion, which occurred in the time
of the persecution referred to, as A.D. 34.
    2. "That the author of the book of Acts is the same as
that of the third Gospel, js evident from several considerations:
from the address to Theophilus, and the reference to a previous
treatise similarly addressed; . . . from the strong resem-
blance in the style of the two books; from the parallelisms par-
ticularly noticeable in the description of the shipwreck in Acts
and the storm on the Sea of Galilee in the Gospel; from in-
timations, slight, and yet noticeable, of the author's knowledge
of disease and his use of medical terms; . . . and from the
fact that Luke, who describes himself as the traveling companion
of Paul even to Rome itself, is several times referred to by Paul
as being with him in Rome. . . . That the author of both
is Luke is the universal testimony of antiquity."— Abbott's
Commentary, Acts.
     3. The work of Christ in carrying out the plan of salvation
may be divided into two parts, His work on earth in person, and
His work from heaven through the Holy Spirit. What He "began
 both to do and teach" while here, He continues to do through
His church endowed with the Holy Spirit. Some one speaks of
this book as "the second part of the Acts of Jesus." The
following references show this to be true: Acts 3:6, 16; 7:59;
9:5, 34; 10:13-15; 12:11; 18:9; 23:11. The book has also
been called the "Acts of the Holy Spirit."
     4. What precious seasons must have been the interviews of
the disciples with their risen Lord during those forty days!
Doubtless He explained many things to them which they could
only understand in the light of the resurrection, and endeavored
especially to make plain the part they were to act in making
Him known to the world.
     5. They were to be witnesses, not princes, witnessing to the
crucifixion (Acts 2:36), resurrection (1:22), and coming (1:11)
of Christ. Note the extent of the work —"unto the uttermost
part of the earth." At that command, when they understood
it, they gave their means, their strength, and their lives to
carrying the gospel message into all the known world. To us
now comes the same command, to carry the last gospel message
to every nation and tongue. And the same power is promised
from on high.
    6. A Sabbath day's journey was, according to the Talmud, two
thousand cubits, or three fourths of a mile.
    7. "All who were fully identified as disciples of Christ and
associated with the apostles as evangelists, assembled together
at Jerusalem. They put away all differences. They continued
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     7
with one accord in prayer and supplication, that they might re-
ceive the fulfilment of the promise of the Holy Spirit; for they
were to preach the gospel in the demonstration of the Spirit
and in the power of God."—" Gospel Workers,'' page 370.
    8. "This is the very course that should be pursued by 'those
who act a part in the work of proclaiming the coming of the
Lord in the clouds of heaven; for a people are to be prepared
to stand in the great day of God. Although Christ had given
the promise to His disciples that they should receive the Holy
Spirit, this did not remove the necessity of prayer. They prayed
all the more earnestly; they continued in prayer with one accord.
Those who are now engaged in the solemn work of preparing a
people for the coming of the Lord, should also continue in
prayer."—"Gospel Workers," pages 370, 371.
    "Notice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect
unity, when they were no longer striving for the highest place,
that the Spirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All
differences had been put away."—" Testimonies for the- Church,"
volume 6, page 20.
    9. Not only were the believers putting away their sins and
praying for the descent of the Spirit, but they were facing the
great work for which the Spirit was to be given, and proceeded
to transact such business as was necessary for carrying out
their mission.

                           Notes
   1. The day of the week on which that memorable Pentecost
fell has been a subject of much interest. Though the question
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                          9

has absolutely nothing' to do with determining what day is the
Christian Sabbath, it will be of interest to know the facts. The
day on which Pentecost was celebrated depends altogether upon
the day of the week on which the Passover fell on any given
year. The Passover lamb was to be killed on the evening of the
14th of Nisah, and beginning with the 15th day unleavened
bread was eaten for seven days. The first and seventh days of
the feast were sabbaths, in which no servile work should be done.
Ex. 12:6, 15, 16; Lev. 23: 5-7. On the morrow after this first
sabbath — the 16th -- the wave-sheaf (or "ombr," margin) of
the first-fruits was offered to the Lord, and from this day they
were to count fifty days to Pentecost. Lev. 23:10, 11, 15, 16.
    Jesus was crucified on Friday (Luke 23:54), and ate the
Passover with His disciples the evening before (Luke 22: 7-15),
which would be the 14th. Sabbath therefore was the 16th of
Nisan, and fifty days would bring Pentecost that year on the
Sabbath.
    There has been much discussion over the question of whether
Jesus did not eat the Passover one day before the regular time,
 so that He would be crucified on the day on which the typical
 lamb was slain. "The question, on what day of the week this
 Pentecost fell, must of course be determined by the mode in which
 the doubt is solved regarding the day [of the month] .on which
 the Last Supper was eaten. If it was the legal paschal supper,
 on the 14th of Nisan, and the Sabbath during which our Lord
 lay in the grave was the day of the omer, Pentecost must have
 followed on the Sabbath. But if the supper was eaten on the
13th, and He was crucified on the 14th, the Sunday of the
 resurrection must have been the day of the omer, and Pentecost
 must have occurred on the first day of the week."—"Smith's
Bible Dictionary," article "Pentecost."
    Andrews, after considering all the evidences on this question,
concludes that Jesus ate the Passover at the regular time and was
crucified on the 15th. ("Life of our Lord," page 460.) With
him agree Edersheim, Neander, Burton and Matthews, Hastings's
Bible Dictionary, and many other authorities. Ti         s seems to
be the only position the Scripture warrants.
    2. This was the baptism of the Holy Spirit promised by Jesus.
It filled the room, and it filled and took possession of the believers.
"On the day of Pentecost the Infinite One revealed Himself in
power to the church. By His Holy Spirit He descended from the
heights of heaven as a rushing, mighty wind, to the room in
which the disciples were assembled. It was as. if for ages this
influence had been held in restraint, and now heaven rejoiced in
being able to pour upon the church the riches of the Spirit's
10          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 power. And, under the influence of the Spirit, words of penitence
 and confession were mingled with songs of praise for sins for-
 given. Words of thanksgiving and of prophecy were heard. All
 heaven bent low to behold and to adore the wisdom of matchless,
 incomprehensible Love. Lost in wonder, the apostles and dis-
 ciples exclaimed, 'Herein is love.' 1 John 4:10. They grasped
 the imparted gift. And what followed? — Thousands were con-
 verted in a day. The sword of the Spirit, newly edged with
 power, and bathed in the lightnings of heaven, cut its way
 through unbelief."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 7,
 page 31.
     3. "The work will be similar to that of the day of Pentecost.
 As the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of the Holy
 Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of
 the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given at its close,
 for the ripening of the harvest. . . . The great work of the
 gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of
 God than marked its opening. The prophecies which were ful-
 filled in the outpouring of the foriner rain at the opening of the
 gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close.
. . . Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining
 with holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to pro-
 claim the message from Heaven. By thousands of voices, all over
 the earth, the warning will be given. Miracles will be wrought,
 the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will folloW the
believers. Satan also works with lying wonders, even bringing
down fire from heaven in the sight of men. Thus the inhabitants
of the earth will be brought to take their stand."—"Great Con-
troversy," pages 611, 612.
     4. "Why has the history of the work of the disciples, as they
labored with holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the Holy Spirit,
been recorded, if it is not that from this record the Lord's people
to-day are to gain an inspiration to work earnestly for Him,
What the Lord did for His people in that time, it is just as
essential, and more so, that He do for His people to-day. All
that the apostles did, every church-member to-day is to do. And
we are to work with as much more fervor, to be accompanied
by the Holy Spirit in as much greater measure, as the increase of
wickedness demands a more decided call to repentance."—"Testi-
monies for the Church," volume 7, page 33.
     " The Spirit awaits our demand and reception."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," page 131.                     •
     5. "Already many are receiving the Holy Spirit, and no
longer will the way be blocked by listless indifference."—"Testi-
monies for the Church," volume 7, page 33.

       LESSON            Christ and Him Crucified

                     JANUARY 21, 1911
     LESSON SCRIPTURE : Acts 2:22-47.
     LESSON HELPS: Sabbath School Worker.

                          Questions
                     PETER'S ARGUMENT
 .  1. Having explained the manifestations of the
Holy Spirit, whom did Peter at once set forth as
the theme of his discourse? What evidence had been
given that Jesus was the Messiah? Acts 2 : 22.      •
    2. What, however, had the Jews done? Of what
was this a fulfilment? Verse 23 ; 3 : 18.
    3. What gteat truth was then stated? Acts 2 : 24.
    4. Give the substance of the scripture quoted to
prove this. Verses 25-28 ; Ps. 16 : 8-11.
    5. How does this prove the resurrection? Acts 2 :
29-31, 34 (first clause). Note 1.
    6. What other evidence of the resurrection did
Peter present 1 Verse 32.
    7. What third proof ,was given? Verse 33.
    8. With what scripture did he prove the exaltation
of Christ? Verses 34, 35; Ps. 110:1. Note 2
    9. What Was the conclusion of Peter's argument?
Acts 2 : 36.
                    THE EXHORTATION
   10. What  was  the effect of the sermon on the peo-
 ple? Verse 37.
   11. What were they exhorted to do, and with what

12         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  12. How many may receive forgiveness of sin and
the gift of the Holy Spirit?, Verse 39.
  13. What was the burden of the invitation that day?
Verse 40.
                , A HARVEST OF SOULS
  14. What result followed this effort? Verse 41.
Note 3.
  15. What spirit did these early Christians manifest?
What did they do? Verses 41, 42, 46. Note 4.
  16. How were the temporal wants of all supplied?
Verses 44, 45. Note 5.
  17. What was the attitude of the people toward this
work, and with what results was it continued? Verses
43, 47.
                             Notes

   1. If the righteous receive their reward at death, Peter's
argument proves nothing. But David's body had been left in
hades, or the grave; so the text must refer to Christ, who was
resurrected.
    2. In this reference we have allusion to two ancient customs,
one that of kings' placing on their right those for whom the
highest honors were intended (1 Kings 2:19), and the other
of conquerors' treading on the neck of their vanquished foes as
a symbol of complete subjection. See Phil. 2:5-11.
   3. This was doubtless a fulfilment of Jesus' promise to His
disciples in John 14:2. "A work similar to that which the
Lord did through His delegated messengers after the day of
Pentecost He is waiting to do to-day."—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 7, page 33.
   4. As disciples, or learners, they studied the doctrines or
teachings perseveringly. This, with the ordinances and prayer-
meetings, bound them together in Christian fellowship, and built
them up. All this was a willing and joyful service.
   5. There were doubtless great numbers from all over the
world, away from their usual means of support, who wanted to
become more thoroughly instructed in the Christian life before
returning home. Having consecrated all to God, those who had
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  13
property voluntarily turned it into money to meet this need.
There seems to have been no holding of property in common, or
public ownership. Private ownership of property did not cease
among Christians. See Acts 12:12. Every able-bodied man was
charged with the duty of supporting his own household; and to
fail of this through neglect, was a denial of the faith. 1 Tim.
5 : 8. But in cases of need and distress, every believer is a
steward of God; and when the cause of Christ suffers need, no
believer can say that aught that he has is his own.

                             Notes
    I. It is not certain which of the several gates belonging to
the temple is meant, but probably the magnificent doors of Cor-
inthian brass described by josephus, which led from the Gentile
court to the court of the women. It is said that the folds of
this gate were seventy-five feet high and sixty feet broad, and
were covered with plates of gold and silver.
   "This unfortunate man had long desired to go to Jesus and
be healed; but he was almost helpless, and was removed far
from the scene of the great Physician's labors. Finally his
earnest pleadings induced some kind persons to bear him to the
gate of the temple. But upon arriving there he discovered that
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    15

the Healer upon whom his hopes were centered, had been put to
a cruel death."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 275.
    2. Every one who has received Christ in the heart has some-
thing of infinitely more value to give than silver or gold. And
it is a law of the kingdom that these precious blessings must be
continually given away to be retained.
    3. "I. Faith performs the miracle (Peter and John). 11.
Faith experiences the miracle (the lame man). I11. Faith com-
prehends the miracle (the believing hearers)."—Lange.
     4. Daniel the prophet had written of the solemn scene, just
before the coming of Christ, when the Ancient of Days should
sit in judgment and the books of heaven be opened. Dan. 7:
9, 10. Before this tribunal every case was to come; and Peter
exhorted his hearers to make sure work for that great day. And
now that, in the closing days of our own generation, the judg-
ment hour is fast passing, when the record of sin will be blotted
out, or the names be blotted out, how urgent the same call to
repentance! Note some of the promises for this time of judg-
ment, and of refreshing by the latter rain. See Rev. 2:7, 10, 11.
The time of the latter rain is also the shaking time. While those
who seek God shall increase in strength, the careless and con-
tentious and unconsecrated will be shaken out of the ranks of
God's people.

  18. What threefold answer was given? Verse 31.
                              Notes

    1. "Being grieved;" Greek, "troubled all through," or
"thoroughly worked up." Probably most of the worshipers had
left the inner precincts of the temple, and were drinking in the
words of life preached by the apostles. "This preaching the
resurrection of Chiist, and that through His death and resur-
rection He would finally bring up all the dead from their graves,
deeply stirred the Sadducees. They felt that their favorite doc-
trine was in danger, and their reputation at stake. Some of the
officials of the temple, and the captain of the temple, were Sad-
ducees."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 278.
     2. This was the supreme council of the Jewish nation, the
Sanhedrin. It was composed of seventy-one members, and sat
in a semicircle of which the high priest was the central figure.
Both Sadducees and Pharisees were members at this time. Annas
was acting high priest, though he had been deposed, and Caia-
phas his son-in-law appointed by the Roman authority. See Luke
3:2; John 11:49; 18:13. Of John and Alexander we know noth-
ing. They were probably prominent relatives of the high priest.
     3. "In that very room, and before those very men, Peter had
shamefully denied his Lord. All this came distinctly before the
 mind of the disciple, as he now appeared for his own trial. He
had now an opportunity of redeeming his former wicked cow-
 ardice.
     "The company present remembered the part Peter had, acted
 at the trial of his Master, and they flattered themselves that he
could be intimidated by the threat of imprisonment and death.
 But the Peter who denied Christ in the hour of His greatest
 need, was the impulsive, self-confident disciple, differing widely
 from the Peter who was before the Sanhedrin for examination
 that day. He had been converted; he was distrustful of self,
 and no longer a proud boaster. He was filled with the Holy
 Spirit, and through its power he had become firm as a rock,
 courageous, yet modest, in magnifying Christ. He was ready to
 remove the stain, of his apostasy by honoring the name he had
 once disowned."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 279.
     4. Christ's promise of Matt. 10:19, 20, was fulfilled that day.#
     5. In accordance with later direction in his epistle (1 Peter
2:17) Peter here showed due regard to his renowned audience,
18         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
but being filled with the Holy Ghost he does not fail to declare
the whole counsel of God, and he and John are not slow to tell
the Sanhedrin what attitude the disciples must sustain toward the
demand not to preach Christ.

                            Notes
    1. "Great numbers had collected at Jerusalem to observe the
sacred feast. The exciting scenes of the crucifixion and resur-
rection had called out a much larger number than usual. When
the truth taught by the apostles was brought suddenly and with
convincing power before them, thousands were converted in a
day. These early believers were most of them immediately cut
off from family and friends by the zealous bigotry of the Jews.
Many of the converts were thrown out of business, and exiled.
from their homes because they followed the convictions of their
consciences, and espoused the cause of Christ. It was necessary
to provide this large number, congregated' at Jerusalem, with
homes and sustenance. Those having money and possessions
cheerfully sacrificed them to the existing emergency. Their
means were laid at the feet of the apostles, who made dis-
tribution to every man according as he had need; and there were
none among them who lacked.'_ —"Spirit of Prophecy," volume
3, pages 282, 283.
20          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. "This was the effect of the pouring out of the Spirit of
God upon the believers. It made them of one heart and soul.
They had one common interest — the success of the mission in-
trusted to them. Their love for their brethren, and the cause ,
which they had espoused, was far greater than their love for
money and possessions. They acted out their faith, and by their
works testified that they accounted the souls of men of far
greater value than any earthly heritage."—"Spirit of Proph-
ecy." volume 3, page 283.
    3. "Ananias and Sapphirn. coveted popularity and high posi-
tion which they saw those enjoying who had thus given all they
possessed to their brethren and were spending their lived in the
services) of the gospel. But this popularity came high; it would
cost them their Possessions. And such a price they were un-
willing to pay. So they tried to get it by means of hypocrisy.
They pyofessed to give all that they had received for the piece
of property which they had sold.x Hypocrites are a hindrance
to any good movement. The better the movement, the greater the
danger from such people, and the more injurious are their pres-
ence and influence. A few individuals of such character, who in
this way had got leading positions in the yonng church, could
have ruined it. The danger was great, the remedy severe."—
Thatcher, "History of the Apostolic Church," page 80.
 . 4. Though the punishment was severe, it was just, and spared
the infant church from greater sorrow. It caused them to have
greater awe in Cod's presence and greater reverence 'for the
Holy Spirit. It led to careful living, to searching of heart - lest
they might he deceived. Tt also caused those who were not Chris-
tians to realize the terrible nature of sin, and to understand the
heart-searching presence of God. Those who were not sincere
were kept out of the church, and many who were longing for
power for right living were added to the church.
    5. "As the people of God approach the perils of, the last days.
Satan holds earnest consultation with his angels as to the most
successful plan of overthrowing their faith             He directs
his angels to lay their snares especially for those who are look-
ing for the second advent of Christ, and endeavoring to keep all
the commandments of God. Says the great deceiver: .               .
`Go, make the nossessors of lands and money drunk with the
cares of this life. Present the world before them in its most
attractive light, that they may lay up their treasure here, and
fix their affections upon earthly things. We must do our utmost
to prevent those who labor in God's cause from obtaining means
to use against ns. Keep the money in our own ranks. The more
means they obtain, the more they will injure our kingdom by
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     21
taking from us our subjects. Make them care more for money
than for the upbuilding of Christ's kingdom and the spread of
the truths we hate, and we need not fear their influence; for we
know ti.at .very•s.slallicGvatauz,     7.4.11   u n-der ollr power,
and will finally be separated from God's people."'—"Spirit of

                               Notes

    1. The Sadducees seem to have been the leaders in this per-
secution. According to Josephus, most of the higher class were,
skeptics or Sadducees, though the mass of the people were
Pharisees. The work of the apostles was very offensive to them.
It drew away their followers, and refuted their leading doctrine
that there was no resurrection. Matt. 22:23.
    2. This was indeed a strong protest, against the actions of
those who taught that there was "neither angel nor spirit."
Acts 23:8.
    3. "Note the marvelous accuracy of detail in St. Luke's nar-
rative. The Sanhedrin used to sit in the temple, but a few years
before the period at which we have arrived, four or five at most,
they removed from the temple into the city, a fact which is
just hinted at in the sixth verse of the fourth chapter, where
we are told that the rulers, and elders, and scribes were gathered
together in Jerusalem, that is, in the city, not in the temple; while
again in this passage we read that when the high priest came
and convened. the council and all the senate of the children of
Israel, they sent their officers to bring the prisoners before them.
These officers after a while returned with the information that
the apostles were preaching in the temple. If the Sanhedrin
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       23
were meeting in the temple, they would doubtless have learned
this fact as soon as they assembled, especially as they did not
sit till after the morning sacrifice, several hours after the apostles
appeared in the temple."— Stokes, Acts.
     4. "The apostles and early Christians acted on the principle,
that human governments forfeit their claim to obedience when.
they require what God has plainly forbidden, or forbid what He
has required. They claimed the right of judging for themselves
what was right and what was wrong; in reference to their re-
ligious duties, and they regulated their conduct by that decision.
. . . In applying this principle, it will be found that ,the
apostles in every instance abstained from forcible .resistance to
the public authorities. They refused utterly to obey the man-
dates which required them to violate their consciences, but they
endured quietly the penalties which the executors of the law en-
forced against them. They evaded the pursuit ,of their op-
pressors if they could, secreted themselves from arrest, left their
prisons at the command of God, yet when violent hands were
laid upon them, and they were dragged before magistrates, to
 the dungeon, or to death, they resisted not the wrong, but 'fol-
lowed His steps, who, when He suffered, threatened not, but
committed Himself to Him that j udgeth righteously.! "—"Haek-
ett's Commentary," Acts.
    5. To have acted upon their passionate desire might have
brought them in conflict with the Romans, for the Sanhedrin did
hot have the power of capital punishment. Doubtless also it would
have stirred the great wrath of the people. Whatever Gamaliel's
personal opinion may have been, he was used of God to bring
victory to His cause. Bernard says: "Gamaliel is described in
Acts 5:34 as 'a Pharisee, a doctor of the law, had in honor with
all the people.' This description exactly corresponds with that-
given in the Mishna of Rabban Gamaliel I,, who died about A.D.
57, and was at the height of his influence at the time of the
trial described in Acts 5. He belonged to the milder and more
liberal school of Hillel, whose grandson he is said to have been.
. . . He was the teacher of St. Paul."—"Smith's Bible Dic-
tionary," article Gamaliel.
     6. We can not think of these Spirit-filled men as "profes-
sional" evangelists, yet preaching was decidedly their business.
In the temple (in Solomon's porch or portico) they seem to have
had daily services; and in the houses, and doubtless on the
street, in public and private, they spoke "to the people all the
words of this life." The apostle Paul said, "By the space of
 three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with
 tears." Acts 20:31.

  11. What manifestation of the divine presence did
all the council see? Verse 15. Note 4.
                             Notes
   1. These are qualifications for persons, chosen to any church
office, and they exalt the office. The business of the church as
well as the ministry of the Word should be done in the most
diligent and religious spirit. Phillips Brooks well said, Never
fear to do the smallest act with the highest motive.
    2. This was a synagogue for foreign Jews —Libertines, Jews
and their descendants who had been Roman captives and who
had been freed by theii captors. " Tacitus speaks of 10,000
Libertine Jews."— Lewin. It is said that there were 460 syna-
gogues in Jerusalem.
    3. The same accusation had been brought against Christ.
Matt. 26:61. Probably Stephen had taught the prophecies of
Daniel and Christ concerning the- destruction of Jerusalem, and
that the sacrificial service's had lost their meaning. But doubt-
less, like Paul, he could say; "Neither against. the law of the
Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Cnsar, have
I offended anything at all." Acts 25:8.
    4. These intolerant religionists were very jealous' for the
influence of Moses, yet they could not recognize. Christ, of whom
Moses wrote, or understand the glory that shone on Stephen's
face, such as that which had illuminated the face of Moses.

                               Notes
    1. The student should read the whole discourse carefully, and
endeavor to grasp its purpose and thought. It is a remarkable
defense. Had he offered an abstract defense against the charges,
he would doubtless have been stopped much sooner than he was.
Jewish history was a favorite thethe among the Hebrew. people.
To secure their attention, give time for their rage to subside,
and to show that their charges of his opposition to Moses and
the Jewish religion were not true, he gave a review of their
history, showing how it led to Christ and a spiritual religion not
confined to any one place, such as the temple.
    2. Mesopotamia, "between the rivers," is doubtless used in a
general sense, including all the Tigro-Euphrates country. "Ur
of the Chaldees" has been identified with the mound Mugheir
in lower Babylonia, but has not been fully excavated.
    3. In Jewish history the time of the sojournings• of their
fathers among strangers and amidst afflictions was counted from
 the wanderings of Abraham to the exodus from Egypt. Abra-
ham was called out from his kindred and country to Canaan,
into which the Lord promised to lead his descendants; but on
 account of the famine in the land he went down at once into
Egypt. Gen. 12:1-1.0. According to the chronology in the margin
(if the Common Version, this was B.C. 1921. Just four hundred
 thirty years later, according to the same chronology, Israel went
 out of Egypt. Ex. 12:40, 41, marginal date. Sometimes in
 Scripture this period is referred to by even figures as four hundred
years.
     4. This was God's everlasting covenant. "The covenant of
 grace was first made with man in Eden, when after the fall, there
 was given a divine promise that the seed of the woman should
 bruise the serpent's head. To all men this covenant offered
 pardon, and the assisting grace of God for future obedience
 through faith in Christ. It also promised them eternal life on
 condition of fidelity to God's law. Thus the patriarchs received
 the hope of salvation. This same covenant was renewed to
 Abraham in the promise, 'In thy .seed shall all the nations of
 the earth be blessed.' This promise pointed to Christ. So
 Abraham understood it, and he trusted in Christ for the for-
 giveness of sins. It was this faith that was accounted unto him
 for righteousness."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 370:
     5. In Gen. 46:26 it is stated that the number of Jacob's
 house wlio went down with him into Egypt was sixty-six, "be-
 sides Jacob's sons' wives." Stephen is counting not the di-
 rect descendants only but also the "kindred," and so includes
 the wives, making seventy-five as the total family.
28         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   6. Though Jacob and the twelve patriarchs died in Egypt,
they believed God's promise of deliyerance, and desired their
bones to be buried in the land of Canaan. Jacob was buried with
Abraham at Machpelah (Gen. 50:13). The words in verse 16,
of Stephen's address, refer to the twelve patriarchs —"our
fathers — mentioned in the closing words of the preceding verse.
We have only the account of the carrying of Joseph's bones to
Sychem for burial (Joshua 24:32), but evidently at some time
the other eleven patriarchs were likewise buried there by their
posterity.
   7. " They were not yet prepared for freedom. . . . In
slaying the Egyptian, Moses had fallen into the same error so
often committed by his fathers, of taking into their own hands
the work that God had promised to do. It was not God's will
to deliver His people by warfare, as Moses thought, but by His
own mighty power, that the glory might be ascribed to Him
alone."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 246, 247.
   8. "Moses was not prepared for his great work. He had
yet to learn the same lesson of faith that Abraham and Jacob
had been taught,— not to rely upon human strength or wisdom,
but upon the power of God for the fulfilment of His promises.
And there were other lessons that, amid the solitude of 'the
mountains, Moses was to receive."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
page 247.

  19. By whom was he buried? Acts 8: 2.
                             Notes

   1. In this and the preceding verse Stephen shows his hearers
that it was Christ who led the children of Israel; and that
Moses, whom they professed to follow, foretold His coming in
person as the Deliverer of His people.
   2. "You have carried your idolatrous images about; and
I will carry you into captivity, and see if the gods in whom ye
have trusted can deliver you from My hands. Instead of 'be-
yond Babylon,' Amos, from whom the quotation is made, says
I will carry you beyond Damascus. Where they were carried
was into Assyria and Media, (see 2 Kings .17:6) ; now, this was
not only beyond Damascus, but beyond Babylon itself; and, as
Stephen knew this to be the fact, he states it here, and thus more
precisely fixes the place of their captivity."— Clarke's Com-
mentary.
   3. The Jews were trusting in externals. Stephen doubtless
meant to show them that just as their fathers had with them
the "tabernacle of witness," a continual witness or proof of
God's presence, and yet went into idolatry, so they with the
temple and with even the Messiah among them had rejected God.
He had been accused of blasphemy against Moses, the law, and
the temple. He has shown.his respect for Moses and the law, and
now he shows that he had no intention of speaking with dis-
respect of the temple.
   "Jesus" in verse 45 is the Greek form of the word Joshua.
See Heb. 4:8, margin.
   4. "When Stephen had reached this point there was a tumult
among the people. The prisoner read his fate in the countenances
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   31
before him. He perceived the resistance that met his words,
which were spoken at the dictation of the Holy Ghost. He
knew that he was giving his last testimony. Few who read this
address of Stephen properly appreciate it. The occasion, the
time and place should be borne in mind to make his words convey
their full significance. When he connected Jesus Christ with
the prophecies, and spoke of the temple as he did, the priest, af-
fecting to be horror-stricken, rent his robe. This act was to ,
Stephen a signal that his voice would soon be silenced forever.
Although he was just in the midst of his sermon, he abruptly
concluded it by suddenly breaking away from the chain of
history, and, turning upon his infuriated judges, said, 'Ye stiff-
necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,' " etc.—"Spirit of
Prophecy," volume 3, pages 297, 298.         •
    5. "At this the priests and rulers were beside themselves
with anger. They were more like wild beasts of prey than
like human beings. They rushed upon Stephen, gnashing their
teeth. But he was not intimidated; he had expected this. His
face was calm, and shone with an angelic light. The infuriated
priests and the excited mob had no terrors for him. 'But he,
being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into
heaven.' . . .
    "The scene about him faded from his vision; the gates of -
 heaven were ajar, and Stephen, looking in, saw the glory of
the courts of God, and Christ, as if just risen from His throne,
standing ready to sustain His servant, who was about to suffer
 martyrdom for His name. When Stephen proclaimed the glo-
rious scene opened before him, it was more than his perse-
 cutors could endure. They stopped their ears, that they might
 not hear his words, and uttering loud cries ran furiously upon
him with one accord."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages _
298, 299.

                             Notes

    1. "After the death of. Stephen the disciples were restrained
in their active ministry, and many of the believers • who had
temporarily resided in Jerusalem now retired to their distant
homes because of the violent persecution against them. But
the apostles dared not leave Jerusalem till the Spirit of God
indicated it to be their duty to do so; for Christ had bidden
them to first work in that field. Although the priests and rulers
bitterly persecuted the new converts, they did not venture for a
time to arrest the apostles, being overawed by the dying testimony
of Stephen, and realizing that their course with him had injured
their own cause in the minds of • the people."—"Spirit of
Prophecy," volume 3, page 300.
    2. " The Romans alone had the power of life and death.
The Sanhedrin, by whom Saul was employed (chapter 26:10),
could do no more than arrest and imprison, in order to inflict
any punishment short of death. It is true, St. Paul himself says
that some of them were put to death (chapter 26), but this was
either done by Roman authority, or by what is called the judg-
ment of zeal; i. e., when the mob took the execution of the laws
into their own hands, and massacred those whom they pretended
to be blasphemers of God."— Clarke's Commentary.
    3. The means by which the enemies of Christ sought to crush
the gospel, were the means of scattering it, and "those holy
fugitives were like so many lamps lighted by the fire of the Holy
Spirit, spreading everywhere the sacred flame by which they
themselves had been illuminated."
    4. From now on, in the book of Acts, we see the Lord
leading the disciples out toward the peoples and nations round
about. They were tempted by their national prejudices and nar-
row vision to settle down at home and work only for their own
people. But, as we learned in the first chapter, the Lord's com-
mand was that they should witness "both in Jerusalem, and in
all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
earth."
    5. Jesus said, when in Samaria with His disciples, "One
soweth and another reapeth." Philip was now reaping the
harvest from seed sown in that two days' ministry by the
Master.
    6. "The apostles sent Peter; he was their messenger, not
their master."— Lindsay.
    7. John at one time wanted to call down fire on the Samar-
itans. Now he seeks to bring them the baptism of the Holy
 Spirit.
34         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    8. The crime of Simony is named from Simon. It means
the obtaining of preferment or office in the church by the pay-
ment of money. It was very common in its worse forms in the
Dark Ages. Simon doubtless thought to purchase the gift in
order to exercise its powers to gain selfish honor or to make
money by it. The gifts of God's Spirit and power are not given
to advance any one's selfish desires or commercial interests.

death, later became also a witness and a martyr?
   8. By what means was the church hurried out from
Jerusalem to' bear the witness? What experience

                        Systematic Work
   The envelope system makes possible a systematic house-to-
house work, which may be taken up as follows:
   1. Each volunteer for the work should say about how many
homes he or she can conveniently visit regularly. Ordinarily
ten, six, or even four, are enough for the average person to
attempt at once.
   2. Take seven envelopes, number them 1, 2, 3, etc., and then
with tracts suggested in list given below fill these. As many
sets as needed may be made up in the same way, and delivered
to workers.
    3. Worker begins with No. 1, visiting homes in his territory,
and leaving one with each.
    4. The following week No. 2 is used, and No. 1 taken up,
unless reader wishes to keep it.
    5. If possible have a regular time for going; keep the work
up, giving out the next number each week, and taking up the
one preceding.
                  •    (See next page also.)

   The special price of $5.00 for this $7.00 package does not
include transportation charges, which are about $1.15, if sent
by express. It is hoped that it may be sent by freight with other
supplies, in which case the cost will be but a few cents.

our best missionary workers to believe it will prove to be as
convenient, economical, and popular to our churches as the Dollar

                                              A NEED
                                              SUPPLIED
                                              It was a little more than
                                              two years ago that the
                                              publishers of the SIGNS
                                              OF THE TIMES, acting
                                              upon insistent demands
                                              for a religious magazine
                                              that would prove more
                                              salable than the weekly
                                              journal, began publishing
                                              the SIGNS OF THE
                                              TIMES MONTHLY. Its
                                              magazine form, variety of
                                              subjects treated, we 11 -

                                              tiful covers in colors,
                                              caused it to meet with in-
                                              stant favor.
A sister residing in Portland, Oregon, has sold over 38,000 copies
during these past two years. She has earned a net weekly wage
of about $25. Others are regularly selling from 50 to 1000 and
even more each month.
These faithful workers have a purpose in doing this work which
is higher than the mere earning of money. They are endeavor-
ing to win souls to the truth. This is the secret of their staying
with the SIGNS MONTHLY, even if they sell but a few copies
a month.
Here is what one of our agents has to say about the SIGNS
MONTHLY:
    " Enclosed please find $16.00 for which send me 400 of the October
    SIGNS MONTHLY: I have sold half of my last order of 400 already.
    They sell well. I will be sorry when my strength fails so I can't sell
    the SIGNS. I love the work and am so glad I can earn my living in
    service for the Master."
Other agents are wanted who can devote even a small portion of
their time to this work. Write to-clay direct to us or to your tract
society for further information. Orders should be sent through
the tract society.
