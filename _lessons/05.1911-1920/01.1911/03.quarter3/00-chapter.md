          Sabbath-School Lessons on the

      BOOK OF ACTS
             . For the Third Quarter, 1911
     INTRODUCTORY NOTE.- This quarter's lessons are a further
 study of the missionary labors of the apostle Paul. These lessons
 should be so faithfully studied that each member of the Sabbath-
 school will get a clear grasp of the apostle's movements. But of
 greater value will be the study of the methods of labor employed,
 the tact shown, the unselfish devotion seen, the dauntless courage
 manifested, the obstacles surmounted, the victories gained, the
 special blessing of God that rested upon His servants in their
 work, and His manifestation of power given as evidence of divine
 approbation: "God also bearing them witness, both with signs
 and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
 Ghost, according to His own will." Heb. 2:4.
     The travels of Paul and the other evangelists should be care-
" fully traced on the map. Consult Bible dictionaries and atlases
 for, information concerning the places visited. The "Life and
 Epistles of the Apostle Paul," by Conybeare and Howson, iA
 recognized authority, and is an excellent help on these lessons. it
 is a valuable work for the library.
     Just a word concerning dates. A few dates are given in the
 notes in connection with Paul's missionary journeys; also the
 time suggested when some of his epistles were written. As there
 is disagreement among reliable authorities as to the date of some
 of these events, no time should be spent in debate over the matter.
 The dates given are from what is regarded as good authority, and
 will be helpful to many in determining at least approximately
 when certain events occurred.

                               Notes
    1. "Lystra is about six hours S. S. W. from Iconium. The
exact site of Lystra is on a hill in the center of the valley. The
hill rises about 100 to 150 feet • above the plain, and the sides
are steep. Pew traces of ancient buildings remain above the
surface. Situated on this bold hill, Lystra could easily be made
a very strong fortress, and must have been well suited for its
purpose of keeping in check the tribes of the mountain districts
that lie west and south of it"— Abbreviated from Ramsay's
"Church in the Roman Empire,'' pages 47-50.
    2. "The temple of the Lystrian Jupiter still stood before the
gate, and the priest still offered the people's sacrifices to the
imaginary protector of the_ city. Heathenism was invaded, but not
yet destroyed. Some votaries had been withdrawn from that poly-
theistic religion which wrote and sculptured in stone its dim
ideas of 'present deities,' crowding its thoroughfares with statues
and altars, ascribing to the king of the gods the attributes of
beneficent protection and the government of atmospheric changes,
and vaguely recognizing Mercury as the dispenser of fruitful sea-
sons and the patron of public happiness."—"Life and Epistles
of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page V6.
    3. "Paul came to Lystra again after the interval of one or
 two years, .and on that occasion we are told that he found a
certain Christian there 'whose name was Timotheus, whose mother
 was a Jewess, while his father was a Greek,' and whose excellent
 character was highly esteemed by his fellow Christians of Lystra
 and Iconium. It is wa            stated that at the time of this
 second visit Timothy s already a Christian; and since we know
 from Paul's own expression, 'my own son in the faith,' that he
was converted by Paul himself, we must suppose this change to have
 taken place at the time of the first visit."— Id., pages 171, 17V.
6          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    4. "But both Paul and Barnabas returned again to visit
Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the fields of labor where they had
met such opposition and persecution. In all those. places were
many that believed the truth; and the apostles felt it their duty
to strengthen and encourage their brethren who were exposed to
reproach and bitter opposition. They were.determined to securely
bind off the work which they had done, that it might not ravel
out. Churches were duly'organiied in the places before mentioned,
elders appointed in each church, and the proper order and system
established there."—" Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs.
E. G. White, pages 62, 63.

                              Notes
    1. We are here brought in our study to the end of Paul's
first missionary journey. Barnabas accompanied him on this tour.
" They had been absent, as Ramsay calculates, above two years,
leaving Antioch in spring and returning in the third summer or
autumn following."—"Dictionary of the Bible" (Hastings),
page 705.
    2. "No age, however, of Christianity, not even the earliest,
has been without its difficulties, controversies, and corruptions.
The presence of Judas among the apostles, and of A.nanias and
Sapphira among the first disciples, were proofs of the power which
moral evil possesses to combine itself with the holiest. works. The
8           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

misunderstanding of 'the Grecians and Hebrews' in the clays of
Stephen, the suspicion of the apostles when Paul came from
Dathascus to Jerusalem, the secession of Mark at the beginning
of the first missionary journey, were symptoms of the prejudice,
ignorance, and infirmity in the midst of which the gospel was to
win its way in the hearts of men. And the arrival of the apostles
at Antioch at the close of their journey was presently followed
by a troubled controversy which involved the most momentous
consequences to all future ages of the church, and which hid to
that visit to Jerusalem which, next after his conversion, is per-
haps the most important passage in Paul's life."—"Life and
Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 177.
    3. "The matter resulted in much discussion and want of
harmony in the church, until finally the church at Antioch, ap-
prehending that a division among them would occur from any
further discussion of the question, decided to send Paul and
Barnabas, together with some responsible men of 'Antioch, to
Jerusalem, to lay the matter before the apostles and elders. There
they were to meet delegates from the different churches, and those
who had come to attend the approaching annual festivals. Mean-
while all controversy was to cease until a final decision should be
made by the responsible men of the church. This decision was
then to be universally accepted .by the various churches through-
out the country."—"Sketehes from the Life of Paul," Mrs.
E. G. White, page 63.
    4. "Some of the 'false brethren ' (for such is the name whieh
Paul gives to the Judaizers) .went down 'from Judea' to A ntioeh.
The course they adopted iu the first instance, was not that of open
antagonism to Paul, but rather of clandestine intrigue. They
came as 'spies' into an enemy's camp, creeping in 'unawares,'
that they might ascertain how far the Jewish law had been re-
laxed by the Christians at Antioch, their purpose being to bring
the whole church, if possible, under the 'bondage' of the Jewish
yoke. . . . They did not merely recommend or enjoin, for pru-
dential reasons, the continuance of certain ceremonies in them-
selves indifferent, but they said, 'Except ye be circumcised after
the manner of Moses, ye can not be saved.' Such a doctrine
must have been instantly opposed by Paul with his utmost energy.
He was always ready to go to the extreme verge of• charitable
concession when the question was one of peace and mutual under-
standing; but when the very foundations of Christianity were
in danger of being undermined, when the very continuance of
`the truth of the gospel' was in jeopardy, it was impossible that
he should 'give place by subjection,' even 'for an hour.' "—
"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and How-
son, page 183. •
   5. "This yoke was not the law of ten commandments, as
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     9

those who oppose the binding claim of the law assert; but Peter
referred to the law of ceremonies, which was made null and void
by the crucifixion of Christ. This address of Peter brought the
assembly to a point where they could listen with reason to Paul
and Barnabas, who related their experience in working among the
Gentiles. 'Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audiencb
to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God
had wrought among the Gentiles by them.' "—"Sketches from
the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 68.




         LESSON .11.1 Decision of the Council
                        JULY 15, 1911
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 15:13-35.
   LESSON •HELP : Sabbath School Worker.
   PLACE: Jerusalem.

    5. What did the council decide to do? Who was

substance of the letter. Verses 23-29.
    7. What did the letter say of those who .had been

teaching circumcision as necessary to salvation? What

   8. What is said of the men by whom the letter was

   9. What authority did they give for the decision

have? Verse 32.
   12. Having delivered their message, what did these
brethren do? Verse 33.
   13. Who remained -behind? What did they do?
Verses 34, 35.
                               Notes
    1. "James presided at the council, and his final decision, was, .
 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them which
from among the Gentiles are turned to God!' This ended the
discussion. In this instance we have a refutation of the doctrine
held by the Roman Catholic Church — that Peter was the head
of the church. Those who, as popes, have claimed to be his
successors, have no foundation for their pretensions. Nothing
in the life of Peter gives sanction to those pretended claims. If
the professed successors of Peter had imitated his example, they
would have taken no authoritative position, but one on an equality
with that of their brethren."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul,"
Airs. E. G. White, pages 68, 69.
    2. "The substance of what he [James] said was (1) that the
conversion of the Gentiles, as rehearsed by Simon (Peter's Hebrew
name), was an exact fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy, the
particular prediction cited being taken from Amos 9:11, 12; and
(2) that, that being so, the conversion of the Gentiles manifestly
had a place in the plan and purpose of God, to whom all His
works are known from the beginning, so that nothing could occur
by accident."—"Homiletical Commentary," page 802.
    This allusion to the rebuilding of the house of David that
"is fallen," as 'spoken by Amos, is especially interesting, show-
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     11

 ing, as it ,does, that the real true house of David, or the true
 Israel, are those of all nations who become one with Christ by
 faith. See Gal. 3:29; Eph. 2:11-13; Hosea 2:23; Rom. 9:25, 26.
      3. "The council which decided this case was composed of thy'
 founders of the Jewish and Gentile Christian churches. - Elders
 from Jerusalem, and deputies from Antioch, were present; and
  the most influential churches were represented. The council did
  not claim infallibility in their deliberations, but moved from the
  dictates of enlightened judgment, and with the dignity of a
  church established by the divine will. They saw that God Him-
 self had decided this question by favoring the Gentiles with the
  Holy Ghost; and it was left for them to follow the guidance of
  the Spirit.
      "The entire body of Christians were not called to vote upon
  the question. The apostles and elders -- men of influence and
  judgment — framed and issued the decree, which was thereupon
  generally accepted by the Christian churches. All were not pleased,
  however, with this decision; there was a faction of false brethren
  who assumed to engage in a work on their own responsibility.
' They indulged in murmuring and fault-finding, proposing new,
  plans, and seeking to pull down the work of the experienced men
  whom God had ordained to teach the doctrine of Christ. The
  church has had such obstacles to meet from the first, and will
  ever have them to the close of time."—"Sketches from the Life
  of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 70, 71.
      The Gentiles worshiped idols, and made sacrifices to them.
   Their priests then sold the animals that were brought to them
   as offerings, and the people ate them. They also ate the flesh
   of animals that had been strangled, and they drank blood,- and
   used it in their food. The Jews had been divinely instructed with
   regard to the food they should use in order to preserve their
   health and strength. While merely ceremonial observances were
   no longer to be followed, it was just as wrong for Gentiles as
 _for Jews to partake of those things which God had declared
   unclean and unfit for food.

conversion? Verse 15. Note 8.
                              Notes
    I.. One striking characteristic of Paul's Jabots was his watch-
fulness over those whom he brought to Christ by his ministry.
Not content with having raised up a church, or secured converts
to the faith, he "ceased not to warn every one night and day
with tears" so that he might "present every man perfect in
Christ ;Jesus." - See Acts 20:31; Col. 1:28; 2 - Cor.. 11:2. Gospel
workers now may very profitably- reflect on the diligence of - this
great - evangelist.
    2. "There was a sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas
concerning MUrk, who was still anxious to devote hiMself to the
work of the ministry. This contention caused Paul and Barnabas
to separate, the latter following out his cortvictions, and taking
Mark with him ,in his work. Paul could not; at that time, ex-
euse in any degree the weakness of Mark in - deserting them [in
 Pamphylia — see Acts 13:13] and the work Upon which they had
entered, for the ease and quiet of home; and he urged that one
 with so little stamina was unfit for the gospel ministry, which
 required: patience, self-denial, bravery, and faith, with a
 ness to sacrifice even life if need be. Barnabas, •on the other
 hand, was inclined to excuse Mark, who was his nephew, because
of his inexperience. He felt anxious that he should not abandon
the ministry, for he saw in him qualifications for a useful laborer
in the cause of Christ. Paul was afterward reconciled to Mark,
 and - received him as a fellow laborer."—"Sketches from the
 Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 47, 48.
     3. "If Silas had not returned to Jerusalem, but had remained
 in Antioch, he had doubtless recommended himself -to Paul by
 some special proof of fitness for dealing sympathetically with the
 relations of the Jewish Christians and the Gentile converts. This
 sympathy on the part of Silas would be the more marked and
 significant as he was himself almost certainly a Hebrew; other-
 wise we can not account for his high position in the Jerusalem
 church, although his Roman citizenship is implied in Acts 16:37."
 —"Expositor's Greek Testament," Knowling, column 2, page 381.
     4. Timothy no doubt accepted the- gospel under- -Paul's, min-
  14          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  istry on his first Missionary journey, and probably was an eye-
  witness of his persecution at these places. In the interim between
  the first and second visits he had become favorably known in the
  regions about his home as a consistent adherent to the Christian
  faith. Paul "did not venture to accept Timothy, an untried
  youth, without diligent inquiry with regard to his life and char-
  acter. After fully satisfying himself on these points, Paul re-
  ceived Timothy as his fellow laborer and son in the gospel."—
  "Sketches, from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 73.
      5. "Paul, with his usual good judgment, caused Timothy to
  be circumcised; not that God required it, but .in order to remove
  from the minds of the Jews an obstacle to Timothy's ministra-
  tion. Paul was to labor from place to place, in the synagogues,
  and there to preach Christ. If his companion should be known
  as an uncircumcised heathen, the work of both would be greatly
  hindered by the 'prejudice and bigotry of the people. The apostle
  everywhere met a storm of persecution. He desired to bring the
  Jews to Christianity, and sought as far as was consistent with
  the faith to remove every pretext for opposition.      Id., page 73.
      6. In verses 4, 6, 7, Luke, the writer of the Acts, speaks of
  Paul and those who were with him in the third person, "They
  went through the cities," "when they had gone," "After they
  were come." This would indicate that Luke was not one of
  the company. In verse 11 -he changes to the first person, "We
  came with a straight course," etc., which would indicate he
  was one of the company, having evidently joined Paul and Silas
  at Troas.
      7. " The luxurious extravagance of the age created a large
  demand for purple in the market of Rome, and Lydia found
  room for her profitable trade among the citizens of Philippi."
  —Farrar's "Life of St. Paul," page 276.
      8. We have other examples of baptism following immediately
  after the acceptance of Christ. See the case of the jailer in the
  next lesson, and of the eunuch in chapter 8. Baptism is an in-
  separable part of the commission to the gospel ministry. It was
  evidently set forth plainly as an obligation upon their hearers
  by these early apostles. See Matt. 28: 19, 20.

Phil. 1: 28-30.
                           .    Notes
   -1. "Day after day, as they went to their devotions, a woman
with the spirit of divination followed them, crying, 'These men
are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the
way of salvation.' This woman was a special agent of Satan;
and, as the devils were, troubled by the presence of Christ, so
the evil spirit which possessed her was ill at ease in the presence
of the apostles. . . . The words of recommendation uttered by
this woman were an injury to the cause, distracting the minds of
the _people, from the truths presented to them, and throwing dis-
repute upon the work by causing people to believe that the nuh
who spoke with the Spirit and power of God were actuated by
the seine spirit as .this emissary of Satan."—"Sketches from the
Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 74.
    2. When Jesus sent His servants to preach the gospel to all
nations, He said: "All power is_given unto Me in heaven and in
earth. Go ye therefore;" and He said further, ''Lo, I am with
you alway." So these heralds of the gospel, acting under the
great commission, worked in the name of Him who had promised
to give them power for every crisis. Matt. 28:18-20; 16:18.
    3. "The apostles endured this opposition for several days;
then Paul, under inspiration .of the Spirit of God, commanded the
evil spirit to leave the woman. Satan was thus met and rebuked.
The immediate and continued silence of the woman testified that
the apostles were the servants of God, and that the demon had
acknowledged them to be such, and had obeyed their command."
— Id., page '74.

     4. What a duet was this! These Roman 'prisons. "were pes-
tilential cells, damp' and cold, from which the light was excluded,
and where the chains rusted on the limbs of the prisoners."•
Here, tortured by stocks, lacerated and bleeding from their ter-
rible scourging, instead of murmuring or complaining, they prayed
and sang songs of thanksgiving to God. What a br;autiful lesson
of trust is here presented!
     5. "The earthquake was not a mere coincidence. There was
more here. Earthquakes do not throw all bolted doors open, and
unclasp fetters and chains. Gcid was here. He was breaking a
way for His gospel to the heart of heathendom. But His mercy
followed close in the heavy steps of His power. The jailer, like
a true Roman, was about to execute himself for .the loss of his
prisoners, as he supposed. Paul arrests the attempt. The -mar-
velous story of his conversion follows."—"Introduction to the
Book of Acts," Stiller, pages 157,.158.
     6. The jailer "had trembled because of the wrath of God ex-
pressed in the earthquake. . . . He saw his own deplorable con-
dition in contrast with that of the disciples, and with deep
humility and reverence asked them to show him the way of life."
 --"Sketehes from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 78.
      7. The following note is a valuable testimony from a recog-
nized Episcopalian authority. However, the suggestion which
he makes, that there might have been "exceptional cases," we
know to be unwarranted by the Scriptures:
     "It is needless to add that baptism was (unless in excep-
 tional cases) administered by immersion, the convert being
 plunged beneath the surface of the water to represent his death
 to the life of sin, and then raised from this momentary burial
 to represent his resurrection to the life of righteousness. It must
 be a subject of regret that the general discontinuance of this
 original form of baptism . . . has rendered obscure to popular
 apprehension some very important • passages of Scripture."—
 "Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and How-
 son, page 361.
      8. "Paul and Silas felt that to maintain the dignity of dhrist's
 church, they must not submit to the illegal course proposed by
 the Roman magistrates. The. apostles were Roman citizens, and
 it was unlawful to scourge a Roman save for the most flagrant
 crime, or to deprive him of his liberty without a fair trial and
 condemnation. . . . When this word was brought to the aUthor-
  ities, they were alarmed for fear the apostles would make com-
 plaint of their unlawful treatment to the emperor, and cause the
 magistrates to lose their positions. They accordingly visited the
  prison, apologized to the apostles for their injustice and cruelty.
  and themselves conducted them out of the prison, and entreated
 18           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON 'QUARTERLY

•them to depart out of the city. Thus the Lord wrought for His
 servants in their extremity."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul,"

                            Notes
    1. Thessalonica was "a maritime city of Macedonia; orig-
inally named Therma, and situated on the Thermaic Gulf, now a
gulf of Salonica. The city rose in importance with the decay
of Greek nationality. CaSsander, the son of Antipater, rebuilt
and enlarged it, and named it after his wife Thessalonica, the
sister of Alexander the Great, whose name commemorated in
Greek a victory over the Thessalians which her father (Philip
 I), obtained on the day when he heard of her birth. . . . The
name, ever since, under very slight modifications, has been con-
tinuous, and the city has never ceased to be eminent. It is now
known as Saloniki or Salonica, and is still the most important
town of European Turkey, next after Constantinople."—"Smith's
Dictionary of the Bible,".article Thessalonica.
20          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  -2. "Timotheus seems to have rejoined Paul and Silas, if not
at Thessalonica, at least at Berea (Acts 17:14). But we do not
see Luke again in the apostle's company till the third missionary
journey and the second visit to Macedonia (Acts 20:4-6). At
this exact point of separation we observe that he drops the style
of an eye-witness and resumes that of a historian until the second
time .of meeting, after which he writes as an eye-witness till the
arrival at Rome and the very close of the Acts. To explain and
justify the remark here made, we- need only ask the reader to
contrast the detailed narrative of events at Philippi with the more
general account of what happened at Thessalonica."—"Life and
Epistles of the Apostle,Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 262.
   .3. The question at that time, which pre-eminently involved
man's eternal destiny, was whether the One who had .attracted
so much attention in Galilee was indeed the Messiah foretold by
the holy prophets. To make clear to the people that the man of
Nazareth was indeed the Christ, was the first effort or the apostles.
    4. "The result [of Paul's work in Berea] was that many Jews
believed, as well as Greeks — men and women of the more respect-
able classes. They [the apostles] must have spent some weeks of
calm among these open-minded Bereans. . . . But it would have
been too much to hope that all should be thus open to conviction,
and the news was soon unfavorably reported to the synagogue at
Thessalonica. The-hated name of Paul acted like a spark on their
inflammable rage,-and they instantly despatched emissaries to stir
up storms among the mob of Berea. . . . It was impossible to
face this,persistent and organized outburst of hatred which was
now pursuing him from city to city. And since it was clear that
Paul,, and not Silas, was the main object of persecution, it was
arranged that, while Paul made good his escape, Silas and Tim-
othy . . . should stay to set in order all that was wanting, and
water the good seed which had begun to spring."—Forrar's
"Life of St. Paul," pages 293, 294.

                              Notes
   1. Driven from Berea,Paul came to Athens in Greece. The
city of Athens was famd for its architecture and art, and for
the education and intelligence of its people. But the darkness
of heathenism enshrouded all. Statues of gods and deified
heroes of history and poetry were to be seen in every direction.
The city was filled with altars and idols, and there were costly
temples and sanctuaries on every hand. The Athenians boasted
of their religion; but it was of no value, because they knew
nothing of the true God. It did not satisfy the needs of their
soul; and one altar in the city was dedicated ''to the unknown
God." The great men of the place delighted to engage in dis-
cussion, that they might display their wisdom and oratory.
   "Philosophers of the Epicureans" were disciples of Epicurus,
a famous teacher. They believed that the true object in life
should be to obtain pleasure, enjoyment, the indulgence of the
senses and appetite.
   T4e Stoics were indifferent alike to pain and pleasure. They
condemned the worship of images, and believed that the many
heathen gods were partial developments of the great "world-
god." They believed that deity and man alike were subjects
of fate.
    2. "The great men of the city seemed hungering for sub-
jects of discussion, in which they would have opportunity to dis-
play their wisdom and oratory. While waiting for Silas and
Timothy to meet him, Paul was not idle. 'He disputed in the
synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the
market daily with them that met with him.' The great men
of Athens were not long in finding out this singular teacher, who
presented to the people doctrines so new and strange."—
"Sketches from the -Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 91.
   3. The Areopagus "was a famous meeting place in Athens,
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      23

-and gave its name to the great council of the city which met there.
 It was situated west of the Acropolis and on a ridge of reddish
 limestone rock sloping downward on the west, but abrupt on the
 east, north, and south. A short flight of sixteen steps cut in the
 rock led to the quadrangle on the top, about twenty-four paces
 north and south and sixty paces east and west. There were
 benches cut in the stone on three sides of this square place, which
 was rudely divided into two or three smaller compartments. From
 this point the apostle could see the temple of Theseus on the
 north, the Acropolis on the east with the great Parthenon, and
 the statues, temples, and. altars on every side of him. The Are-
 opagus refers to the place rather than to the court held there."
 — Abbreviated from "People's Commentary," Rice, "Acts,"
 pages 225, 226.
   ,4. Instead of the word "superstitious,"the Revised Version
gives `f religious" in the margin. "Conybeare and Howson" so
translate the text, and in a foot-note add: "The mistranslation
of this verse in the Authorized Version is much to be regretted,
because it entirely destroys the graceful courtesy of St. Paul's
opening address, and represents him as beginning his speech by
offending his audience."
     5. The relation of Jehovah to all things, as Creator, and His
exalted character and holiness, should engage the thought of
those who profess to worship Him, far more than it does, thus
leading to a worship that is "in spirit and in truth." The
object of the Sabbath institution is to inculcate the highest ideals
of our Maker and to foster reverence for Him. The great truth
preached to the Athenians is a primary truth in the "ever-
lasting gospel" now, as it always has been. Rev. 14:6, 7.         -
     6. This appeal to men everywhere to repent is now more
solemn than in the past, in view of the fact that the judgment
" FS COME." The tendency of men is to lapse into recklessness,
and to abandon themselves to sin. See Eeel. 8:11. So the gospel
herald must urge upon the world the great restraining truth that
 judgment is certain. This is one office of the Holy Spirit. 2 Cor.
5:10; John 16:7, 8.
   P 7. Hales, in his chronology, speaking concerning the darkening
of the sun at the cross, makes the following interesting state-
ment concerning Dionysius:
     "This obscuration of the sun must have been preternatural,
in its extent, duration, and opposition of the moon at full to
the sun. It was observed at Heliopolis, in Egypt, by Dionysius,
the Areopagite, afterwards the illustrious convert of Paul at
 Athens (Acts 17:34), who, in a letter to the martyr Polycarp,
describes his own alid his companion's — the -sophist Apolloph-
anes — astonishment at the phenomenon, when they saw the
 darkness commence at the eastern brink of the sun, and proceed to
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON : QUARTERLY

the western, till the whole was eclipsed ; and then retrograde,
from the western to the eastern, till his light was fully restored;
which they attributed to the miraculous passage of the . moon
across the sun's disk. A pollophanes exclaimed, as if divining the
cause, These, 0. good Dionysius, are the vicissitudes of divine
events! ' Dionysius answered, Either the Deity suffers, .or He
sympathizes- with the sufferer.' And that sufferer, according to
tradition recorded by Michael Syncellus, of Jerusalem, he declared
to be the Unknowable God,' for whose sufferings all nature was
darkened and convulsed."—"Hales," volume C, page 897, quoted
in "Sacred Chronology," page isq._„ •

                               Notes
     1. "Corinth, the capital of Achaia, was one of the most
  famous cities of Greece. It was beautifully situated on an
-isthmus, which connects the peninsula of Morea with the Greek
 mainland. In the• rear of the city was a rocky mountain, called
 Acro-Corinth, rising abruptly to the height of 2,000 feet, upon
 the summit of which was a temple of Venus. Corinth had two
 seaports, Cenehrea, on the Gulf of Agina, and LechEeum, on the
 Gulf of Corinth. Through these important commercial routes it
 gained great wealth and influence, but its immorality was notori-
 ous even in the heathen world. Destroyed by the Romans, B. C.
146,' it was restored and rebuilt by Julius CEesar, and regained
 much of its former splendor and prosperity. Paul visited Corinth
 three times. About A. D. 53 he spent a year and a half here,
 during which time he probably wrote the two epistles to the Thes-
 salonians (Acts 18:11); then between 54 and 57 (1 Cor. 16:7
2 Cor. 12:13, 14; 13:1), and the three winter months from 57
 to 58, during which he wrote the epistle to the Romans. (Acts
20:2, 3; comp. 1 Cor. 16:6; Roni. 16:1.) He wrote two epistles
 to the Christians at Corinth. The site of this once proud and
 dissolute city is now occupied by the miserable little village of
Gortho."—"Cyclopedia of Religious Knowledge," page .218.
   "Corinth gave birth to painting; the most elaborate order of
architecture received, from her its tiame, the finest bronze was the
`Corinthian brass,' although none of her sons are mentioned among
the illustrious writers of Greece."— Quoted in "Pelaubet's
Notes," 1897.
     2. Aquila and Priscilla were refugees from Rome, having fled
 from Italy to the Grecian metropolis after the decree of Claudius
,in A. D. 52, expelling all the Jeivs from Rome. These two per- -
 sons accepted the gospel message from Paul, and on his leaving
 Corinth when returning to Syria, they accompanied him as far as
 Ephesus.- We find them at this place when Paul wrote his first
 letter to the Corinthian church (see 1 Cor. 16:19); but from
 Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 16:3, we see that they later
 returned to Rome, where their house was a place of meeting for
 the company of believers. Their devotion to the gospel is in-
 dicated by verse 4,—"Who have for my life laid down their
 own necks."
        "Paul was highly educated,- and was admired for his genius
and eloquence. He was chosen by his countrymen as a member of
 the Sanhedrin, and was a rabbi of distinguished ability; yet his
education had not been considered complete, until he had • served
an apprenticeship at some useful trade. He rejoiced that he was'
able to support himself by manual labor, and frequently declared
 that his own hands had ministered to his necessities. While in a
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    27

city of strangers, he would not be chargeable to any one. When
his means had been expended to advance the cause, of -Christ,
he resorted to his trade in order to gain a livelihood."—
"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. A'. G. White, page 100..
    "There were certain circumstances at Thessalonica, and above
all at Corinth, which made St. Paul waive his just claim, and
even cramp, limit, and confine his exertions, by imposing on him—
self the work of earning his daily food. Thessalonica and 'Cor-
inth had immense Jewish populations. The Jews were notorious
in that age as furnishing the greatest number of impostors, quack
magicians and every other kind of agency which traded upon hu-
man credulity for the purposes of gain. St. Paul was determined
that neither Jew nor Gentile in either place should be able to
hinder the work of the gospel by accusing him of self-seeking
or covetous purposes. For this purpose he united with Aquila
and Priscilla in working at their common trade as tent-makers."
—"The Expositor's Bible" (Acts), by Stokes, volume 2, pages
323, 324.
    4. "One of the proconsuls who were sent out to govern the
province of Achaia in the course of Paul's second missionary
journey was Gallio. His original name was Annteus Novatus,
and he was the brother of Annaus Seneca the philosopher. The
name under which he is known to us in sacred and secular history
was clue to his adoption into the family of Junius Gallio the
rhetorician."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Cony-
beare and Howson, page 342.



   LESSON IX Paul Begins His Third Missionary
       Journey; Paul and Apollos at Ephesus
                       AUGUST 26, 1911
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 18:23 to 19:20.
  LESSON HELP: Sabbath School Worker.
  PLACES: Galatia, Phrygia, Corinth, Ephesus.
  PERSONS: Paul, Apollos, Aquila and Priscilla, twelve disciples,
Tyrannns, vagabond Jews, seven sons of Sceva.
    GENERAL NOTE:— In this lesson we begin a study of Paul's
third missionary journey, which covered about four years, A. D.
54 to 58. Some of the early churches were visited. This journey
covered "a long residence at Ephesus, where he had spent a brief
time on his return from the second journey; probably missionary
expeditions from this center into the province of Asia, founding
28          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the seven' churches of Asia mentioned in Revelation, and Colossee
up the valley of the Lycus. He also revisited Corinth and the
churches of Macedonia during the last year, touching at Miletus
as he sailed for Palestine and Jerusalem. His arrest at Jeru-
salem prevented his returning to the point of his departure,—
Antioch in Syria.
    "During this journey were written the 1 Corinthians, from
Ephesus A. D. 57; 2 Corinthians, probably from Philippi A. D. 58;
Galatians, from Corinth A.D. 58; and Romans, from Corinth A.D.
58. "—"Peloubet's Notes," 1897.

                               Notes
   1. "It was at this time that Apollos, an Alexandrian Jew,
visited Ephesus. He had received the highest Grecian culture,
and was a scholar and an orator. He had heard the teachings
of John the Baptist, had received the baptism of repentance,
and was a living witness that the work of the prophet was not
in vain. Apollos was -a thorough student of the prophecies, and
an able expounder of the Scriptures, publicly proclaiming his
faith in Christ, as far as he himself had received the light.
    "Aquila and Priscilla listened to him, and saw that his teach-
ings were defective.- He had not a thorough knowledge of the
mission of Christ, His resurrection and ascension, and - of the
work. of His Spirit, the Comforter which He sent down to remain
 30           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  with His people during His absence. They accordingly sent for
  Apollos, and the educated Orator received instruction from them
  with grateful surprise and joy. Through their teachings he ob-
  tained a clearer understanding of the Scriptures, and became one
  of the ablest defenders of the Christian church."—"Sketches
• from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. 0. White, page 119.
      2. "This providential meeting with Aquila and Priscilla in
  Asia became the means of promoting the spread of the gospel in
  Achaia. Now that Apollos was made fully acquainted with the
. Christian doctrine, his zeal urged him to ,go where it had been •
  firmly established by an apostle. . . . The Christians of Ephesus
  encouraged him in this intention, and gave him 'letters of corn-
. mendation' to their brethren across the Agean. On his arrival
  at Corihth, he threw himself at. once among those Jews who had
  rejected Paul, and argued with them publicly and zealously on
  the ground of their Scriptures, and thus became 'a valuable
  support to those who had already believed through the grace of
  God;' for he proved with power that Jesus who had been cru-
  cified at Jerusalem, and whom Paul was proclaiming throughout
  the world, was indeed the Christ."—"Life and Epistles of the
  Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 388.
      3. "His success iu preaching the gospel led some of the
 church to exalt his labors above those of Paul, while he himself
  was working in harmony with Paul for the advancement of the
 cause. This rival spirit threatened to greatly, hinder the progress
 of truth. Paul had purposely presented .the gospel to the Corin-
 thians in its veriest simplicity. Oisappointe'd with the result of 'his
 labors at Athens, where he had brought ihis learning and eloquence
 to bear upon his hearers, he determjhed to pursue an entirely
 different course at Corinth. He presented there the plain, simple
 truth, unadorned with worldly wisdohi, and studiously dwelt upon
 Christ, and His mission to the world. The eloquent discourses
 of Apollos, and his manifest learning, were contrasted by his
 hearers with the purposely simple and unadorned preaching of
 Paul."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White,
  page 1O.
      4. "There are many at the present day who have unwittingly
 violated one of the precepts of God's law. When the under-
 standing is enlightened, and the claims of the fourth command-
 ment are urged upon the- conscience, they see themselves sinners
 in the sight of God. 'Sin is the transgression of the law,' and
 'He that shall offend in one point is guilty of all.' The honest
 seeker after truth will not plead ignorance of the law as an
 excuse for transgression. Light was within his reach. God'S-
 word is plain, and Christ has bidden him search the Scriptures.
 He reveres God's law as holy, just, and good, and he repents of
 his transgression. By faith he pleads the atoning blood of Christ,
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    31

and grasps the promise of pardon. His former baptism does 'not
satisfy him now. He has seen himself a sinner, condemned by the
law of God. He has experienced anew a death to sin, and he
desires again to be buried with Christ by baptism, that he may
rise to walk in newness of life. Such a course is in harmony
with the example of Paul in baptizing the Jewish converts. That
incident was recorded by the Holy Spirit as an instructive lesson
for the church."— Id., page 133.
   el. "This school `was probably a lecture-room, which, as the
private property of the owner, was lent or let to the apostle.'
Ramsay suggests that it was the lectire-room used by the pro-
fessors of rhetoric and philosophy a part of the day, and Paul
at other hours."—"Peloubet's Notes," 1909„
    6. "The manifestations of supernatural power which accom-
panied the apostle's work, were calculated to make a deep im-
pression upon a people given to sorcery, and priding themselves
upon their intercourse with invisible beings. The miracles of
Paul were far more potent than had ever before been witnessed
in Ephesus, and were of such a character that they could not be
imitated by the skill of the juggler or the enchantments of the
sorcerer. Thus the. Lord exalted His servant, even in the esti-
mation of the idolaters themselves, immeasurably above the most
favored and powerful •of the magicians."—"Sketches from the
Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White pages 135, 136.
    7. "The discomfiture and humiliation of those who had pro-
faned the name of Jesus, soon became known throughout Ephesus,
by Jews and Gentiles. Unmistakable proof had been given of
the sacredness of that name, and the peril which they incurred
who should invoke it while they bad no faith in Christ's divine
mission. Terror seized the minds of many, and the work of the
gospel was regarded by all with awe and reverence."— Id.,
pages 136, 137.
    8. "They did not sell them [the books] for others to use, as
they might have done, but destroyed the instruments of evil at
great cost, reckoned at fifty thousand pieces of silver, Latin,
denarii, Greek, drachmas, worth about 16 cents each, or $8,000
in all. But in those days a drachma was equivalent to a! day's
wage, so that the sum was equivalent to $50,000 to $100,000 in
our time."—"Peloubet's Notes," 1909.

1 Cor. 15: 32. Note 4.
                               Notes
    1. "The first epistle to the Corinthians was written by the
apostle Paul during the latter part of his stay in Ephesus
[about 57 A.D.]. . . .
    "A letter was sent to Paul by the church, revealing nothing
of the enormous sins that existed among them. . . . He was,
however, forcibly impressed by the Holy Spirit, that the true
state of the church had been concealed, and that this letter was
an attempt to draw from him statements which the writers could
construe to serve their own purposes. There had come to ..Ephesus
about this time several members of the household of Chloe, a
Christian family of high repute in Corinth. In answer to the ques-
tions of the apostle, these brethren reluctantly gave him a state-
ment of facts as they existed. The church was rent in factions;
the dissenSions that arose at the time of Apollos' visit had greatly
increased. False teachers were leading the brethren to despise
the instructions of Paul. The doctrines and the ordinances of the
gospel had been perverted. Pride, idolatry, and sensualism were
steadily increasing among 'those who 'had once been disciples of
Christ.
    " The apostle's worst fears were more than realized          He
sent Titus to Corinth to inform them of. his change of plans,
and to do what he could to correct the existing evils. Then,
summoning all the courage of his nature, and keeping his soul
stayed upon God, . . . and throwing hiS whole soul into the
work, he dictated to the faithful Sosthenes one of the richest,
most instructive, and most powerful of his letters,— the first
extant epistle • to the Corinthians."—"Sketches from the Life
 of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 149-151.
     2. "The temple of Diana, one of the wonders of the world,
 and which was 220 years in building, and erected at the joint
 cost of all Asia, stood without the walls, at some little distance
34           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  to the northeast, and being constructed of the purest marble, is
 said to have gleamed like a meteor to the gaze of the approaching
 mariner. It was- built upon marshy ground, and the foundations
 were laid at a vast expense. The first superstructure, or basement,
 was ascended by a grand flight of fourteen steps, and upon this
 platform was erected the temple, facing the east, 425 feet long, and
220 broad, and supported by columns of Parian marble, 60 feet
 high, of which 36 were beautifully carved.
      ''The building was of the Ionic order. its porticoes con-
 sisted each of 32 columns, eight abreast, and four deep, and
 around the sides were two rows of columns. In the center of
 the court or hall is the shrine, containing the image of the goddess.
 We enter, and the roof, which is of cedar, is supported by a row,
 on each side, of four columns of green jasper. In front of us is
 the altar, rich with the carvings of Praxiteles, and beyond it
 hangs from the ceiling the purple embroidered veil screening
 the image that all the world worshipeth — a wooden image so
 time-worn that whether the material be pine, or cedar, or ebony,
 the nearest examination can not discover. Whence it came or
 by whom it was shaped is a mystery, but the common belief is
 that it fell from heaven."— Abbreviated from "Life of St.
 Paul," Lewiu, volume 1, pages 323-326.
     3. "The month of May was specially dedicated to the god-
 dess of Ephesus, and was called from her the Artemisian. Dur-
 ing the month was held the great fair — called Ephesia — which
 attracted an immense concourse of people from all parts of
 Asia, and was kept with all possible splendor and revelry. The
 gods were personated by chosen representatives, who received
 throughout the month a sort of mock adoration.
     "The theater and stadium were densely crowded by festive
 throngs to listen to the musical contest, to watch the horse-races
 and the athletic exhibitions, or to look on with thrills of fieicer
 emotion at the horrible combats of men and beasts. The vast
 expense of these prolonged festivities and superb spectacles was
 entirely borne by the ten Asiarchs. They were men of high dis-
 tinction, chosen annually from the wealthiest citizens of the chief
 cities of Asia, and it Was their duty to preside over the games
 and to keep order in the theater. Their names were recorded on
 coins and in public inscriptions, and the garlands and the purple
 robes which distinguished them during the continuance of the
.feast were the external marks of the popular gratitude."—
 Abbreviated from Farrar's "Life of St. Paul," pages 369, 370.
     4. ''Paul informed the Corinthians of his trouble in Asia,
 where, he says, 'We were pressed out of measure, above strength,
 insomuch that we despaired even of life.' In his first epistle
 he speaks of fighting with beasts at Ephesus. He thus refers
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 35-
to the fanatical mob that clamored for his life. They were in-
deed more like furious wild beasts than men. With gratitude
to God, Paul reviews his danger and his deliverance. He had
thought when at Ephesus, that his life of usefulness was about
to close, that the promise made to him that he should at last
die for his faith, was about to be fulfilled. But God had pre-
served him, and his remarkable deliverance made him hope that
his labors were not at an end. "—" Sketches from the, Life of
Paul," Mrs. E. G. White; page 178.

                              Notes
   1. "Paul had directed Titus, on his return from Corinth, to
rejoin him at Troas, and he awaited the coming of this beloved
fellow laborer, hoping to receive some tidings from the Cor-
inthian church. But week after week passed, and Titus came not.
The apostle's solicitude became almost unsupportable. He says,
`My spirit found no rest, because of Titus, my brother.' He
left Troas, and went to Philippi, where he met Timothy. .
    "A deep sadness still rested upon the mind and heart of
Paul because of his apprehensions concerning the Corinthian
church. While at Philippi, he commenced his second epistle to
them;.for they hung as a heavy weight upon his soul. -. . .
   "Paul's burden because of the Corinthians did not leave him
until he reached Macedonia, where he met Titus. He states: •
`Our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; with-
out were fightings, within were fears. Nevertheless, God that
comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.                    37
of Titus.' The report of this faithful messenger greatly relieved
the mind of Paul. Titus assured him that the greater part of,
the church at Corinth had submitted to the injunctions of the
apostle, and had given proof of the deepest repentance for the
sins that had brought a reproach upon Christianity. . . .
    "In his second epistle to the church, the apostle expressed his
joy at the good work which had been wrought in them: `Though
I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did
repent'— when tortured with fear that his words would be de-
spiSed, and half regretting that he had written so decidedly and
severely."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White,
pages 173-177.
    2. "From Macedonia, perhaps from Philippi, he wrote the
second epistle to the Corinthians, which he soon followed in per-
sou. .From Corinth he wrote his epistle to the Romans, in order.
to prepare the brethren of Rome for his personal preaching.
Phcebe, the deaconess, was probably the bearer of the letter.
But before going to Rome .he visits Jerusalem."—"Concise Cy-
clopedia of Religious Knowledge," page 715.
     'In• the autumn lie [Paul] went to Greece, and spent three
months there, chiefly in Corinth, where he had much to do amid
sickness and afflictions on every side, 'fightings without and fears
within' (2 Cor. 4:7-11; 7:5, 6), in caring for all the churches
    Cor. 11:28), and correcting wrong conduct (2 Cor. 12:20, 21;
13:1, 2). It was four or -five years since he had left them after
a stay of a year and a half."—" Peloubet 's Notes ," . 1909.
    3. "Paul was accompanied to Corinth by a little band of
fellow laborers, some of whom had been his companions during
the months spent in Macedonia, and his assistants in gathering
funds for the church at Jerusalem. He could rely upon these
brethren for sympathy and support in . the present crisis."—
"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 186.
    4. "The passage from .Philippi was hindered by- contrary
winds, so that five days instead of two, the usual time, were re-
quired to reach Troas. Here Paul remained seven days, and as
was his custom, improved the opportunity , to encourage and
strengthen the believers."— Id., page 196.
    5. That this was au evening meeting is clear from the fact
that there were "many lights in the upper chamber," and that
Paul talked "till break of day."
    "The labors of the early days of the week that was spent -at
Troas are not related to us, but concerning .the last day we have
a narrative which enters into details with all the minuteness of
one of the gospel histories. It was the evening which succeeded
the Jewish Sabbath."—"Life and Epistles • of the Apostle
Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 530. -            •
38          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    "The meeting was held on what we should call Saturday
evening; but we must remember that the Jewish first day began
from sundown on Saturday or the Sabbath."—"The Expositor's
Bible" (Acts), volume 2, page 393.
     6. "As Jesus had once said of the young maiden who was
taken by death from the society of her friends, 'She is not dead,
but sleepeth,' so the apostle of Jesus received power to restore
the dead to life. He went down and fell upon the body like
Elisha of old, and, embracing Eutychus, said to the bystanders,
`Do not lament, for his life is in him.' "—"Life and Epistles
of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 521.
    7. "But the time came when Paul too must depart. The ves-
sel might arrive at Assos before him, and, whatever influence he
might have with the seamen, he could not count on any long
delay. . .
    "The discomfort of a crowded ship is unfavorable for de-
votion, and prayer and meditation are necessary for maintaining
      igious life even of an apostle. That Saviour to whose
the rel
service he was devoted had often prayed in solitude on the moun-
tain and crossed the brook Kedron to kneel under the olives of
Gethsemane.. And strength and peace were surely sought and
obtained by the apostle from the Redeemer as he pursued his
lonely road that Sunday afternoon in spring among the oak woods
and the streams of Ida."— Id., pages 521, 522.
    8. "That he should wish to reach Jerusalem in time for
Pentecost is natural enough, for there was a peculiar fitness in
offering his collection to the church at Jerusalem on that occasion.
It was the harvest feast, and it brought to Jerusalem a larger
number of foreign Jews than any other festival, so that the rela-
tion between Palestine and the rest of the world received then
special emphasis. Paul might well fear that a visit to Ephesus,
where he had so many friends, and very likely enemies as well,
would demand more time than he could afford under the cir-
cumstances, possibly compelling him to wait for another ship."—
"The Apostolic Age," McGiffert, page 339.

                                  Notes
     1. "Paul had ever exalted the divine law. He had presented
  before the people their great sin in transgressing its precepts,
 and their duty to repent of such transgression. He had showed"
  them that there was in law no pocwer to save them from the
  penalty of disobedience. While they. should repent of their sins,
 and humble themselves before God, whose holy law they had
  broken, and whose just wrath they had thus incurred, they must
  exercise faith in the blood of -Christ as their only ground of
  pardon. . . . By repentance and faith they might be free from
  the condemnation of sin, and through ,the grace of Christ be
 enabled henceforth to render obedience to the law of God."—
 "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 190.
     2. "Paul had not designed to bear this testimony; but while
 he was speaking the Spirit of inspiration came upon him, con,
 firming his former fears that this would be his .last meeting with
 his Ephesian brethren. He therefore left with them his counsel
 and admonition as .his will and testament to be carried out by
  them when they should see him no more."— Id., pages 199, 200.
     3. "Could ministers of the gospel constantly bear in mind
  that they are dealing with the purchase of the, blood of Christ,
 they would have a deeper sense of the solemn importance of their
 work. They are to take heed unto themselves and to the -flock.
 Their own example must illustrate and enforce their instructions.
 Those who teach others the way of life should be careful to give
 no occasion for the truth to be evil spoken of. As representatives
 of Christ, they are to maintain the honor of His name. By their
 devotion, their purity of life, their godly conversation, they should
 prove themselves worthy of their calling. By right example
 they may exert an influence which words alone could not have, to
 encourage faith and holiness, fervent love, devotion, and integrity
 among those for whom they labor."— Id., pages 200, 201.
-5‹ 4. " They were gathered together — probably in some soli-
 tary spot upon the shore — to listen to his address. This little
 company formed a- singular contrast with the crowds which used
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       41
to assemble at the times of public amusement in the theater of
Milotus. But that vast theater is now a silent ruin, while the
words spoken by a care=worn traveler to a few despised strangers
are still living as they were that day, to teach lessons for all time
and to make known eternal. truths to all who will hear them, while
they • reveal to us, as though they were merely human words, all
the tenderness and the affection of Paul, the individual speaker."
—"Life and .Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and
Howson, page 526. '--
   "  Sadly the, disciples followed him to the ship, their hearts
filled with anxiety, both for his future and for their own. The
apostle's tears flowed freely as he parted from these brethren,
and after he had embarked there came to him from the shore the
sound of weeping. With heavy hearts the elders turned homeward,
knowing that they could expect no further help from hint who
had felt• so deep an interest and labored with so great zeal for
them and for the church under their care."—"Sketches from the
Life of Paul,".3.1rs. E. G. White, pages 202, 203.

            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     43

   17. With what kind of gifts is the Lord pleased?
2 Cor. 9 : 6, 7. Note 5.
                              Notes
    1. By this text (1 Cor. 16:2) it will be seen that every dis-
ciple has been made a treasurer for God. The Lord places the
responsibility upon each believer to render back to Him (1) the
tithe—which has never been given man; (2) offerings; both
of which are subject to the expression "as God hath prospered
him." To ascertain "how God. hath prospered him' requires
an examination into his private business affairs. No one can
do this for another, as it would require the turning over of per-
sonal business matters for examination. Therefore each church- ,
member actually becomes a treasurer for God. This reveals great
confidence on the part of God. He voluntarily' puts the financial
interests of His own kingdom in the earth into our hands. He
leaves it to us to count out from our own purses that portion be-
longing to Him. Surely in a case of this kind it behooves every
one to be strictly honest. And it is possible that much more is
involved in this than many suppose. Some have proved untrue
to this confidence reposed in them by the Lord, and with results
quite disastrous. Among these might be mentioned Achan, Ana-
nia and Sapphira, and Judas. Roni. 14:12.
     2. " Voluntary offerings and the tithe constitute the revenue
     the gospel. Of the means which are entrusted to man, God
claims a certain portion,— a tithe; but He leaves all free to
say how much the tithe is, and whether or not they will give more
than this.? They are to give as they purpose in their hearts."—
"TestimAies for the Church," volume 5, page 149.
     3. "God has given special direction as to the use of the
 tithe. He does not design that His work shall be crippled for
 want of means. That there may be no haphazard work and no
 error, He has made our duty on these points very plain. The
 portion that God has reserved for Himself is not to be diverted
 to any other purpose than that which He has specified. Let none
 feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to use according to their own
 judgment. They are not to use it for themselves in an emer-
 gency, nor to apply it as-they see fit, even in what they may
 regard as the Lord's work."—Id., volume 9, page 247.
     4. "The hearts of men become hardened through selfishness,
 and like Ananias and Sapphira, they are tempted to withhold
 part of the price, while pretending to come up to the rules of
 tithing. Will a man rob God? Should means flow into the treas-
 ury exactly according to God's plan,— a tenth of all the increase,—
 there would be abundance to carry forward His work. 'Well,'
44           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

says one, 'tie calls keep coming to give to the cause. I am weary
of giving.' Are you? Then let me ask, Are you weary of re-
ceiving from God's beneficent hand? Not until He ceases to
bless you, will you cease to be under bonds to return to Him the
portion He claims."— Id., volume 5, page 150. .1 i.
   5. "Not grudgingly." This spirit in the heart reveals that
the giver has lost sight of the essential iii the gospel plan of
redemption. He fails to view Calvary. The things of earth are
become of greater value than the heavenly. God is not glorified
by such forced gifts. Such hearts need reconversion. But the
cheerful giver reveals a heart overflowing with love for his
blessed Redeemer, who gave up. a royal home, and for our sakes
became poor. "Not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth
a cheerful giver."

        THE THIRD READER again repeats the Gospel
    story in a little different setting, and is still further
    enriched by the addition of biographical sketches, para-
    bles of Jesus, and simple lessons in physiology, geogra-
    phy, and botany.
        BOOK FOUR embraces a wider variety of subjects,
    introducing the pupil, by short biographies, to many of
    the best known characters of history. Interesting Bible
    stories are also used in this Reader, with themes more
    fully developed. Some of the most wonderful inventions
    are brought before the student in a way to be easily
    understood and greatly appreciated. The study of
    nature and science is encouraged by fascinating stories
    of animals and birds, and by sketches of a more scien-
    tific nature but no less interesting.
        BOOK FIVE is a little higher development Of the
    same general plan. Many of the simpler literary gems
     are introduced, and Bible stories are also used quite
     freely.
         BOOK SIX is still in preparation, but will doubtless
     be ready for the beginning of the next school year.
         BOOK SEVEN is quite largely made up of selec-
     tions from the best authors, including the Bible and
     our best denominational writers. More attention is given
     to vocal physiology and voice training, and the lessons
     are arranged in a way to develop the natural ability
     of the student. Like all the Readers, this book contains
     many selections from the best poetry of the English
     language.
         This series is beautifully illustrated, and bound in a
     very substantial and attractive style.

               Books One to Seven
    As the first years of school life have the greatest
influence on the character of the child, much care should
be used in selecting the reading lessons to be placed in
the hands of the pupil. The vital, living truths con-
 tained in the Scriptures are essential to the formation
.of sound characters; therefore the lessons in the first
three Readers are quite largely developed from Bible
themes, in story form.

 . THE FIRST READER gives the story in a very
simple style, fixing upon the child's mind in his first
school year the beautiful Gospel story from Creation to
Redemption.

    THE SECOND READER follows the same general
line, with several additional topics especially interesting
to children.
