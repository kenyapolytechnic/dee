    12 Gaza, earlier called Azzah, was the most southern city in
Palestine, about fifty miles southwest of Jerusalem, on the shore
route between Palestine and Egypt. It was a very ancient city.
Throughout Bible times it was generally held by the Philistines.
See Judges 16: 21-30.
    "The epithet 'desert' as applied to the region between Jeru-
salem and Gaza, did not necessarily mean that it was all sand
and bare rock. Sections might be spitable for olive-trees and grain
crops, but there were no large springs or brooks for irrigation
and the nourishment of flocks and herds, and therefore there
could be few or no villages in which the evangelist could preach.
It seemed an unreasonable command, and one that involved a waste
of time, but 'he arose and went.' "
    2. The name "Ethiopia" (Hebrew, Kush, country of burnt
faces) is doubtless here used to refer to a kingdom south of Egypt,
including part of modern Nubia and the Egyptian Sudan. It
was governed by queens, whose dynastic name was Candace. The
inhabitants were dark-skinned, but were probably not Negroes.
The eunuch was no doubt a tivelp .fhe region.
    3. A careful study of         .        i.eveals the secret of suc-
cessful missionary work. Notwithstanding the-fact that the Lord
sent Philip into a desert to wait by the roadside, he obeyed at
once. If he had delayed one day, or even a few hours, he would
have missed meeting the Ethiopian. When Philip saw the chariot,
again the Spirit said; "Go." If Philip had delayed, the chariot
would soon have passed; but he ran, and thus joined the chariot.

Philip met the man where he was. He did not introduce a new
subject, but was familiar enough with the Scriptures to preach
the full gospel message, including baptism, from the verses the
eunuch was reading.
   4. Azotus, the ancient Ashdod, was about fifteen miles north of
Gaza, and near the coast. It was the seat of the worship of
Dagon. See 1 Sam. 5: 1-9. Cnsarea, on the coast, was about
seventy miles northwest of Jerusalem, and about the same dis-
tance north of Azotus. Unlike Gaza and Azotus, it was then a
modern city, built by Herod the Great about twenty-two years
before the birth of Christ.

                               Notes
   1. "Saul's 'threatening and slaughter' came from inside; the
bright light of heaven came from outside. The inner light of a
man is not worth much as a guide to duty; it is light from out-
side that every man needs. Saul was following conscience when
he started on a life and death hunt for Damascus Christians. If
his conscience had not been enlightened from heaven, Saul would
have kept on the threatening and slaughter track to the end of
his life. We need light from heaven to show us our duty toward
our fellows, and also the safe road toward heaven."— Sunday
School Times, 1909.
     2. "To kick against the pricks."— A figure of speech derived
from the custom of driving oxen with a goad. If the ox re-
sisted and kicked against it, he wounded himself severely. Thus
Jesus shows Saul how useless and how injurious to himself is his
fighting against God.
   - 3. The conversion of Saul is narrated three times in the book
of Acts. Paul relates it himself in chapters 22: 3-16; 26: 9-18;
and it is alluded to several times in his epistles.
     4. "Many have the idea that they are responsible to Christ
alone for their light and experience, independent of His acknowl-
edged followers in the world. But this is condemned by Jesus
in His teachings, and in the examples, the facts, which He has
given for our instruction. Here was Paul, one whom Christ was
to fit for a most important work, one who was to be a chosen
vessel unto Him, brought directly into the presence of Christ;
yet He does not teach him the lessons of truth. He arrests his
course and convicts him; and when he asks, 'What wilt Thou
have me to dol' the Saviour does not tell him directly, but places
him in connection with His church. They will tell thee what thou
 mitst do. Jesus is the sinner's friend? His heart is ever open,
8           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

ever touched with human wo; He has all power, both in heaven
and upon earth; but He respects the means which He has or-
dained for the enlightenment and salvation of men. He directs
Saul to the church, thus acknowledging the power that He has
invested in it as a channel of light to the world. It is Christ's
organized body upon the earth, and respect is required to be paid
to His ordinances."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 3,
page 433;
 - 5. "As the weary travelers neared Damascus, the eyes of Saul
rested with pleasure upon the fertile land, the beautiful gardens,
the fruitful orchards, and the cool streams that ran murmuring
amid the fresh green shrubbery. It was very refreshing to look
upon such a scene after a long, wearisome journey over a desolate
waste. While Saul, with his companions, was gazing and admiring,
suddenly a light above the brightness of the sun shone round about
him, 'and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto
him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Mel And he said, Who
art Thou, Lord' And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou per-
secutest; it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.'
    "The scene was one of the greatest confusion. The com-
panions of Saul were stricken with terror, and almost blinded by
the intensity of the light. They heard the voice, but saw no one,
and to them all was unintelligible and mysterious. But Saul,
lying proStrate upon the ground, understood the words that were
spoken, and saw clearly before him the Son of God. One look
upon that glorious Being, imprinted His image forever upon
the soul of the stricken Jew. The words struck home to his heart
with appalling force. A flood of light poured in upon the dark-
ened chambers of his mind, revealing his ignorance and error.
He saw that while imagining himself to be zealously serving god
in persecuting the followers of Christ, he had in reality been
doing the work of Satan."—" Sketches from the Life of Paul,"
page 22.
    6. "How different from what he [Saul] had anticipated was
his entrance into that city! In proud satisfaction he had neared
Damascus, expecting on his arrival to be greeted with ostentation
and applause because of the honor conferred upon him by the
high priest, and the great zeal and penetration he had manifested
in searching out the believers to carry them as captives to Jeru-
salem, there to be condemned, and punished without mercy. He
had determined. that his journey should be crowned with success;
and his courageous and persevering spirit quailed at no diffi-
culties or dangers in the pursuance of his object. He had deter-
mined that no Christian should escape his vigilance; he would
inquire of men, women, and children concerning their faith, and
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                       9
that of those with whom they were connected; he would enter
houses, with power to seize their inmates, and to send them as
prisoners to Jerusalem.
    "But how changed was the scene from that which he had an-
ticipated! Instead of wielding power and receiving honor, he
was himself virtually a prisoner, being deprived of sight, and
dependent upon the guidance of his companions. Helpless, and
tortured by remorse, he felt himself to be under sentence of death,
and knew not what further disposition the Lord would make
of him.
    "He was taken to the house of the disciple Judas, and there
he remained, in solitude, studying upon the strange revelation
that had broken up all his plans, and changed the entire current
of his life."--"Sketches from the Life of Paul," pages 25, 26.

                          Notes
  1. "After that many days were fulfilled."- This period of
"many days" evidently covers the time Saul spent in Arabia,
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      11'

shortly after his conversion, before he went to Jerusalem. See
Gal. 1: 17, 18.
   "Paul's life was in peril, and he received a commission from
God to leave Damascus for a time. He went into Arabia; and
there, in comparative solitude, he had ample opportunity for
communion with God, and for contemplation. He wished to be
alone with God, to search his own heart, to deepen his repentance,
and to prepare himself by prayer and study to engage in a work
which appeared to him too great and too important for him to
undertake. He was an apostle, not chosen of men, but chosen
of God, and his work was plainly stated to be among the Gentiles.
   "While in Arabia he did not communicate, with the apostles;
he sought God earnestly with all his heart, determining not to
rest till he knew for a certainty that his repentance was accepted,
and his great sin pardoned. He would not give up the conflict
until he had the assurance .that Jesus would be with him in his
coming ministry. He was ever to carry about with him in the
body the marks of Christ's glory, in his eyes, which had been
blinded by the heavenly light, and he desired also to bear with
him constantly the assurance of Christ's sustaining grace. Paul
came in close connection with heaven, and Jesus communed with
him, and established him in his faith, bestowing upon him His
wisdom and grace.
   "Paul now returned to Damascus, and preached boldly in the
name of Jesus. The Jews could not withstand the wisdom of
his arguments, and they therefore counseled together to silence
his voice by force — the only argument left to a sinking cause.
They decided to assassinate him. The apostle was made acquainted
with their purpose. The gates of the city were vigilantly guarded,
day and night, to cut off his escape. The anxiety of the disciples
drew them to God in prayer; there was little sleeping among
them, as they were busy in devising ways and means for the
escape of the chosen apostle. Finally they conceived a plan by
which he was let down from a window, and lowered over the wall
in a basket at night. In this humiliating manner Paul made his
escape from Damascus."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul,"
 pages 33, 34.
    2. "He [Paul] now proceeded to Jerusalem, wishing to be-
come acquainted with the apostles there, and especially with Peter.
He was very anxious to meet the Galilean fishermen who had lived,
and prayed, and conversed with Christ upon earth. It was with
a yearning heart that he desired to meet the chief of apostles. . . .
He attempted to join himself to his brethren, the disciples; but
great was his grief and disappointment when he found that they
would not receive him as one of their number. . .         Barnabas,
12          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

who had liberally contributed of his means to sustain the cause
of Christ, and to relieve the necessities of the poor, had been
acquainted with Paul when he opposed the believers. He now
came forward and renewed that acquaintance, heard the testimony
of Paul in regard to his miraculous conversion, and his experience
from that time. He fully believed and received Paul, took him
by the hand, and led him into the presence of the apostles. . . .
    "The apostles no longer hesitated; they could not withstand
God. Peter and James, who at that time were the only apostles in
Jerusalem, gave the right hand of fellowship to the once fierce
persecutor of their faith; and he was now as much beloved and
respected as be had formerly been feared and avoided. Here the
two grand characters of the new faith met — Peter, one of the
chosen companions of Christ while He was upon earth, and Paul, a
Pharisee, who, since the ascension of Jesus, had met Him face
to face, and had talked with Him, and had also seen Him, in
vision, and the nature of His work in heaven."—"Sketches from
the Life of Paul," pages 35, 36.
    It seems from Gal. 1: 18, 19 that Paul only remained in Jeru-
salem fifteen days at this time.
    3. "Lydda, in the Old Testament Lud, a small town in the
fertile plain of Sharon (verse 35) which was situated between the
mountains and seacoast of northern Judea, now called Lucid, and
the first principal station on the railway from Jaffa [Joppa]
to Jerusalem."—Riddle.

Verse 23.
14          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                              Notes
    1. The "band" means a Roman cohort. The Roman army
was divided into legions, each legion into ten cohorts, each cohort
into three maniples, and each maniple into two centuries. A
centurion was the officer in command of a century, which consisted
of a hundred men. Originally the members were recruited in
Italy.
    2. The visions given to Cornelius and Peter, like those given
to Saul and Ananias, found recorded in Acts 9, show very clearly
how God plans and directs events so as to instruct and • save
those who love truth and righteousness, and sincerely desire a
knowledge of God.
    3. The Jew considered the touch of the Greek as defiling, "his
food was an abomination to the devout Israelite, and his religion
blasphemy." Peter "knew that the Gentile was to be saved.
The Old Testament declared it on every page. The Lord Jesus
confirmed it. But how should it be accomplished? It was ac-
complished. The prejudices and the convictions of the ages gave
way. . . . And he who knows what human nature is must admit
that no earthly power could have solved the problem in a single
generation. Only God could."— Abbreviated from J. M. Stigler,
"The Acts."
    4. It was hard for Peter, with all his Jewish prejudices, to
understand the vision. God was preparing his mind for the
messengers who were on the road from Cnsarea. If Peter had
fully accepted this call from God to labor among the Gentiles,
his life-work might have equaled Paul's. The vision was not given
to sanction the eating of flesh of unclean animals, but to teach
Peter that he "should not call any man common or unclean,"—
that the Gentiles were as precious in God's sight as the Jews.
Acts 10: 28.

   1. "It was nearly two days before the journey was ended and
Cornelius had the glad privilege of opening his doors to a gospel
minister, who according to the assurance of God, should teach
him and his house how they might be saved. While the messengers
were upon their errand, the centurion had gathered together as
many of his relatives as were accessible, that they, as well as he,
might be instructed in the truth. When Peter arrived, a large
company were gathered, eagerly waiting to listen to his words."
—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 329.
    2. "As Peter entered the house of the Gentile, Cornelius did
not salute him as an ordinary visitor, but as one honored of
Heaven, and sent to him by God. It is an Eastern custom to
bow before a prince or other high dignitary, and for children
to bow before their parents who are honored with positions of
trust. But Cornelius, overwhelmed with reverence for the apostle
who had been delegated by God, fell at his feet and worshiped
him. Peter shrank with horror from this -act of the centurion,
and lifted him to his feet, saying, 'Stand up; I myself also am
a man.' He then commenced to converse with him familiarly,
in order to remove the sense of awe and extreme reverence with
which the centurion regarded him."—"Spirit of Prophecy," vol-
ume 3, pages 329, 330.

   3. " This chapter [Acts 10] has much precious counsel in it
for us, and we should study it with humble attention. When the
Lord has His appointed agencies whereby He gives help to souls,
and men disrespect these agencies, and refuse to receive help
from them, and decide that they will be directly taught of God,
the Lord does not gratify their desire. The man who takes such
a position is in danger of taking up with the voices of strangers,
and of being led into false paths. Both Cornelius and Peter were
instructed what they were to do, and they obeyed the angel's word.
Cornelius gathered his household together to hear the message of
light from Peter. If he had said, I will not be taught of any
man, the angel would have left him to himself."—Mrs. E. G.
White, in "Review and Herald," No. 40, 1893.
   4. The disciples of Christ must not be respecters of persons.
Neither nationality, nor social rank, nor poverty, nor riches must
influence our interest in the salvation of souls. "If ye have
respect of persons,.ye commit sin." James 2: 9.

                                Notes
   1. ''Peter preached Jesus to that company of attentive hear-
ers; His life, ministry, miracles, betrayal, crucifixion, resurrection,

and ascension, and His work in heaven, as man's Representative
and Advocate, to plead in the sinner's behalf. As the apostle
spoke, his heart glowed with the Spirit of God's truth which he
was presenting to the people. His hearers were charmed by the
doctrine they heard, for their hearts had been prepared to re-
                                     ,
ceive the truth. The apostle was interrupted    by the descent of
the Holy Ghost, as was manifested on the day of Pentecost."—

                                         body. Verses 47, 48.
   3. Peter and Cornelius worked out in the Lord's way a dif-
ficult problem. By the same process we must solve the latter-day
problems. They were men of prayer. They did their immediate
duty without concern for what lay farther ahead. They did what
the Lord asked them to do now, without inquiry as to what He
would ask of them another day or another year. If we are not
doing His will at this moment, we shall never be sure of knowing
His will later.


LESSON V11.— The Gospel at Antioch; a New Center
           Open for Missionary Work
                         MAY 13, 1911
   LESSON SCRIPTURE:   Acts 11: 19-30.
   LESSON HELP: The   Sabbath School Worker.
  PLACES: Antioch, Phenicia, Cyprus, Cyrene, Tarsus.
  PEssoNs: Scattered Christians, Grecians, Barnabas, Saul,
Agabus, Claudius Caesar.
                            Questions

    1. What had caused a scattering among the breth-
20           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

ren? How far had they traveled? To what class did
they confine their missionary labors? Acts 11: 19.
Note 1.
    2. Who were the first to change this plan of work?
With whom did they bdgin to labor? Verse 20.
    3. In what way did God show His approval of their
efforts to carry the gospel to the Grecians? Verse 21.
    4. When the brethren at Jerusalem heard of the
work at Antioch, who was sent to that place? Verse 22.
    5. After Barnabas had fully investigated the matter,
how did he feel? What did he exhort them to do?
Verse 23.
    6. What is said of the character of Barnabas? What
was the result of his work at Antioch? Verse 24.
    7. Win, did Barnabas go to Tarsus? Verse 25.
Note 2.
   8. Where did Barnabas bring Saul? How long did
they labor together in Antioch? What name was given
the disciples in that place? Verse 26. Note 3.
   9. Who visited Antioch at this time? Verse 27.
  10. What was the name of one of these prophets?
What prophecy did he utter? When was his prophecy
fulfilled? Verse 28.
  11. How were the brethren in Judea sustained during
the great dearth? Verse 29.
  12. Who carried their liberality to Jerusalem? Verse
30. Note 4.
                               Notes
    1. Phenicia (Phenice) lay between Galilee and Syria. Cyprus
.was the nearest large island in the Mediterranean. Cyrene was
 in Africa. Antioch, the capital of Syria, was situated on the river
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     21

Orontes, about sixteen miles from the sea. Tarsus, Saul's native
city, was the chief city of Cilicia.
    2. It is quite probable that the work among the Gentiles at
Cnsarea and the Grecians at Antioch reminded Barnabas of what
the Lord had declared concerning Saul, "He is a chosen vessel
unto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles." When Barnabas
saw that God was working for the Gentiles, he thought the time
had come when Saul should enter upon the work God had called
him to do; so he went in search of him.
   3. "It was here that the disciples were first called Christians.
This name was given them because Christ was the main theme
of their preaching, teaching, and conversation. They were con-
tinually recounting the incidents of His life, during the time
in which His disciples were blessed with His personal company.
They dwelt untiringly upon His teachings, His miracles of healing
the sick, casting out devils, and raising the dead to life. With
quivering lips and tearful eyes they spoke of His agony in the
garden, His betrayal, trial, and execution, the forbearance and
humility with which He endured the contumely and torture im-
posed upon Him by His enemies, and the Godlike pity with which
He prayed for those who persecuted Him. His resurrection and
ascension, and His work in heaven as a Mediator for fallen man,
were joyful topics with them. The heathen might well call them
Christians, since they preached of Christ, and addressed their
prayers to God through Him."—"Sketches from the Life of
Paul," pages 40, 41.
    4. A list of the prominent characteristics of the church at
Antioch is impressive:
    1. A church born of persecution. Verse 19.
    2. A church of different nationalities. Verses 19, 20.
    3. A church of able leadership. Verses 22-26.
    4. A church of growing influence. Verses 21, 26.
    5. A church of generous givers. Verses 27-30.

  21. Who returned from Jerusalem with Barnabas and

                            Notes
   1. ''Herod the king." Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod
the Great, now ruled all Palestine under the Romans. Herod the
Great died soon after the birth of Jesus. Herod Antipas, the
son to whom Galilee and Perea were given, was the Herod who
put John the Baptist to death.
   2. "Four quaternions of soldiers" Four sets of men, one
for each watch, and four men in each set, two of whom were
chained to Peter in the cell, and two were on. guard outside.
   The Greek word "Passover" is wrongly rendered Easter in
the King James Version. The word "Easter" is of Saxon origin.
"Herod purposed putting Peter to death, but as a strict Jew
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

he would not pollute the festival by shedding blood, and there-
fore had Peter imprisoned till after the Passover. There were
four modes of execution lawful among the Jews, stoning, decapi-
tation, burning, and strangling."— Tarbell.
    3. The Lord does not do for us what we can do for ourselves.
The angel freed Peter from the chains which bound him to the
soldiers, but he did not put the garments on him. Peter was
commanded to gird himself, bind on his own sandals, and cast
his garment about him. When they came to the great iron gate
that Peter was powerless to open, the gate opened by divine power.
The angel stayed with Peter until they had gone through "one
street" and were a safe distance from the prison guards, and
when the danger was passed left Peter to go the rest of the way
himself. God expects us to use the power we have; and when we
have reached the limit of our strength He will supply divine
strength.
    Van Lennep, in ''Bible Lands," thus describes an Oriental
city gate to which the prison gate may have been similar: "The
gates are large, massive, and two-leaved, built of heavy timber,
plated with iron. A strong iron bar, hooked at one end, hangs
from a heavy ring of the same metal, made fast in a strong post,
built into the wall behind each fold of the gate. When the gate
is closed, the hooks are set into other iron rings, on the back of
its folds, enabling the gate to resist a very heavy pressure from
without. The lock is massive and of wrought iron, and the long-
handled, ponderous key is carried by the keeper of the gate in
his belt, or hung from a nail in.his little room close by."
    God has opened many doors as firmly fastened as the iron gate
which was opened before Peter. It used to be said that the
zenanas — the women's quarters — in India could never be en-
tered. "God swung the doors ajar in answer to fervent and
faithful prayer and effort." Africa, the "Dark Continent," is
now called "the Continent of Opportunity." We are not crying
now so much for open doors, as for open hearts to take advantage
of opened doors which none can shut.
    4. "Herod knew that he deserved none of this praise and
homage; yet he did not rebuke the idolatry of the people, but
accepted it as his due. The glow of gratified pride was on his
countenance as he heard the shout ascend: It is the voice of a
god, and not of man! The same voices which now glorified a vile
sinner, had, but a few years before, raised the frenzied cry of,
Away with Jesus! Crucify Him, crucify Him! Herod received
this flattery and homage with great pleasure, and his heart bounded
with triumph; but suddenly a swift and terrible change came over
him. His countenance became pallid as death, and distorted with
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     25
agony; great drops of sweat started from his pores. He stood a
moment as if transfixed with pain and terror, then, turning his
blanched and livid face to his horror-stricken friends he cried
in hollow, despairing tones, He whom you have exalted' as a god
is struck with death!
      He was borne in a state of the most excruciating anguish
from the scene of wicked revelry, the mirth, and pomp, and display
of which he now loathed in his soul. A •moment before, he had
been the proud recipient of the praise and worship of that vast
throng — now he felt himself in the hands of a Ruler mightier
than himself. Remorse seized him; he remembered his cruel com-
mand to slay the innocent James; he remembered his relentless
persecution of the followers of Christ, and his design to put to
death the apostle Peter, whom God had delivered out of his hand;
he remembered how, in his mortification and disappointed rage, he
had wreaked his unreasoning revenge upon the keepers of the
prisoner, and executed them without mercy. He felt that God,
who had rescued the apostle from death, was now dealing with
him, the relentless persecutor. He found no relief from pain of
body or anguish of mind, and he expected none. Herod was ac-
quainted with the law of God, which says, `Thou shalt have no
other gods before Me,' and he knew that in accepting the wor-
ship of the people he had filled up the measure of his iniquity, and
 had brought upon him the just wrath of God.
    "The same angel who had left the royal courts of heaven
to rescue Peter from the power of his persecutor, had been the
messenger of wrath and judgment to Herod. The angel smote
 Peter to arouse him from slumber; but it was with a different
stroke that he smote the wicked king, bringing mortal disease
 upon him. God poured contempt upon Herod's pride, and his
 person, which he had exhibited decked in shining apparel before
 the admiring gaze of the people, was eaten by worms, and putri-
 fied while yet alive. Herod died in great agony of mind .and
 body, under the retributive justice of God.
    "This demonstration of divine juclgment had a mighty in-
 fluence upon the people. While the apostle of Christ had been
 miraculously delivered from prison and death, his persecutor
 had been stricken down by the curse of God. The news was borne
 to all lands, and was the means of bringing many to believe on
 Christ."—"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, pages 343-345.

  17. What is said of kindred opposition to the gospel
in the last days? 2 Tim. 3: 1, 8.
                               Notes
    1. "Antioch, the capital of Syria, was very favorably situated
for the new outward movement of Christianity. Moreover, Barna-
bas was a native of Cyprus, the nearest island, and Saul was a
native of Cilicia, the neighboring province. Seleucia was about
sixteen miles down the river Orontes. Cyprus, about eighty miles
southwest of Seleucia, was a triangular island about one hundred
fifty miles long and fifty or sixty miles wide. Salamis was the
chief city on the eastern coast, and Paphos the capital city, sit-
uated on the western coast."-- Sunday School Times.
    2. "We have, in the history of these two apostles, only a
simple record of the laying on of hands, and its bearing upon
their work. Both Paul and Barnabas had already received their
commission from God Himself; and the ceremony of the laying on
of hands added no new grace or virtual qualification. It was
merely setting the seal of the church upon the work of God —
an acknowledged form of designation to an appointed office."—
"Spirit of Prophecy," volume 3, page 349.
    3. "Bar-Jesus, "— that is, "Son of Joshua." "Elymas
[verse 8] is from the Arabic, meaning sorcerer or magician; hence
the probability that he was an Arabian Jew."— Riddle.
    4. The leading explanation of the change from "Saul" to
"Paul," is that he always had both names, as such a custom was
28         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

common especially among Hellenistic Jews, and that his Gentile
(or Roman) name is used from this point, because his mission
to the Gentiles becomes prominent.




     LESSON X.— The Gospel Preached at Antioch, in

   1. Perga, the capital of Pamphylia, was on the river Cestrus,
then navigable, about seven miles from the Mediterranean. It
was northwest of Paphos. Celebrated for its worship of Diana.
    Antioch of Pisidia, a city on the central table-land of Asia
Minor. The journey from Perga to Antioch was a perilous one.
Some commentators think reference is made to it in 2 Cor. 11:26.
It will be remembered that the Antioch from which the journey
was begun was in Syria.
    "Paul and his company now continued their journey, going
into Perga, in Pamphylia. Their way was toilsome, they en-
countered hardships and privations, and were beset by dangers
30           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 on every side, which intimidated Mark, who was unused to hard-
 ships. As still greater difficulties were apprehended, he became dis-
 heartened, and refused to go farther, just at the time when his
 services were most needed. He accordingly returned to Jerusalem,
 and to the peace and comfort of his home. Mark did not apos-
 tatize from the faith of Christianity; but, like many young min-
 isters, he shrank from hardships, and preferred the comfort and
 safety of home to the travels, labors, and dangers of the mis-
 sionary field. This desertion caused Paul to judge him unfa—nr-
 ably and severely for a long time. He distrusted his steadiness
 of character, and his devotion to the cause of Christ."—"Spirit
 of Prophecy," volume 3, page 852.
     2. Synagogues were established in every foreign city where
 Jews were numerous. "After prayers, which were of a pre-
 scribed form, though extempore prayers were often added, a
 lesson from the law was followed by another from the prophets,
 the reader being usually designated by the ruler of the synagogue.
 Then came an address or sermon. Here there was large liberty,
 though the ruler (or rulers) of the synagogue remained in con-
 trol. Any well-known rabbi, and even strangers who had some
 repute as teachers, might be invited to speak (verse 15). This
 liberty was constantly made available by the Christian mission-
aries."— Riddle, in "Sunday School Times."
     "The synagogue was always a plain, rectangular building
 erected on the highest spot in the neighborhood, or having a tall
pole on the roof to make it conspicuous. Unlike the scribes who
 desired to have the chief seat' (Mark 12:38, 39), Paul and
Barnabas entered the synagogue and sat 'down with the congrega-
tion. The chief seats were around the ark or chest at one end
of the building, containing the sacred rolls. Before the ark
hung a veil and lamps. In front was a platform with its reading
desk or pulpit. In the congregation the men were separated from
the women. During the prayers Paul and Barnabas stood with
the rest with their faces toward Jerusalem."— Tarbell.
    3. " The Jews were never tired of hearing their own history.
Whenever a speaker arose in Jewish society determined to carry
a specific point, he came with all the background of Jewish his-
tory, and under the influence of recollections heroic and thrilling,
he endeavored to carry the immediate point of the occasion.
One might have expected that the Jews would have become weary
of hearing their history time after time, but historians record
it to their credit that they were always ready to hear the living
story again."— Joseph Parker.

                              Notes
     1. "When he [Paul] had finished, and the Jews had left the
 synagogue, the Gentiles still lingered, and entreated that the same
 words might be spoken unto them the next Sabbath day. . . .
 When the Jewish priests and rulers saw the multitudes that had
 assembled to hear the new doctrine, they were moved by envy
 and jealousy, and contradicted the words of the apostles with
 blasphemy. Their old bigotry and prejudice were also aroused,
 when they perceived great numbers of Gentiles mingling with the
 Jews in the congregation. They could not endure that the Gentiles
 should enjoy religious privileges on au equality with themselves,
 but clung tenaciously to the idea that the blessing of God was
 reserved exclusively for them. This had ever been the great sin
.of the Jews, which Christ, on several occasions, had rebuked. . . .
 The Gentiles, on the other hand, rejoiced exceedingly that Christ
 recognized them as the children of God, and with grateful hearts
 they listened to the word preached. The apostles now clearly dis-
 cerned their duty, and the work which .God would have them
 do. They turned without hesitation to the Gentiles, preaching
 Christ to them, and leaving the Jews to their bigotry, blindness of
 mind, and hardness of heart. The mind of Paul had been well
 prepared to make this decision, by the circumstances attending his
 conversion, his vision in the temple at Jerusalem, his appointment
 by God to preach to the Gentiles, and the success which had al-
 ready crowned his efforts among them. . . . This gathering in
 of the Gentiles to the church of       had been traced by the pen
 of inspiration, but had been but faintly understood. Hosea had
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     33

said; 'Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the
sand of the sea, which can not be measured nor numbered; and
it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
them, Ye are not My people, there it shall be said unto them,
Ye are the sons of the living God.' And again,        will sow her
unto Me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had
not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not My
people, Thou art My people; and they shall say, Thou art my
God.' "—" Sketches from the Life of Paul," pages 48-51. )
    2. It is worthy of notice that the. Sabbath is mentioned four
times in this chapter. There can be no question but that the
meeting described in this lesson was held on the seventh day,4
as that was the day upon which the Jews met for religious wor-
ship. Luke, writing by inspiration for Christians in this dis-
pensation, calls it the Sabbath. It must therefore be the Sabbath
still. No Bible writer of the New Testament calls it the Jewish
 Sabbath, or calls any other day the Sabbath or the Lord's day.
 Paul calls the day on which the Jews met in the synagogue the
 Sabbath (verse 27), and the Gentiles also called the same day of
 the week the Sabbath (verse 42). James called it the Sabbath.
 See Acts 15:21. The evidence is conclusive that the seventh-day
 Sabbath of the Old Testament is as well the Sabbath of the New
 Testament.
    3. "As many as were ordained to eternal life." Compare
 verse 46 and John 1: 11, 12. "The best rendering would be
 `were disposed to eternal life,' which preserves the exact shade
 of the verb."— Bartlett.




      LESSON X11.— Support of the Gospel Work
                         JUNE 17, 1911

     NOTE.- Along with the study of the beginnings of missionary
 operations in the early church, it is appropriate that we review,
 for one lesson, the Lord's plan for the support of His work on
 earth. The early church was familiar with the system of tithes
 and offerings for the maintenance of the temple and its services.
 "Do ye not know," said Paul, "that they which minister about
 holy things live of the things of the temple'? and they which wait
 at the altar are partakers with the altar'? Even so hath the Lord
 ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the
 gospel." 1 Cor. 9: 13, 14.

    3. When the Father described the priesthood of
Christ, the promised Seed, after what order was it
called? Heb. 7: 17-20.
    4. If the Melchisedec priesthood received tithe, as
in the case of Abraham returning with the spoil after
rescuing Lot, and Christ is made priest after this order,
what may we conclude regarding the obligation to pay
tithe during Christ's priesthood?
           DURING THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD

    5. What shows that Jacob, Abraham's grandson, un-
derstood perfectly his obligation to God regarding the
payment of tithe? Gen. 28 : 20-22. Note 2.
    6. About twenty years later, when he came back to
his old home in safety, what substantial evidence could
Jacob (now Israel) present of the Lord's prospering
care over him? Gen. 32 : 13-18; 33: 8-11. (See margin,
verse 11.)
    7. What commandment did God give to the children
of Israel concerning the tithe? Lev. 27 : 30-34.
    8. On one occasion what were the Levites compelled
to do, when through selfishness the other tribes of Israel
withheld the tithe? Neh. 13: 10.
    9, Uow was this condition corrected,? Verses 117 12.

  13. In the payment of tithes, under both the Mel-
chisedec and Levitical orders. of priesthood, what lesson
is taught? Note 3.
  14. As He taught upon one occasion, what statement
did Jesus make regarding faithful tithe-paying? Luke
11 : 42.
  15. What must prompt the payment of tithe that this
service may be acceptable in the sight of God? Note 4.
  16. Why does the Lord ask that all the tithe be
brought in? To him who is faithful in these things,
what precious promise is made? Mal. 3: 10.. Note 5.
            SCRIPTURES FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY
   Luke 12: 29-36; Acts 4: 33-37; 1 Cor. 16: 2; Ps.
145 : 15-17 (see margin,,Verse 17) ; 2 Cor. 9: 11, 12.
                             Notes .
    1. Abraham paid tithe to Melchisedec after God had made
him the father of them that believe. The lesson is obvious that
those who by faith follow in the footsteps of Abraham, and by
faith accept the promised Seed as the Son of God, in whom is
life, acknowledge also the Lord's ownership of the tithe.
    2. " 'Of all that Thou shalt give me,' said Jacob, 'I will
surely give the tenth unto Thee.' Shall we who enjoy the full
light and privileges of the gospel, be content to give less to
God than was given by those who lived in the former, less favored
dispensation'? Nay, as the blessings we enjoy are greater, are
not our obligations correspondingly increased? But how small
36           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the estimate; how vain the endeavor to measure with mathematical
rules, time, money, and love, against a love so immeasurable and
a gift of such inconceivable worth. Tithes for Christ! 0, meager
pittance, shameful recompense for that which cost so much!
From the cross of Calvary, Christ calls for an unreserved conse-
cration. All that we have, all that we are, shOuld be devoted to
God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 188.
     3. The priesthood after the order of MelLisedec, king of
 Salem, is that royal order after which Christ is now our great
 High Priest. -Under this order tithe-paying is a part of the serv-
 ice of the worshiper. So, too, it was under the Levitical order.
 Thus, from the call of Abraham, which was the preaching of the
 gospel to him as father of the faithful, on to the end we find
 tithe-paying a part of the Scripture record. By the Scriptures
 studied, it is shown that all along the obligation, or rather the
 privilege, of returning a tenth to the Lord, is clearly made known.
 Besides this, free-will offerings were to be given. It is made very
 evident that the acceptance by any person of the privileges of the
 gospel, lays him under certain obligations, among which is that
 of paying a tithe of all his increase into the treasury for the
 support of God's work. in the earth. This portion is reserved by
 God; it "is the Lord's," ever consecrated "holy unto the Lord."
     4. It should ever be borne in mind that compliance with any of
 these sacred duties, such as tithe-paying, or baptism, or even
Sabbath-keeping, in itself can not commend us to God. These
 things are the fruits of living faith. And the same faith will
bring forth the fruits of mercy, judgment, and love for God and
man. The rebuke of Christ addressed to the Pharisees applies to
any to-day who, like them, pass over the weightier principles of
the law, even though they may be very scrupulous in outward form.
",These ought ye to have done, and riot to leave the other undone."
     5. " The magnitude of our work calls for willing liberality
on the part of the people of God. In Africa, in China, in India,
there are thousands, yes, millions, who have not heard the message
of the truth for this time. They must be warned. The islands
of the sea are waiting for a knowledge of God. . . . The Lord
has made us His stewards. He has placed His means in our hands
for faithful distribution. He asks us to render to Him His own.
He has reserved the tithe as His sacred portion, to be used in send-
ing the gospel to all parts of the world. My brethren and sisters,
confess and forsake your selfishness, and bring to the Lord your
gifts and offerings. Bring Him also the tithe that you have with-
held. Come confessing your neglect. Prove the Lord, as He has
invited you to do."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 9,
pages 51, 52.
