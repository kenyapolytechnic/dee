         Sabbath-School Lessons on the

 BOOK OF ACTS
             For the Fourth Quarter, 1911 •
   INTRODUCTORY Nam.— In this quarter's lessons are narrated
the arrest of Paul at Jerusalem, the various scenes of his trial,
his appeal to Caesar, and his, journey to Rome. Nearly one
quarter of the book of Acts is devote'd• by Luke to these events.
Paul's undaunted courage and sacrifice for Christ, and his noble
defense made on different occasions before his pefsecutors, are
sublime, and should stir our hearts to renewed zeal and consecra-
tion, and deepen our determination to maintain greater faithful-
ness in the work of God committed to our hands.

                            Notes
   1. Coos was a small island in the Grecian Archipelago about
forty miles south of Miletus. It was celebrated for its manu-
factories of silk, ointments, wines, etc. Rhodes was also an
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      5

island in the Grecian Archipelago. On the island was a city of
the same name, which was _principally distinguished for its brazen
Colossus one hundred feet high. The Colossus stood astride the
mouth of the harbor, and was so high that vessels could pass
beneath. It stood for fifty-six years, and had been destroyed by
an earthquake 244 B.c., long before Paul's visit. It was reckoned
as one of the seven wonders of the world.
    2. "The Holy Spirit had revealed to these brethren something
of the dangers which awaited Paul at Jerusalem, and they en-
deavored to dissuade him from his purpose. But the same Spirit
which had warned him of afflictions, bonds, and imprisonment,
still urged him forward, a willing captive."—"Sketches from the
Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 203.
    Tyre was about three hundred and fifty miles from Patara.
It was one of the gr&Itest and most famous cities of the ancient
world. Hiram, king of Tyre, aided Solomon in building the
temple, B.C. 1000. 1 Kings 9.
    3. "Philip the evangelist was bound to Paul by ties of the
deepest 'sympathy. A man of clear discernm'ent and sterling in-
tegrity, Philip had been the first to break away from the bondage
of Jewish prejudice, and thus had helped prepare the way for the
apostle's work. It was Philip who preached the gospel to the Sa-
maritans: it was Philip who had the courage to baptize the Ethio-
pian eunuch.''— Id., page 204.
    4. It was common for the prophets to perform actions em-
blematic of the events they predicted. The design was to make
the prediction more forcible and impressive by representing it to
the eye. Thus Jeremiah was directed to him, his girdle by the
Euphrates, to denote the approaching captivity of the Jews. Jer.
13:4. He was directed to make bands and yokes, and to put them
around his neck, as a sign to Edom and Moab. Jer. 27:2, 3.
    5. "The apostle was deeply moved by the entreaties of. his
beloved brethren. To human judgment he had sufficient reason
to relinquish his plan as unwise. But he felt that he was moving
 in obedience to the will of God, and he could not be deterred
by the voice of friends, or even the warning of the prophet. He
 would not swerve from the path of duty to the right hand nor
 to the left. He must follow Christ, if need be, to prison and to
 death. His tears fell not for himself, but in sympathy with his
 brethren, upon whom his determination had brought so great
sorrow."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White,
page 205.
   6. "This was Paul's last visit to Jerusalem. The school of
Gamaliel, the synagogue of the Libertines, the house where the
high priest had given him his commission to Damascus, the spot
6          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

where the reddened grass had drunk the blood of Stephen, must
have stirred painful memories. But never had he trod the street
of the holy city with so deep a sadness as now that he entered it,
avoiding notice as much as possible, in the little caravan of
Csarean pilgrims and Gentile converts. He was going to a city
where friends were few, and where well-nigh every one of the
myriads among whom he moved was an actual or potential
enemy."— F. IV. Farrar, quoted in "Tarbell's Teachers' Guide,"
1909, page 328.

8            SABBATH-SCHOOL: LESSON QUARTERLY.

                                 Notes
     1. "On the day following Paul's arrival, the elders of the
 church,, with James at their head, assembled to receive him and
 his fellow travelers as messengers from the Gentile churches.
 Paul's first act was to present the contributions with which he had
 been entrusted. He had been careful to guard against the least
 occasion for suspicion in the administration of his trust by causing
 delegates to be elected by the several churches to accompany him
 as joint trustees of the funds collected. These brethren were now
 called forward, and one by one they laid at the feet of James the
 offering which the Gentile churches had freely given, although
 often from their deepest poverty."—" Sketches from the Life of
 Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 208, 209.
     2. The elders warned Paul that there were some in the church
who were still striving to maintain the old ceremonies and customs
which had passed away. " The elders of the church had been at
fault in allowing themselves to be influenced by the enemies of
the apostle. But when they heard from his own lips an account
of the work he had been doing, it assumed a different aspect.
 They could not condemn his manner of labor: they were convinced
that it bore the signet of • heaven. The liberal contributions from
the new churches he had raised up testified to the power of the
 truth. They saw that they had been held in bondage by the
Jewish customs and traditions, and that the work of the gospel
had been greatly hindered by their efforts to maintain the middle
wall of partition between Jew and Gentile."— Id., page 211.
    3. "But while James assured Paul that the decision of the
former council (Acts 15) concerning the Gentile converts and the
ceremonial law still held good, the advice given was not con-
sistent with that decision, which had also been sanctioned by the
Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God did not prompt this advice. It
was the fruit of cowardice."
    "His advisers were not infallible. Though some of these men
wrote under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, yet when not
under its direct influence they sometimes erred. 'It will be re-
membered that on one occasion Paul withstood Peter to the face
because he was acting a double part."— Id., pages 212, 214.
    4. "It was customary among the Jews, for those who had re-
ceived deliverance from any great peril or who from other causes
desired publicly to testify their dedication to God, to take upon
themselves the vow of a Nazarite, the regulations of which are
prescribed in the sixth chapter of the book of Numbers. In that
book no rule is laid down as to the time during which this life
of ascetic rigor was to continue, but we learn from the Talmud .
and Josephus that thirty days was at least a customary period.
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      9

 During this time the Nazarite -was bound to abstain from wine and
 to suffer his hair to grow uncut. At the termination of the period
 he was bound to present himself in the temple with certain offer-
 ings, and his hair was then cut off and burnt upon the altar. The
 offerings required were beyond the means of the very poor, and
 consequently it was thought an act of piety for- a rich man to pay
 the necessary expenses- and thus enable his poorer countrymen to
 complete their vow."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul,"
 Conybeare and Howson, page 545.
     5. "The celebration of the festival had attracted multitudes
 to the holy city, and the temple was thronged with worshipers
 from every land; and amongst these were some of those Asiatic
 Jews who had been defeated by his arguments in the synagogue
 of Ephesus, and irritated against him during the last few years
 daily more and more by the continual growth of a Christian
 church in that city, formed in great part of converts from among
 the Jewish proselytes. These men, whom a zealous feeling of na-
 tionality had attracted from their- distant home to the metropolis
 of their faith, now beheld, where they least expected to find him,
 the apostate Israelite who had opposed their teaching and seduced
 their converts. An opportunity of revenge which they could not
 have hoped for in the Gentile city where they dwelt had suddenly
 presented itself."— Id., page 546.
      6. " This cohort of soldiers formed the garrison of Castle
  Antonia, at the northwest corner of the temple area, so built as
  to overlook the temple and its courts. The castle was named after
  Mark Anthony. This fortress communicated with the temple
 cloisters by means of two flights of steps."—"Peloubet's Notes,"
1909, page 288.
      7. "The 'Egyptian' whom the chief captain took Paul to be,
  is mentioned by J osephus. A short time before this he had gath-
  ered a large body of discontented Jews on Mount Olivet, whom
  he had deluded into the belief that he was the Messiah, declar-
  ing that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down at his word.
  Felix marched out against the insurgents and dispersed them,
  but the Egyptian escaped."— Id., page 289.

                                 Notes
     1. "Had he [Paul] spoken in Greek, the majority of those
 who heard him would have understood his words. But the sound
 of the holy tongue in that holy place fell like a calm on the
 troubled waters. The silence became universal and breathless. "
  —"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and
 Howson, page 555.                           •
     2. "But when his mission to the Gentiles was announced —
 though the words quoted were the words of Jehovah spoken in
  the temple itself, even as the Lord had once spoken to Samuel —
  one outburst of frantic indignation rose from the temple area
 and silenced the speaker on the stairs. Their national pride bore
- clown every argument which could influence their reason or their
  reverence. They could not bear the thought of uncircumcised
  heathens being made equal to the sons of Abraham. They cried
  out that such a wretch ought not to pollute the earth with his
  presence — that it was a shame to have preserved his .life; and
  in their rage and impatience they tossed off their outer garments
   (as on that other occasion when the garments were laid at the
  feet of Saul himself), and threw up dust into the air with frantic
  violence. "—Id., pages 556, 557.

                             Notes
    1. "This commotion threw Lysias into new perplexity. He
had not been able to understand the apostle's Hebrew speech,
and when he saw its results he concluded that his prisoner must
be guilty of some enormous crime. He ordered him therefore to
be taken immediately from the stairs into the barracks, and to be
examined by torture in Order to elicit a confession of his guilt."
—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and
Howson, page 557.
    2. "Tarsus had received great benefits both from Julius Cnsar
and Augustus, but the father of Paul was not on that account
a Roman citizen. This privilege had been granted to him or had
descended to him as an individual right; he might have purchased
it for a 'large sum' of nToney; but it is more probable that it
came to him as the reward of services rendered during the civil
wars to some influential Roman. . . . The family of Paul were
in the same position at Tarsus as those who were Jews of Asia
Minor and yet citizens of Rome at Ephesus; and thus it came
to pass that while many of his contemporaries were willing to
expend a 'large sum' in the purchase of 'this freedom,' the
apostle himself was 'free-born."'— Id., page 52.
    3. "The apostle's bearing was calm and firm. The peace
of Christ, ruling in his heart, was expressed upon his countenance.
But his look of conscious innocence offended his accusers, and
when he fearlessly addressed them, 'Men and brethren, I have
 lived in all good conscience before God until this day,' their
 hatred was kindled afresh, and the high priest ordered him to
14         SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

be smitten upon. the mouth."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul,"
Mrs. E. G. White, pages 221, 222.
    4. "These words were not an outburst of passion. Under
the influence of the Holy Spirit, Paul uttered a prophetic de-
nunciation similar to that which Christ had uttered in rebuking
the hypocrisy of the Jews."— Id., page 222.
   5. "This exclamation produced an instantaneous effect on the
assembly. It was the watchword which marshaled the opposing
forces in antagonism to each ether. The Pharisees felt a momen- •
tary hope that they might use their ancient partisan as a new
weapon against their rivals."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle
Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 559. •

                             Notes
    1. "When Peter had been made a prisoner and condemned to
death, the brethren had offered earnest prayer to God day and
night for his deliverance. But no such interest was manifested
in behalf of him who was looked upon as an apostate from Moses,
a teacher of dangerous doctrines. It was not to the elders whose
counsel had brought him into this dangerous position, but to the
watchful sympathy of a relative, that Paul owed his escape from
a violent death."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G.
White, page 226.
   " This mention of Paul's relative is one of those touches
which make the whole world kin. From this we may infer that
some, at least, of PaUl's family were reconciled to him, and per-
haps that they occupied an influential position, within reach of
information about the secret policy of the high priest."—"Acts
of the Apostles," Rackharn, page 438.
   .2. "Lysias gladly improved this opportunity to get Paul off
his hands. He was the object of so great animosity, and his
presence created so wide-spread an excitement, that a riot might
occur among the people at any time, with consequences dangerous
to the commandant himself. The Jews as a people were in a
state of excitement and irritation, and tumults were of frequent
occurrence. A short time previous, a Roman knight of far higher
rank than Lysias himself, had been violently taken and dragged
by the maddened Jews around the walls of Jerusalem, and finally
beheaded, because he received a bribe from the Samaritans. Upon
the suspicion of similar crimes, other high officials had been im-
prisoned and disgraced. Should Paul be murdered, the chief
captain might be charged with having been bribed to connive
at his death. There was now sufficient reason to send him away
secretly, and thus get rid of an embarrassing responsibility."—
"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 227:--z
    3. "The escort and their prisoner marched all night to Antip-
atris, a distance of about thirty-five miles. At Antipatris they
halted
    ; and, the immediate danger being passed, the foot soldiers
returned thence to Jerusalem, leaving the horsemen to conduct
Paul the remaining twenty-seVen miles to Cmsarea, where they
probably arrived on the following day. So within a fortnight
Paul was back at Caesarea, and the apprehensions of the disciples
there were fulfilled."—" Acts'of the Apostles," Rackham, page
440.
   4. "After ascertaining the necessary information, Felix de-
termined to hear the case when the accusers should arrive. Mean-
while Paul was to be confined in free custody in Herod's palace,
now the residence of the Roman governor, and therefore called
by the Romans the pretorium."— Id.

    18. What order did he issue concerning Paul?
What favors did he grant him? Verse 23.
                             Notes
    1. Nothing is known of Tertullus except the mention here..
 "The description of Tertullus here as an orator indicates that
.4re was a paid advocate."— Abbott.
    2. " Tertullus here descended to bare-faced falsehood. The
 character of Felix was base and contemptible. It was said that
 he 'practised all kinds of lust and cruelty with the power of a '
 king and the temper of a slave.' . . . His acts of cruelty and
 oppression caused him to be universally hated."—"Sketches from
the Life of Pdul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 235.
    3. "This reference to Lysias may have been a device for
turning away the Jews, an excuse for the temporary dismissal
of the case, and need not imply that Felix was in doubt regarding
Paul's innocence and was waiting for further light. There is no
record that Lysias ever came down to Caesarea, or that Felix
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    19

made any effort to have him come. It is not probable that the
Jews waited long in CNsarea on such an uncertainty. They re-
turned to Jerusalem with the small satisfaction that if Paul was
still alive, he at least was not preaching and destroying the in-
fluence of Moses. They seem to have attempted nothing further
for two years."—"Student's Life of Paul," Gilbert, page 193.

                              Notes
  1. "Felix, who had never before listened to the truth, was
deeply agitated as the Spirit of God sent conviction to his soul.
Conscience, now aroused, made her voice heard. He felt that
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   21

Paul's words were true. Memory went back over the guilty past.
With terrible distinctness came up before him the secrets of his
early life of lust and bloodshed, and the black record of his
later years,— licentious, cruel, rapacious, unjust, steeped with
the blood of private murders and public massacres. Never before
had the truth been thus brought home to his heart. Never before
had his soul been thus filled with terror. The thought that all
the secrets of his career of crime were open before the eye of
God, and that he must be judged according to his deeds, caused
him to tremble with guilty dread. "—"Sketches from the Life of
Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 143.
    2. "No change seems to have taken place in the outward cir-
cumstances of the apostle when Festus came to take command
of the province. He was still in confinement as before. But
immediately on the accession of the new governor the unsleep-
ing hatred of the Jews made a fresh attempt upon his life, and
the course of their proceedings presently changed the whole as-
pect of his case and led to unexpected results. "—"Life and
 Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 578.
    3. " Festus was probably surprised by this termination of the
 proceedings, but no choice was open to him. Paul had urged his
 prerogative as a Roman citizen. to be tried not by the Jewish
 but by the Roman law — a claim which, indeed, was already
 admitted by the words of Festus, who only proposed to transfer
 him to the jurisdiction of the Sanhedrin with his own consent.
 He ended by availing himself of one of the most important priv-
 ileges of Roman citizenship, the right of appeal. By the mere
 pronunciation of those potent words, I appeal unto Cmsar, ' he
 instantly removed his cause from the jurisdiction of the magis-
 trate before -Whom he stood, and transferred it to the supreme
 tribunal .of the emperor at Rome. "— Id., pages 579, 580.
     4. "King Herod Agrippa made a visit of congratulation to
 Governor Festus. With him came the beutiful and fascinating
 Bernice, who was both his sister and his illegal wife. She was
 also sister of Drusilla the wife of Felix, and as dissolute. "—
 "Peloubet's Notes," 1909.

   PERSONS: Paul; Agrippa and Bernice; Festus; chief captains
and principal men of Caesarea.
    GENERAL NOTE .— In this lesson we begin a study of the
twenty-sixth chapter of Acts. This chapter "is one of the
twenty-six chapters of the Bible which Ruskin's mother had him
commit to memory, whereby, as Ruskin says, she established his
soul in righteousness. It is well worth being learned by heart,
for it contains the finest address in the Acts, the best account we
have of the great apostle's relation to his mission, and in its
dignity, sincerity, skill, and persuasiveness it proves the power
of the gospel to 'turn from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan unto God.' It is called Paul's apologia pro vita
sua, his defense of his life, but the apostle is not pleading in
fear for his life; he shows, indeed, that he has done nothing
worthy of death, but he does so in defending Christianity as be-
ing, not contrary to earlier divine revelation, but a fulfilment of
that revelation, a culmination of all past promises."—" Tar-
bell's Teachers' Guide," 1909.

Verses 24, 25.
    3. What did Festus, therefore, wish to gain by the

26, 27.
    4. What permission was given Paul? By whom?
Whom did Paul address? How did Paul regard this
privilege? Why? Acts 26: 1-3. Note 2.
    5. At what point did Paul begin his narrative?
What did he say concerning his manner of life from
his youth up? By whom could this be proved? For
what did he say he was now judged? Verses 4-6.
    6. What did he say was the relation of the twelve
          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY            23

tribes to this promise? By whom, however, was he
accused on account of that same hope? Verse 7.

    10. How vigorously did he carry on persecution?
How did he feel toward them '? How did he show his
enmity? Verse 11.
    11. What further shows that it was not because
 he had been prejudiced in favor of Christianity that
 he accepted it? Verse 12.
    12. What details does•the apostle again relate of his
 experience on the way to Damascus? Verses 13-15.
 How many times has the story of Paul's conversion
 been told?
    13. From this narrative what do we learn was the
 work for which the Lord chose Paul? Verse 16.
    14. What did Jesus say i He would do for Paul?
 To whom had he been sent? For what purpose?
 What was he to, bring to the Gentiles? Verses 17, 18.

 heaven? Verse 19.
    16. In what successive fields did he say he had
 labored? What did he instruct all to do? Verse 20.
    17. For what cause had the Jews sought to kill
 him? By what means had he been able to continue
 preaching so long? To what class of people had he
24          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY


testified'? To what had he confined his testimony?
Verses 21, 22.
   18. What had Moses and the prophets said should
come? What had they said Christ would do through
the resurrection from the dead? Verse 23.
                                 Notes
     1. "In all the pomp and splendor of royalty, Agrippa and
 Bernice went to the audience-room, attended by a train of fol-
 lowers in the costly apparel of Eastern display. Proudly the
 haughty ruler with his beautiful sister swept through the as-
sembly, and seated himself by the procurator 's side. At his com-
 mand, Paul, still manacled as a prisoner, was led in, and the king
 gazed with cold curiosity upon him, now bowed and pale from
sickness, long imprisonment, and continual anxiety.
     "What a contrast was there presented! Agrippa and Bernice •
 were destitute of the traits of character' which God esteems. They
were transgressors of His law, corrupt in heart and in life. God
and angels abhorred their course of sin. But because they pos-
sessed, in a limited degree, power and position, they were the
favorites of the world. That aged prisoner, standing chained to
his soldier guard, presented nothing imposing or attractive in his
dress or appearance, that the world should pay him homage.
Yet this man, apparently without friends or wealth or position,
had an escort that worldlings could not see. Angels of heaven
were his attendants. Had the glory of one of those shining mes-
sengers flashed forth, the pomp and pride of royalty would have
paled before it; king and courtiers would have been stricken
to the earth, as were the Roman guards at the sepulcher of
Christ."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White,
pages 253, 254.
    2. "Herod Agrippa II, ruler of some principalities in north-
ern Palestine, with the title of king; son of Herod Agrippa I,
who slew James the son of Zebedee; great-nephew of Herod
A ntipas, who beheaded John the Baptist; great-grandson of
Herod the Great, who massacred the innocents in his attempts
to kill the infant Jesus. He was made supervisor of the temple
at Jerusalem, and had the privilege of appointing its high priest.
When the last Jewish war broke out with the Romans, he re-
ceived into his territory and protected those who fled before the
siege of Titus began."—"Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," 1909,
page 272.
    "Stretching forth his manacled right hand, he [Paul] said :
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     25

 I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answer for
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I
am accused of the Jews. Especially because I know thee to be
expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews;
wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.'
    "Did the mind of Agrippa at these words revert to the past
history of his family, and their fruitless efforts against Him
whom Paul was preaching? Did he think of his great-grand-
father Herod, and the massacre of the innocent children of Beth-
lehem? of his great-uncle Antipas, and the murder of John the
Baptist? of his own father, Agrippa I, and the martyrdom of
the apostle James? Did he see in the disasters which speedily
befell these kings an evidence of the displeasure of God in con-
sequence of their crimes against His servants? Did the pomp and
display of that day remind Agrippa of the time when his own
father, a monarch more powerful than he, stood in that same
city, attired in glittering robes, while the people shouted that he
was a god? Had he forgotten how, even before the admiring
shouts had died away, vengeance, swift and terrible, had befallen
the vainglorious king? Something of all this flitted across
Agrippa's memory; but his vanity was flattered by the brilliant
scene before him, and pride and self-importance banished- all
nobler thoughts."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E.
G. White, pages 255, 256.

                             Notes
   1. "The Jewish king had been instructed in the law and the
prophet; and he had learned from credible witnesses some of the
facts of which Paul had spoken. Hence, the arguments which
were so new and strange to Festus, were clear and convincing
to Agrippa. And he could but be affected by the burning zeal
which neither stripes nor imprisonment could quench. For a
time he forgot the dignity of his position, lost sight of his sur-
roundings, and, conscious only of the truths which he had heard,
seeing only the humble prisoner standing as God's ambassador,
he answered 'involuntarily, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.'
   ''With solemn earnestness, the apostle made answer:      would
to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day,
were both almost and altogether such as I am,' adding, as he
28           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 raised his fettered hands, ' except these bonds.' All who heard
 him were convinced that Paul was no common prisoner. One
 who could speak as he had spoken, and present the arguments
 that he had presented, who was so filled with the exaltation of an
inspiring faith, so enriched by the grace of Christ, so calm in
 the consciousness of peace with God and man; one who could
 wish that all those princely and distinguished people might have
 the same hope and confidence and faith that sustained him, but
 who, without the least desire for revenge, could pray that they
might be spared the conflicts, sorrows, and afflictions which he had
experienced,— such a man could not be an impostor."—"Sketches
 from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 259, 260.
    2. " Thus, however grudgingly conceded, the whole process of
two years and more, at Jerusalem and Cnsarea, ended in a public
and decisive acquittal of St. Paul. Claudius Lysias, Festus, and
Agrippa, had each declared him innocent; three times was it
publicly announced of the apostle, as of the Lord, that he had
done nothing worthy of death."—"Acts of the Apostles," Rack-
ham, page 474.
    3. " When St. Paul was despatched to the judgment-seat of
Cmsar from the port of Cmsarea, he had arrived at the middle
of his long captivity. Broadly speaking he was five years a pris-
oner from the day of his arrest at Jerusalem till his release by
the decision of Nero. He was a prisoner for more than two years
when Festus sent him to Rome, and then at Rome he spent two more
years in captivity, while his voyage occupied fully six months.
Let us now first of all look at that captivity, and strive to dis-
cover those purposes of good therein. which God hides amidst all
His dispensations and chastisements:
    "We do not always realize what a length of time was con-
sumed in the imprisonments of St. Paul. He must have spent
from the middle of 58 to the beginning of 63 as a prisoner, cut
off from many of those various activities in which he had pre-
viously labored so • profitably for God's cause. That must have
seemed to himself and to many others a terrible loss to the gos-
pel; and yet now, as we look back from our vantage-point, we
can see many reasons why the guidance of his heavenly Father
may have led directly to this imprisonment, which proved ex-
ceedingly useful for himself and his own soul's health, for the
past guidance and for the perpetual edification of the church
of Christ."—"Expositor's Bible" (Acts), G. T. Stokes, volume
2, pages 450, 451.
    4. " The season of Safe navigation was already far advanced,
before the apostle 's ship left Caesarea, and the time was fast
approaching when travel by sea would be closed for the year.
           SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     29

Every day's delay increased the peril of the voyage. But the
journey which would be difficult and dangerous to the ordinary
traveler, would be doubly trying to the apostle as a prisoner.
Roman soldiers were held responsible with their own lives for
the security of their prisoners, and this had led to the custom of
chaining prisoners by the right wrist to the left wrist of soldiers,
who relieved each other in turn. Thus not only could the apostle
have no movement free, but he was placed in close and con-
stant connection with men of the most uncongenial and abso-
 lutely repulsive character; men who were not only uneducated
 and unrefined, but who, from the demoralizing influence of their
surroundings, had become brutal and degraded. This custom, how-
 ever, was less rigidly observed on shipboard than when the pris-
 oners were ashore. One circumstance greatly lightened the hard-
 ships of his lot. He was permitted to enjoy the companionship
  of his brethren, Luke and Aristarchus. In his letter to the Co-
  lossians, he speaks of the latter as his fellow prisoner.' But
  it was as an act of choice, because of his affection for Paul, that
  Aristarchus shared his bondage, and ministered to him in his
  affliction."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G.
  White, page 262.
       5. "The Greeks and Romans were ignorant of the use of the
  compass; the instruments with which they took observations must
   have been rude compared with our modern quadrants and sex-
   tants; and we have no reason to believe that their vessels Were
   provided with nautical charts; and thus, when 'neither sun nor
   stars appeared,' and the sky gave indications of danger, they _
   hesitated to try the open sea."—"Life and Epistles of the Apos-
   tle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 586.
        6. " The centurion decided to follow the judgment of the
   majority. Accordingly, 'when the south wind blew softly,' they
   set sail from Fair Havens, with the flattering prospect that a
    few hours would bring them to the desired harbor. All were now
    rejoicing that they had not followed the advice of Paul: but their
    hopes were destined to be speedily disappointed. They had not
    proceeded far, when a tempestuous wind, such as in that latitude
    often succeeds the blowing of the south wind, burst upon them
    with merciless fury. From the first moment that the wind struck
    the vessel, its condition was hopeless. So sudden was the blow,
     that the sailors had not a moment in which to prepare, and they
     could only leave the ship to the mercy of the tempest"—
    "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 264.
         7. " The third day,' says Luke, 'we cast out with our own
     hands the tackling of the ship. And when neither sun nor stars
     in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope
30          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

that we should be saved was then taken away.' A gloomy apathy
settled upon those three hundred souls, as for fourteen days they
drifted, helpless and hopeless, under a sunless and starless heaven.
They had no means of cooking; no fire could be lighted, the
utensils had been washed overboard, and most of the provisions
were water-soaked and spoiled. In fact while their good ship
was wrestling with the tempest, and the waves talked with death,
no one desired food."— Id., pages 265, 266.
    8. "In the midst of that terrible scene, the apostle retained
his calmness and courage. Notwithstanding he was physically the
greatest sufferer of them all, he had words of hope for the dark-
est hour, a helping hand in every emergency. In this time of
trial, he grasped by faith the arm of infinite power, his heart
was stayed upon God, and amid the surrounding gloom his cour-
age and nobility of soul shone forth with the brightest luster.
While all around were looking only for swift destruction, this
man of God, in the serenity of a blameless conscience, was pour-
ing forth his earnest supplication in their behalf.
    "Paul had no fears for himself; he felt assured that he would
not be swallowed up by the hungry waters. God would preserve
his life, that he might witness for the truth at Rome. But his
human heart yearned with pity for the poor souls around him.
Sinful and degraded as they were, they were unprepared to die,
and he earnestly pleaded with God to spare their lives. It was
revealed to him that his prayer was granted."— hl., page 266.

    1. "It was the fourteenth night that they had been tossed up
and down on the black, heaving billows, when, amid the sound of
the storm, the sailors distinguished the roar of breakers, and re-
ported that they were near some land. They 'sounded, and found
it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they
sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.' They were now
threatened by a new danger, of having their ship driven upon
some rock-bound coast. They immediately cast out four anchors,
which was the only thing that could be done. All through the
remaining hours of that night they waited, knowing that any
moment might be their last. The leak was constantly increasing,
and the ship might sink at any time, even if the anchors held."
—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 267.
    2. "A slight effort of imagination suffices to bring before
us an impressive spectacle as we think of the dim light just show-
ing the haggard faces of the two hundred and seventy-six per-
sons clustered on the deck and holding on by the bulwarks of the
sinking vessel. in this hour of anxiety the apostle stands for-
ward to give them courage. He reminds them that they had
`eaten nothing' for fourteen days, and exhorts them now to par-
take of a hearty meal, pointing out to them that this was indeed
essential to their safety, and encouraging them by the assurance
that 'not a hair of their head' should perish. So speaking, he
set the example of the cheerful use of God's gifts and grateful
acknowledgment of the Giver by taking bread, 'giving thanks to
God before all,' and beginning to eat. Thus encouraged by his
calm and religious example, they felt their spirits revive, and
'they also partook of food,' and made themselves ready for the
labor which awaited them."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle
Paul," Conybeare and Howson, page 610.
    3. "Whether one is ready for the hour of opportunity or
emergency depends on the whole previous life, and the real test-
ing time is not the critical moment itself, but all the appar-
ently unimportant moments which precede it. The hour reveals,
but does not make, the man. David was able to save the armies
of Israel because he had learned to use his sling in his shepherd
life. It was General Charles James Napier who said, 'The smith
who has to look for his hammer when the iron is red strikes when
it is too late; the hammer should be uplifted to fall like a
thunderbolt while the white heat is in the metal.'
    "The greatness of Paul as a man and as a leader is shown on
this voyage to Rome. His brave endurance of hardship, his pres-
ence of mind in time of danger, his tireless activity, his unselfish-
ness, his practical wisdoin, his sympathy for others, his good cheer,
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     33

 and above all, his perfect trust in God, are brought out by the
 exciting scenes of peril. But all these qualities have been shown
 again and again in the record of his life given in the Acts, and
 in his own self-revelation in his letters. He was the foremost
 man on that ship, because he had lived the noblest life and had
 attained to the greatest character.' '—"Tarbell's Teachers'
 Guide," 1909.
      4. "Julius the centurion knew that Paul had been instrumental
 in saving the lives of all on board, and he felt that it would be
 the basest ingratitude to allow him to be put to death; and more,
 he felt convinced that the Lord was with Paul, and he feared to
 do him harm. He therefore gave orders to spare the lives of the
 prisoners, and directed that all who could swim should cast them-
 selves into the sea and get to land. The rest seized hold of planks
 and other fragments of the wreck, and were carried landward by
 the waves."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G.
 White, page 270.
      5. Melita is the island that is now called Malta, in the Medi-
 terranean Sea, one hundred fifty miles southwest of the most
 southern point of Italy. "Malta is seventeen miles long by nine
 miles wide at its greatest breadth. Its area is ninety-five square
  miles. One of the greatest sieges of history took place here in
1565. Since 1800 it has belonged to the English."—"Peloubet's
  Notes," 1909.
      6. "The whole scene is brought very vividly before us in the
 sacred narrative. One incident has become a picture in Paul's
  life with which every Christian child is familiar. The apostle
  had gathered with his own hands a heap of sticks and placed
  them on the fire, when a viper came out of the heat' and fastened
  on his hand. The poor superstitious people when they saw this
  said to one another, This man must be a murderer: he has es-
  caped from the sea, but still vengeance suffers him not to live.'
  But Paul threw off the animal into the fire and suffered no harm.
  Then they watched him, expecting that his body would become
  swollen or that he would suddenly fall down dead. At length,
. after they had watched for o long time in vain and saw nothing
  happen to him, their feelings changed as violently as those of the
  Lystrians had done in an opposite direction, and they said that
  he was a god. We are not told of the result    s to which this oc-
  currence led, but we can not doubt that while Paul repudiated,
  as formerly at Lystra, all the homage which idolatry would pay
  him, he would make use of the influence acquired by this miracle
  for making the Saviour 'known to his uncivilized benefactors."

  son, pages 613, 614.

                                Notes
    1. "In Puteoli, the principal port of southern Italy, where out.
of the first temples for the worship of Augustus was erected,
Paul and his companions were refreshed by the presence ofi. Chris-
tian brethren, at whose solicitation they remained a week. Evi-
dently Julius had respect for the wishes of his prisoner, .and
indeed after the experiences of the past winter he may well have
felt that, excepting in the political sense, he was dependent upon
Paul rather than Paul upon him. In any case he was willing
to grant him special favors, as is proven by the visit in Puteoli."
—"Student's Life of Paul," Gilbert, pages 210, 211.
     2. "Forty-three miles from Rome was the Market of Appius,
and ten miles farther on another station called the Three Taverns.
Rome, the capital of the empire, is on the Tiber about fifteen
miles from its mouth. At this time its population numbered
1,600,000. "—` Tarbell's Teachers' Guide," 1909.
     "The travelers reach Appii Forum, forty miles from Rome.
 As they make their way through the crowds that throng the great
 thoroughfare, the gray-haired old man, chained with a group of
 hardened-looking criminals, receives many a glance of scorn and
 is made the subject of many a rude, mocking jest. Not one of
 all he meets bestows upon him a look of pity or sympathy. He
 meekly wears his chain, and silently, slowly pursues his way.
     "Suddenly a cry of joy is heard, and a man springs out from
 the passing throng and falls upon the prisoner's neck, embracing
 him with tears and rejoicing, as a son would- welcome a long-
 absent father. Again and. again is the scene repeated. With
 eyes made keen by loving expectation, many discern in the chained
 captive the one who spoke to them the words of life at Corinth,
 at Philippi, or at Ephesus.
     "The whole company is brought to a standstill, as warm-
  hearted disciples eagerly flock around their father in the gospel.
  The soldiers are impatient of delay, yet they have not the heart
  to interrupt this happy meeting; for they too have learned to
  respect and esteem their prisoner. In that worn, pain-stricken
  face, the disciples see the image of Christ reflected. They assure
  Paul that they have not forgotten him or ceased to love him; that
  they are indebted to him for the joyful hope which animates their
  lives, and gives them peace toward God. In the ardor of their
  love they would bear him upon their shoulders the whole way to
  the city, could they but have the privilege." `Sketches from
  the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 273.
      3. "Luke, his fellow traveler, remained with him during his
   bondage; Timotheus, his beloved son in the faith, ministered to
   him at Rome, as he had done in Asia, in• Macedonia, and Achaia
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     37

Tychicus, who had formerly borne him company from Corinth
to Ephesus, is now at hand to carry his letters to the shores which
they had visited together. But there are two names amongst his
Roman companions which excite a peculiar interest, though from
opposite reasons — the names of Demas and of Mark. The lat-
ter, when last we heard of him, was the unhappy cause of the
separatica of Barnabas and Paul. He was rejected by Paul as
unworthy to attend him, because he had previously abandoned
the work of the gospel out of timidity or indolence. It is delight-
ful to find him now ministering obediently to the very apostle who
had then repudiated his services; still more, to know that he
persevered in this fidelity even to the end, and was sent for by
Paul to cheer his dying hours. Demas, on the other hand, is now
a faithful 'fellow laborer' of the apostle, but in a few years we
shall find that he had 'forsaken' him, 'having Joved this present
world.' Perhaps we may be allowed to hope that as the fault
of Demas was the same with that of Mark, so the repentance of
Mark may have been paralleled by that of Demas."—"Life and
Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson, pages
639, 640.
    4. "The Jews who had been banished from Rome some years
previous, had been tacitly permitted to return, so that large num-
bers were now to be found there. To these, first of all, Paul de-
termined to present the facts concerning himself and his work,
before his enemies should have opportunity to embitter them
against him. Three days after his arrival at Rome, therefore,
he called .together their leading men, and in a simple, direct
manner stated the reasons why he had come to Rome as a
prisoner."—"Sketches from the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White,
 page 275.
    5. "He said nothing of the abuse which he had suffered at
the hands of the Jews, or of their repeated plots to assassinate
him. His words were marked with caution and kindness. He was
not seeking to win personal attention or sympathy, but to defend
the truth and to maintain the honor of the gospel."— Id.,
 page 275.
    6. "During the long delay of his trial Paul was not reduced,
as he had been at Caesarea, to a forced inactivity. On the con-
trary, he was permitted the freest intercourse with his friends,
and was allowed to reside in a house of sufficient size to accom-
modate the congregation which flocked together to listen to his
teaching. The freest scope was given to his labors consistent with
the military custody under which he was placed. We are told
in language peculiarly emphatic that his preaching was sub-
jected to no restraint whatever. And that which seemed at first
38          SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 to impede must really have deepened the impression of his elo-
quence, for who could see without emotion that venerable form
subjected by iron links to the coarse control of the soldier who
stood beside him! How often must the tears of the assembly
have been called forth by the upraising of that fettered hand
and the clanking of the chain which checked its energetic action!"
 —"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and How-
son, page 639.
     7. "According to Roman law, the trial of Paul could not take
place until his accusers should be present in person to state their
charges against him. They had not yet come from Palestine, nor
was it known at Rome whether they had even started on the
long journey. Therefore the trial might be postponed indefi-
nitely. Little regard was shown for the rights of those supposed
to have violated the law. It was often the case that an accused
person was kept in prison a long time, by the delay of the prose-
cutors to prefer their charges; or his trial might be deferred by
the caprice of those in power. . . . The Jews of Jerusalem
were in no haste to present their accusations against Paul. They
had been repeatedly thwarted in their designs, and had no desire
to risk another defeat. Lysias, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa had all
declared their belief in his innocence. His enemies could hope for
success only in seeking by intrigue to influence the emperor in
their favor. Delay would further their object, as it would afford
them time to perfect and execute their plans."—"Sketches from
the Life of Paul," Mrs. E. G. White, page 380.
    8. "The history closes somewhat abruptly. It may-have been
the intention of the writer to continue his narrative. It is a
natural inference that when he closed it the two years had ex-
pired, or were on the point of expiring; that he, who had remained
with the apostle during his imprisonment, started with him on
his eastward journey afterwards; and that some incidents, to us
unknown, hindered him from completing the work which he had
begun. It is possible, on the other hand, that Theophilus, as an
Italian convert, mayeav known what had passed in Rome during
the apostle's first sojourn there, or subsequently, and that St.
Luke did not aim at more than setting before his friend the stages
by which St. Paul had been brought .to the imperial city."—
"Handy Commentary" (Acts), Plumptre, page 437.
    From the writings of Mrs. E. G. White we glean the follow-
ing information concerning Paul's imprisonment until his mar-
tyrdom:
    At Paul's examination the charges against him were not sus-
tained, and, contrary to the general expectation, Nero declared
the prisoner guiltless. Paul's fetters were struck off and he was
             SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                      39


free. He left Rome, and again visited the churches; seeking to
establish a firmer union between the Greek and Eastern believers.
The Jews fastened upon Paul the crime of instigaling the burn-
ing of Rome, and at the house of a disciple in Troas, he was seized
and hurried to Rome and placed in a loathsome dungeon. Paul's
last letter, the second epistle to Timothy, was written in this
cell. His persecutors fearing the extent of Paul's influence, he
was beheaded privately.
    Commentators give the date of his death at about A.D. 66.

                               Notes

     '1. Just before Moses went up into the mountain near Jordan
 to view the promised land and die before the Lord; lie rehearsed
in the ears of all the people the great things God had done for
 them in Egypt and since their deliverance. He looked forward
 to the time when they should be settled in their goodly land "flow-
ing with milk and honey," and 'pointed out their greatest danger.
 They would be very likely to forget the Lord their God and be-
 come lifted up, thinking-that it was by their own thrift and in-
 dustry they had acquired riches in increased flocks and herds and
 silver and gold. Human hearts are the same in all ages. The
people of God in our own time, just before entering the promised
Heavenly Canaan, are in danger of failing in this same particular.
 Thus we should be admonished by - this same lesson.
      2. Selfishness ever stands with outstretched arms to receive and
keep. Love receives only to impart. Cheerfulness in giving is
 therefore a sure test of pure, unselfish love. It is a test of char-
 acter, and men and women are saved solely upon the worth of
 character. The poor widow with the two mites is a type of the
cheerful givers whom God especially loves, and who reap special
 blessings. To such "giving is living, and living is giving."
Cheerful giving is the spontaneous outburst of a converted heart
that appreciates the value of Heaven's Great Gift to us, and stands
forth amid the covetousness and greed of the world as a living
example of one truly converted to and blessed of God. To such
"it is more blessed to give than to receive."
     3. "Not all can make large offerings, not all can do great.
works, magnificent deeds; but all can practise self-denial, all can
reveal the unselfishness of the Saviour. Some can bring large
gifts to the Lord's treasury; others can bring only mites; but
every gift brought in sincerity is accepted by the Lord."—`Tes-
timonies for the Church," volume 9, pages 54, 55.
     4. It is the rust of the money that witnesses against its pos-
sessor. This betrays its nature — hoarded treasure. The money
thrown to the moles and bats was one time trusted in to purchase
every desirable thing. It has no such power in the day when
the Lord Jesus is revealed in flaming fire from heaven. These
treasures were potent with great blessing had they been used in
feeding the poor and sending the gospel to the perishing millions
            SABBATH-SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     45

of earth. But it is now too late. The halo and charm have for-
ever departed from these treasures of silver and gold, once so
precious in the eyes of thOse possessing them.
    5."' We have for our God the Creator of the heavens and the
earth. In Him we have all. He who could take five small loaves
and two fishes, and by His own blessing upon them feed. five
thousand people and more — can He not provide for His children
anywhere, at any time'? Did the vast multitude of Israel lack
for food; for water, for clothes, during their sojourn in the wil-
derness for forty years Can He not provide for usl To hoard
up money and trust in this is a direct insult to God, who delights
in continuously working to supply the need of His children. Matt.
16: 5-10; Luke 12: 6, 7. •
    6. Here is an instance where a rich man was directly instructed
to go and sell all that he had, and was at the same time invited
to come and ;associate with Jesus in His work. There is no ques-
tion as to this young man's duty on that day. Had he obeyed
Jesus implicitly, Christ could have made of him a valued servant.
Jesus loved him, but the young man loved his great possessions
more than he loved his Lord, and the precious privilege of being
personally connected with Him in His ministry of saving souls.
Jesus did not -direct everybody to sell all they had, and come
and follow Him. He even told some to stay at home. But in
this young man He saw qualities. He could use in His work. The
young man turned sorrowfully away. No wonder; for he turned
away from his path of duty, away from his God, away from the
light, and went,. as did Judas, out where it was dark.
    7. "My brethren and sisters, do not plead for retrenchment
in evangelical work. So long as there are souls to save, our in-
terest in the work of soul-saving is to know no abating. The
church can not abridge her task without denying her Master.
Not all can go as missionaries to foreign lands, but all can give
of their means f'or the carrying forward of foreign missions."—

The Great Threefold Message
     Always the Message. God's only remedy for
the ills of this world, for the salvation of lost ancisuf-
fering humanity.
     The Signs of the Times weekly is set for the
giving of that Gospel Message, and, every six months,
gives it clearly, sweetly, tenderly, strongly, truly, and
completely.
     A New Series commencing November 14, im-
 mediately following the special Harvest Ingathering
 Number, and continuing for six months, includes a
'study of the Book of Daniel as one of its many
 leading features.
    Never was prophecy fulfilling as now. Never
were the great world movements so charged with
elements involving eternal destiny as now. Never
was this old world staggering under a greater bur-
den, in greater darkness, or under stronger decep-
tions than now. And never was the world in greater
need of a saving message.
    The Signs of the Times is proving one of the
most helpful factors in the work of carrying this
great message quickly, loyally, and effectively.
