    2. What shows the Lord's pleasure in His work in each
step of creation? Gen. 1: 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31; Ex. 31: 17.
    3. For what purpose did God form the earth? Isa. 45: 18;

    7. What two particular trees are mentioned? Verse 9,
last part.
    8. What was the essential difference in partaking of these
two trees? Verses 16, 17. Answer: Partaking of one would

4          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

could listen to His voice. It is in these promises that Christ

    17. What will be the result if we continually choose right
in all we read and study as well as in all we do? Verse 20.
                   Lessons We Can Learn
    1. God created this world as an expression of His pleasure
—more exactly, His will, though the two are in perfect har-
mony. Whatever God wills, or whatever is a pleasure to Him,
is not only right but greatly to be desired. Some development
of the universe was in God's mind when He created the earth,
with its inhabitants. In fact, He created it with the very
purpose that it should be inhabited. The particular aim in
 His will and pleasure was the creation of man.
     2. Not until everything for man's necessity and pleasure
had been prepared was man himself created—with just the
one exception that no one of his kind was provided as a com-
panion. The reason for this exception was clearly God's pur-
pose to take the woman out of man, that he might ever regard
and treat her as part of himself. God would make sure that
 man should not only love his neighbor as himself, but in the
very nature of things, love his wife as himself.
     3. To the pair was given a garden as a home. For them,
a home was to be a place where they could live, have occupa-
tion, and grow in the knowledge of God—that is, grow more
 Godlike. In this way would God add to the expression of
 His glory. "I have created him for My glory." Isa. 43: 7.
     4. The trees in the garden had two properties: "pleasant
 to the sight" and "good for food." Food was a necessity, but
 the higher nature was also to be cultivated. Beauty and
 strength are both elements of character. Man was to enjoy
 both the fruit and the beauty of the tree; for this was closely
 akin to God's pleasure, and every provision was made for
 man to be Godlike.
     5. Two particular trees were planted in the garden as a
 test for the fidelity of the creature to his Creator. Man was
 not to be a mere automaton in relation to his Maker, but
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    5
should have opportunity for the exercise of his free will in
choosing to be or not to be true to God. The test was made
perfectly clear to him. By partaking of the tree of life, he
would live; by partaking of the tree of knowledge of good
and evil, he would die. Like the angels, he was placed on
probation. This test was all the more necessary because re-
bellion had broken out in heaven, and a rebel leader challenged
the justice of God; hence God would not impose His will arbi-
trarily upon any of His creatures, but give them liberty of
choice, with the consequences clearly before them.
     6. In the two trees of the garden is symbolized a founda-
tion principle in Christian education: Choose "life and good";
shun "death and evil." (Deut. 30: 15.) Reduced to educa-
tional practice, this means: Choose studies in which the good
is unmixed with evil; shun studies in which there is evil un-
mixed, or mixed with good. It was not the Creator's purpose
that man should obtain any knowledge of evil; but by par-
taking of the forbidden tree, he would gain a knowledge of
good and evil. In the temptation of Eve, Satan pointed out
only the good; but the evil was there. At first, when she
partook, Eve felt the thrill of only the good; but almost im-
mediately the terrible reality of the evil settled down upon
her. Good is open and easy to identify; evil is hidden, subtle,
and deceptive.
     7. CoNcLusioN: (a) In God's original plan, there was no
separation between education and life. They were insepa-
rable. The very purpose of forming man in the image of
God, of giving him life, of clothing him with Godlike powers,
and of placing him in a perfect environment, was that his
powers might constantly unfold in Godlikeness. This is edu-
cation, it is true education, it is Christian education. Educa-
tion is the business of life. The business of true education
 in this present life is to prepare ourselves and others for the
 life which is to come.
      (b) The best way to enrich life in the school of to-day,
and cause it to unfold in harmony with God's plan, is to study
only things of the following order: whatsoever things are
 true, are honest, are just, are pure, are lovely, are of good
report; then "think on these things." Phil. 4: 8.

11: 7. "When Adam came from the Creator's hand, he bore,
in his physical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to
his Maker."—"Education," page 15.
    5. What was God's purpose concerning this "image and
glory"? Answer: "It was His purpose that the longer man
lived, the more fully he should reveal this image,—the more
fully reflect the glory of the Creator."—"Education," page 15.
    6. Where else was found a similar glory? Ps. 19: 1, 2;
Hab. 3: 3.
    7. How did the Lord commune with Adam and Eve? Gen.
2: 16; 3: 8 onward.
    8. In school terms, how may it be said that God provided
for education at the beginning? Answer: "The Garden of
Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson book, the
Creator Himself was the instructor, and the parents of the
human family were the students."—"Education," page 20.
    9. What was the first reading lesson of which we have
record? Gen. 2: 19, 20.
    10. In a similar way, how did Adam discern the thought
of God when his "helpmeet" was brought to him? Verse 23;
Gen. 3:20.
    11. In general, how did Adam and Eve read the thought
of God? Answer: "In their original perfection, all created

edge of God, teeming with divine instruction. Wisdom spoke
to the eye, and was received into the heart; for they com-
muned with God in His created works."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," page 18.
    12. In what two ways did God 'evidently instruct the
dwellers in Eden? Answer: By His word and through His
works.
    13. By what further means did they gain practical knowl-
edge? Gen. 2: 5, last part, and verse 15.
    14. In God's purpose, what was the Garden of Eden to be?
Answer: "The Garden of Eden was a representation of what
God desired the whole earth to become, and it was His pur-
pose that, as the human family increased in numbers, they
should establish other homes and schools like the one He had
given. Thus in course of time the whole earth might be oc-
cupied with homes and schools where the words and the works
of God should be studied, and where the students should thus
be fitted more and more fully to refiect,, throughout endless
ages, the light of the knowledge of His glory."—"Education,"
 page 22.
    15. Is it too late now to apply the principles of the Eden
plan of education? Answer: "God's Word must be made the
groundwork and subject matter of education."—"Counsels to
 Teachers," page 16. "As soon as the holy pair transgressed
the law of the Most High, the brightness from the face of
 God departed from the face of nature The earth is now
marred and defiled by sin. Yet even in its blighted state,
 much that is beautiful remains. God's object lessons are
 not obliterated; rightly understood, nature speaks of her
 Creator."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 18. "Time is too
 short now to accomplish that which might have been done in
 past generations. But even in these last days we can do
 much to correct the existing evils in the education of youth.
 And because time is short, we should be in earnest, and work
 zealously to give the young an education consistent with our
 faith."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, pages
179, 180.
    16. On what promise of the Lord may we still depend?
 Ps. 32:8.
                      Lessons We Can Learn
   1. God's Word is His principal means of revealing His
will and doing His work. It was the agency used in creation;
8          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
and in its written form, it is the most profitable for study in
all literature.
    2. God's works are another means of expressing His
thought, of revealing Himself,—His wisdom, His might, and
His love. "While the Bible should hold the first place in the
education of children and youth, the book of nature is next in
importance."—"Special Testimonies on Education," page 58.
    3. The holy pair were created in the image of God—in
physical, mental, and spiritual likeness to Him, clothed in the
garments of His glory. This image was to be more fully re-
vealed as time went on.
    4. In Eden, God and the angels instructed and communed
with Adam and Eve by word of mouth, face to face; but the
Eden pair learned of God through His works also. "The
book of nature, which spread its living lessons before them,
afforded an exhaustless source of instruction and delight.




                   SCHOOL, SOONAN, KOREA

On every leaf of the forest and stone of the mountains, in
every shining star, in earth and sea and sky, God's name was
written. With both the animate and the inanimate creation,—
with leaf and flower and tree, and with every living creature,
from the leviathan of the waters to the mote in the sun-
beam,—the dwellers in Eden held converse, gathering from
each the secrets of its life. God's glory in the heavens, the
innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, 'the balanc-
ings of the clouds,' the mysteries of light and sound, of day
and night,—all were objects of study by the pupils of earth's
first school."—"Education," page 21.
    5. The Garden of Eden was a perfect expression of God's
ideal for the Christian home and school. Education was not
separated from the home, nor from the daily work, but was
the whole aim of existence, bound up intimately with every
activity of life itself.

     15. What is the true object of Christian education?
 Answer: "The true object of education is to restore the image
 of God in the soul."-"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 595.
10         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   16. What, then, is the relation of Christian education to
redemption?
                 Lessons We Can Learn .
    1. God's original purpose for man was that he should
have knowledge of only the good. As his knowledge of good,
of God, should increase, he would grow more Godlike in
character.
    2. By partaking of the forbidden tree—forbidden so as to
prevent the learning of evil—man added the knowledge of
evil to his knowledge of good. •
    3. Henceforth it was easy to confuse good and evil. In
fact, Eve was enticed to a knowledge of. evil by what she
mistook for good, and Adam joined her in transgression
because of a mistaken view of the highest good—he would
rather die in transgression with Eve than live in righteous-
ness without her.
    4. The fruits of evil followed immediately upon the knowl-
edge of evil: sense of guilt and shame, laying blame for
wrongdoing upon others, insinuation that even God was to
blame, loss of access to the tree of life, exile from their
happy home.
    5. Though it was necessary to pronounce judgment on
the sinner; God mingled that judgment with mercy in the
promise of a Redeemer to restore the lost estate.
    6. The object of redemption is to renew in man the image
of God in which he was created. The object of Christian
education is identical with that of redemption: "To restore
the image of God in the soul."
    7. CONCLUSION: "In the highest sense, the work of edu-
cation and the work of redemption are one; for in education,
as in redemption, 'other foundation can no man lay than that
is laid, which is Jesus Christ.' "—"Education," page SO.

                   Lessons We Can Learn
    1. In their Eden home, our first parents were taught di-
rectly by teachers from heaven. "In His interest for His
children, our heavenly Father personally directed their edu-
cation. Often they were visited by His messengers, the holy
angels, and from them received counsel and instruction.
Often as they walked in the garden in the cool of the day
they heard the voice of God, and face to face held communion
with the Eternal."—"Education," page 21.
    2. After the fall, people were of two classes: sons of God
and sons of men, according to their acceptance or rejection
of the plan of redemption. A true son of God is one who
accepts Christ and lives by the Word of God.
    3. In the home, parents are enjoined to teach the Word
of God "diligently" to their children morning and evening,
all through the day, and every day.
    4. Abraham is commended for his faithfulness in main-
taining an altar of worship, and teaching his children and
household to the number of a thousand souls. Its influence
extended in a marked way over three generations following.
    5. Joseph's remarkable record of integrity and ability
was owing largely to his early teaching in his father's tent.
While he was on his way to Egypt to be sold as a slave, "his
thoughts turned to his father's God. In his childhood he had
been taught to love and fear Him. Often in his fathel's tent
he had listened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as
he fled from his home an exile and a fugitive. He had been
told of the Lord's promises to Jacob, and how they had been
fulfilled,—how, in the hour of need, the angels of God had
come to instruct, comfort, and protect him. And he had
learned of the love of God in providing for men a Redeemer.
Now all these precious lessons came vividly before him.
Joseph believed that the God of his fathers would be his
God. He then and there gave himself fully to the Lord, and
he prayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with him in
the land of his exile. His soul thrilled with the high resolve
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   13
to prove himself true to God,—under all circumstances to
act as became a subject of the King of heaven. He would
serve the Lord with undivided heart; he would meet the
trials of his lot with fortitude, and perform every duty with
fidelity."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 213, 214-
    6. After Moses had been given into his mother's hands
by Pharaoh's daughter to be nurtured, "she faithfully im-
proved her opportunity to educate her child for God. She
felt confident that he had been preserved for some great work,
and she knew that he must soon be given up to his royal
mother, to be surrounded with influences that would tend
to lead him away from God. All this rendered her more
diligent and careful in his instruction than in that of her
other children. She endeavored to imbue his mind with the
fear of God and the love of truth and justice, and earnestly
prayed that he might be preserved from every corrupting
influence. She showed him the folly and sin of idolatry, and
early taught him to bow down and pray to the living God,
who alone could hear him and help him in every emergency.
     "She kept the boy as long as she could, but was obliged
to give him up when he was about twelve years old. From
his humble cabin home he was taken to the royal palace, to
the daughter of Pharaoh, 'and he became her son.' Yet even
here he did not lose the impressions received in childhood.
 The lessons learned at his mother's side could not be for-
 gotten. They were a shield from the pride, the infidelity,
and the vice that flourished amid the splendor of the court."—
 Id., pages 243, 244.
     7. Daniel's fidelity to God in a heathen court, is traceable
 to the influences that molded his character in his Judean
 home. "Joseph and Daniel proved themselves true to the
 principles of their early training. . . . The same mighty
 truths that were revealed through these men, God desires
 to reveal through the youth and the children of to-day."—
 "Education," pages 56, 57.
     8. "Unfeigned faith" on the part of the grandmother and
 the mother may pass on to the son also, as it did to Timothy,
 because of his knowing the Scriptures from his childhood.
     9. Let every youth remember his Creator while he is yet
 young, and let every parent train up each child in the way
 he should go.
     10. Christian education in the home is the foundation of
 the integrity and usefulness of son or daughter wherever
 the providence of God may lead.

  "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are
white already to harvest."

tion," page 47.
     19. What was the spiritual tone of these schools? An-
swer: "A spirit of devotion was cherished. Not only were

faith in Him, and how to understand and obey the teachings
of His Spirit. Sanctified intellects brought forth from the
treasure house of God, things new and old, and the Spirit of
 God was manifested in prophecy and sacred song."--"Pa
 triarchs and Prophets," page 594.
16          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    21. What were the results of the work done in the schools
of the prophets? Answer: "These schools 'proved to be one

past, present, and future.
    2. A prophet is one who speaks for God, in reference to
things past, present, or future.
    3. In the fuller sense, a prophet is divinely appointed to
his work. In a modified sense, a prophet is divinely called
to do the work of teaching. See "Education," page 46.
    4. What any one can do for God depends much upon the
kind of education he receives in childhood and youth.
    5. Parents have the usefulness and destiny of their chil-
dren largely in their own hands.
    6. The great danger of youth is that they will "learn the
ways of the heathen" instead of the ways of God.
    7. In addition to a Christian home, the greatest safeguard
for our children is to send them to a school whose avowed
object is to "restore the image of God in the soul."

had been told the story of the night vision at Bethel, of the
ladder from heaven to earth, and the descending and ascend-
ing angels, and of Him who from the throne above revealed
 Himself to Jacob. He had been told the story of the conflict
beside the Jabbok, when, renouncing cherished sins, Jacob
 stood conqueror, and received the title of a prince with God.
    "A shepherd boy, tending his father's flocks, Joseph's pure
 and simple life had favored the development of both physical
and mental power. By communion with God through nature
 and the study of the great truths handed down as a sacred
 trust from father to son, he had gained strength of mind,
 and firmness of principle."—"Education," page 52.

                    Lessons We Can Leain
    1. The dwelling of God in the heart is the first essential
to true education.
    2. Keeping the Word of God in the mind, by every device
possible, is another great essential.
    3. Teaching the things of God diligently from childhood
is the best assurance that crises in later life will be success-
fully met.                            •
    4. As the basis for Moses' great choice between the throne
of earth's mightiest kingdom and suffering affliction with the
people of God was laid in the first twelve years of his life,
by his faithful mother-teacher, so should every parent see
that his children are kept under Christian instruction during
these vital, formative years.
    5. As Joseph, listening in his father's tent to the rehearsal
of God's dealings with His people, developed such confidence
in God, by 'the .time he was seventeen, that he passed the
terrible test of being sold into slavery and thrown into prison
unjustly in a strange and heathen land, so may our sons and
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    21
daughters be established in faith if they have been diligently
taught of God from childhood.
    6. As David learned of God in the simple surroundings
of pastoral life in his boyhood, and as he used his wonderful
skill in music and poetry to give expression to the melody in
his soul as he caught new glimpses of God, so may every
youth learn of God, and devote his talent to the honor of
God, if he is kept under environment and instruction of the
right kind.
    7. As Solomon, by the time he was twenty, had the dis-
cernment to choose an understanding heart above all that
wealth, power, and honor offered him, so may our maturing
youth come out of our homes and schools, by the same age,
with their choice fixed upon the wisdom and knowledge which
Solomon commends, if they are led by their parents and
teachers to cry out for and seek after the knowledge that
"passeth understanding."

    6. Jesus never attended any of the schools of the time,

in reaching the heart.

rather glory in understanding and knowing God.

   20. Under what discipline in the school of Christ may all

                   Lessons We Can Learn
    1. The worker for God must have "many infallible proofs"
that Jesus ever lives to make intercession for him, and will
be with him always in all his labor.
    2. He must receive "the power of the Holy Ghost coming
upon him." Acts 1: 8, margin.
    3. He is then ready to be a witness of Jesus "unto the
uttermost part of the earth."
    4. His work in the field will confirm the efficiency of his
preparation in the school of Christ.
    5. The marvelous changes wrought in the lives of Peter,
John, and Philip, are examples of what learning in the
school of the apostles taught by Jesus, accomplished, and of
what can be accomplished now if the principles of Christian
education are faithfully carried out.
    6. Though sincere in it all himself, Paul was wrongly
educated, and consequently became a persecutor of the true
people of God.
    7. When Christ was revealed to Paul, he immediately be-
gan to preach Jesus, till his life was imperiled. Then he
went into solitude "to be alone with God, to search his own
heart, to deepen his repentance, and to prepare himself by
prayer and study to engage in a work which appeared to
him too great and too important for him to undertake."—
"Life of Paul," page 33.
    8. Paul esteemed himself the least of the apostles, and
unfit to be an apostle, because of sin; but he became chief
of the apostles, by the grace of God, and by rejoicing in the
infirmity which kept him from self-exaltation, that the power
Jf Christ might rest upon him.
    9. Sitting at the feet of the greatest teachers of the day,
even professed religious teachers, will not of itself fit young
men and women for fruitful Christian service. There are
some who may even array them against the true cause of God.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  27
   10. The sure way is to sit at the feet of the Master
Teacher, learning in the school of Christ, as His disciples,
receiving the Holy Spirit, as His apostles, then go forth every-
where preaching the Word.

    20. What part may the Christian school act in the advent
movement, to hasten the finishing of the work?
                   Lessons We Can Learn
   1. As Jesus' work was both to do and to teach, so are we to
do what we teach, practice what we preach, that we may teach
through doing, and preach through practicing. Living like
this is more to be esteemed than necessary food. Job 23: 12.
    2. I can do all things in Him that strengthens me—the
Father working hitherto and I working.
    3. Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit as His personal
representative, to teach us all things and to guide us into all
truth; but He ordained that we receive the Holy Spirit, and
that He teach through us. On this condition, Jesus sends
us into all the world to teach all nations and preach the gos-
pel to every creature.
    4. Jesus through Paul bids us study to become workmen
that need not be ashamed, vessels unto honor, meet for the
Master's use, thoroughly furnished unto every good work.
    5. The Scriptures must be our chief study, in school and
out; for they are able to make us wise unto our own salva-
tion and unto the salvation of others.
    6. The Christian school is one of the chief agencies to save
our children from the world, and to furnish the advent move-
ment with laborers for the finishing of the work.

   "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will
send forth laborers into His harvest."

    3. Wisdom and understanding grow when the truth is
kept and taught in love. "Thy Word is truth."




                 SCHOOL, SHANGHAI, CHINA
    4. The Scriptures should be taught diligently and daily
by parents and by teachers of children.
    5. One large function of the school is to educate "faith-
ful men who shall be able to teach others also."
    6. The Christian schools of to-day should so teach that
they may furnish men of God for all kinds of good works.
    7. Conditions in society and in the popular schools call
loudly for a type of school that teaches pure truth—not
fables, not traditions of men, not rudiments of the world, not
philosophy and vain deceit, not science falsely so-called; for
all these cause many to err from the faith.
    8. Young men and women should be so taught that they
hold fast to sound doctrine, that they may be sober, chaste,
sincere, sound in speech, denying ungodliness and worldly
lusts, looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appear-
ing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

    1. How was man created in the beginning in his relation-
ship to God? Gen. 5: 1; 9: 6; 1 Cor. 11: 7.
    2. How did he lose this image of glory? Rom. 3: 23; 5: 12.

ner? Rom. 5:8.

first part, A. R. V.
    6. How is our transformation into the glorious image of
God accomplished? 2 Cor. 3: 18. The expression "from
glory to glory" indicates a progressive change into the image
of God. This suggests an educational process. As the glory
of God shines forth in the study of His Word, His works, and
His ways, the student, by continued beholding, is changed
into the same image, reflecting the glory of his Maker, as
did Moses, by intimate and prolonged communion with God.
    7. How is the true educational process defined in the
Scriptures? 2 Cor. 4: 16.
    Literally: "The inward man is being renewed day by day."

   19. What will be the measure of that accumulating knowl-
edge? Eph. 3: 17-19.
    20. To whom will the redeemed give all the glory as the
ages roll on? Verses 20, 21.
                    Lessons We Can Learn
    1. Man was created in the image and likeness of God.
He was clothed in the glory of God.
    2. Man lost the glory of this image by sinning and com-
ing short of the glory of God. He was left naked, ashamed,
and lost.
    3. Christ came to man's rescue by giving His own glorious
life as a substitute, and lifted man up to sit with Him in
heavenly places. Man's part is to die with Him, and rise
with Him to walk in newness of life.
    4. Christ is the raying-forth of His Father's glory. By
beholding Him, we become changed into His likeness from
glory to glory. We see the glory of God revealed as we study
His Word, His works, and His ways. These should be the
chief studies in our preparation school here on earth.
    5. As we discover the love, wisdom, and power of God,
and study and meditate upon these, their glory is reflected
in our lives, and we long to go forth and reveal them to the
children of men sitting in darkness. We look on the field,
and offer ourselves as laborers to reap the ripening harvest,
and thus to hasten the coming of the Lord of the harvest.
    6. When He comes, He bestows the reward of the faith-
ful—far beyond anything we can now comprehend.
    7. The riches of God's grace and the glories of Eden re-
stored will be the science and the song and the study of the
redeemed through the ages as they roll ceaselessly on.

              Lesson 13—The Review
                    SEPTEMBER 25, 1920
              EDUCATION AND LIFE—Lesson 1
    Education is bound up with the life itself. Man was
created upright--like God. He was left free to choose good
or evil. As he chose, he was, he lived.
               THE EDEN SCHOOL—Lesson 2
   The Eden plan was education by living. What man saw,
what he ate, what he did, what he heard, what he thought,
what he was taught, were all a part of his education, 0.11 de-
signed to make him more Godlike.
          EDUCATION AND REDEMPTION—Lesson 3
   Re-education is the same as redemption. Man chose evil.
He was turned out of the Eden school to die. Jesus prom-
ised His life for man's. Man must learn his way back to
God's favor by a new and living way.
            EDUCATION IN THE HOME—Lesson 4
   Home is the first and best school. So it proved with
Joseph, and Moses, and Samuel, and Daniel, and Timothy.
            SCHOOLS OF THE PROPHETS—LeSSOn 5
   Schools of the prophets were a supplement to the home.
   They were taught by men of learning and piety.
   The students were intelligent, pious, and industrious.
   The studies were Bible, sacred history, sacred music,
and poetry.
   Teachers and students worked with their hands.
   The students became teachers of others.
     RESULTS OF TRUE EDUCATION IN ISRAEL—Lesson 6
   Moses and Joseph were products of true education in
the home.
   David and Solomon, specially taught at home,,and by the
Lord Himself, raised Israel to the greatest height of glory.
            THE EDUCATION OF JESUS—Lesson
   Jesus was taught by His mother, by the Scriptures, by
nature, by the Father. He never went to schools of the day,
but He spoke and taught as never man did.
34          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
              THE SCHOOL OF CHRIST—LeSSOn 8
    The disciples were taught in the school of Christ.. They
were untaught at school, but were teachable, and so were
transformed in character and ability from fishers of fish to
fishers of men.
          THE SCHOOL OF THE APOSTLES—LeSSOn 9
    The school of the apostles was a graduate school. Men
who had been in the school of Christ for three years, went
on learning under the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Paul
came in late, but by special revelation and zeal, became chief
of the apostles.
     THE SCHOOL IN THE ADVENT MOVEMENT—Lesson 10
   This school is to prepare workmen that need not be
ashamed, who are to teach and preach the Word, which is
able to make men wise unto salvation, and prepare them to
meet their God.
       THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL OF To-DAY—Lesson 11
    Its characteristics:
    The fear of the Lord is to pervade its work.
    The Scriptures are to be taught from childhood.
    Parents and teachers are to unite their efforts.
    Teachers are to be developed.
    All kinds of workers are to be trained.
    Sound doctrine is to be taught.       •
    Philosophy and vain deceit, traditions of men, rudiments
of the world, science falsely so called, are all to be kept out.
Young men and women must be taught to be sober, chaste,
sound of speech, denying worldly lusts, looking for *the
blessed hope.
        THE SCHOOL OF THE HEREAFTER—LeSSOn 12
    To make sure of the school of the hereafter for us, Christ
gave His life for the sinner, lived thirty-three years as a man
among men, trained His successors on the earth, went back
to heaven, will come again, take His children, and place them
in the school of the hereafter, where the science and song
of the redeemed will be their study and their joy through
endless ages.
