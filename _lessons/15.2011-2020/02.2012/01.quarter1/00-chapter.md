         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of worldwide evaluation committees and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

Glimpses of Our God

W               ho can look at those photos from the Hubble Space Telescope and
                not marvel at the beauty of the cosmos? Astonished at the famous
                photo of the Sombrero Galaxy, one writer said, “How can we begin
to fathom the knowledge, the power, the reasoning, the truths, and the purposes
that went into the Sombrero Galaxy (which is just one among billions of others)?
Here we are, so small and so isolated, a speck of the creation with so much in our
view but so infinitely beyond our grasp.”
   More astonishing than the universe itself, however, has to be its Maker, because
only something greater than the universe could have made it.
   Of course, as Seventh-day Adventists, the God whom we worship and serve is the
One who, indeed, has made the universe—everything from the Sombrero Galaxy to
the quarks that compose all matter in it and everywhere else.
   It is in this context—that of the Lord whom we worship and serve—that this
quarter’s lesson is going to do some “theology,” a technical term for “the study of
God.” After all, is it not important to know about the God whom we worship, trust,
and serve—the One we are called to love with “all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind” (Luke 10:27)?
   The picture of God in the Bible is very expansive. Yes, God’s love is underscored,
again and again, but there is so much more about Him that He wants us to know.
For example, there are hundreds of different names for God in Scripture. Each one
of them could give a deeper and more informed understanding of the great God of
heaven and earth. He is so much more than a benign Santa Claus in the sky who
doles out assistance at our request. (A professional poker player recently won mil-
lions of dollars in a tournament and then publicly thanked Jesus for it!)
   This quarter we’re going to look at God, at various aspects of Him as they have
been revealed to us, and at what these things mean for us on a practical level. We’re
going to start with some of the “basics,” such as the Trinity—the amazing teach-
ing that God is One God and yet composed of Three
Persons. From there, we’re going to focus on God as
Creator—the doctrine that forms the foundation of             This quarter we’re
all that we believe. Next, we’ll look at His work of          going to look at God,
redemption because, in a fallen world, being created          at various aspects of
isn’t enough. We need to be redeemed, as well. We’ll
also look at God as both a God of grace and a God of
                                                              Him as they have
judgment. We’ll then look at His holiness, His law, and       been revealed to us,
the Sabbath, all of which stem from the essence of His        and at what these
character and help us to understand more about what           things mean for us
He is like.
                                                              on a practical level.
   And we also are going to look at some other aspects of
God not commonly considered, such as God as a God
of beauty, of history, and even of romance. Among other things, such as prayer and
ecology (that is, we want to look at some of the practical aspects of what it means to
serve our Lord), we’re going to look at God’s great promise of the Second Coming,
which leads to the climax of history and the end of humanity’s horrible experience
with sin.
   God is big (after all, He created—along with everything else—the Sombrero
Galaxy!). We are so small in contrast. How grateful we should be, then, for every
bit of light He casts our way. This quarter we’ll look at some of that light. How
faithfully we walk in it, is up to each of us individually.

      The Triune God
       				




        		




        						
      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Deut. 6:4; Phil. 2:6; Matt.
      28:19; Gen. 1:26, 27; John 14–16.

Memory Text: “But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your
      most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the
      love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto
      eternal life” (Jude 20, 21, NKJV).

Key Thought: Scripture contains references and hints to the deity
      and unity of the divine Godhead.



      A
               lthough the word Trinity doesn’t appear in the Bible, the
               teaching definitely does. The doctrine of the Trinity, that God
               is One and composed of three “Persons,” is crucial because it
      is dealing with who God is, what He is like, how He works, and how
      He relates to the world. Most important, the deity of Christ is essential
      to the plan of salvation.
         In Scripture, there are three separate but interrelated types of evi-
      dence for the Trinity, or tri-unity of God: (1) evidence for the unity of
      God, that God is One; (2) evidence that there are three Persons who
      are God; (3) subtle textual hints of God’s three-in-oneness.
         The distinctions among God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit found in the
      Bible must be understood as being the way God is in Himself, however
      difficult this may be for our fallen minds to grasp. The “eternal heavenly
      dignitaries—God, and Christ, and the Holy Spirit,” as Ellen G. White
      calls them (Evangelism, p. 616), are equal but not identical or inter-
      changeable. As fundamental belief number 2 says, “There is one God:
      Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three co-eternal Persons.”

     The Oneness of God
       The belief system of the ancient Hebrews was rigorously mono-
     theistic: “mono” expressing “one” and “theistic” from the Greek word
     for “God,” meaning that there is only one true God. This position is
     unwavering all through the Old Testament. There is but one God, the
     God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and not many gods as believed by
     the nations and tribes around the Hebrews. In this sense, the religion
     of the Bible was unique.

How does God speak about Himself in Exodus 3:13–15? How do
     these verses imply the oneness of God?

     ________________________________________________________

        The oneness of God is also found in the text (Deut. 6:4) called by
     the Jews “the Shema.” It was given this name because the opening
     word, the command “Hear” in Hebrew, is the word shema. This state-
     ment is one of the great truths about God, a truth that the people of
     Israel were commanded to believe and to teach their children.
         “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one” (Deut. 6:4,
     ESV). Compare that verse with Genesis 2:24 (ESV), “Therefore a man
     shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they
     shall become one flesh.” What might it mean that the same Hebrew
     word for one appears in both texts?

     ________________________________________________________

        The same word, echad, for “one,” is used of God in the “Shema”
     of Deuteronomy 6:4. This word echad, for oneness, does not imply
     a mathematical sum but a complex unity instead. Something is being
     affirmed here about a unity of distinct parts. Husbands and wives are
     to be “one” (echad) according to Genesis 2:24, just as in Deuteronomy
     God is “one.”

How does the New Testament talk about the oneness of God? James
     2:19, 1 Cor. 8:4.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

      How should the understanding of God as one help us avoid the
      pitfalls of idolatry in any form? Why should the Lord alone be
      the One whom we worship? How can you eradicate any “idols”
      from your own life?
                                                                            7
                   M onday January 2

      The Deity of Christ
        The deity of the Father is scarcely, if ever, in dispute. Those who
      question the Trinity often challenge the deity of Christ. Were Christ
      anything but eternal and fully divine, the plan of salvation would be
      seriously compromised (see Thursday’s lesson).

How does Paul, once a rigid Pharisee, talk about the deity of Christ?
      Phil. 2:6.
      ________________________________________________________

        For a Pharisee grounded in the Old Testament teaching of the one-
      ness of God, this is an astonishing statement, because it reveals Paul’s
      deep commitment to the deity of Christ.
        The book of Hebrews—written to Jews who were strong mono-
      theists, as was Paul—contains potent statements underscoring the
      deity of the Son of God. In Hebrews 1:8, 9, Christ’s divine nature is
      powerfully and explicitly expressed.
        Most important in revealing the deity of Christ is Jesus’ own self-
      consciousness. He didn’t march through the streets of Jerusalem
      with a triumphal chorus proclaiming His deity. Yet the four Gospels
      include many threads of evidence which reveal that this is how He
      understood Himself. Jesus repeatedly claimed to possess what prop-
      erly belonged only to God: He spoke of the angels of God as His
      angels (Matt. 13:41); He claimed to forgive sins (Mark 2:5–10); and
      Jesus claimed the power to judge the world (Matt. 25:31–46). Who
      else but God could rightfully do that?

Review how Jesus accepted the worship of various people in the
      Gospel records (Matt. 14:33, 28:9, Luke 24:50–52, John 9:35–38).
      Compare His actions with Paul’s (Acts 14:8–18). What does Jesus’
      acceptance of all this worship reveal about His deity?
      ________________________________________________________

        At His trial, one accusation against Jesus was that He claimed to be
      the Son of God (John 19:7, Matt. 26:63–65). If Jesus did not regard
      Himself as God, this was a critical opportunity for Him to correct a
      mistaken impression. Yet He did not. In fact, it was at His trial before
      Caiaphas that He affirmed His own deity under oath. Hence, we have
      powerful evidence from the Bible of the deity of Christ.

       Think about Jesus’ life. Focus on the fact that He was God, the
       Creator of the universe. What does this tell us about God’s love for
       the world? Why should you draw much comfort and hope from
       this truth?

     The Holy Spirit
       If God can be “one,” with the two Persons of the Father and the
     Son, adding a third Person to the Godhead should not particularly add
     more difficulty. We are talking here about the Holy Spirit.

Read Genesis 1:2. What does this tell us about the role of the Holy
     Spirit, who appears so early in the biblical record?
     ________________________________________________________

How does Matthew 28:19 draw attention to the three members of the
     Godhead?

     ________________________________________________________

        Three Persons of the Godhead are mentioned when Jesus instructs how
     new believers are to be baptized. This baptismal “formula” is used today
     in most Christian baptisms. The person who has chosen to follow Jesus
     is baptized into the “Name” (singular, not plural, in the Greek), although
     three Persons are included. Three Divine Beings are viewed as One.
        At the baptism of Jesus, all three Persons of the Trinity appear
     together. Read Mark’s dramatic description of that baptism (Mark
     1:9–11). Mark’s description of the heavens as “parting” (vs. 10, NKJV)
     would be better translated as “torn open” (NIV). Mark draws attention
     to all three Members of the Divine Godhead in an awesome revelation
     of God that affects even nature itself.
        As with Jesus, the work of the Holy Spirit is linked with, and attrib-
     uted to, the actions of God. Review the following portrayals of the Holy
     Spirit’s actions:
        1. When announcing the birth of Christ, the angel tells Mary that her
     Child will be called “holy” because the Holy Spirit will come upon her
     (Luke 1:35).
        2. Jesus claimed that the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him, anointing
     Him to preach (Luke 4:18).
        3. He also claimed to be driving out demons by the Spirit of God
     (Matt. 12:28).
        4. The Spirit, who is to carry on Christ’s work after His departure, is
     another Counselor of the same kind (John 14:16).
        5. Jesus breathed out the Holy Spirit upon His followers (John
     20:22).
        6. New Christians will have both the indwelling Holy Spirit (John
     14:17) and also the Spirit of Christ (Gal. 2:20, Col. 1:27).
        Christ and the Holy Spirit are intimately linked with each other’s
     ministry. Moreover, there are biblical references that identify the Holy
     Spirit as God. Read Acts 5:1–11. How does this incident help us to
     understand the deity of the Holy Spirit, as well?
                                                                             9

      In Unity and Equality
        However clear it is in the Bible that God is one (echad), the Bible
      also talks about the plurality of Persons. Scholars and Bible students
      throughout the millennia have seen in many Old Testament texts power-
      ful evidence of the plural nature of God. This truth, as with many oth-
      ers, is more fully revealed in the New Testament.

Read Genesis 1:26, 27. How is God’s plurality revealed here?

         This pairing of the plural and the singular when referring to God
      also occurs in Genesis 11:7, 8 at the building of the tower of Babel.
      God Himself speaks again. The “Lord” is mentioned, yet He speaks
      as one of a group (“Us”).

Read Isaiah 6:8. In what ways do you see the plurality of the “Lord”
      revealed there, as well?

         In the New Testament, how does Peter’s sermon at Pentecost exalt
      Jesus within the Godhead? (See Acts 2:33.) Peter, a devout mono-
      theistic Jew, and thus a believer in One God, proclaims the full divin-
      ity of Christ, now in heaven. In his letter to the Jewish exiles of the
      dispersion, Peter again communicates evidence of the triune nature of
      God. (See 1 Pet. 1:1–3.)		

How does Paul include the plurality of God as he describes the pro-
      cess of salvation? 2 Cor. 1:20–22. (See also 2 Cor. 13:14.)

       With our finite and fallen minds, this teaching is not easy to
       fully grasp. But so what? We are dealing here with the nature
       of God, the Creator of the universe. How foolish it would be to
       think that we could fully understand Him, especially when, as
       humans, we don’t “fully” understand pretty much anything.
       Dwell on even the “simplest” thing you can think of. How many
       aspects of it remain beyond your grasp? How much more so
       with something as grand as the nature of God Himself?

     The Trinity and Salvation
       The Gospel of John gives direct and conscious attention to the
     unique nature of God. John seems to be fully aware of the oneness,
     yet “threeness,” of God.

Read Christ’s prayer in John 14–16 and count the number of refer-
     ences to the three Persons of God. How do these passages help us
     to understand the reality of this important truth?

     _______________________________________________________

        This passage in the Gospel of John is the most extensive concentra-
     tion of references to the coequal, three-Person God. Here, the inter-
     dynamics among the Trinity come through repeatedly. The doctrine of
     the Trinity, far from being a piece of abstract speculation, is the inevi-
     table conclusion that comes from a systematic survey of Scripture.
        Of special importance in this context is the deity of Christ. If Christ
     were not fully God, then all we have is the Lord shifting the punishment
     for our sins from one party to another, as opposed to taking them upon
     Himself. The whole point of the gospel is that it was God Himself on the
     cross bearing the sins of the world. Anything short of this would denude
     the atonement of everything that made it so powerful and effective.
        Think about it: if Jesus were merely a created being, and not fully God,
     how could He—as a creature—bear God’s full wrath against sin? What
     created being, no matter how exalted, could save humanity from the vio-
     lation of God’s holy law?
        Were Jesus not divine, then God’s law would not be as sacred as God
     Himself, because the violation of it would be something for which a cre-
     ated being could atone. The law would be only as sacred as that created
     being, and not as sacred as the Creator. Sin itself would not be so bad if all
     it took to atone for it was the death of a creature and not the death of the
     Creator to atone for it. The fact that it took God Himself, in the Person of
     Christ, to remedy sin presents powerful evidence of the seriousness of sin.
        Also, our assurance of salvation through what Christ has done for us—
     and not through our own works—comes from the fact that God Himself
     paid the penalty for our sins. What could we do to add to that? Were
     Christ a created being, maybe we could add something. But with God
     the Creator sacrificing Himself for our sins, it’s all but blasphemous to
     believe that anything we do could supplement that sacrifice. Thus, were
     Christ not divine, the atonement would be fatally compromised.

      Think for a moment: the Creator of the universe died in your
      stead, in your place, so you could have the promise of eternal life
      in Him. How can you learn to draw hope and assurance from this
      amazing truth? In light of this reality, what else really matters?
                                                                               11

    Further Study: In the doctrine of the Trinity, we do not find three
         different divine roles displayed by one Person (that is modalism). Nor
         are there three gods in a cluster (that is tritheism or polytheism). The
         one God (“He”) is also, and equally, “They,” and “They” are always
         together, always closely cooperating. The Holy Spirit executes the
         will of both Father and Son, which is also His will. This is the truth
         that God reveals about Himself all throughout the Bible.
            Some people struggle with the divinity of Christ because of how,
         while here in the flesh, Jesus had subordinated Himself to the will of
         the Father. Many see this as “proof ” that He was somehow less than the
         Father. This reality, however, does not reflect the inner structure of the
1        Godhead. This subordination reflects, instead, how the plan of salvation
         was to operate. Jesus was to come into humanity, becoming “obedient
         to the point of death, even death on a cross” (Phil. 2:8, ESV). Also,
         “though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he
         suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salva-
         tion unto all them that obey him” (Heb. 5:8, 9). These statements reveal
2        that the subordinate role Jesus played resulted from the Incarnation,
         which was crucial to the plan of salvation. They don’t prove that He is
         anything other than fully divine and eternal.
            “ ‘His name shall be called Immanuel, . . . God with us.’ ‘The light of
         the knowledge of the glory of God’ is seen ‘in the face of Jesus Christ.’
         From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with the Father;
         He was ‘the image of God,’ the image of His greatness and majesty,
         ‘the outshining of His glory.’ It was to manifest this glory that He came
3        to our world.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 19.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Some early Adventists struggled with the doctrine of the
          Trinity. Today the church has taken a firm stand on the doc-
          trine. How does this change over time reveal to us the unfolding
          nature of truth? In your own experience, how have you grown
          in your understanding of truth? What beliefs did you once hold
          that, today, you no longer accept?

          l
          2 John 8:58 reads: “Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
          unto you, before Abraham was, I am.” How does this text power-
          fully reveal the full divinity of Christ?

    Summary: If we want to deepen our love for the great infinite God
         we serve and be drawn to worship Him, we first must try to grasp
         what He tells us about Himself. The Trinity is a mystery, but in
         Scripture “mysteries” are deep truths that an infinite God reveals to
         us on a finite level. Thus, we can safely speak of God only from our
         knees. “ ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!’ ” (Deut.
         6:4, NKJV).

Curse of the Fetish Priest
by Guillaume Djossou
   Giving one’s life to God can be a life-or-death decision in some regions
of the world. As a lay pastor and church planter working near the city of
Cotonou, Benin, I saw this firsthand.
   When Ann and her husband became Seventh-day Adventist Christians,
Ann’s father, a fetish priest in Benin, cursed her with death.
   One day as Ann sat working under a tree, she noticed dark clouds form-
ing. She gathered her things, but before she could leave, rain started fall-
ing. The rain wasn’t heavy, so Ann remained under the sheltering tree.
   Suddenly, lightning struck, and Ann’s clothes caught fire. She yanked
off the burning cloth wrap, but her back was badly burned. Some Seventh-
day Adventist church members nearby ran to help Ann to safety. Ann lost
consciousness before they reached a nearby house.
   Realizing that Ann’s injuries were the work of the devil, the believers
read Revelation 12:7–12 and claimed God’s power over Satan. Then they
prayed for Ann. While they prayed, some people approached the house
and began invoking spirits. The believers realized that these were fetish
priests, and they prayed even more earnestly, even as the voodoo priests
called on their spirits.
   When Ann regained consciousness, the believers tried to take her to the
hospital. But the priests prevented them from leaving. Finally, the police
arrived and helped the Christians take Ann from the house. Ann eventu-
ally recovered from her ordeal.
   At the time the demons attacked Ann, the little Seventh-day Adventist
congregation had just eight members. But word spread about how God
had saved Ann from the curse of the voodoo priests, and many people
came to hear about Ann’s powerful God.
   Because of Ann’s steadfast faith and the family’s work in the com-
                              munity, many people have given their lives
                              to Jesus. The little church in the village has
                              grown to more than 50 members.
                                Your mission offerings are helping to
                              advance the work of God in a demon-infested
                              region of the world. Who knows how many
                              people will hear Christ’s message of love
                              because you have given? Thank you.

      In the Beginning




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 19:4; Job 38:4–7; Deut.
      32:10, 11; Psalm 19; John 1:1–13; Rom. 5:12; Isa. 66:22.

Memory Text: “For by Him all things were created that are in
      heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether
      thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were
      created through Him and for Him” (Colossians 1:16, NKJV).

Key Thought: The doctrine of Creation, a literal six-day Creation,
      is foundational to all that we believe.



      I
          t’s hard to imagine two more diverse views of our origins than the
          biblical model of Creation and atheistic evolution. The first presents
          a creation that was planned, calculated, with nothing left to chance.
      In contrast, the evolutionary model is all chance. Second, in the biblical
      account, everything was created for a purpose; God had an end goal, a
      purpose for what He created. In contrast, evolution works on the prem-
      ise that there is no final goal, no purpose-driven force motivating what’s
      created. Random mutation and natural selection (products of chance)
      work together blindly, keeping what functions and discarding what
      doesn’t. Finally, the biblical account teaches that humans were made in
      the image of God. Evolution teaches that they are made in the image of
      whatever primate just happened to precede Homo sapiens.
         This week, we’ll look at the biblical doctrine of Creation. If we get
      Creation wrong, we’re all but certain to get many other things wrong.
      That’s how crucial the teaching is to what we believe as Seventh-day
      Adventist Christians.

     Creation Week
       				
       “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen.
     1:1, NKJV). How does this opening line automatically make the
     Bible and Darwinian evolution mutually exclusive?

        The book of Genesis opens with God already in action as Creator.
     No explanation for, or introduction of, God is given. None of the Bible
     writers thought that God needed an introduction. The closest thing for
     a proof of the existence of God might be the sentiment of the psalmist:
     “The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’ ” (Ps. 14:1, NKJV).
        Scholars have noted an amazing artistry, not just in creation but in
     how it is presented in the Bible. Genesis 1:2 provides the introductory
     aspects upon which God’s masterpieces of matter are organized: “The
     earth was without form and void.” The first three days He “forms” what
     was “unformed.” The next three days He “fills” what had been “void”
     or empty.
        The light created on day one was filled or completed on day four with
     the great lights of the sun and moon (and “the stars also,” Gen. 1:16).
     The air and water that had been the focus on day two were filled up with
     the birds and water creatures on day five (Gen. 1:6–8, 20–23). The dry
     land separated from the waters and then filled with vegetation on day
     three (Gen. 1:9–13) was completed with the land animals, along with
     humans, on day six. Finally, all was pronounced “very good” and then
     regally celebrated on the seventh day by God Himself (Gen. 2:1–3).
        The point is that nothing in these texts leaves any indication that any-
     thing was left to chance. On the contrary, the texts teach the opposite:
     everything was meticulously worked out and planned.

According to the following texts, who also believed in the biblical
     account of Creation?

     Matt. 19:4________________________________________________

     Exod. 20:8–11_____________________________________________

     1 Tim. 2:13_______________________________________________

     Isa. 40:26________________________________________________

       Everything in the Bible testifies to the fact that the Lord created the
     world, speaking it into existence just as depicted in Genesis 1 and 2.
     Scripture leaves us no wiggle room regarding that matter. One can
     choose Creation, or one can choose evolution, but honesty allows no
     melding of the two. The texts themselves don’t leave us that option.
                                                                            15

     The Heart of the Creator
       The drama of Creation week is extraordinary. Day after day, the Creator
     speaks into existence the life systems and life forms that continue to
     amaze scientists. Even God refers to the extreme joy of that time.

How does God express to Job the excitement that was part of the
     earth’s creation? Job 38:4–7.

     _______________________________________________________

       A hint of the joy in the Creator’s heart that first week can also be
     found in the second verse of Genesis chapter one (NKJV): “And the
     Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.” Biblical
     scholars become ever more appreciative of the fine literary crafting
     of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible) by Moses. In this
     instance, as Moses describes the Spirit of God “hovering” over the
     face of the waters at the opening of Creation week, he deliberately
     chooses a word that he will only use one more time—in Deuteronomy
     32. That chapter is part of his farewell sermon to Israel.

How does Moses use the word hovering this second time? Deut. 32:10,
     11. (See also Matt. 23:37.)

     _______________________________________________________

       Think of how mother birds lovingly prepare the nest for their
     babies. Then, picture them hovering over their babies, bringing them
     food, and then teaching them how to fly. Moses, who had taken care
     of sheep for 40 years, must have seen this natural phenomenon hap-
     pen each spring, and it must have made him think of God’s tender
     care. Under inspiration, he pictured the same emotions in the Holy
     Spirit’s heart as our human “nest” was being constructed.
       Everything in the Creation account, then, in contrast to the vari-
     ous evolutionary models—which depict our Creation as the work of
     forces violently competing with each other—reveals a God who loves
     His creation, who cares about it, and who purposely and carefully
     designed it. There’s nothing impersonal about the creation, nothing
     emotionless, nothing purposeless. Love was there at the start of the
     Creation week. What a contrast to evolution, which teaches that love
     somehow emerged only after billions of years of selfish violence.
     Love motivated the Creation, and love will be there when this dam-
     aged version of Creation is created anew.

      Dwell on the marvels of nature. How do you see the amazing
      love of God manifested there?

The Heavens Declare
   The book of Psalms contains a rich corpus of songs praising the Creator.
Regularly and jubilantly the psalmists refer to the “great works” of God.
   Psalm 19. The progression of thought is audacious. First, David
describes the glories of the heavens and firmament, including the
blazing sun. He compares the brilliant energy of the sun to a bride-
groom going to his wedding and also to an athlete in training (vss.
1–6). He then links this splendor of the sun to the perfection of God’s
law and the power of its precepts. The contents of the law are thereby
linked with the grandeur of God’s creative actions (vss. 7–11).
   Psalm 92. This “Song for the Sabbath” opens with the attitude of
praise from a grateful heart. The one who traces the use of “the works
of Your hands” and “Your works,” as used throughout the Psalter
(or throughout any biblical book for that matter), will be drawn to the
extensive praise for the created world included in the Bible. And the
more that any person learns about the created works of God—whether
the smallest detail seen through a microscope, or the farthest star or
planet seen through a telescope, or whatever creature of animal life
(whether it swims, flies, or walks)—the more the amazing power of
God’s creative activity comes through. Scientists continue to learn
more and more, not only about the different plants and animals but also
about how all systems of life interact with each other in the complex
web of life. The more they learn, the more amazing it all appears.

   “[The] jaw is clearly not an example of intelligent design; rather,
it is an imperfect adaptation that has occurred as a result of natu-
ral selection, working with the materials at hand to refashion and
shorten the mammalian muzzle into a face.”—Owen Gingerich,
God’s Universe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2006),
pp. 98, 99. What important point has this Christian—fruitlessly
attempting to meld evolution with a Christian worldview—unfor-
tunately missed?


   No question, the created world reveals the love and power of the
Creator. But our world has also been devastated by sin, by the scars
and disruption caused by the great controversy. We see the horrible
results all around us in sickness, death, natural disasters, and the like.
No part of the earthly Creation has escaped, and certainly no human
being has. And yet, even amid this devastation, we can see the love
and power of the Creator. The key is to focus not on the bad but on the
good that underlies it. We might see, for example, a cherry tree smit-
ten with the blight that destroys all the fruit. The blight, however bad,
does not, and cannot, erase the love and goodness revealed in the tree
itself, a love and goodness that points to the character of the Creator.
                                                                       17

     The Cross and Creation
Read John 1:1–13. In what ways does John link Creation with the
     Cross? Why are the two teachings inseparable?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        In numerous places the Bible clearly links the Lord as Creator with
     the Lord as Redeemer, a link that provides more evidence that evolu-
     tion cannot be reconciled with the Bible, especially with the teaching
     of the Cross. Otherwise, what? The Lord would have incarnated into
     an evolved ape created through the vicious and painfully murder-
     ous cycle of natural selection, all in order to abolish death, “the last
     enemy” (1 Cor. 15:26)? But how can death be the “enemy” if it was
     one of God’s chosen means for creating humans, at least according to
     the evolutionary model? The Lord must have expended plenty of dead
     Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, and Homo neanderthalensis in
     order to finally get His own image (Homo sapiens). What this would
     mean, then, is that Jesus came to save humankind from the very pro-
     cess He, as Creator, used to create it in the first place. If that sounds
     ridiculous, it’s because it is.

Read Romans 5:12. How does this text help us to understand how
     crucial a literal reading of the Genesis Creation account is to the
     whole plan of salvation?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        How is the idea of the Fall, so clearly biblical, explained by those
     who seek to meld evolution with the Bible? Does God use processes
     of violence, selfishness, and dominance of the strong against the
     weak in order to create a morally flawless and selfless being who
     then “falls” into a state of violence, selfishness, and dominance of the
     strong over the weak—a state from which he has to be redeemed—or
     else face final punishment?
        Again, the absurdity of the position utterly rules it out. The only
     way to make sense of the Cross, of the need for the Savior to redeem a
     fallen race, is for human beings to have “fallen” from something, and
     a “fall” implies a descent, a degeneration; it means that we went from
     that which was good to something that wasn’t as good. That makes
     perfect sense from a literal understanding of Genesis; with evolution,
     it makes no sense at all. Indeed, the idea of evolution makes a mock-
     ery of both the Fall and the Cross.

     Creation and Re-creation
What wonderful promises are found in these texts? Isa. 65:17, Isa.
     66:22, 2 Pet. 3:13, Rev. 21:4. Also, how are these promises linked
     with the biblical model of Creation, as revealed in the opening
     chapters of Genesis?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The whole Christian hope rests on the promises of a new heaven
     and a new earth, a heaven and earth without the devastation that sin
     has brought to the one we inhabit now. Without that hope, that prom-
     ise, we have, literally, no hope at all. The promise of eternal life is
     wonderful, but we want that eternal life in a world without the horrors,
     sorrows, and disappointments of this one. What could be worse than
     the eternal death that awaits the unsaved except eternal life in a world
     in which misery is often the rule, rather than the exception?
        All of which leads to some very interesting questions in regard to our
     origins and how the Lord worked in the process of the first Creation—
     the one depicted so masterfully in Genesis 1 and 2. The question is,
     will the new heaven and the new earth be created by divine fiat? That
     is, as depicted in a literal reading of Genesis: God speaks and within an
     amazingly short time all life exists on the earth fully formed and devel-
     oped, with nothing left to caprice, violence, or chance?
        Or, instead, will the process of creation mean that life will, again,
     have to endure the “joys” and rigors of natural selection and survival-
     of-the-fittest for billions of years until a new world, one “wherein
     dwelleth righteousness” (2 Pet. 3:13), finally appears?
        After all, if God chose to use evolution the first time around to cre-
     ate this world, why would He do something different the second time?
     If these were His chosen means in the original Creation, are they not
     good enough for round two?
        The absurdity of the idea that God would use evolution to re-create
     the heavens and the earth is more evidence pointing to the absurdity of
     His having created the world that way to begin with. No question, the
     Cross, Redemption, and the promise of a new heaven and a new earth
     are themes inseparably tied in with the literal Genesis account.

      Try to imagine what our world was like in its pristine beauty.
      Imagine, too, what it will be like when it is created over. Our
      minds and hearts can only begin to wrap around what that will
      be like. Why is nothing in this world worth having if we lose out
      on what is promised us?
                                                                          19

    Further Study: Throughout all her ministry, Ellen G. White was un-
         compromising in her rejection of the theory of evolution.
           “It is,” she wrote, “the worst kind of infidelity; for with many who
         profess to believe the record of creation, it is infidelity in disguise.”
         —The Signs of the Times, March 20, 1879.
           “[S]hall we, for the privilege of tracing our descent from germs and
         mollusks and apes, consent to cast away that statement of Holy Writ,
         so grand in its simplicity, ‘God created man in His own image, in the
         image of God created He him’? Genesis 1:27.”—Education, p. 130.
           “When the Lord declares that He made the world in six days and
1
         rested on the seventh day, He means the day of twenty-four hours,
         which He has marked off by the rising and setting of the sun.”
         —Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 136.

    Discussion Questions:
2         l1 Another problem stemming from the attempt to meld evolu-
          tion with the Bible is the resurrection of the dead at the end
          of time. Isn’t that going to be an instantaneous process, in the
          “twinkling of an eye” (1 Cor. 15:52) even? Some folk have been
          dead for thousands of years; there’s not much left to work with.
          Yet, if God can re-create them in an instant, why did He use
          evolution to create them the first time around?

3         l
          2 Contrary to popular conceptions, Charles Darwin worked on his
          theory of evolution from a theological premise. He expressed it like
          this: “There seems to me,” wrote Darwin, “too much misery in the
          world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent
          God would have designedly created the [parasitic wasp] with the
          express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of cater-
          pillars, or that the cat should play with mice.” Of course a “benefi-
          cent and omnipotent God” did no such thing. What’s wrong with
          Darwin’s assumption, and how do you think it influenced him in his
          development of such a radically wrong theory on human origins?

          l3 As a class, spend some time in nature and marvel at the vari-
          ous wonders of the created world. As you do so, keep open to the
          damage that sin has brought, and see how much you can distin-
          guish between the creation and what sin has done to the creation.
          Why is it always important to keep this distinction in mind?

    Summary: Despite many attempts to mix a biblical worldview with
         the doctrine of evolution, the two teachings are polar opposites.
         Christians must stand firm on the literal Creation story; once that
         goes, the plan of salvation goes with it.

Power of Prayer
by Irina Mezeuan
   Irina is a teenager who lives with her family in the Republic of Georgia. As
a child, she suffered from a painful spinal tumor, and doctors gave her only
four years to live. Her mother, desperate for help, met a woman who was
lending books in the marketplace. Irina’s mother chose several books that
offered hope and took them home to read as she sat by Irina’s bedside.
   When her mother returned the books, she thanked the woman for sharing
them. The woman invited Irina’s mother to visit the Seventh-day Adventist
church and to bring Irina. “We will fast and pray for her,” she promised,
smiling. Irina’s mother took her to the church the following Sabbath, and the
woman and her friends fasted and prayed for her.
   When Irina’s mother took her back to the hospital for a checkup, her doc-
tors were amazed to find that the tumor was shrinking. They removed the
tumor, and Irina’s pain disappeared.
   Irina’s mother continued attending the Seventh-day Adventist church and
took both Irina and her sister, Yana, with her. The girls learned the importance
of prayer and began praying for others, just as Irina had been prayed for.
   When the girls visited a certain store, they often sought out Lisa, a woman
who sold bread there. They invited her to church, but Lisa refused to go. The
girls weren’t discouraged; they continued praying for their friend, even after
she stopped working at the store.
   One day Irina and Yana’s mother met Lisa on the subway and told the
woman that her daughters were praying for her. She shared words of hope
with Lisa and invited her to church. This time Lisa agreed to go.
   When Lisa arrived at church the next week, the sisters hugged her and sat
with her. “We wanted her to know we love her and that she is special to God,”
Irina says.
   Lisa continued attending church, even though she had to take several buses
to get there. Irina, Yana, and their mother continued praying for her. One
Sabbath the pastor invited those who wanted to accept Jesus to stand. The
sisters prayed silently that Lisa would make her decision for Christ and were
thrilled when Lisa stood up.
   “We felt that God had answered our prayers for Lisa,” Irina said. Lisa was
baptized along with three friends for whom they also had been praying. The
girls are praying for their father. “He’s started reading the Bible,” Irina says.
“We know that God is working on his heart in answer to our prayers.”
   Sharing our faith through witnessing and prayer and giving a generous mis-
sion offering are the three most powerful ways to bring others to Christ.

      God as Redeemer
        		




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 1:18, Gen. 3:15,
      Rom. 16:20, 1 Pet. 1:19, Mark 10:32–45, Matt. 27:46.

Memory Text: “ ‘Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive
      power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honor and glory
      and blessing!’ ” (Revelation 5:12, NKJV).

Key Thought: The Triune God is our Creator and Redeemer.


      C
              losely related to God as Creator is His role as our Redeemer.
              Sin is so bad, so hostile to the created world, that only the
              Creator Himself could solve the problem.
        “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been
      brought near by the blood of Christ” (Eph. 2:13, NKJV). It is not
      through works, nor through anything we could ever do, but it is through
      His grace, manifest at the Cross that we as sinners can be redeemed by
      the Lord and be “brought near” to Him. Christ bore God’s wrath so that
      none of us would ever, ideally, have 10.
        Paul also tells the church in Corinth that “the message of the cross is
      foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is
      the power of God” (1 Cor. 1:18, NKJV). The scandal of the Cross is that it
      appears so absurd: God, the infinite, holy Creator, becomes a sacrifice for
      the sake of twisted human souls, even His avowed enemies, taking upon
      Himself the penalty for their sins so that they wouldn’t have to face that
      penalty themselves! The atonement is so deep, so heavy, so profound,
      that we grasp only what we can. Beyond that, thinking stops, and all we
      can do is worship.

     At the Cross
       “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we
     were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8). What is this text
     saying to us?

        At the cross, in the most humiliating, inconceivable manner imagin-
     able, God triumphs over and shames the enemy. Love, justice, and com-
     passion fuse in a singular dynamic act. God forgives sinners by paying
     in Himself the price of sin and absorbing into His own suffering Self
     the penalty of that sin. On Calvary, God reveals how extremely costly
     forgiveness is.
        Christ didn’t die in order to create love in God’s heart for us. No, Jesus
     insists that the Father’s love is the source, not the consequence, of the
     atonement (John 3:16, 17). God doesn’t love us because Christ died for
     us; Christ died for us because God loved us. The atonement of Christ
     was not offered to persuade the Father to love those whom He otherwise
     hated. The death of Christ did not bring forth a love that was not already
     in existence. Rather, it was a manifestation of the love that was eternally
     in God’s heart. Jesus never had to persuade the Father to love us. Notice
     how He insists on this truth in John 3:16, 17; 16:26, 27.
        The real tragedy is that we have lost much of the knowledge of God,
     against whom we have sinned. We do not even feel that we have much
     to repent of, because we’re not always sure about just how much we
     have offended God with our sins. We can become dull to just how bad
     sin really is. Modern religious sentimentality often minimizes repugnance
     toward sin. And because sin doesn’t make us angry anymore, perhaps it
     becomes harder to realize that sin arouses the wrath of a Holy God.

Paul is not afraid to discuss the wrath of God. How does he express
     it in Romans 1:18?

        This strong statement sets the tone for the lengthy treatment of the
     universal sway of sin on which Paul continues to elaborate for the
     next two chapters (through Romans 3:20).
        An astounding aspect of the gospel is the fact that God is both the
     victor over our sin and the victim of it. And, as a result of this dual
     role, our holy God can keep His covenant with sinful covenant break-
     ers. God’s love does not lead to a bland tolerance of sin and evil but
     to a triumphant victory over it. It is precisely because God is love that
     He opposes sin and evil, for these realities corrupt and destroy His
     beloved children. The death that God endured on the cross is the price
     His love pays for taking sin seriously while still loving sinners.

      How seriously do you take the sin in your life? And what crite-
      ria do you use to justify your answer?
                                                                              23

      The Gospel in the Old Testament
When is the first promise of salvation given, and what does it mean?
      Gen. 3:15.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The language here is striking. Adam and Eve have sinned. Now the
      great controversy is announced to them through the strong language
      of “enmity” between two opposing sides. This is a precious promise
      for human hearts now attracted to sin. We are also assured that this
      major conflict will not be eternal, for the head of the enemy will one
      day be crushed. In these verses, not only is the great controversy first
      revealed, but we also are told how it is going to end.

Paul took courage from Genesis 3:15. How does he express it in
      Romans 16:20? What point is he making?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        In Genesis 22:1–19, Moses also narrates an amazingly graphic
      atonement picture. What can we learn about the future atonement of
      Christ from this narrative?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Note the many mentions of “father and son” and how the two go
      to the mountain of sacrifice together. The son carries the wood and
      the father the instruments of sacrifice (fire and knife). Isaac, much
      younger than his father, could have overpowered Abraham on the
      mountain of sacrifice. But, instead, we see two miracles: the father
      yielding his son, and the son yielding his life.
         What a powerful representation of the sacrificial death of Christ on
      our behalf. The scene, however powerful and moving, was only a tiny
      foretaste of the time when—centuries later—another Father would offer
      His Son. This time, however, there would be no animal to die instead of
      the son. The Son Himself would die on the altar. The Father would truly
      give up His Son, and the Son would give His life.
         There, on Mount Moriah, the world has been presented a very power-
      ful picture (but still only a picture) of the plan of salvation and what
      it cost to redeem fallen humanity from the ruin of sin.

     Salvation in Isaiah
On the famous road to Emmaus, Jesus taught the two despairing dis-
     ciples about the atonement from “Moses and all the prophets”
     (Luke 24:27). What prophetic materials might Jesus have included
     in His study of the atonement?

      It’s very likely that Isaiah was among the prophets to whom Jesus
     would have referred.

Read Isaiah 53, which describes the “Suffering Servant.” Describe
     the details included there that help you to more fully grasp the
     amazing atonement of Christ.

     _______________________________________________________

        Although so much exists in this chapter, one point stands out more than
     anything else, and that is the substitutionary role of the Suffering Servant.
     Notice all the times that He is paying the price for the sins of others.
     Again and again this theme appears, and what it teaches is that at the heart
     of salvation, of atonement, is the death of Jesus on our behalf. As sinners
     who have violated God’s law, we can do nothing to make ourselves right
     with God. All of our good works cannot bridge the gap between us and
     God. The only way to save us was for Jesus to pay the penalty in our stead
     and then offer us His perfect righteousness, which we claim by faith.
        Had our works been able to make us right with God in any way,
     then Jesus would not have had to die for us. The fact that He did,
     that it took nothing less than His death in order to make atonement,
     should be all the proof we need that we cannot earn our salvation. It
     is, instead, wholly a gift of grace.

Read 1 Peter 1:19, 2:21–25. How does Peter draw on Isaiah 53 in his
     explanation of Christ’s atoning death on our behalf?

     _______________________________________________________

        Isaiah 53 presents what’s perhaps the clearest theological explana-
     tion of the Cross, showing unequivocally that, whatever else the Cross
     represents, it represents Christ dying on our behalf, bearing in Himself
     the punishment that we deserve.

      Using Isaiah 53 as your text, think about the final scenes of
      Christ’s life. As you do, keep in mind that the person depicted
      there is our God, our Creator, one part of the Godhead Himself.
      How do we get our minds around this amazing truth?

                                                                              25

     The Gospels and the Cross
       The astounding miracle of Christ’s incarnation, His profound
     teaching, and the miracles He performed, are not the central focus
     of Christ’s life. Instead, what dominates the thinking of Jesus is the
     giving of His life. As miraculous as His birth and ministry were, the
     great mission of Christ’s life was His death.
       In the four Gospels, we find Jesus endeavoring to prepare His disci-
     ples for His coming death. However, their devotion to Jesus, coupled
     with their hope for a political Messiah, prevents them from grasping
     what Jesus is telling them.

Read Mark 10:32–45. How did Jesus describe His coming execu-
     tion? (vss. 33, 34). What was wrong with the request of James
     and John? (vss. 35–37). What was Jesus’ pointed response? (vss.
     42–45).

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The evening before He died, Jesus celebrated a Passover meal
     with His disciples. He then gave instructions that this event should
     be observed until He returned again. This ordinance of Communion,
     instituted by the Lord Himself—and the only commemorative act He
     personally authorized—is not a memorial of His incarnation, nor His
     miracles, nor His parables, nor His preaching, but only of His death.
     Christ Himself wished above all else to be remembered by His death.
        In fact, in the four Gospel accounts of the Messiah’s life, the events
     surrounding and including the crucifixion carry the major empha-
     sis. The staggering miracle of the Incarnation is mentioned only by
     Matthew and Luke. Only two chapters in each of their Gospels record
     Christ’s conception and birth. Mark and John omit any comment on
     Christ’s birth at all and begin their Gospels with Jesus as an adult.
        All four Gospel writers, however, determinedly emphasize the last
     week of Christ’s life and, of course, His death. Glance through them
     and notice this pointed focus on just a few days of Christ’s life. The
     last week of Jesus’ life, leading up to and including His death, takes up
     from one-third to almost one-half of all gospel accounts. Each reader
     is “forced” to rivet attention on the great redeeming act of God.

      Look at your life, your past, your mistakes, your sins. Do you
      honestly think anything you have done, or could do, could ever
      atone for them? Why, then, should the death of Jesus on your
      behalf be the central focus of your life? What hope would you
      have without it?

     The Cry on the Cross
       Nothing is more destructive to our grasp of the atonement of Christ
     than the sentimentality that sometimes passes for Christianity in our
     day (all in the attempt to make the gospel conform to modern think-
     ing). However, we must ever humbly acknowledge that anything we
     say about God can never do God justice, especially when we consider
     the atonement. We must avoid the temptation to reduce Jesus’ death
     on the cross to merely an “example of selfless love.” It was certainly
     that, but considering our situation as sinners, it would take more than
     “an example of selfless love” to redeem us. It would take, instead, our
     God bearing in Himself the full brunt of His own wrath against sin.

On the cross, Jesus cried out, “ ‘My God, My God, why have You
     forsaken Me?’ ” (Matt. 27:46, NKJV). How are we to understand
     this? What was Jesus saying, why, and how does this amazing cry
     help us understand what it cost to save us from sin?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        “And now the Lord of Glory was dying, a ransom for the race. . . .
     Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the iniquity of us
     all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from the
     condemnation of the law. . . . The Saviour could not see through the
     portals of the tomb. . . . He feared that sin was so offensive to God that
     Their separation was to be eternal. . . . It was the sense of sin, bringing
     the Father’s wrath upon Him as man’s substitute, that made the cup
     He drank so bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of God.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 752, 753.
        Jesus addresses this prayer to “God,” instead of to the “Father” as
     He always had done. Christ’s cries from the cross are not some exem-
     plary display that He appears to go through in order to demonstrate
     that He loves us. No, this is God giving Himself over to death so that
     our destiny would not be determined by death. This is God Himself
     dying the death from which we can be spared, the death that sin would
     otherwise bring us all.
        Three Gospels record that Jesus cried out with a loud voice from
     the cross as He was dying. These loud cries are even mentioned in
     the book of Hebrews: “who, in the days of His flesh, when He had
     offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to
     Him who was able to save Him from death” (Heb. 5:7, NKJV). Jesus’
     “cry of dereliction” is the most piercing cry in the Bible. There is no
     statement in all the Gospels to rival this one from Jesus on the cross,
     and in that cry we get a glimpse of what the Lord Himself was willing
     to go through in order to bring us salvation.
                                                                            27

    Further Study: “Oh, how inefficient, how incapable I am of express-
         ing the things which burn in my soul in reference to the mission of
         Christ! . . . I know not how to speak or trace with pen the large subject
         of the atoning sacrifice. I know not how to present subjects in the liv-
         ing power in which they stand before me. I tremble for fear lest I shall
         belittle the great plan of salvation by cheap words.”—Ellen G. White,
         Selected Messages, book 3, p. 115.
            “The infinite mercy and love of Jesus, the sacrifice made in our
         behalf, call for the most serious and solemn reflection. We should dwell
         upon the character of our dear Redeemer and Intercessor. . . . As we
1        thus contemplate heavenly themes, our faith and love will grow stron-
         ger, and our prayers will be more and more acceptable to God, because
         they will be more and more mixed with faith and love. They will be
         intelligent and fervent. There will be more constant confidence in Jesus,
         and a daily, living experience in His power to save to the uttermost all
         that come unto God by Him.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 89.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 In Scripture, God is portrayed both as a great Lover of sin-
          ners as well as extremely wrathful against sin. Some Christians
          try to pick one or the other as representing God’s nature. Why
          is that unnecessary? In fact, why is God’s love for sinners one of
          the main reasons why He is wrathful against sin?
3         l
          2 God’s love is not like the feeble and sometimes irregular
          affection that we bestow on one another. What does Christ’s act
          as Savior teach us about divine love?

          l
          3 How does your understanding of God’s holiness, in contrast
          to your sinfulness, help you to understand better why salvation
          cost so much?

          l
          4 Dwell more on the story of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22.
          In what other ways does it help us to understand the nature of
          Christ’s sacrifice on our behalf? At the same time, in what ways
          does it barely do justice to what it was intended to symbolize?

    Summary: From the earliest pages of Genesis, the Bible points us to
         the death of Christ on the cross, where He would die a sinner’s death
         in order to redeem us, as sinners, from the eternal destruction that
         sin brings. Though the Bible uses different symbols and metaphors
         to explain Christ’s death, at the center of it all is His substitution, so
         graphically expressed in Isaiah 53. If we ever needed proof that works
         can’t save us, we have it with the death of God Himself on the cross.
         After all, what could fallen beings ever add to that?

Hope and a Future
by Alexander Grinev
         I was a typical Soviet youth—ambitious and skeptical. When the
      Soviet Union broke up, I opened my own business.
         One day Natasha, my wife, met a woman who invited us to evan-
      gelistic meetings sponsored by Seventh-day Adventists. I had heard of
      Adventists and believed that they were honest people. So when Natasha
      came home from the first meeting, excited about what she heard, I
      agreed to go to the meetings with her.
         As I listened to the speaker, my youthful skepticism melted away,
      and we accepted the truths we were learning. We made a commitment
      to God, and He delivered me from my bad habits. We were so happy!
         When Communism failed in Russia, the Mafia stepped in and threat-
      ened small business owners, including me. I realized that we had to
      leave Russia, but where could we go? In answer to our prayers, a pastor-
      friend invited us to go to New Zealand. I knew a lot about this small
      island nation from my years in the Russian military. We sold everything
      and moved to New Zealand.
         We found a Seventh-day Adventist church in Christchurch and were
      welcomed into the church family. As we learned of other Russians
      moving to Christchurch, we invited them to church. Our Russian-
      speaking company meets in the English church. We’re continuing to
      grow as we invite other Russian-speaking immigrants to worship with
      us. We share our faith with those we meet and make friends for God
      among newcomers to this country.
         We hold small-group meetings, women’s meetings, and Bible-study
      groups. We now have a growing—congregation with a part-time
      Russian-speaking pastor who has helped to build this congregation. We
      have discovered that about 4,000 Russian and Slavic-speaking people
      live in our area of New Zealand.
         Our mother church supports us, and its members are happy to see
      our congregation growing. We’re all very excited about the potential to
      reach others in the community who need to know Christ as a personal
      Friend and Savior. Some of our friends have been baptized, and we’re
      looking for more who want to know Christ.
         I’m amazed at how God has led us. We’re happy to be living in His
      will and working for Him in our adopted homeland.
         Our Russian church plant is sponsored in part through Global
      Mission. Thank you for sharing God’s love so that other Russians in
      New Zealand will know how much Jesus loves them.

Alexander Grinev shares his faith in Christchurch, New Zealand.

      The God of Grace and
      Judgment
        		




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Cor. 3:13; 2 Cor. 5:10;
      Genesis 3; Genesis 6; John 3:17–21; Rev. 14:6, 7.

Memory Text: “For God shall bring every work into judgment,
      with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil”
      (Ecclesiastes 12:14).

Key Thought: God’s judgment is as pervasive in the Bible as is the
      theme of salvation; in fact, the two teachings are intricately entwined.



      A
               soldier stood next to an old man about to be executed. He was
               guilty of being the “wrong” race and religion, nothing more.
               As the soldier raised his gun, his victim said, “Do you know
      that there is a God in heaven who sees all this, and who will one day
      judge you for your actions?”
         The soldier then shot the old man dead.
         This is, in many ways, a prime example of a secular society. Not a
      secular government (a government that does not promote one religion
      over another), but a secular society—one in which there is no higher
      standard than the rules of the society itself. It’s a society with no sense
      of transcendence, no sense of a higher authority, no sense of God or
      of a moral standard greater than anything human. It’s a society where
      humans take the place of God, a society where the only judgment
      one faces is the judgment of one’s peers or of one’s own conscience
      (whatever’s left of it, anyway).
         According to the Bible, however, the old man was right: there is a
      God in heaven, and He knows all things and He, indeed, will bring
      everything into judgment.

     Judgment Day
       The theme of divine judgment runs through the entire Bible.
     Contrary to common beliefs, judgment is not contrary to salvation
     or to the gospel. Both themes are woven together in Scripture from
     Genesis through Revelation.
       And no wonder. Judgment and salvation reflect twin aspects of
     God’s character: His justice and grace. Thus, we should not pit the
     idea of judgment against the idea of salvation any more than we
     should pit the idea of God’s justice against His grace. To do so is
     to rob both of their fullness and mutual complementarity. Scripture
     teaches both; hence, we need to understand both.
       What is interesting is that the New Testament talks more about
     judgment than does the Old Testament.

Read the following verses. What are they about? Who is judged?
     What happens in these judgments? What do these texts reveal
     about the nature and reality of divine judgment?

     Eccles. 12:13, 14_________________________________________

     1 Cor. 3:13______________________________________________

     2 Cor. 5:10______________________________________________

     Heb. 10:30______________________________________________

     Matt. 16:27______________________________________________

     Rev. 20:12_______________________________________________

     Rev. 22:12_______________________________________________

     Matt. 12:36, 37___________________________________________

     1 Pet. 4:17_______________________________________________

     Rev. 14:6, 7______________________________________________

        These are a sample of the texts that clearly teach judgment. Many of
     the most explicit judgment texts, texts that clearly reveal the reality of
     divine judgment, or judgments, appear in the New Testament. This fact
     works against the notion that judgment is contrary to the new-covenant
     concept of God’s grace, which is also taught in the New Testament.
     What this should teach us is that, however we understand judgment,
     and however we understand grace, we must understand them as divine
     truths that work together. To pit one against the other is to misunder-
     stand the fullness of the gospel, which we looked at last week.
                                                                            31

      Judgment and Grace in Eden
        Think about this: before sin, there was no need of grace because
      there was nothing to forgive, nothing to pardon, nothing to cover. It’s
      the same with judgment. Before sin, there was nothing to judge, noth-
      ing to condemn, nothing to be punished. Both grace and judgment
      arise, at least in a human context, only because of humanity’s sin.

Read Genesis 3, the account of the Fall. In what ways are the themes
      of judgment and grace revealed?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Satan succeeded in bringing sin into the world, changing everything as
      a result. Immediately, though, the Lord entered, calling out, “Where
      are you?” This question doesn’t have to be seen as condemnatory;
      it was more an invitation to come to Him, the One who created and
      loved them. It was a call to turn away from their deceiver and to return
      to their Maker.
         Notice, too, what happens. The first few lines from the mouth of
      God in this fallen world are questions (see Gen. 3:9, 11, 13). Then the
      first thing God says after He’s finished questioning is to declare His
      judgment against the serpent. But next, in verse 15, even amid His
      judgment against the serpent, what does God say?
         Verse 15 is the first gospel promise. As soon as He declares His
      judgment against the serpent, He then immediately gives the first
      message of grace, of redemption, of salvation for humanity. And only
      then, only after that gospel promise, does He start declaring His judg-
      ments against the woman and the man. Although they fell, the first
      things God gives them are hope and grace—the grace that forms the
      background against which judgment is to unfold. Thus, even before
      judgment, the promise of grace is given for those who will accept it.
         It’s too late for Satan; his destruction is assured. But there, even
      amid the judgments passed on to the man and the woman, God makes
      His grace known.
         At the beginning of fallen human history, a relationship between
      sin, judgment, and God’s grace emerges. Although God must judge
      and condemn sin, the promise of grace is always there, always pres-
      ent, always available for those who will claim it for themselves.

       In what ways might the Lord be saying to you, “Where are you?”
       What are you doing that, perhaps, is causing you to hide from
       Him? Why is understanding grace a crucial first step in heeding
       His call to draw near to Him and away from the deceiver?

      The Flood
        Critics of the Bible make a big deal of the fact that other ancient
      civilizations had their own flood stories. They argue that the Bible
      story isn’t unique, original, or even true, but that it is merely a copy
      of some previous myth or legend.
        On the other hand, those who believe that the Bible is the Word of
      God see these stories as a confirmation of the reality of the Flood. The
      Flood happened, and Genesis gives the inspired account of it. This
      account stands in contrast to the other versions, such as the one that
      says the Flood was sent because humans in their nightly feasting made
      too much noise and disturbed the gods’ sleep. The gods, cranky from
      lack of rest, sent the flood to punish them.

What reason does the biblical account of the Flood give for the judg-
      ment that was to come upon the earth? Gen. 6:5.
        								
      _______________________________________________________

         The idea of humans being so evil that they deserved death and destruc-
      tion shouldn’t be that hard to fathom for us today, living as we do in a
      world where evil just gets worse and worse. The Christian view of human
      sinfulness, although often derided, is constantly being verified. That we
      are capable of good deeds doesn’t make us good. After all, American
      mobster Al Capone loved children, was generous to a fault, and treated
      his friends kindly. Who, though, would call him a good man?

Even amid the impending promise of retributive judgment, how is God’s
      grace revealed in the Flood account? (See Gen. 6:14–22, 2 Pet. 2:5.)

      _______________________________________________________

        By building the ark, Noah was giving the world a warning about
      judgment. What’s implied, too, is that there was a grace period, a
      chance for the world to turn from its evil ways and accept God’s sal-
      vation. Ellen G. White wrote that had “the antediluvians believed the
      warning, and repented of their evil deeds, the Lord would have turned
      aside His wrath.”—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 97. The building of
      the ark offered anyone who would heed the warning a refuge of safety
      from the coming destruction. No question, judgment was coming. But
      grace was offered to all who would accept it until it was too late, and
      the door of mercy was shut.

       How often has God revealed His grace to you? More times than
       you can count, probably. How can you learn to better surrender
       to that grace and let it mold you into the image of Christ?
                                                                           33

     Condemnation and Grace
       Most everyone is familiar with John 3:16. What comes afterward,
     however, helps flesh it out and explain it even better.

Read John 3:17–21. What does it say about judgment? About grace?
     In what way do these verses reveal to us the way in which grace
     and judgment work together?

     _______________________________________________________

       The word translated as “condemn” in verse 17 is also translated in
     some versions as “judge.” Clearly, though, the context is that of con-
     demnation, because God has made it clear in numerous other places
     that the world will be judged.
       Two themes appear in these texts, grace and judgment, and they are
     radically intertwined. Sin and darkness and evil have brought the need
     for a God of justice to judge and condemn these things. At the same
     time, God’s grace offers a way out to those who are guilty, and that
     comes by faith in Jesus Christ.
       He who believes in Jesus is not condemned. That’s what the texts
     say. It’s that simple. Christ’s righteousness covers that person, and
     that person stands without condemnation, now and in the judgment.

What reason do the texts give for condemnation?

     _______________________________________________________

        According to these texts, the default state of humanity is that of
     condemnation. That’s because all have sinned and all deserve the
     death that sin brings. These texts clearly debunk the notion that, after
     the Cross, all humanity is automatically justified. Instead, after the
     Cross, the whole condemned world is now offered salvation through
     the atoning death of Jesus Christ, which is sufficient for every human
     being. Everyone stands condemned; everyone, though, who, through
     the grace of Christ, accepts the provision offered, stands pardoned,
     justified, and redeemed through Jesus. The condemnation that is
     theirs is, through the merits of Jesus, canceled, and they stand in His
     perfect righteousness.
        In fact, what does grace mean apart from the prospect of condemna-
     tion? Just as the idea of condemnation implies judgment, so does the
     idea of grace. Were there no potential for judgment (and condemna-
     tion), there would be no need for grace. The notion of grace itself all
     but demands the notion of condemnation. Hence, more reason to see
     how grace and judgment are linked.

     The Hour of His Judgment
       “Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall
     not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known” (Matt. 10:26).

        Looking around at the world, we shouldn’t have a problem under-
     standing the idea of judgment and condemnation. One doesn’t have to
     be a believing Christian to realize that something is radically wrong
     with humanity. Who can’t see what a royal mess, even disaster, we’ve
     made of things? Maybe we cry so hard at birth because, instinctively,
     we know what’s coming. “I cried when I was born and every day shows
     why,” a poet wrote. Who can’t relate? Who hasn’t been the victim of
     just how greedy, selfish, and mean people can be? Or who hasn’t at
     some point been the greedy, selfish, and mean one?
        Thus, if God is just, and if justice was His only major attribute, who
     among us would stand before Him? If the Lord knows even our secret
     things, our secret deeds (Eccles. 12:14) (not to mention what we have
     done in public), what chance would even the godliest among us have
     on the day of judgment, when all these things will be revealed?
        Fortunately, though, our God is also a God of grace. The whole
     plan of salvation was established so that every human being could,
     ideally, be spared the condemnation that God’s justice would demand.
     Without grace, we’d all be consumed by God’s justice. Our only
     hope, then, standing before a just God, is grace.

Read the first angel’s message in Revelation 14:6, 7. How do these
     verses reveal the link between God’s justice and His grace? How
     do they also parallel what we saw in Genesis 3 regarding the rela-
     tionship between grace and judgment?

     _______________________________________________________

        How interesting that before the warning that the “ ‘hour of His judg-
     ment has come’ ” (NKJV), the angel is proclaiming the “everlasting
     gospel.” It has to be that way, otherwise the judgment would condemn
     all humanity. No one would have a chance because all have sinned,
     all have violated God’s law. Here, among the last warning message
     to the world, God’s grace is proclaimed. Otherwise, judgment would
     condemn everyone, without exception. Without grace, what message
     would we have for the world other than that God is going to destroy us
     all and there’s no hope of escape? Fortunately, the message we have
     has the “everlasting gospel” as its foundation.

      What role are you playing in helping to spread this message of
      judgment and grace to others? What more could you do to help
      spread it because, most likely, you could be doing more, right?
                                                                           35

    Further Study: How do grace and judgment work together? Here’s
         how inspiration reveals it:

            “While Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan
         accuses them before God as transgressors. The great deceiver has
         sought to lead them into skepticism, to cause them to lose confidence
         in God, to separate themselves from His love, and to break His law.
         Now he points to the record of their lives, to the defects of character,
         the unlikeness to Christ, which has dishonored their Redeemer, to all
         the sins that he has tempted them to commit, and because of these he
         claims them as his subjects.
1           “Jesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and
         faith, and, claiming for them forgiveness, He lifts His wounded hands
         before the Father and the holy angels, saying: I know them by name.
         I have graven them on the palms of my hands.”—Ellen G. White, The
         Great Controversy, p. 484.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 How does the above quote help you to understand the role of
          grace in the judgment? How does Ellen White describe God’s
          faithful people, and why is that important? How clearly do you
          see yourself described there?

          l
          2 Imagine standing before God with everything that you have

3         ever done, good and bad, exposed? How well would you fare?
          Would you be able to stand before God on the basis of your good
          deeds, even the ones done out of the sincerest and most honest of
          motives? Do you really think that they would be enough to com-
          mend you before your Maker? How does your answer help you
          understand the need of grace?

          l
          3 What’s the deadly spiritual trap of thinking that it doesn’t
          matter what we do because we’re saved by grace? How can you
          protect yourself against falling into that deception?

          l
          4 People sometimes warn us about “cheap grace.” Yet, there’s
          no such thing. Grace isn’t cheap—it’s free! What’s cheap is
          when people, in claiming that grace, try to use it as an excuse to
          sin. What examples of that deception can be seen in the Christian
          world? Or even in our own church?

    Summary: God is a God of justice, and justice demands judgment.
         God is also a God of grace. How crucial that we, as Seventh-day
         Adventist Christians proclaiming the three angels’ messages, under-
         stand both these divine truths and what they reveal to us about our
         God.

The Stolen Cow
by Jacque Thermil
  Roseline lives in a village in northwestern Haiti. She felt rich, for she
owned three cows. But she also felt grateful to God for her wealth and had
dedicated one of her cows to God. Now the cow was about to give birth,
and Roseline would give the calf to the Lord.
  One day after finishing her morning devotions, Roseline went to tend to
her cows. But her dedicated cow was missing. She walked up and down
the path, calling to the cow, but there was no response. She realized that
the cow hadn’t wandered off to find a lush stand of grass; it had been
stolen.
  Roseline started out to town to report the theft to the mayor’s office.
On the way she stopped at her pastor’s home and told him that her cow
had been stolen. “I’m not afraid,” she told the pastor, “because this cow
and its calf are dedicated to God. Nothing will happen to them that God
doesn’t wish. But I pray that the thief will bring the cow back because she
belongs to God.”
  The pastor smiled at Roseline’s faith and promised to pray for the cow
and its calf. Then Roseline continued on to the mayor’s office to report the
missing cow and to ask that if someone returned a cow to let her know,
for it was hers. Roseline never doubted that the cow would return home
before her calf was born.
  The next day Roseline again walked down the path to the pastor’s
house. “God’s cow has come home!” she said excitedly.
  “What happened?” the pastor asked, curious.
  “The thief himself brought back the cow,” Roseline responded. “He told
me that every time he looked at the cow he was troubled. He sensed that
there was something about this cow, and that made him uncomfortable,
but he didn’t know what it was. Finally, he couldn’t stand it any longer
and brought the cow back to me! He even apologized for taking her.”
Then Roseline hurried on to town to report to the mayor that God had sent
her cow home safely.
  Two months later, when the calf was born, Roseline gave it to God. She
cared for it until it was old enough to leave its mother, and then she sold
the calf and gave the money to the Investment offering.
  A portion of Investment offerings helps to start new work and supports
work in large cities around the world. Thank you for giving your mission
and Investment offerings.

      The Holiness of God




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 11:10; Mark 1:2; Gen.
      2:3; Job 42:5, 6; Luke 5:1–11; Luke 4:31–36; Isa. 6:1–3; Rev. 4:8, 9.

Memory Text: “Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy
      hill; for the Lord our God is holy” (Psalm 99:9).

Key Thought: Scripture gives much attention to God’s holiness.
      What does this holiness tell us about what God is like and what it
      means to the plan of salvation?



      O
              ne of the foundational assumptions of all biblical writers is
              that the God of heaven exists. God’s existence is just a given,
              like an axiom in geometry.
        Instead, we find within the 66 biblical books an extensive recount-
      ing of what God is like and how He relates to us as fallen beings
      whom He longs to redeem.
        This week’s lesson focuses on one aspect of God’s nature that’s
      foundational in Scripture: God’s holiness. God is love, Yes. And, Yes,
      God bids us call Him “Father.” And, Yes, God is patient, forgiving,
      and caring.
        But, according to Scripture, fundamental to our understanding of
      God is His holiness. Both in the Old and New Testaments, God’s
      holiness undergirds His revelation of Himself. This theme appears all
      through the Scriptures in one way or another.
        What, though, does it mean to say that God is holy? How does the
      Bible depict His holiness? And how do we, as unholy beings, relate
      to a God like this?

     “It Is Written”
        Even a superficial study of church history makes it clear that it’s
     all too easy to develop ideas about God and then to worship these
     ideas instead of God Himself, the God revealed in the Bible. As the
     skeptic Voltaire quipped, “God made man in His image, and man has
     returned the compliment.” We may not even realize that we have an
     incomplete, or even false, understanding of God.
        Thus, we must return to Scripture and compare our thinking about God
     with what is taught there. And this study must include both Testaments,
     for in both the Lord has spoken to us. This point is important because
     some have argued that the God revealed in the New Testament is differ-
     ent from the One revealed in the Old. That’s not a position accepted by
     Seventh-day Adventists, nor is it a position taught in the Bible.

What phrases punctuate the Old Testament prophets again and
     again? Jer. 7:1–3.

       The prophetic messages of the Old Testament are laced thousands
     of times with the phrase, “thus says the Lord,” or an equivalent. This
     should remind us that the prophet is not merely speaking for God but
     that God is speaking for Himself through the prophet.
       At the same time, the New Testament is filled with reference after
     reference to the Old Testament. In fact, the whole theology of the New
     Testament is intricately linked to the Old. How does one, for instance,
     make sense of the sacrifice of Jesus apart from the entire sacrificial
     system revealed in the Old Testament? How many times did Jesus,
     as well as the New Testament writers, refer to Old Testament pas-
     sages in order to buttress their arguments and points? The whole New
     Testament corpus finds its theological foundation in the Old. There’s
     no justification for any radical division between them. All Scripture—
     both Testaments—is inspired by the Lord (2 Tim. 3:16).

Look up the following texts. How do they help us to see the link
     between the New Testament and the Old? What do they tell us
     about how Jesus, as well as the New Testament writers, viewed
     the Old Testament? Matt. 4:4, 11:10; Mark 1:2; 7:6; John 12:14,
     15; Acts 13:33; Rom. 3:10; Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 1:16; 1 Cor. 5:7.
      								
      Mark Twain once said that it’s not the parts of the Bible that he
      doesn’t understand that bother him; it’s the parts that he does.
      Who doesn’t, at times, find sections of the Bible bothersome?
      Given what the Bible says about itself (2 Tim. 3:16), how should
      we respond to the parts we don’t understand, or maybe don’t
      even like? (See also 1 Cor. 13:12.)
                                                                        39

      To Be Set Apart
What is the first time the concept of “holiness” (from the same root
      often translated as “sanctified”) is mentioned in Scripture? Gen.
      2:3. How significant is the fact that the first thing deemed holy in
      the Bible is time?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         This text gives us our first understanding of holiness. It shows that
      something, in this case time, is “set apart” from that which is around
      it. The seventh day itself is no different from any other 24-hour,
      sunset-to-sunset period; what makes it different, “holy,” is that God
      declared it that way. He set it apart from the rest of the week.
         The Hebrew word there for “sanctified” means to “make holy” or to
      “declare holy.” Holiness then implies that something is special about
      whatever is “holy,” something that sets it apart from what isn’t holy.
         To some degree, then, this idea should help us to understand the
      holiness of God. God is set apart from anything else in creation. He
      is transcendentally separate, far above and beyond anything that we
      can truly grasp. To be holy is to be “other,” to be different in a special
      way, as with the seventh-day Sabbath.

How do these texts help us to understand the holiness of God in this
      context? Exod. 15:11, 1 Sam. 2:2, Pss. 86:8–10, 99:1–3, Isa. 40:25.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        This concept of holiness should help us better understand the gap
      between a God who is holy and a race of beings who aren’t—a race,
      in fact, of sinners. God is separate from us not only because He is the
      Creator and we are the created but because we are fallen beings. All this
      should, ideally, help us better understand what Christ has done for us.

       Although we are made in the image of God, what are the ways
       in which we differ radically from Him? How do these differ-
       ences help us to understand our need of a Savior? Make a list of
       those differences and bring them to class on Sabbath.

     To Repent in Dust and Ashes
After enduring inhuman suffering at the hand of Satan, Job cries
     out: “I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
     eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
     ashes” (Job 42:5, 6). What does this response tell us about God’s
     holiness in contrast to human sinfulness? How is the gospel being
     preached in Job’s reaction to what he experienced?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The prophet Ezekiel, whom God graciously sends to Israel (even
     though they are captive in Babylon as a result of their unfaithfulness),
     also experiences the awful presence of God. What happened? (Ezek.
     1:28).
        Jacob had to flee from home after deceiving his father, Isaac, and
     twin brother, Esau. What was Jacob’s response after his night vision of
     the ladder to heaven and of God speaking to him? (Gen. 28:16, 17).
        While Israel remained encamped at Sinai, the Lord again descended
     in the cloud on the mountain and proclaimed Himself to Moses. How
     did Moses react? (Exod. 34:8).
        Daniel, another prophet during the same Babylonian captivity of
     Israel, also received major visions from God while he served as a high
     government official.

Although repeatedly told that he is loved in heaven, how did
     Daniel react when given a vision of God? Why do you think he
     reacted as he did? Dan. 10:5–8.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Even though these men were faithful, godly, and righteous—they
     were prophets, even!—their reactions to the presence of God were
     fear, trembling, and worship. No doubt that was because, among
     other things, they understood their own unworthiness and sinfulness
     in contrast to the holiness of God. In their own way, these passages
     hint at the need of a Savior, a Substitute, Someone to bridge the gap
     between a Holy God and fallen sinful creatures like ourselves. Thanks
     to the Lord, we have that bridge in Jesus.

      Imagine yourself having a similar experience to one of these
      men mentioned above. How do you suppose you would react,
      and why?
                                                                         41

     Depart From Me!
       In the Old Testament, we find a consistent record of human
     responses to a God who is holy. What about in the New? Some mod-
     ern Christians argue that the Old Testament presents a primitive and
     outdated picture of God, a God who is harsh and very prone to anger.
     But when Jesus comes, He is now the God of grace and love. We
     know, of course, that this is a distorted view of the Bible and of the
     character of a God who does not change.

What do the New Testament writers teach us about God’s holiness?
     Read, for instance, Luke 5:1–11. How does this show the consistency
     between the Old and New Testaments regarding the holiness of God?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        After these men toiled unsuccessfully all night as fishermen, Jesus
     provided a miraculous catch of fish for His hard-working disciples.
     When this occurred, one would think a normal human response would be
     thankfulness to Jesus for such extraordinary financial assistance. Peter’s
     response, though, was focused on something else. His reaction was much
     like those of the Old Testament characters who encountered the Lord.
        “But Peter was unmindful now of boats or lading. This miracle,
     above any other he had ever witnessed, was to him a manifestation of
     divine power. In Jesus he saw One who held all nature under His con-
     trol. The presence of divinity revealed his own unholiness. Love for his
     Master, shame for his own unbelief, gratitude for the condescension of
     Christ, above all, the sense of his uncleanness in the presence of infinite
     purity, overwhelmed him. While his companions were securing the
     contents of the net, Peter fell at the Saviour’s feet, exclaiming, ‘Depart
     from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Desire
     of Ages, p. 246.
        Why this reaction? It’s because we’re not in the Garden of Eden
     anymore, where Adam and Eve—before their fall into sin—welcomed
     the presence of God in the cool of the evening. This close communion
     dramatically changed immediately after the Fall, when the couple
     ran and hid. Not much has changed since then. Indeed, this reaction
     remains the consistent picture throughout Scripture. Whenever a
     human being truly encounters the living God, there is the initial horror
     of finally seeing the true depth of one’s own sinfulness.

      When was the last time you got a really good look at your own
      sinful nature? A horrible sight, isn’t it? What’s your only hope,
      and why?

     When Demons Speak
Read Luke 4:31–36. What testimony is given here about the holiness
     of Christ? What is significant about who gave that testimony, too?
     What lessons can we draw from this story about God’s holiness?

     _______________________________________________________

        Demons, who are fallen angels, remember who Jesus really is, and
     even they—in their nastiness, hatefulness, and rebellion—are con-
     strained to acknowledge Him and that He is holy. Notice, too, that they
     feared that He was going to destroy them. Why so fearful? It must be
     that, so full of sin, even demons fear before the presence of God’s holi-
     ness, somewhat in the same manner that sinful humans do.
        In the last book of the Bible, John describes receiving a vision from
     God. Read Revelation 1:12–17. John, sometimes referred to as the apostle
     who had the greatest insight into the love of God, has the same response
     to his encounter with the Holy God as we saw in the Old Testament.
        Moreover, a vision of how celestial beings worship God in the
     heavenly sanctuary yields a similar picture to what Isaiah depicted
     centuries earlier in a vision (see Isa. 6:1–3).

What did John hear the heavenly beings around the throne saying?
     Rev. 4:8, 9.

     _______________________________________________________

        Although God is love and all heavenly beings adore Him, we can
     see that, around the heavenly throne of God, the worship anthem is
     not “God is love, love, love.” Nor do the heavenly beings cry out,
     “God is good, good, good.” Instead, day and night these mighty
     beings exclaim, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.” Although all
     heaven is involved in the ministry of God’s love and salvation to this
     world, heavenly beings around the throne of God day and night praise
     the holiness of God. As sinless beings, they are awed by His holiness,
     but they don’t hide in fear of it, as do fallen beings.
        In all of the human encounters of the divine as depicted in Scripture,
     one never finds a suggestion that God is frightening. What we see
     instead is that, in the piercing light of His holiness, human beings
     finally see themselves for who they really are. And that is scary. In
     Scripture, when people truly encounter the God of heaven, we find no
     hand clapping, backslapping, and lighthearted singing. Rather, there
     is abject personal repentance. All see and admit their personal guilt
     without any excuses and without reference to the faults of anyone
     else. How different our words, our lives, and our actions would be
     were we all to live with the constant sense not only of God’s presence
     but of His holiness, as well.
                                                                           43

    Further Study: As Christ stands before the trafficking crowd in the
         temple, “the confusion is hushed. The sound of traffic and bargaining
         has ceased. The silence becomes painful. A sense of awe overpowers
         the assembly. It is as if they were arraigned before the tribunal of God
         to answer for their deeds. Looking upon Christ, they behold divinity
         flash through the garb of humanity. The Majesty of heaven stands as
         the Judge will stand at the last day . . . with the same power to read the
1
         soul. His eye sweeps over the multitude, taking in every individual.
         His form seems to rise above them in commanding dignity, and a
         divine light illuminates His countenance. He speaks, and His clear,
         ringing voice—the same that upon Mount Sinai proclaimed the law
         that priests and rulers are transgressing—is heard echoing through the
         arches of the temple: ‘Take these things hence; make not My Father’s
2
         house an house of merchandise.’
            “Slowly descending the steps, and raising the scourge of cords gath-
         ered up on entering the enclosure, He bids the bargaining company
         depart from the precincts of the temple. With a zeal and severity He
         has never before manifested, He overthrows the tables of the money-
         changers. . . . None presume to question His authority. . . . Jesus does not
         smite them with the whip of cords, but in His hand that simple scourge
         seems terrible as a flaming sword. Officers of the temple, speculating
3
         priests, brokers and cattle traders, with their sheep and oxen, rush from
         the place, with the one thought of escaping from the condemnation of
         His presence.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 158.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In class, go over your answer to Monday’s last question. What
          are the major differences between us and a holy God? What are
          ways in which some of those differences can be eradicated, if any?

          l2 Given what we have looked at this week, why is it so much
          easier to see why self-righteousness and self-satisfaction, espe-
          cially about one’s own spiritual state, are very dangerous decep-
          tions?

          l3 Think about someone you know who is “holy,” that is, who
          seems to be upright, honest, pure, and so forth; someone quite
          “set apart” from most people. How do you respond to the per-
          son? Does he or she make you feel good or bad, and why?

    Summary: It might be much nicer to focus only on God’s love
         instead of His holiness, but that would be to distort the truth. We need
         to encounter God’s searing holiness until we tremble before Him.
         Understanding God’s holiness, and our sinfulness in contrast, is cru-
         cial to helping us to understand what the atonement is all about, why
         it is so desperately needed, and why it had to cost so much.

Through the Children
   How does a group of believers carry on its ministry when they have no
place to meet outside of their worship hour? The Portuguese-speaking group
of believers in Brussels, Belgium, is small, but growing. It started as a Global
Mission project, and it’s growing larger and stronger as it reaches out to the
Portuguese-speaking community in this multiethnic city in northern Europe.
   Because the group doesn’t have a church of its own, members can’t hold
meetings whenever they wish. Brazilians love to sing, and the youth crave a
time to hold youth meetings, but without space and time, it’s difficult to hold
regular meetings.
   The church members have discovered that ministries to children bring
adults to the church. They’ve held weekend camps for children and youth in
rented locations and have started an Adventurers Club. Because the church
doesn’t have enough Pathfinder-age children to form a club, leaders have
asked the older children to help lead in Adventurers. And the club has quickly
grown to 18 children, half of whom are from non-Adventist homes.
   One boy who comes is nine-year-old Paul. His father swore that he
would never set foot inside a church, so Paul’s uncle brought Paul to
Adventurers. Paul’s mother began coming with the boy to watch the pro-
gram and to see what Paul was learning. She praised the leaders for the
strong values they were helping to instill in her son.
   But Paul’s mother couldn’t attend Adventurers on the week of Paul’s
investiture. This was an important program, so Paul’s mother asked her
husband to take the boy. In spite of his promise never to go to a church,
Paul’s father attended the investiture program. He, too, was impressed
with what his son was learning, and now he takes Paul to Adventurers
often. He did not object when Paul’s mother began taking Bible studies
with a member of the church.
   One day Paul’s father commented, “I still don’t believe, but what you’re
doing for my son and other children is a good thing. You are teaching
good values.”
   God is working in the hearts of parents through the lives of their chil-
dren in Brussels, Belgium. And our mission offerings are helping to make
this possible. A recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is helping to provide
worship centers for the Spanish and Romanian congregations in Brussels.
Giving these two groups their own churches has made it possible for the
Portuguese and another language group to meet in the rented spaces these
two churches once used. Thank you for helping God’s work expand in
Brussels, Belgium, a city with many hungry hearts.

      God the               Lawgiver



      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Heb. 12:21; Rom. 7:8–13;
      Job 24:14, 15; Exod. 16:4–30; Heb. 8:10; 10:16; Rom. 13:8–10.

Memory Text: “For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-
      giver, the Lord is our King; He will save us” (Isaiah 33:22,
      NKJV).

Key Thought: God’s law is an inseparable part of the Old and New
      Testaments. It is also an expression of His love.



      A
               s Seventh-day Adventists, we often hear the idea that the
               law is a transcript of God’s character. (If so, then because
               God doesn’t change, the law—which reveals His character—
      shouldn’t change either.) What, though, does that mean?
         Suppose you lived in a land with a king whose word was law. (“The
      state, that’s me” one French king famously said.) Now, suppose the
      king issued laws that were repressive, nasty, hateful, unfair, discrimi-
      natory, and so forth. Would not those laws be a good representation of
      the kind of person the king was; would they not reveal his character?
         Think through some of history’s worst despots. How did the laws
      they passed reveal what kind of people they were?
         In this sense, the law reveals the character of the lawgiver. What,
      then, does God’s law reveal about God? When we understand God’s
      law as a hedge, a protection, something created for us, for our own
      good, then we come to understand more about what God is like.
         This week we’ll take a look at the law and, by default, the
      Lawgiver.

     The Law at Sinai
Read Exodus 19:18, 19; 20:18; Deuteronomy 5:22; and Hebrews
     12:21, descriptions of the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. Why
     would it be something so terrifying?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       “The people of Israel were overwhelmed with terror. The awful
     power of God’s utterances seemed more than their trembling hearts
     could bear. For as God’s great rule of right was presented before
     them, they realized as never before the offensive character of sin, and
     their own guilt in the sight of a holy God. They shrank away from
     the mountain in fear and awe.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, pp. 309, 310.
       There’s something so powerful in the Ellen White quote above. As
     the law is presented to them, the people realize “as never before” just
     how bad sin is and their own guilt in the eyes of God.
       So, right from the beginning of Israel’s covenantal relationship with
     God, we can see a revelation of the gospel in the law. The law was
     never meant to be a means of salvation, even at Sinai; rather, it was to
     show the people their need of salvation. It was right after the giving of
     the law that they were given instructions to build the sanctuary, which
     revealed to them the plan of salvation. The law was to point people
     to the Cross, to their need of atonement and Redemption. No wonder,
     then, that they trembled before the law, because the law showed them
     just how sinful and fallen they were.

Read Romans 7:8–13. How do these verses reveal this crucial truth?
     What is Paul saying that the law does? (See also Ps. 119:6.)

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       In a sense, Paul is saying here what Ellen White said happened at
     Sinai. The problem is not with God’s law; the problem is with sinners
     who have violated the law, as we all have done. Paul is showing how
     the law is inseparably tied to the gospel, that it is the law that shows
     us just how sinful and fallen we are.

      Read Exodus 20:1–17. Do you find yourself trembling before
      the law? Do you find yourself convicted by it? What are your
      emotions as you read the law and compare yourself with it?
                                                                          47

     The Law Before Sinai
        		
        As soon as we talk about the law, the Ten Commandments, and Sinai,
     we hear the refrain that the Ten Commandments were first given to
     the Jews at Sinai; hence, the commandments are a Jewish or an Old
     Testament institution and not applicable to our day and time.
        Of course, numerous problems exist with that theology, the biggest
     being that if this were true, then how could there have been sin before
     Sinai, “for sin is the transgression of the law” (1 John 3:4)? The truth
     is that the book of Genesis yields an amazing witness to the existence
     of God’s law long before Sinai.
        Genesis 1 and 2 describe God’s perfect Creation. Genesis 3 records
     the fall of Adam and Eve. In the next chapter, Genesis 4, we have
     the first murder. How did Cain know he was guilty for murdering his
     brother if there were no law to define murder as sin?
        Long before Sinai, God specifically denounced murder in the cov-
     enant He established with Noah after the Flood (Gen. 9:6).
        In the oldest book in the Bible, the book of Job, we find God com-
     mending Job’s righteousness two times. What does He declare of
     Job’s character? (Job 1:8, 2:3). Obviously, a standard of right and
     wrong is operating. Job lived long before the Exodus, and he wasn’t
     even of the covenant line.

Read Job 24:14, 15. How do these verses help us to understand what
     the standard of right and wrong included?


       When Abraham lied about Sarah to Abimelech, God rebuked Abraham
     for his falsehood. And even though Abimelech was king of Gerar and
     not of Israelite stock, God held him to the same standard of marital
     purity found in the Decalogue and demanded that Sarah be returned
     to Abraham (see Gen. 20:9).

What pointed testimony about Abraham does God give to Isaac
     about his father? Gen. 26:4, 5.


        What’s fascinating about Genesis 26:5 is that the Hebrew uses four
     different words, mshmrt, mzvot, huqot, and torot (from Torah, “the
     law”) to describe what Abraham obeyed. Certainly among all these
     were the Ten Commandments.
        When Jacob, at God’s bidding, was returning to Bethel to build an
     altar to the Lord, he felt the need for revival in his household. What
     did he request his household to do? (See Gen. 35:2, 3.)
        Clearly, the idea that there was no law until Sinai makes no sense in
     light of so much of what the Bible teaches about life before Sinai.

      The Sabbath Before Sinai
        God doesn’t reveal how He communicated the eternal principles
      of His law to humanity before Mount Sinai, but the evidence is clear
      and substantial that the giving of the law on Sinai was not the world’s
      initial exposure to its precepts.
        Many people, forced to concede that point, argue, instead, that it
      was only the Sabbath commandment, not the others, that was first
      given at Sinai, and, therefore, it is exclusively Jewish and doesn’t
      pertain to Christians today. How valid is that claim?

Read Genesis 2:1–3. What does this passage teach us about the
      Sabbath before Sinai?

         Next, in Exodus 5:1–5, the Bible reveals Moses and Aaron strug-
      gling with Pharaoh in regard to the question of letting Israel go. Verse
      five is particularly enlightening.

Read Exodus 5:5. What indication is there of the Sabbath in this text?

        Pharaoh’s response, “You make them rest from their labor” (NKJV),
      seems clear enough. The original language reads even more pointedly.
      Although there are several words for rest, the verb Pharaoh uses is built
      on the word for “Sabbath.” The striking language of Pharaoh to Moses
      and Aaron reads like this, “You make them sabbath from their labor!”
      a hint, if nothing else, to the reality of the Sabbath rest before Sinai.
        Proof of the Sabbath before Sinai, though, appears in Exodus 16,
      when God miraculously provides manna for Israel in the wilderness.
      This 40-year miracle began before the Israelites reached Mount Sinai.

Read Exodus 16:4–30, focusing especially on verses 23–30. How
      do these verses prove the existence of the seventh-day Sabbath
      before the Mount Sinai experience?

        Notice the words of the Lord to Moses in verse 28, “How long do
      you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?” (NKJV), a
      clear indication that God’s laws and commandments existed before
      the revelation at Sinai, and that among those commandments and
      laws was the seventh-day Sabbath. Thus, although something monu-
      mental happened with the giving of the law at Mount Sinai, the Ten
      Commandments themselves obviously weren’t new.

       How is your Sabbath experience? Do you love the Sabbath,
       dread it, or are you ambivalent about it? What can you do to
       have a deeper and richer experience with the Lord through the
       gift of His Sabbath day?
                                                                           49

      The Law and the Prophets
         Little controversy exists over the existence of the law in the period
      after Sinai. The Old Testament writings are filled with references
      to the law. And though, so often, those references deal with Israel’s
      transgression of the law and the subsequent punishments, other texts
      reveal the great love and reverence many in Israel had for the law,
      which included not just the Ten Commandments but all of the rules
      and precepts that the Lord had given to His people.

In what ways do the following texts extoll the law? What attitudes do
      they reveal?

      Isa. 48:17, 18____________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________

      Ps. 119:69–72 ___________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________

      Ps. 119:97–103___________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________

      Jer. 31:33_______________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________

         Contrary to popular beliefs, although Israel (ideally) loved the law,
      those who understood the law’s function never saw it as a means of
      salvation. The Hebrew religion had always been a religion of grace,
      even though the people went from one extreme to the other: from
      trampling the law openly and blatantly, as in the first-temple period,
      to extreme legalism, as seen so clearly in the time of Jesus.
         Why, though, such a love of the law? Again, if one understands
      the word law to encompass not just the Ten Commandments but the
      whole body of Old Testament teachings, especially the first five books
      of Moses, then you understand that what was loved was the message
      of salvation, of grace, of redemption. They loved the “truth” as it was
      revealed to them and as they best grasped it. It wasn’t a love of rules,
      per se, but a love of a set of guidelines and principles that, if kept, would
      have opened the way for many blessings and promises, because all that
      God had given them was for their own good and well-being.
         Is it any different today?

       Think about what God has given us as a people. How could we
       better live out the wonderful light with which we have been
       blessed?

      The Law in the New Covenant
         From the start, the principles of the Ten Commandments were given
      to humanity out of the Lord’s love for people. The law has always been
      intended to be a blessing. You obey the law, and you are greatly protected
      from the ravages of sin; you disobey, and you face the inevitable conse-
      quences of transgression. Who needs theology to know, personally, just
      how painful sin and its consequences are? How often can you read the
      results of sin on the faces of those who have been ravaged by it?
         Although sections of the New Testament—Paul’s writing specif-
      ically—deal with those who have misunderstood the purpose of the
      law, the commandments of God have been presented in the New
      Testament in a positive, uplifting way. 				

Read Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16 in their contexts. How is God’s law
      presented in these texts? As something still relevant, or as some-
      thing negated by grace?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         So often, we see people seeking to place the law in opposition to God’s
      love or God’s grace, the idea being that if you truly love, then God’s law
      is negated. One could argue that love transcends the law, in the sense that
      one who truly loves God and others reveals the ultimate principles of
      the law. But this is no excuse for negating the law. On the contrary, love
      fulfills the law; love is the law expressed in its purest form.
         It’s like the parts of a car. The parts don’t exist as ends in them-
      selves; they are there so that the car will go from place to place. That’s
      their purpose, so that the car can move. Yet, without each part, the car
      wouldn’t function. The law is like that: it’s not an end in itself but the
      means to an end, and that end is a deep expression of love, love for
      God and love for others.

Look up these texts. How do they help us to understand the link between
      love and law? Rom. 13:8–10; Gal. 5:14; James 2:8; 1 John 5:2, 3.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

       Dwell more on the links between God’s law and love. Law-
       keeping without love leads to what? Love without law-keeping
       leads to what? Write out your thoughts and bring them to class
       on Sabbath.

    Further Study: “The ten holy precepts spoken by Christ upon Sinai’s
          mount were the revelation of the character of God, and made known
          to the world the fact that He had jurisdiction over the whole human
          heritage. That law of ten precepts of the greatest love that can be
          presented to man is the voice of God from heaven speaking to the
1
          soul in promise. ‘This do, and you will not come under the dominion
          and control of Satan.’ There is not a negative in that law, although it
          may appear thus. It is DO, and Live. . . . The Lord has given His holy
          commandments to be a wall of protection around His created beings.”
          —Ellen G. White, Sons and Daughters of God, p. 53.
             “In the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No external
2         force is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of God, man
          is left free to choose whom he will serve. In the change that takes
          place when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is the highest sense of
          freedom. . . . True, we have no power to free ourselves from Satan’s
          control; but when we desire to be set free from sin, and in our great
          need cry out for a power out of and above ourselves, the powers of the
          soul are imbued with the divine energy of the Holy Spirit, and they
          obey the dictates of the will in fulfilling the will of God.
3
             “The only condition upon which the freedom of man is possible is
          that of becoming one with Christ. ‘The truth shall make you free;’ and
          Christ is the truth. . . . Subjection to God is restoration to one’s self,—
          to the true glory and dignity of man. The divine law, to which we are
          brought into subjection, is ‘the law of liberty.’ James 2:12.”—Ellen
          G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 466.

    Discussion Questions:
           l1 Discuss your answer to Thursday’s questions about law and love.
           What is law-keeping without love like? How is it often manifested?
           At the same time, what is love without law-keeping like? What kind
           of love is it, if love at all? Why do they need to be linked?

           l
           2 In what ways does the law reveal the character of the Lawgiver?
           How does God’s law reveal to us what God is like?

           l3 What does Ellen White mean when she talks above about the law
           being a “law of liberty”? How can the keeping of the law be equated
           with “liberty”?

           l
           4 What examples can we find in the world, and all around us, of
           what happens when people violate God’s law? How powerful a
           testimony are these examples of the value and continued validity
           of that law?

    Summary: God’s law is an expression of His love, and when we love as
          God loves us, we will truly reveal the law in all its beauty and power.

Determined to Serve
by Enkhchimeg Enkhbaatar
  Eggie’s family wasn’t religious, but when a classmate in secondary
school invited her to attend church with her, Eggie agreed to go. She knew
that her parents didn’t mind, for her mother had told her that worshiping
God was a good thing.
  Her friend’s church was a small group of 20 or 30 people who met on
Sabbaths. Most were young people, and Eggie loved the vibrant worship
service these youth led out in. Eggie invited her younger sister to attend,
and eventually both girls were baptized.
  Eggie finished high school and looked forward to studying to become
a teacher. But her older sister was already studying at a university, and
her parents couldn’t afford to support two girls in university at once.
Disappointed, Eggie found work as a waitress and saved money to study.
  Eggie helped start a small group Bible study in another family’s home.
Her church family saw her leadership abilities and helped Eggie get a
scholarship to begin her studies. Joyfully Eggie journeyed to Ulaanbaatar,
Mongolia’s capital city, to begin her studies.
  She found a vibrant church family where she can grow spiritually. She
teaches the children’s class in church and hopes that when Mongolia
opens a Seventh-day Adventist elementary school, she can teach there. In
the meantime, she encourages other Seventh-day Adventist young people
to stay true to God and the beliefs they treasure.
  In the dormitory where she lives, Eggie shares her faith with her school-
mates. “My friends want to know what I believe,” she says. “I give them
books about my faith and copies of my Sabbath School lessons. I invite
them to church and share with them my joy in Jesus.”
  Eggie prays for her younger sister, who is working as a missionary vol-
                            unteer while she awaits her turn to attend the
                            university. “God is leading us, and we rejoice
                            that we are working with Him to lead others to
                            Jesus,” Eggie says.
                               Mongolia is a small but growing mission
                            field that relies on our mission offerings to
                            help grow the church. Thank you for your part
                            in this important ministry.

Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 2:1–3, Exod. 20:8–12,
  Deut. 5:12–15, Matt. 12:1–13, John 9, 19:30.
    				
Memory Text: “ ‘The Sabbath was made for man, and not man
  for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the
  Sabbath’ ” (Mark 2:27, 28, NKJV).

Key Thought: The seventh-day Sabbath, in every way, points us
      to Jesus, our Creator and our Redeemer.



      I
          n the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
          Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things
          were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was
      made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light
      shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a
      man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness,
      to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He
      was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the
      true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was
      in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him
      not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as
      received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
      them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the
      will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God” (John 1:1–13).
         These verses are, of course, pointing to Jesus, Jesus as the One who
      made “all things” and Jesus as the One who gives salvation to those who
      “believe on his name.” That is, Jesus as Creator and Jesus as Redeemer.

     The Sabbath in Genesis
       One of the most deeply imbedded truths of the Bible is this: back
     in Eden, in a perfect world created by a perfect God, the seventh day
     was set apart from the rest of the week and made holy. That’s how
     far back, and basic, the seventh-day Sabbath is. From the perspective
     of this world, you can’t get much farther back than that. With the
     Sabbath, then, we’re dealing with one of the most fundamental and
     foundational of all biblical truths.

What four actions of God are recorded in Genesis 2:1–3 as He cre-
     ated the Sabbath?

       God created a day, He rested on that day, He blessed the seventh
     day, and He sanctified it, which means He made it holy or set it
     apart for holy use. How fascinating that God Himself “rested” on the
     seventh day. Whatever that means, it shows how seriously the day is
     meant to be taken, because God Himself rested on it!
       Genesis 2:3 states that the Creator “blessed” the seventh day, just as
     He blessed animals and man on the day before (Gen. 1:22, 28). God
     refers to this blessing of the Sabbath in the fourth commandment,
     forever linking the Creation Sabbath with the weekly Sabbath.

Notice how many times the phrase “the seventh day” is repeated in
     Genesis 2:1–3. What possible significance does that repetition have?

        Three times that specific day is mentioned. This accentuates the
     extraordinary nature of the seventh-day Sabbath and clearly sets it
     apart from the rest of the week. It should always remind us that God
     didn’t make the first day special, or any other day. The special bless-
     ing is for the seventh day and no other.
        With the creation of the seventh-day Sabbath, God ended His creative
     work. He took the seven days of time and crafted them into a week.
     This weekly cycle is observed throughout the rest of Scripture and his-
     tory. Thus, God demonstrates His manifold power over not just space
     and the things of space but over time, as well. None of us can control
     an hour, or even a minute, of time. Time relentlessly marches on, com-
     pletely beyond our machinations. How important, then, that we learn to
     trust the Lord with the little amount of time we have here on earth.

      Think about the march of time, how it sweeps us along moment
      by moment, day by day, and year by year. Although we have no
      control over time itself, what we can control to some degree is
      what we do with it. How well do you use your time? What things
      occupy your time? How might you use your time better?

     The Sabbath in Exodus
Read Exodus 20:8–11. What does the Lord tell us to do, and what
     reason does He give us to do it?

        The entire family household, including any servants of either
     gender, the working class along with the “boss,” are to rest together.
     Sabbath is the great equalizer, the liberator of all inequities in the
     social structure. Before God, all human beings are equal, and the
     Sabbath is a unique way of revealing this crucial truth, especially in
     a world so dominated by class structures that place various groups
     “over” or “beneath” others.
        This commandment is also a carefully structured literary unit:
      A. Introduction: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (vs.
           8, NKJV).
      B. Command: “Six days you shall labor and do all your work” (vs.
           9, NKJV).
      C. Motivation: “but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
           your God” (vs. 10a, NKJV).
      B1. Command: “In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor
           . . .” (vs. 10b, NKJV).
      C1. Motivation: “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the
           earth, the sea, . . . and rested . . .” (vs. 11a, NKJV).
      D. Conclusion: “Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and
           hallowed it” (vs. 11b, NKJV).
        A contains, as an introductory opening statement, the essential prin-
     ciple of the Sabbath commandment as a whole.
        B conveys the positive command to engage in work on six days.
        B1 gives the corresponding prohibitive command of refraining from
     any work on the Sabbath day, including the inclusive application to the
     entire family. Even the domestic animals, as well as any guests in the
     home, are included.
        C and C1 supply the motivation for the commands. C acknowledges
     the time factor in the six-days/seventh-day sequence by emphasizing
     that “the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.”
        C1 contains the formal motivation clause with the introductory “for”
     or “because.” It presents the detailed motivation in terms of the Lord’s
     six days of work and His resting on the seventh day, rooting it directly
     in the first Sabbath of Creation week.
        D is an independent clause, starting with a “Therefore” and also
     forming the conclusion. The last words of the commandment, “and
     made it holy,” correspond to the exhortation of the opening principle.
        A “to keep it holy.” Both are linked to the holiness with which God
     endows the Sabbath in Genesis 2:3.

     The Sabbath in Deuteronomy
       Although Seventh-day Adventists are most familiar with the Sabbath
     commandment as expressed in the book of Exodus, the Lord gave it
     again (and all the other commandments) in the book of Deuteronomy.
     What’s fascinating is that, although the commands appear in very
     similar language, the language isn’t precisely the same. Moreover,
     the commandment in Deuteronomy is given another motivation, one
     not seen in Exodus.

Read Deuteronomy 5:12–15. Compare it with Exodus 20:8–11. What
     similarities exist between the two, what differences, and why are
     those differences important?

     _______________________________________________________

        Although much is the same between them, there is a new element
     and emphasis. While both commandments talk about the servants
     resting on the Sabbath day, Deuteronomy goes out of its way to
     emphasize that point. The text reads that they should keep the Sabbath
     “so that your manservant and maidservant may rest, as you do” (Deut.
     5:14, NIV; emphasis added). Here we see what was touched on the
     other day: how the Sabbath helps bring master and servant together
     on the same level; both are to rest on the same day. The Sabbath, on
     a purely practical level, offered servants some protection from the
     master who would work them nonstop—a protection built right into a
     commandment that had its origins in Creation itself.
        Of course, this raises an interesting question. When the Sabbath was
     first instituted, it was to be a memorial of Creation in a nonfallen world.
     It had nothing to do with manservants or maidservants and certainly noth-
     ing about being in slavery in Egypt, itself a symbol of bondage to sin, and
     deliverance from that bondage. This new element, then, had been added
     onto the commandment after the Fall; that is, the original precept was
     altered to incorporate something that it originally didn’t contain.
        Thus, as first conceived, the Sabbath was a symbol of Creation; after
     sin, it came to be a symbol of both Creation and Redemption, which is
     itself a type of re-creation (2 Cor. 5:17, Gal. 6:15, Rev. 21:1). Creation
     and Redemption are closely linked in the Bible; only God the Creator
     could be God the Redeemer, and we have them both in Jesus (see John
     1:1–14). Both versions of the commandment show that the seventh-day
     Sabbath is the symbol of the work of Jesus, our Creator and our Redeemer.

      Think about the bondage from which Christ has promised to
      free you. What promises of freedom do you have in Jesus? How
      can you learn to claim them and then allow the Lord to make
      them real in your life?
                                                                            59

      Jesus and His Sabbath: Part 1
        Books have been written, and are still being written, with the sole
      purpose of showing that Jesus, when here in the flesh, was pointing
      people away from the seventh-day Sabbath, either toward Sunday
      worship or (more commonly today) toward the idea that the seventh
      day has been superceded and replaced with a more generic and gen-
      eral “rest” in Christ.
        Neither option, though, seems to be found in any of the Gospel
      accounts of Jesus and the Sabbath. Besides the obvious reason for
      such books (a need to justify the rejection of the seventh-day Sabbath
      by the vast majority of the Christian world for centuries), they argue
      Christ’s healing on the Sabbath heralds the death knell of that com-
      mandment.
        What about these arguments? A careful look at what Jesus did on
      the Sabbath shows the opposite of what these theologians are trying
      to milk out of the incidents themselves.

Carefully read Matthew 12:1–13, focusing specifically on the Sabbath
      healing. As you read it, ask yourself, What is the context of the
      healing, why would Jesus have done it specifically on that day,
      and what is the major point that He is clearly making?


         Perhaps the key verse, the one that explains it all, is verse 7. This
      is what the issue was all about: it was about people, about mercy
      and kindness and loving others. Properly kept, the Sabbath allows us
      more opportunity to show kindness and mercy to those in need than
      would other days of the week when we are forced to earn a living.
      The problem was that the Sabbath day had become burdened with a
      host of man-made rules and regulations that soon became an end in
      themselves rather than the means to an end—and that end is love to
      God and to other people. Love, the Bible says, is the fulfilling of the
      law, and anything that turns the law into that which negates love, or
      that which works against love, is something that must be discarded.
      The Sabbath had become law without love, which is harsh legalism.
      This is what Jesus was fighting against by His Sabbath healing.
         The hardness of the religious establishment could be seen in the
      healing of the man blind from birth (John 9). Look carefully at verse
      16. Talk about law without love!
         In the end, if Jesus were using His Sabbath healing to start point-
      ing people away from the literal seventh-day Sabbath, it sure was a
      strange way to do it.

       Ask yourself, What are other ways one can manifest the law
       without love? Might you be guilty of doing the same thing?

     Jesus and His Sabbath: Part 2
       “It is finished” (John 19:30).
       Jesus, through His Sabbath miracles, demonstrated what the
     Sabbath is really about. It is a day for healing and restoration. Jesus
     intended for the Sabbath to call to mind God’s creative power. Thus,
     the Sabbath is the day when He frees the captives (Luke 4:31–37),
     makes the lame walk (Luke 13:10–17, John 5:1–9), and restores sight
     to the blind (John 9).
       For Jesus, the Sabbath was more about people than about rules,
     which is no doubt partly why He made His famous statement about
     the Sabbath being made for humankind and not humankind for the
     Sabbath. At the same time, as we saw earlier in the week, if properly
     kept, the rules protected people.

Jesus not only reinforced the validity and importance of resting on
     the Sabbath while He was alive, but He did it in death, as well.
     (Read Matt. 27:57–28:1, Mark 15:42–16:1, Luke 23:52–24:1, and
     John 19:31–20:1.) What’s the one common point all four Gospel
     writers make here? More important, what does this tell us about
     the Sabbath, especially in the context of the question of whether
     or not the Sabbath is still valid?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        After He cried out, “It is finished!” (John 19:30), that is, after His
     work of Redemption (prior to His heavenly intercession) was done,
     what did Jesus do?
        He rested on the seventh day. Sound familiar? Where have we
     already seen that? Of course, in Genesis 2:1–3. After God’s work
     of creation, He rested on the seventh day. Now, after His work of
     Redemption, He does the same thing.
        Also, in light of the whole question of Jesus’ moving humanity
     away from the seventh-day Sabbath, His example of resting in the
     tomb on the Sabbath is, indeed, another strange way of getting that
     point across. If anything, especially because His death sealed the new
     covenant, and the new covenant supposedly supercedes the seventh-
     day Sabbath, one is hard pressed to understand the logic of those who
     believe that the Sabbath commandment was abolished after the Cross.
     If it were abolished, why would resting on the Sabbath be the first
     thing Jesus did after the Cross?
        Thus, both in life and in death, Jesus showed us the continued valid-
     ity and importance of the Sabbath.

                                                                          61

    Further Study: “Should God forbid the sun to perform its office upon
          the Sabbath, cut off its genial rays from warming the earth and nourish-
          ing vegetation? Must the system of worlds stand still through that holy
          day? Should He command the brooks to stay from watering the fields
          and forests, and bid the waves of the sea still their ceaseless ebbing and
          flowing? Must the wheat and corn stop growing, and the ripening cluster
          defer its purple bloom? Must the trees and flowers put forth no bud nor
          blossom on the Sabbath?
             “In such a case, men would miss the fruits of the earth, and the bless-
1         ings that make life desirable. Nature must continue her unvarying course.
          God could not for a moment stay His hand, or man would faint and die.
          And man also has a work to perform on this day. The necessities of life
          must be attended to, the sick must be cared for, the wants of the needy
          must be supplied. He will not be held guiltless who neglects to relieve
          suffering on the Sabbath. God’s holy rest day was made for man, and acts
2         of mercy are in perfect harmony with its intent. God does not desire His
          creatures to suffer an hour’s pain that may be relieved upon the Sabbath
          or any other day.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 206, 207.

    Discussion Questions:
           l1 It’s easy today, with hindsight, to mock the hardness and coldness
           of those religious leaders who attacked Jesus for His Sabbath healing.
3
           And they certainly will be judged for their actions. At the same time,
           try to put yourself in their sandals. These man-made rules had been
           around for so long that these leaders all but thought the rules were
           the very essence of Sabbath-keeping itself; hence, they truly believed
           that Jesus was violating the Sabbath. How would we feel were some-
           one to come along today and, claiming great light and truth, maybe
           even doing miracles, yet was in our view trampling on the fourth
           commandment? How might we react? What important lesson can we
           learn from this exercise about knowing how to separate truth from
           mere tradition and why it is not always easy to do so?

           l2 Further examine in class this idea that God rested after His work
           of Creation and His work of Redemption. How are we to under-
           stand the significance of this amazing fact?

           l
           3 Place yourself in the shoes of someone who believes that Jesus’
           miracles on the Sabbath showed that He was abolishing it. Compare
           what the Bible teaches He said and did with what you would imag-
           ine Him doing were He really making this change. What do you
           imagine He would have done differently?

    Summary: The Bible reveals the Lord as the Lord of the seventh-day
          Sabbath, the most basic sign of Him as Creator and Redeemer.

Raquel’s New Church
  Raquel is 10 years old. She lives with her family along the Amazon
River in northern Brazil. Raquel’s family doesn’t attend church, but some-
times Raquel attended church with her cousin on Sundays. One Sunday
evening Raquel’s cousin didn’t come to take her to church. Disappointed,
Raquel wandered outside.
  She heard people singing in the Seventh-day Adventist church near her
home. She hurried back inside and asked her mother to let her go to the
Seventh-day Adventist worship service since her cousin hadn’t come for
her. Her mother agreed, and Raquel hurried down the street to the church.
  The members greeted Raquel warmly; she was happy that she had
come. She enjoyed the worship service and decided to return. One of the
members invited her to come for Sabbath School; so on Saturday morning
when Raquel heard people singing in the little church, she hurried down
the street to join them.
  Raquel loved Sabbath School, where the children helped her learn new
songs and the teachers made Bible stories so interesting. Raquel contin-
ued worshiping at the Seventh-day Adventist church. When her cousin
invited her to go to church again, Raquel told her that she had found a
new church.
  Raquel has joined Pathfinders, and she sings in a children’s choir. She
enjoys helping with the children’s programs at church. She has invited
her family to come to church with her, and her mother and brother have
visited several times. Although they don’t always attend, they are glad
that Raquel wants to worship God. “I feel that I’m a light shining in my
home,” she says.
  Raquel learned that nearly everyone in the church is involved in one or
more small groups that meet during the week to study the Bible and talk
about God. Members invite their friends to come, and many people have
joined the church through these small groups. Raquel wanted to learn how
to lead a small group, so she took a class. Now she leads a small group
just for children. Raquel invites her friends from school to attend the small
group and encourages the other children to invite their friends as well.
  Raquel has learned that there’s power in group prayer. When her father
was seriously ill, she asked the small groups at church to join her in pray-
ing for him. Her father recovered, and she told him that she’s sure his
recovery was in answer to the prayers of her church friends. Her father
has promised to visit her church one day. Raquel can’t wait for him to
keep that promise.

Key Thought: How should Christians relate to the environment?


      W
                 hat should we, as Seventh-day Adventists, think about the
                 environment, especially because we know that this earth is
                 corrupted, will continue to be corrupted, and will one day
      be destroyed, burned up in a great lake of fire: “and the elements shall
      melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
      shall be burned up” (2 Pet. 3:10)? Add to this the biblical injunction
      about humans having “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
      fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
      every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth” (Gen. 1:26), and
      it’s no wonder that, at times, we struggle with how to relate to envi-
      ronmental concerns.
         At the same time, as stewards of all God’s gifts, don’t we have an
      obligation to take care of the earth? After all, didn’t God create it and
      pronounce it “very good”? As a people with a distinct message about
      God as Creator (Rev. 14:6, 7), shouldn’t we have something to say
      about the question of how we treat God’s creation?
         This week we’ll explore what the Bible says about some of these
      concerns.

     The Lobster Liberation Movement!
        Years ago an environmentalist entered a seafood restaurant. There
     before him, sitting in a large tank, were half a dozen Maine lobsters that
     probably wouldn’t last the night. A customer would pick out the one that
     he or she wanted to eat, and before long the lobster would be sitting on
     someone’s plate next to, perhaps, a potato smothered in cheese.
        Moving stealthily, the environmentalist reached into the tank, grabbed
     the first lobster he could get his hands on, threw it into a bag, and ran.
     He then put the lobster in a tank in his car and drove to the shore. There,
     a helicopter took him over the ocean, and he then returned the lobster to
     the water. A lobster liberator strikes again!
        The man was not alone in his concern. You can visit a Web site titled
     “Lobster Liberation” that talks about saving lobsters from getting eaten
     by humans. It even has a section called “Tips for Releasing Lobsters,”
     telling you what to do once you rescue lobsters from a restaurant.
        Another time, an American actress dedicated an entire episode of her
     sitcom to smuggling lobsters out of restaurants and releasing them in the
     ocean.
        Caring about the environment is one thing, but stealing a lobster out of
     a restaurant and taking it, by helicopter, back to the ocean does seem a
     bit extreme, does it not?
        All of which leads to the question, what about Christians—indeed,
     Seventh-day Adventist Christians—and the environment? Putting aside the
     strangeness of the lobster liberators, how should we relate to environmen-
     tal concerns? After all, isn’t Jesus coming soon? Isn’t our whole message
     predicated on the notion that this world is coming to an end, that this earth
     is corrupted and not going to last? Given our understanding of the Second
     Coming, how concerned need we really be about the earth itself?

Read 2 Peter 3:10–14, Isaiah 51:6, 65:17, and Revelation 21:1. What
     does the Bible clearly teach about the ultimate fate of the earth?
     How should this teaching impact the way we look at the environ-
     ment? Or should it at all?

        The Bible is more than unequivocal: this world, this earth, will not
     last. It is destined to be destroyed by God, who promises to make
     it over, to re-create it, to make a “new heaven and a new earth.”
     Although that’s hardly an excuse (as we’ll see this week) to abuse or
     exploit the environment, it should at the same time help to protect us
     from making a god, as many have done, out of the earth and of the
     environment. While we can laugh at the extremists, we need to be
     careful not to get caught up in those extremes ourselves.

      Read Romans 1:25. What important message should we take in
      regard to how we show our concern and care for the creation?
                                                                              65

     A Statement on Creation Care
        How, then, do Seventh-day Adventists view the question of the envi-
     ronment? How do we get involved and yet seek to keep a right balance?
     Below is an official statement, voted by the church leadership back in
     1995.
        “Seventh-day Adventists believe that humankind was created in the
     image of God, thus representing God as His stewards, to rule the natural
     environment in a faithful and fruitful way.
        “Unfortunately, corruption and exploitation have been brought into the
     management of the human domain of responsibility. Increasingly men
     and women have been involved in a megalomaniacal destruction of the
     earth’s resources, resulting in widespread suffering, environmental disar-
     ray, and the threat of climate change. While scientific research needs to
     continue, it is clear from the accumulated evidence that the increasing
     emission of destructive gasses, the depletion of the protective mantle of
     ozone, the massive destruction of the American forests, and the so-called
     greenhouse effect, are all threatening the earth’s ecosystem.
        “These problems are largely due to human selfishness and the egocen-
     tric pursuit of getting more and more through ever-increasing production,
     unlimited consumption and depletion of nonrenewable resources. The
     ecological crisis is rooted in humankind’s greed and refusal to practice
     good and faithful stewardship within the divine boundaries of creation.
        “Seventh-day Adventists advocate a simple, wholesome lifestyle,
     where people do not step on the treadmill of unbridled consumerism,
     goods-getting, and production of waste. We call for respect of creation,
     restraint in the use of the world’s resources, reevaluation of one’s
     needs, and reaffirmation of the dignity of created life.”—Adventist
     Administrative Committee (ADCOM), released at General Conference
     Session in Utrecht, the Netherlands, June 29–July 8, 1995.

Look up the following texts. How do they help us to understand the
     reasoning behind this church statement? Gen. 1:1, 26; 9:7; Pss.
     24:1; 100; James 5:1, 2, 4, 5; Heb. 1:3.

        If anything, as Christians who believe that this world and the life and
     resources on it are gifts from God, we should be at the forefront of seek-
     ing to take care of it. If we believed that the earth is just a chance cre-
     ation, the product of cold, uncaring forces, we could almost be excused
     in seeking to exploit it to our own ends. When, though, we understand
     this world as something that God created and sustains, it’s hard to see
     how we could do anything other than be responsible stewards of it.

      How might your own selfishness impact how you treat the envi-
      ronment? And what’s wrong with the attitude that says, “Well,
      I’m only one person, so what does it matter?”

     Creation Care
        The issue of the environment, and caring for the environment, isn’t
     specifically and openly addressed in the Bible. Of course, there are a lot
     of specific issues that the Bible doesn’t address. What the Bible does do
     again and again, is give us principles that should be applied to all areas of
     life, which include the question of the environment.

Think about Matthew 22:37–40. In what ways could the principles
     taught here impact our attitude toward environmental concerns,
     especially when misuse of the environment can have some very
     detrimental effects on others?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        Early on in the Bible, we are given some indication of human-
     ity’s call to be a steward of what God had given Adam on the earth.
     Although the context is very specific, it’s hard to see why the prin-
     ciple shouldn’t continue.

Genesis 2:15 reads, “And the Lord God took the man, and put him
     into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.” How does this
     reveal the way in which humankind was originally intended to
     relate to the earth?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        Notice the reciprocal relationship here. God created this beautiful
     environment for the man; it was given to him as a gift. And yet, see
     how Adam was supposed to relate to it. He was to work it and to keep
     it. The word translated as “keep” comes from the Hebrew root smr,
     which means “to watch” or “to preserve” or “to protect.” Thus, right
     from the start, even in the pre-Fall world, Adam was called to be a
     steward of the environment in which he was placed. God didn’t tell
     him to exploit it, to use it for his own selfish means, and to get out of
     it all that he could. Instead, he is told to work it and protect it.
        What reason could we have for believing that this principle has
     changed? In fact, if this is what Adam was called to do in a world
     before sin entered, how much more important would good steward-
     ship of the world be after it has been damaged by sin?

      How conscious are you of environmental concerns? How much
      do you really even care about them? How important or unim-
      portant are they to you? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.

     never satisfied” (Prov. 27:20, NKJV). How does the truth of this
     text directly impact the whole question of creation care and the
     danger our exploits pose to the environment?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       As the creation statement said, part of the reason for the issue with our
     environment today has to do with “human selfishness and the egocentric
     pursuit of getting more and more through ever-increasing production,
     unlimited consumption and depletion of nonrenewable resources.” In
     other words, people just want more and more, and the only place they can
     get it is, ultimately, from the earth. Using natural resources, though, isn’t
     the problem; instead, the problem is that no matter how much a person
     gets, it’s never enough. When was the last time you heard someone, no
     matter how wealthy, say that they had enough money?
       In the midst of all this, God has given humanity the gift of the
     Sabbath.

Look up these Sabbath texts. Although we tend to think about them
     in other contexts, try thinking about them in the context of how
     Sabbath keeping, by commanding us to rest from our work, to
     rest from seeking to make money and do business, could in a very
     real way impact the environment for good.

     Exod. 20:8–11____________________________________________

     Neh. 13:16–19____________________________________________

       Sure, the Sabbath is about remembering that God created the world
     (which itself should make us conscious about how we treat it), but it is
     also about resting from the pursuit of making money. By keeping the
     Sabbath, by purposely taking one seventh of our lives every week and,
     without exception, not pursuing wealth and money and goods, we not
     only have a powerful weekly reminder that life isn’t all about making
     money, but we also often refrain from the kind of pursuits that, when
     overdone, do damage to the earth.

      How has Sabbath keeping been a means of helping to restrain
      your own greed and desire for more? How often has the lure of
      money tempted you to violate the Sabbath?

      Humankind’s Dominion
        “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our like-
      ness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
      over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth,
      and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. . . .
      And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
      multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have domin-
      ion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
      every living thing that moveth upon the earth” (Gen. 1:26–28).

In the above verses we have some of the Bible’s earliest references to
      the way in which humanity is to relate to the created world. Read
      them over prayerfully and carefully, thinking about them in the
      context of creation care and environmental concerns, and then
      answer the following questions:

      • How complete was humanity’s control over the earth to be?

      _______________________________________________________

      • What does it mean to subdue, and to have dominion over, the earth
      and all that was in it? What, if anything in the texts, gives humanity
      the license to abuse and defile that creation?

      _______________________________________________________

      • Genesis 1:28 says that they are to “replenish the earth.” The literal
      Hebrew means to “fill the earth.” How might that be understood in
      regard to the question of how the earth should be treated?

      _______________________________________________________

         No question, humanity was to rule over the earth, at least under the
      power and direction of the Lord. The fact that these verses were given in
      the pre-Fall world, a world without sin and death and suffering, should
      teach us that whatever dominion over the world means, it doesn’t mean
      a violent exploitation and plundering of the world, for those things cer-
      tainly would not have happened in a world before sin. Whatever subduing
      and dominion entailed, it didn’t entail destroying that world.
         Of course, a lot has changed since then: the Fall, the Flood, the
      curse (Gen. 3:17–19), and the general degeneration caused by sin as
      a whole. Yet, one would be hard pressed to see in these texts anything
      that justifies the plunder and ruin of the planet itself. If anything, we can
      see in these texts humankind’s responsibility, as ruler of the world, to
      take care of it, because God created it, and it was “very good.”
                                                                               69

    Further Study: “In the beginning, God was revealed in all the works
         of creation. It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations
         of the earth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned
         the flowers of the field. ‘His strength setteth fast the mountains.’ ‘The sea
         is His, and He made it.’ Ps. 65:6; 95:5. It was He that filled the earth with
         beauty, and the air with song. And upon all things in earth, and air, and
         sky, He wrote the message of the Father’s love.
            “Now sin has marred God’s perfect work, yet that handwriting
         remains. Even now all created things declare the glory of His excel-
1
         lence. There is nothing, save the selfish heart of man, that lives unto
         itself. No bird that cleaves the air, no animal that moves upon the
         ground, but ministers to some other life. There is no leaf of the forest,
         or lowly blade of grass, but has its ministry. Every tree and shrub and
         leaf pours forth that element of life without which neither man nor
         animal could live; and man and animal, in turn, minister to the life
2
         of tree and shrub and leaf. The flowers breathe fragrance and unfold
         their beauty in blessing to the world. The sun sheds its light to gladden
         a thousand worlds. The ocean, itself the source of all our springs and
         fountains, receives the streams from every land, but takes to give. The
         mists ascending from its bosom fall in showers to water the earth, that
         it may bring forth and bud.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
         pp. 20, 21.

3   Discussion Questions:
          l1 As a class, go over your answers to Tuesday’s final ques-
          tions.

          l2 How would you respond to the person who says, “Jesus is
          coming soon, so why should I care about the environment”?

          l
          3 How can we as Christians strike the right balance in our
          understanding of the need to be concerned about the environ-
          ment while at the same time not getting caught up in some of the
          extremist movements involved in environmental issues? Why is
          it so important that we don’t get caught up in them, especially
          those that are very political?

          l
          4 If you have the resources, do some research on just how bene-
          ficial a vegetarian diet is to the environment in contrast to a
          meat-eating one. Discuss your findings with the rest of the class.

    Summary: No question, this world is coming to an end; it will not
         last forever. And yes, Jesus is coming soon. All that’s true, but noth-
         ing in these truths gives us the right, or the mandate, to defile the
         earth. If anything, as Christians, we should seek to take care of the
         world that our God has created for us.

The Obstinate Professor
by Jony Ernesto
  Jony Ernesto lives in Angola, a country in southwestern Africa. He is
studying to become a teacher. He attends a government university where
classes are held Monday through Saturday. Jony and the other Seventh-
day Adventist students at the school simply skip classes that are scheduled
on Sabbaths. And when their exams are scheduled for Sabbaths, they ask
permission to take the exams on another day. Because there are many
Seventh-day Adventist students in Angola, most teachers allowed stu-
dents Sabbath privileges.
  Jony’s math teacher had two Seventh-day Adventists in his class, but he
refused to reschedule an exam planned for Sabbath. “Whoever misses this
class will receive a zero exam grade,” the teacher threatened. When Jony
and the other Seventh-day Adventist student pleaded for him to recon-
sider, the teacher told them, “Other students take their tests on Saturday,
and I expect you to do so too. God likes you to have a good education.
Skip church and take the test.”
  Jony and his friend quietly left the teacher’s office. The boys knew
that they would fail the test, but they weren’t ready to give up yet. They
agreed to pray about the exam and for the teacher some more. Jony went
home to pray and study. The next day a student leader found Jony and
told him, “I’ve been looking for you for an hour! The math teacher wants
to talk with you in his office—right away.” Jony found his Seventh-day
Adventist friend, and together the two hurried to the math teacher’s office.
They knocked gently at the teacher’s door and entered when invited. They
found their professor pacing the floor.
  The teacher returned to his desk and invited the two students to sit
down. “I couldn’t sleep last night,” he began. “And it was because of you
two. I thought about you two and your Sabbath. I realize that your faith in
God is true and strong and powerful. Now I don’t want any problems with
your God, so I will let you take your math exam on Friday.”
  Jony and his friend smiled broadly and thanked their teacher. They
promised to present themselves at the appointed time on Friday. After tak-
ing their exam, they again thanked their teacher for allowing them to take
the test early. On Sabbath when their classmates were taking the exam,
Jony and his friend stood in church to tell the congregation what God had
done for them in softening the heart of their once-obstinate teacher.
  Our mission offerings help further the work in Angola, where almost
350,000 Adventists share their faith.

Jony Ernesto lives in Luanda, Angola.

          Lesson             9       *February 25–March 2



      The Bible and History




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 104:1–9, Rev. 1:1–3,
      2 Pet. 1:21, Daniel 2, Rev. 12:7–17, Rom. 16:20, 2 Cor. 5:17–19.

Memory Text: “ ‘I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning
      and the End,’ says the Lord, ‘who is and who was and who is to
      come, the Almighty’ ” (Revelation 1:8, NKJV).

Key Thought: Our God works in and through history, and in
      and through history He has given us powerful evidence for faith.



      I
          s human history a meaningless series of events, or is there a cen-
          tral direction toward a specified goal, all according to a plan? The
          Bible makes it clear that the latter is true. Bible writers in both
      testaments insist that God directs history and reveals Himself in it.
         Yet, not all history reveals God’s will: humans are free to make bad
      choices, choices that influence history. The point is that just because God
      works through history doesn’t mean He causes all that happens. What
      it means, instead, is that, despite the machinations and evil of human
      beings, God is there, working out His ultimate will and that He will bring
      human history to a grand and glorious close.
         Biblical Christians believe that the Bible writers operated within the
      framework that God had revealed and that He inspired them to record the
      most significant events in human history. God often even provides the
      interpretation of these events so that we can understand what they mean.
         This week we’ll explore a little of how God has worked in and through
      world history.

     The Past and the Future
        World history is usually taught as the history of civilizations. The
     significant facts are generally the ones that have had a bearing on the
     development of those civilizations. Some people argue that human
     affairs are, like the rest of nature, essentially cyclical in character, mov-
     ing endlessly through the cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decay, and
     death in a series that does not have a beginning or any significant end.
        The circular dial of a watch can be deceptive; as the hands revolve
     around and around, they can give the illusion that time recurs in a cycle.
     But this is not reality. The fact is that human life runs in a line, not in a
     renewing circle. Time, according to the Bible, is a one-way street.

What do biblical writers assert regarding human history’s beginning
     and end? Gen. 1:1; Job 38:1–7; Ps. 104:1–9; Rev. 1:1–3, 19; 21:1–6.

     _______________________________________________________

        Human history is not an unending series of repeated cycles. It had
     a definite beginning. It faces a glorious future. Human history has a
     point, a goal. Normally, you cannot be sure what the point of a story
     is until you have reached the end. There can always be surprises at the
     end, and in the best stories there often are. How, then, can we, who
     are still in this cosmic story, know the point? In our case, we know
     because God has, through His prophets, revealed it to us.
        We are talking, of course, about divine revelation. Our Lord knows
     the future, knows all the possible choices humans can and will freely
     make, and He has told us how it will turn out in the end, whatever
     choices we make in the meantime.

How is this revelation explained in the New Testament? 2 Pet. 1:21.

     _______________________________________________________

       Unless we distrust the Word of God and what it says about itself,
     we can know that the Lord knows the end and has revealed it to us.
     He’s not only the God of the past and the present, He’s the Lord of
     the future, as well. Thus, we can trust that the future will unfold as
     He has said it would.

      How easy is it to predict the future? How often have you gotten
      it wrong? The good news is that God does know the future, does
      know all that will happen. How can you draw comfort from the
      realization that a God of love knows about all that comes our
      way?

                                                                              73
                 M onday February 27

      The Prophets as Historians
        All through the Bible, the prophets use the phrase, “The word of the
      Lord” (or an equivalent “Thus says the Lord,” etc.). In short, what
      they are saying is, I am not speaking these truths to you; it’s God
      speaking them through me. So, you’d better listen.

How is this idea revealed in the following verses? Jer. 1:14–19.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        The reader is allowed to see the painful historical process by which
      the capital city Jerusalem is to be handed over to Babylon, in fulfill-
      ment of God’s predictions of Israel’s fate.
        Human kings, of course, rarely believe that history works this way.
      They imagine that their governing decisions shape public life. They
      think that they, ultimately, are in control. But Jeremiah (and other
      prophets) assert otherwise. Israel’s rulers discover that the historical
      process is leading the nation toward devastation and then exile. The
      book of Jeremiah is a stunning reminder of the power of God’s Word
      to be fulfilled in historical events.

How do Isaiah and Nahum testify to this similar point? Isa. 14:
      24–27, Nah. 1:5–10.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        This infinite power of God seen in human history is also exhibited
      in nature. Psalm 104, for example, describes the processes of nature
      not as a self-contained, autonomously functioning mechanism, but
      rather as processes in which God is acting at every moment. The Bible
      doesn’t portray God as having created the world and then leaving it
      on its own in complete subjection to natural laws. Natural laws are,
      indeed, part of how God sustains the world, but all of these laws are
      there only because He created and sustains them.

       Many scientists declare that the world began by accident and
       that it will end that way, as well. Hence, there’s not much mean-
       ing to all that comes in between (how could there be?). Why,
       deep down, do you know that this view can’t be right?

     Daniel 2 and the Providence
     of God in History
       In the 1700s, a Frenchman, an atheist, speculated that because all of
     the universe, including human actions, were predetermined by natural
     laws—then, ideally, if someone could know all of those laws and all
     the positions of all the particles in the universe at a given time, then
     that person could know everything that would happen.
       Of course, humans do have free will, free choice. God made us that
     way. As beings who can love, we had to be given free choice, because
     love that is forced cannot be love. To make us capable of love, God
     had to make us free. And yet, God’s power is so great that, even with
     human free will, He knows the future perfectly, regardless of the free
     choices that we make.

Review the prophecy of Daniel 2. In what ways is this one chapter
     powerful evidence, proof even, that God knows the future, and
     far in advance, too?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        This chapter was written more than twenty-six hundred years ago.
     Look at how history has unfolded exactly as God predicted. In one
     sense, this prophecy should be more meaningful for us today than for
     those who lived millennia ago. And that’s because we, today, looking
     back at history, can see exactly how these empires came and went,
     just as predicted. If you had read this prophecy during the time of
     Media-Persia, you wouldn’t have seen the rise and fall of the empires
     that followed. Today, looking back, we can see much more than
     someone from long ago could see. Thus, the prophecy holds a power
     for us that those in the past couldn’t appreciate.
        The amazing thing is that despite these millions of people, all with
     free will, who lived during the long epochs depicted in Daniel 2, the
     Lord knew exactly what was going to happen, what kingdoms would
     rise and fall. And He knew it way in advance.

      The prophet Daniel was right about the rise and fall of all those
      kingdoms: Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome, includ-
      ing the breakup of Rome into smaller powers that still exist
      today. From where we stand in history, the only kingdom left is
      the last one, God’s eternal kingdom (Dan. 2:44). If he was right
      about all the ones so far, how foolish would it be not to trust him
      about the last one?
                                                                         75

     The Great Controversy and History
        No matter how apparently chaotic, how seemingly out of control,
     human history is not unfolding in a vacuum. There’s a story behind it,
     a drama, a struggle between two radically different principles. We’re
     talking, of course, about the great controversy. Only with that back-
     ground can we even begin to get an understanding of human history
     and what it all means.

How do these texts help us to understand world history? Rev. 12:
     7–17; Job 2:1, 2; Isa. 14:12–14; Gen. 3:15; Eph. 6:12; Rom. 16:20.

         Satan is real, the battle is real, and only at the Cross was he defeated
     and his destruction made certain.
         “Heaven viewed with grief and amazement Christ hanging upon the
     cross. . . . Yet there stood men, formed in the image of God, joining to
     crush out the life of His only-begotten Son. What a sight for the heavenly
     universe! . . .
         “Satanic agencies confederated with evil men in leading the people to
     believe Christ the chief of sinners, and to make Him the object of detesta-
     tion. . . .
         “Satan saw that his disguise was torn away. His administration was laid
     open before the unfallen angels and before the heavenly universe. He had
     revealed himself as a murderer. By shedding the blood of the Son of God,
     he had uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings.
     . . . The last link of sympathy between Satan and the heavenly world was
     broken.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 760, 761.
         Why was Satan not destroyed then?
         “The angels did not even then understand all that was involved in the
     great controversy. The principles at stake were to be more fully revealed.
     And for the sake of man, Satan’s existence must be continued. Man as
     well as angels must see the contrast between the Prince of light and the
     prince of darkness. He must choose whom he will serve.”—The Desire
     of Ages, p. 761.
         What the Bible teaches, and Ellen White, too, is that events here on
     earth are linked to the wider conflict, the great controversy between Christ
     and Satan. This controversy forms the background motif for all that hap-
     pens here, whether in our individual lives or in the larger course of human
     history. Everything unfolds in the context of the great controversy. And
     the good news is that, after the Cross, Satan’s defeat was guaranteed,
     and this controversy will end, and with it all the pain and suffering and
     violence and fear and uncertainty that fill human history.

      The Cross in History
         Have you ever noticed that world history is divided by one event?
      That event was not the rise or fall of some major empire, as one would
      expect. Nor was it the discovery of a new continent. Instead, world
      history has been divided by the birth of a single itinerant rabbi living
      in a relatively obscure part of the vast Roman Empire. Considering
      the vast number of Jews born at this time, it’s even more revealing
      that this one birth, among so many, should be the marker that has
      divided world history into its two largest epochs.
         That birth, of course, is of Jesus.
         In the context of God and history, we can better appreciate the sig-
      nificance of salvation. For here, at the Cross—with the obvious failure
      of all humans, and thus, human history—is where the background and
      also the deepest meaning of world history unfold. The Cross tells us
      that, by forgiving us and making us His children, God has opened up
      a new future for us, a future in which we no longer need to drag along
      with us the enormous guilt of our past or of our personal history. This
      guilt has been taken away by One who “has borne our griefs and car-
      ried our sorrows” (Isa. 53:4, NKJV).
         The whole doctrine of salvation can be expressed in this one sen-
      tence: God cancels our hopelessly stranded history and in its place
      puts His history. Through Him, the history of slavery to sin is ended
      in our life. Through Him, the stains of the past should not rise up to
      accuse, torment, and mock us. Our personal history, which would
      condemn each one of us, is replaced with Jesus’ perfect history. Thus,
      in Him we find not only liberation from our past but the promise of
      a wonderful future. At the Cross, the Lord guaranteed that, whatever
      our history or whatever happened in world history, a new and glorious
      future awaits us and the world.

Read 2 Corinthians 5:17–19. According to these verses what did Jesus
      do for all humanity? How has this event changed human history?

      _______________________________________________________

        Our sins have been laid upon the shoulders of a Lord who willingly
      died beneath a load of human guilt and who, in its place, gave us
      salvation. And His promised climax of history will grant us eternal
      history with the Author of history. The destiny of every person is
      involved. The second coming of Christ will be decisive. Both the Old
      and New Testaments promise a “new heaven and a new earth.”

    Further Study: “The Bible is the most ancient and the most com-
         prehensive history that men possess. It came fresh from the fountain
         of eternal truth, and throughout the ages a divine hand has preserved
         its purity. . . . Here only do we find an authentic account of the origin
         of nations. Here only is given a history of our race unsullied by human
         pride or prejudice.
            “In the annals of human history the growth of nations, the rise and fall
         of empires, appear as dependent on the will and prowess of man. The
         shaping of events seems, to a great degree, to be determined by his power,
         ambition, or caprice. But in the word of God the curtain is drawn aside,
1
         and we behold, behind, above, and through all the play and counterplay
         of human interests and power and passions, the agencies of the all-
         merciful One, silently, patiently working out the counsels of His own will.
            “The Bible reveals the true philosophy of history.”—Ellen G. White,
         Education, p. 173.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 For years, philosophers and theologians have debated the issue
          of God’s foreknowledge and human free will. Many see the two
          ideas as incompatible. They argue either that we don’t have free will
          or that God doesn’t know the future. Why are both those positions
          wrong? What evidence do we have in the Bible that we do have free
          will? What evidence do we have that God does know the future?
3         The truth must be that, even with our free will, God knows future
          events before they unfold. Why is there no contradiction in the idea
          of God having foreknowledge of a choice that is freely made?

          l
          2 One of Satan’s harshest attacks is on Daniel 2, which provides
          such rational evidence for God’s existence. After all, what firmer
          foundation can you have for faith than something as solid and
          unchangeable as world history? Part of his attack is to use scholars
          to argue that Daniel 2 was written about 165 b.c., long after many
          of the events predicted in it already happened. Yet, the argument
          is destroyed by the prophecy itself. How could Daniel have so accu-
          rately predicted the break up of Rome into the nations of modern
          Europe, which didn’t happen until more than five or six hundred
          years later than 165 bc? If an amazing prediction like that required
          supernatural foreknowledge, why shouldn’t we then trust the book
          for what it says about itself and when it was written, as opposed to
          accepting a view that is refuted by the prophecy itself? The whole
          point of the late dating of Daniel is to try to denude it of its prophetic
          power. As we can see, this attempt fails, even miserably. Discuss.

    Summary: However chaotic world history can appear, above it all the
         Lord is working out His purposes, and human history will end with
         the glorious second coming of Jesus.

From Despair to Hope
by Dowell Chow
   Neng Suan cried out in agony. His son—his only son—was dead.
   Neng and his wife have five daughters, but, in their culture, girls count
for nothing. If someone asked Neng how many children he had, his
answer was, “I have a son.” A son meant stability, support in old age, and
hope for the future. But suddenly his only son, his pride and joy, was dead.
Now Neng had nothing, no hope, and no future.
   Neng and his family live in a village in Southeast Asia. In his culture, if
a couple dies without a son, the relatives swoop in and claim everything
the couple owns—their land, their home, their livestock—everything.
Daughters have no rights; it’s as if they don’t exist. And now Neng and
his wife had no son. His life became meaningless.
   Before his son died, Neng had been attending a Protestant church,
but when his son died, his hope and faith died with the boy. He stopped
attending church. His life became enshrouded in darkness. He began
drinking, and before long, he was smoking and chewing khaini, a tobacco-
lime product.
   Neng lost interest in his work and spent his days drinking. His whole
family gave up on him, except for his wife, who supported the family by
cultivating a few crops in her hillside garden. She tried to encourage her
distraught husband, but nothing seemed to bring peace to his troubled
soul.
   Then one night Neng turned on his radio looking for distraction. He
found a program that caught his interest. It was called the The Voice of
Hope. The speaker’s voice soothed him, and the message brought hope to
Neng’s heart. From that night on, Neng listened to the program.
   Neng learned that the speaker, Pastor Khan Suan, would be holding
meetings near his home. Neng decided to attend the meetings. His wife
went with him, and together they experienced the love of God anew. Neng
and his wife surrendered their lives to Christ and asked to be baptized.
   Neng claimed God’s promise in Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things
through Christ who strengthens me” (NKJV), and with Christ’s strength, he
gave up his self-destructive habits. People noticed the changes in Neng’s
life. “God understands my loss,” he says. “He gave His son to die for me.
Although I lost my precious son, I have found comfort in Christ.”
   Neng is glad that in his deepest sorrow, God sent him the message of
love through Adventist World Radio. Your mission offerings help support
this ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

      The Promise of Prayer




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Col. 4:2, Rom. 12:12, Matt.
      26:34–44, Heb. 11:6, James 4:2, John 14:15, 1 Thess. 4:3.

Memory Text: “Evening and morning and at noon I will pray,
      and cry aloud, and He shall hear my voice” (Psalm 55:17, NKJV).

Key Thought: In numerous places in the Bible, the Lord calls us to
      pray because prayer is an essential component of our walk with
      Him.



      E
              llen White gave us these words on the issue of prayer: “Our
              heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the fullness of His
              blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at the fountain of
      boundless love. What a wonder it is that we pray so little! God is
      ready and willing to hear the sincere prayer of the humblest of His
      children, and yet there is much manifest reluctance on our part to
      make known our wants to God. What can the angels of heaven think
      of poor helpless human beings, who are subject to temptation, when
      God’s heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them
      more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little and have
      so little faith? The angels love to bow before God; they love to be
      near Him. They regard communion with God as their highest joy; and
      yet the children of earth, who need so much the help that God only
      can give, seem satisfied to walk without the light of His Spirit, the
      companionship of His presence.”—Steps to Christ, p. 94.
        That about sums it all up, doesn’t it?

     The Power of Prayer
        One day, a young man received a letter from a former co-worker,
     someone who had retired a number of years earlier. The two workers,
     to put it mildly, hadn’t gotten along; the one who had left, had from
     the start, treated the other one badly. Anyway, the remaining worker
     opened the letter and started to read. Among the words were the fol-
     lowing: “You know, I don’t understand how prayer works, never did, at
     least intellectually. I do know, however, that we have been told to pray
     and over the past few weeks, as I’ve been praying, I’ve been greatly
     convicted about how I treated you all that time. I see that I was wrong,
     un-Christlike, and a horrible witness for my faith. I know I should have
     done this a long time ago, but I do sincerely apologize. I have to claim
     Christ’s forgiveness for what I have done, no matter how unworthy I
     am, and now I ask for your forgiveness as well.”
        In many ways, this story exemplifies the power of prayer. It’s not
     so much to get God to move mountains, although that can happen.
     Instead, it can cause something even more miraculous: it can change
     the human heart.
        As the person wrote, prayer isn’t always easy to understand. Why
     ask God for something if He knows about it already? Will God not
     do something unless we ask for it first? Can our prayers really change
     what the Creator God will do?
        Whether we understand how prayer works or not, one thing is cer-
     tain: without it, our walk with the Lord is destined to failure.

Read the following texts. What main point do they all have in com-
     mon? Matt. 26:41, Luke 18:1, 1 Tim. 2:8, 1 Thess. 5:17, 1 Pet. 4:7,
     Col. 4:2, Rom. 12:12.

     _______________________________________________________

       No question, as Christians we are told to pray and to pray often.
     That we might not understand how prayer works is, really, beside the
     point. Most of us don’t fully understand how anything works, be it
     secular or sacred. If we waited until we fully understood all the issues
     regarding our faith, then it would hardly be faith, would it? The very
     word faith itself implies that there are elements beyond our intellec-
     tual grasp. One thing, though, that anyone who prays consistently and
     fervently—and according to the will of God—can testify to is that
     prayer can, and does, change our lives.			

      What is your understanding of prayer? How has it impacted
      your life? Where would you be in your Christian walk without
      prayer?

                                                                         81

     Jesus, the Praying Messiah
What do the following texts teach us about Jesus and prayer? What
     is the context of each verse?


     Luke 3:21, 22____________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

     Luke 9:28, 29____________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

     Luke 6:12, 13____________________________________________

     Matt. 26:34–44___________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

       Jesus, the spotless Son of God, the One who was without sin,
     without fault, the One who lived in perfect harmony with the will of
     the Father, obviously had a powerful prayer life. (The above verses
     don’t even include Jesus’ prayer in John 17.) If Jesus needed to pray
     in order to deal with the things He faced, how much more do we?
     Christ’s example of prayer makes it abundantly clear how central
     prayer needs to be in our walk with the Lord. It’s hard to imagine
     anyone having any kind of relationship with God without that person
     praying. If communication is crucial to maintaining relationships with
     other people, how much more so in a relationship with God? Jesus
     gives us an example. It’s up to us to make the choice to follow it.

      How consistent is your prayer life? How distracted are you from
      praying? Do you pray consistently or when you are in trouble?
      How can you make prayer central in your walk with the Lord?

      The Prayer of Faith
        “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
      cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder
      of them that diligently seek him” (Heb. 11:6). What important
      principles does this text teach us in regard to what is required for
      prayer and what it means to us?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         In a sense, prayer is a way of coming to God, of opening oneself
      up to Him. We don’t pray so that God will know the things that we
      need. After all, Jesus Himself said, in the context of prayer, that “your
      Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him” (Matt.
      6:8, NKJV). We pray because prayer is a way of exercising our faith
      in God. It’s a means of making our faith stronger, more real, and
      practical. Who hasn’t experienced how fervent, unwavering prayer,
      offered with a sense of dependence and need, has increased one’s
      faith and deepened one’s relationship with God?
         Prayer is a way of helping to empty self of self. It’s a way to die
      daily. It’s a way to reconnect with God on a very personal level. It’s
      a way to remind yourself that you are not your own, that you have
      been bought with a price, and that left to yourself you would crumble
      and die in a world full of powers and forces that could, in an instant,
      trample you into the dirt.

So often we hear the phrase “seek the Lord in prayer.” What does that
      mean to you? See Dan. 9:3, 4; Zech. 8:21.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        To a great degree, every prayer is an act of faith. Who can see their
      prayers extend to heaven? Who can see God receive them? Often we pray
      without seeing immediate results; yet, we go on faith that God hears and
      will answer in the best way possible. Prayer is an act of faith in which we
      reach out beyond what we see or feel or even fully understand.

       How much of your prayer life is rote and static, as opposed to
       deep and heartfelt? How can you move away from the former
       toward the latter?
                                                                             83

     Because You Do Not Ask
       One of the questions that those who pray often ask is, “Can my
     prayers really move God to do something that, otherwise, He might
     not do?” That’s a logical question. To answer it, all we can do is go
     to the Word of God and see what it says.

Read James 4:2; Luke 11:9, 10; James 5:16–18. What do these texts
     say about our prayers and the actions of God?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

      However much prayer changes us and impacts our relationship with
     God and others, the Bible is very clear that our prayers influence what
     God does. We ask and He responds, one way or another.

Read Genesis 18:22–33. How do we see this principle at work here?
     _______________________________________________________

       Again, whatever the philosophical difficulties associated with
     understanding this truth, God does respond to human prayers. He said
     that He does, and so we have to take Him at His Word.

       “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble them-
     selves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked
     ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and
     will heal their land” (2 Chron. 7:14, NIV). What does this text
     teach us about prayer?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Notice, however, that God isn’t going to heal their land just because
     they ask. They are called to pray, but prayer is only one aspect of a
     general revival on their part.
        Perhaps the most important example of this principle is here: “If we
     confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and
     purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9, NIV). Here, we see a
     powerful link between prayer (in this case, confession) and God’s action
     in our lives. We confess our sins, and He forgives them, a process that
     also results in His cleansing us from our unrighteousness. The clear idea
     implied here is that if we don’t pray, don’t confess, we aren’t forgiven.
     No question, in these cases, God acts in response to our prayers.

     Complying With Conditions
        Someone sits in a restaurant, consuming a large meal, filled with
     fatty food that he or she washes down with a soft drink. He or she then
     finishes off with a large bowl of chocolate ice cream covered in hot
     fudge. That night, before going to bed (and having a little snack before
     then, too), he or she kneels to pray. Part of his or her prayer is, “O Lord,
     please help me lose weight.”
        What’s wrong with this picture?
        The fact is, we can expect God to answer our prayers, but there are
     things we need to do in the process. It has been said that we need to
     live out our prayers; that is, we need to do all that we can, in our power,
     to see them answered. This isn’t humanism, nor is it showing a lack of
     faith. On the contrary, it’s part of what living by faith is all about.
        “If we regard iniquity in our hearts, if we cling to any known sin,
     the Lord will not hear us; but the prayer of the penitent, contrite soul is
     always accepted. When all known wrongs are righted, we may believe
     that God will answer our petitions. Our own merit will never commend
     us to the favor of God; it is the worthiness of Jesus that will save us, His
     blood that will cleanse us; yet we have a work to do in complying with
     the conditions of acceptance.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 95.
        She’s not saying that we have to be perfect in order to have our
     prayers answered. She’s clear, too, that our acceptance with God is not
     based on us, or on our merit, but only on the merits of Christ for us. She
     is saying that we have to be in an attitude of faith, humility, and surren-
     der to God’s will in order for Him to be able to work in our lives.

How do the following texts help us to understand what it means to
     “comply with the conditions”? See Heb. 10:38, Deut. 4:29, Luke
     9:23, John 14:15, 1 Thess. 4:3.
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

       Perhaps, of all the conditions necessary for us to have an effective
     prayer life, the central one is our own sense of need, our own sense
     of helplessness, our own sense that we are sinners in need of grace,
     and that our only hope exists in the Lord who has done so much for
     us. To be arrogant, self-assured, and full of oneself is a recipe for
     spiritual disaster.

      What are the things you’re praying fervently for? As you pray,
      ask yourself, What could I be doing differently that could help
      bring about the answer that I so desperately want?
                                                                             85
                       F riday March 9

    Further Study: “Prayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of
          spiritual power. No other means of grace can be substituted, and the
          health of the soul be preserved. Prayer brings the heart into immedi-
          ate contact with the Well-spring of life, and strengthens the sinew
          and muscle of the religious experience.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel
          Workers, pp. 254, 255.
             “When we do not receive the very things we asked for, at the
1
          time we ask, we are still to believe that the Lord hears and that He
          will answer our prayers. We are so erring and shortsighted that we
          sometimes ask for things that would not be a blessing to us, and our
          heavenly Father in love answers our prayers by giving us that which
          will be for our highest good—that which we ourselves would desire
          if with vision divinely enlightened we could see all things as they
2
          really are. When our prayers seem not to be answered, we are to cling
          to the promise; for the time of answering will surely come, and we
          shall receive the blessing we need most. But to claim that prayer will
          always be answered in the very way and for the particular thing that
          we desire, is presumption. God is too wise to err, and too good to
          withhold any good thing from them that walk uprightly. Then do not
          fear to trust Him, even though you do not see the immediate answer
          to your prayers.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 96.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 What do you say to someone who asks, “Why pray, if God
           knows all things in advance”?
           									
           l2 Who, at times, doesn’t struggle with the question of answered
           and unanswered prayer? For instance, someone prays that their
           car not break down on a trip and, when the car doesn’t break
           down, they attribute the happy circumstances to answered
           prayers. This is fine. But what do you say to the person who also
           prayed, in this case that their child wouldn’t die, and yet the
           child dies? How do we understand these things? Or can we?

           l
           3 What is the role of the Holy Spirit in our prayer life?


           l4 Imagine in class someone new arrives and he or she asks,
           “Can you teach me what it means to pray? How should I pray?
           Why should I pray? And what should I expect when I do pray,
           and what should I not expect?” How would you answer?

    Summary: No question, there are a lot of things about prayer that we
          don’t grasp. But those who pray do know one thing for sure: prayer
          will change your life, and for the better, as well.

The Noisy Neighbor
by Bobby Wagh
   Raju heard the singing coming from the neighbor’s house and turned his
music up as loud as possible. Sometimes he could still hear the singing,
and he shouted abuses at the little group of Seventh-day Adventist believ-
ers who worshiped next door.
   Other neighbors avoided confronting Raju about his actions. They left
the handling of the troublesome neighbor to the Seventh-day Adventists.
The believers visited Raju and offered to pray for him and his family. But
their kindnesses only irritated Raju more. He purposely chose the believ-
ers’ worship time to bathe his idols and pray to them.
   Raju’s first child died shortly after birth, but the man refused to let the
believers pray with him. When his second child also died shortly after
birth, Raju worshiped his gods with renewed vigor. But then his third
child died, and Raju felt desperate. He ceased worshiping his idols and
stored them inside his house.
   When Raju’s wife became pregnant again, Raju was filled with fear
that he might lose both his wife and the child she carried. Once more the
Seventh-day Adventists offered to pray with Raju and his wife about the
unborn child, but still Raju refused.
   The child was born apparently healthy, but soon he developed jaundice,
just as his older siblings had. The doctors told Raju that only a full blood
transfusion would save the baby. Raju felt powerless and desperate.
   The Seventh-day Adventists learned of the baby’s illness and visited
the family in the hospital. Raju was distraught over his tiny son’s fragile
condition. Desperate, he allowed his Seventh-day Adventist neighbors to
pray for his wife and son. The group gathered around the bed and ear-
nestly petitioned God on behalf of mother and child.
   As the baby grew stronger, Raju and his wife rejoiced. They realized
that their son was alive because the God of the Seventh-day Adventists
had shown mercy on them. Raju and his wife began attending the church
next door to their house, and in time, they gave their hearts to the Lord.
They threw their idols into the river and asked to be baptized.
   Now, instead of raising a ruckus with loud music during the believers’
worship service, Raju sings God’s praises loud and clear. He is sharing
his love for God with others and helping the little group grow. Our mis-
sion offerings help raise up congregations in areas such as Raju’s, where
few believers live. Thank you for helping to share God’s love through
your mission offerings.

      God as Artist




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 64:5–8, Ps. 51:10,
  1 Chron. 23:5, Heb. 8:1–5, Rom. 11:33–36, Acts 9:1–22.
     			
Memory Text: “One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I
  seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my
  life, to behold the beauty of the Lord” (Psalm 27:4, NKJV).

Key Thought: God as artist?



      S
             o far, we’ve looked at various aspects of the Lord: the Trinity,
             God’s holiness, and God as Redeemer. There is one picture of
             God in Scripture, however, that is rarely given attention—God
      as artist.
         Many people claim they have no interest in art. Many Christians
      know little about it. They may know what they like, but that is noth-
      ing more than knowledge about themselves. Others acknowledge that
      art exists, but they never consider its value or relevance. Christianity
      has often been ambivalent about the arts. At times, the arts have been
      denounced as irreligious and evil; other times, aesthetics have become
      a secular “religion” with serious devotees. There are also plenty of
      Christian writers, but they have seldom made attempts to relate the
      concept of “beauty” to the central Christian doctrines.
         “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” wrote poet John Keats. While Keats
      certainly overstated the case, God is indeed Truth, and the Truth is
      beautiful. Creation itself testifies to the fact that God is an artist and a
      lover of what’s beautiful.

     God as Potter
       “But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and
     thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand” (Isa. 64:8).

When is the first time the Bible reveals God displaying His skills
     working with “clay”? Gen. 1:26, 27, 31; 2:7.

     _______________________________________________________

        Scripture opens with God creating the first humans out of the “dust
     of the ground.” In fact, the Hebrew word for “man,” adam, is closely
     tied to the Hebrew word for “ground,” which is adamah—a linguistic
     link that enforces the amazing truth about God’s skill as a “potter.” He
     truly formed us out of the clay of the ground. It’s hard to imagine how a
     human being, with our blood and bones and skin and nerves and all of the
     amazing parts of our body, could have been formed from the ground. Our
     existence is a miracle that far surpasses human understanding.
         In a sense, though the “potter” image works, in that the Lord used
     clay to form us, in other ways (as is with most imagery seeking to
     explain God’s work and power) it hardly does justice to His creativ-
     ity and artistry. After all, what potter can take clay and turn it into a
     living, breathing thing?

Read Jeremiah 18:3–10, Isaiah 64:5–8, Psalm 51:10. How is the
     imagery of God as potter used in some of these texts?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Among the concepts revealed in these verses is the idea of just how
     helpless we are before the power of God. We are, in a sense, like clay
     in the hands of a potter; the potter, not the clay, is in charge.
       At the same time, God is working to re-create in us His image.
     However much God cares about His physical creation, how much
     more would He care about the beauty of what He can do in us? We are
     to surrender, to die to self, and to cooperate with the Lord, who seeks
     to re-create and restore to us, as much as possible, the original spiri-
     tual and moral beauty that we once had. Sure, outside appearances can
     be beautiful, but inner beauty is what really matters.

      Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky created a fictional character
      who had, Dostoevsky said, a “beautiful soul.” What is your idea
      of a “beautiful soul,” and what things in you do, and do not,
      correspond to that ideal?
                                                                          89

     God as Architect
After God dramatically delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt, He
     brought them to Mount Sinai. There, He joined them to Himself
     in a sacred covenant. Among all the varied instructions He gave
     them there, how was beauty included? Exod. 25:1–9.


        The first half of the book of Exodus details the miraculous deliver-
     ance of Israel from Egypt. The second half of the book deals with issues
     that include beauty. The divine instructions of Exodus 25:1–9 are fol-
     lowed by Exodus 25:10–31:11, with God’s “blueprints” for the portable
     tent sanctuary, its furnishings, and the priestly vestments. From Exodus
     35:1 to the end of the book (Exod. 40:38) are found God’s detailed
     descriptions, along with the record of the precise accomplishment of
     them. This record includes extensive details of artistry.
        This collection of details is tedious reading to many modern
     Christians. But it pleased God not only to present these many instruc-
     tions to the newly freed slaves but also to include them in Scripture.
        There are almost fifty chapters in the first five books of the Bible
     that record God’s precise directives regarding a beautiful sanctuary.
     He provides not only the architectural blueprints but also the exact
     directions for the furnishings. It is significant that on Mount Sinai
     God gave not only the Decalogue, His instructions for obedience
     within the covenant, but also specific directions of how to fashion a
     lavish structure involving almost every type of artistic skill.
        God was architect of it all, even inspiring the artisans to craft the
     minute details of decoration. Nothing was left to human devising.
     There are more chapters regarding the plans for, and consequent
     building of, this sanctuary and its furnishings than for any other sub-
     ject in the first five books of Moses.

Upon what was the earthly sanctuary modeled, and what does that
     tell us about God’s love of beauty? Exod. 25:9, Heb. 8:1–5.


       If the earthly sanctuary was only a “shadow” of the heavenly, we
     can hardly begin to imagine the kind of beauty that must exist in the
     real sanctuary, the one made by God Himself.

      Why do you think it was important for the sanctuary to be so
      beautiful? Perhaps to give the people a sense of awe before the
      power and grandeur of God? Maybe to help them sense their
      own need before such grandeur? How can understanding the
      glory of the sanctuary better help us to grasp the character of
      God in contrast to our own earthliness and sinfulness?

      God as Musician
        “ ‘Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are
      to praise the Lord with the musical instruments I have provided
      for that purpose’ ” (1 Chron. 23:5, NIV).

         Try to envision the scene above: four thousand people playing
      musical instruments in praise of the Lord! That must have been an
      amazing worship service.
         God’s artistic expression is not restricted to the representational
      arts. In Scripture we find that, along with sacred architecture, Israel’s
      liturgy was inspired by the Lord. God is a lover of beautiful music,
      as well.

How does King David describe his composition of the psalms Israel
      used in worship? 2 Sam. 23:1, 2.

        David was clear that he was inspired by the Lord to write the songs
      that he did. Although this doesn’t mean that the Lord wrote the words
      and music for him, it does mean that the Lord cared about the kind of
      music that was played. Otherwise, why bother to inspire it?

Read 2 Chonicles 29:25. What does this verse tell us about the role of the
      Lord in the music that was played in Israel’s worship services?

        Throughout the Old Testament, when temple worship is recounted,
      music is evident and impressive. Picture, for instance, the worship
      atmosphere described in 1 Chronicles 23:5. Four thousand instruments!
      Whatever the music must have sounded like, it certainly wasn’t boring
      or dry!
        It might be argued that aesthetic dimensions could be expected
      within sacred worship and that throughout history all nations have
      exhibited such in worship of their gods. However, Israel alone insists
      that God Himself designed every aspect of His worship, including
      architecture, furniture, priestly attire, and liturgy. There can be no
      doubt that artistic design is sanctioned in the Word of God. Anyone
      who rejects the aesthetic dimension, or who denies that being an artist
      can be a relevant vocation for a Christian, does so against the record
      of Scripture.

       Although we don’t have the music that accompanied Israelite
       worship, it must have been beautiful, and it certainly must
       have lifted their souls toward the Lord. How does music in our
       church function today? How can we be sure that it does the
       same thing, that is, lift our souls toward the Lord, as opposed
       to pushing us in another direction?
                                                                           91

     God as Author
       Bible scholars have often been impressed by the incredible literary
     quality of the Bible. Many secular colleges also teach courses on the Bible
     simply for its literary beauty, not because they view it as God’s Word.
       As Christians, we have the blessing not only of enjoying the literary
     beauty of the Scriptures but of learning the truths about God as revealed
     in the Bible. No doubt, too, the artful construction of the narratives
     and the poetry, all influenced by the Spirit of the Lord (yet written out
     through the words of God’s prophets), goes a long way in helping us to
     understand the truth contained therein.
       The apostle Paul, for instance, with his complex theological discourse,
     regularly punctuates his theology with powerful literary devices. For
     example, in the first eleven chapters of the book of Romans, Paul gives
     a comprehensive account of the gospel. Look through these chapters
     and note the various topics Paul weaves together.

Read Romans 11:33–36. Compare these texts with Romans 11:1–32.

        Like a hiker who has reached the summit of a high mountain, the
     apostle—who has taken in the vast panorama of salvation history—
     now bursts into praise. Before Paul goes on to outline the practical
     implications of the gospel, he worships.
        Paul exhibits this subtle literary rhythm several times in his epistles
     and letters: intricate theological reasoning interlaced with praise to
     God before concluding with practical counsel.
        The book of Revelation also is filled with an imposing mosaic of lit-
     erary devices through which God portrays salvation history. Much of
     the book was taken from the Old Testament. The reader is presented
     with an exceedingly complex tapestry of words, phrases, and themes
     borrowed from other biblical writers but now woven together into an
     entirely new fabric. This final book in the Bible is in a style vastly
     different from what Paul and the Gospel writers used. Instead, we
     are almost overwhelmed with a profound aesthetic display carefully
     structured around seven scenes of the heavenly sanctuary, each one
     opening with deeper access into the heavenly court.
        The book of Revelation is an extensive aesthetic display. God could
     have furnished John with a standard historical document to present the
     course of the salvation story. Instead, what we find are stunning picto-
     rial vistas portraying the working out of the great controversy between
     Christ and Satan, and expanding on the imposing apocalyptic display
     given earlier to Daniel and Ezekiel.

      Imagine reading the Bible only as literature. Talk about missing
      the point! What lessons can we learn about how easily we can
      have truth right before our eyes and yet miss it completely?

     God as a Sculptor
       God is also a sculptor, but not one limited to granite or marble.
     Instead, He sculpts our characters. He can take a sinful human being
     and mold and chisel and hammer away until that person reflects
     something of heaven’s glory. God has given extensive evidence of
     such profound skills. From cover to cover in Scripture, we find God
     taking persons we might disregard as unattractive and unworthy and
     fashioning them into something beautiful.

Who are some characters in the Bible who needed a bit of spiritual
     sculpting, as it were? What needed changes were made in their
     lives? For instance, Jacob (Gen. 32:22–30); David (Psalm 51);
     Peter (Luke 22:31, 32); Paul (Acts 9:1–22). Whom else can you
     think of, and what kind of changes came about in them?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Another good example is Mary Magdalene. “Mary had been . . . a
     great sinner, but Christ knew the circumstances that had shaped her
     life. . . . It was He who had lifted her from despair and ruin. Seven
     times she had heard His rebuke of the demons that controlled her
     heart and mind. She had heard His strong cries to the Father in her
     behalf. She knew how offensive is sin to His unsullied purity, and in
     His strength she had overcome. . . . [This woman] who had fallen, and
     whose mind had been a habitation of demons, was brought very near
     to the Saviour in fellowship and ministry. . . . Mary stood beside the
     Cross. . . . Mary was first at the tomb after His resurrection. It was
     Mary who first proclaimed a risen Saviour.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Desire of Ages, p. 568.
        Salvation history is full of divine creativity, restoring in fallen men
     and women the lost “image of God.” The gospel is no cosmetic face-
     lift but a matter of life-changing orientation running deep and swift in
     its power to cleanse, shape, and beautify. The gospel of Jesus Christ
     creatively builds with integrity and wholeness. Genuine newness
     is the result of an inward dynamic at work, a divine creativity that
     restores beauty to a fallen, sinful life.
       									
       Sculpting involves chiseling, filing, maybe even the breaking off
       of parts. What areas in your life need to be sculpted a bit more?
       How much resistance do you put up during a process that isn’t
       always fun?

                                                                           93

    Further Study: “Let the converting power of God be experienced
          in the heart of the individual members, and then we shall see the deep
          moving of the Spirit of God. Mere forgiveness of sin is not the sole
          result of the death of Jesus. He made the infinite sacrifice not only
          that sin might be removed, but that human nature might be restored,
          rebeautified, reconstructed from its ruins, and made fit for the pres-
          ence of God.”—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 6, p. 11,
          emphasis added.

             “How earnestly and perseveringly the artist labors to transfer to
          canvas a perfect likeness of his model; and how diligently the sculptor
          hews and chisels out the stone into a counterpart of the copy he is fol-
          lowing. So the parents should labor to shape, polish, and refine their
          children after the pattern given them in Christ Jesus. As the patient
          artist studies, and works, and forms plans to make the results of his
2
          labors more perfect, so should the parent consider time well spent that
          is occupied in training the children for useful lives and fitting them
          for the immortal kingdom. The artist’s work is small and unimportant
          compared with that of the parent. The one deals with lifeless material,
          from which he fashions forms of beauty; but the other deals with a
          human being whose life can be shaped for good or ill, to bless human-
          ity or to curse it; to go out in darkness, or to live forever in a future
          sinless world.”—Ellen G. White, Child Guidance, pp. 476, 477.

    Discussion Questions:
           l1 What opportunity have you had to develop and use any artistic
           skills? As you created something of beauty, how have you been
           mindful that this act of creation is one way in which you are reflect-
           ing the “image of God”? That is, by being creative, how are you in
           your own way reflecting the creative power of the Lord. 		
           							
           l2 Look around at the created world, at nature, even after it
           has been so long defiled by sin. In what ways does it powerfully
           testify not only to the creative power of God but to His artistic
           mastery and love of beauty? What things in nature do you find
           truly beautiful and why?

           l
           3 As we said in the introduction, Christians have always had some
           ambivalence about the arts. Why would that be? What are some of
           the pitfalls in art? At the same time, how can we use our own artistic
           gifts in a way that glorifies God and advances His kingdom?

    Summary: God’s skills as an artist have been underrated. His created
          world is often appreciated, but the expression of His artistic skills
          extends His great abilities much further. God designs that Christians
          especially should be a source of “beauty” in a dark and dying planet.

One Year for God
   One doesn’t think of Denmark as a mission field, but with just 2,500
Seventh-day Adventists in the country, there’s a lot of work to be done
in this post-modern secular society. To help finish the work, youth are
volunteering to spend a year serving in various ministries in a program
called One Year for God, sponsored by the Danish Union and Adventist
Volunteer Services.
   Among these youth are Bjarne Rasmussen and Kim Larsen, two young
men in their twenties. Bjarne, a pastor’s son, wanted to get serious about
his faith. He took a short-term study course in lay evangelism and hoped to
become a Bible worker in the Danish Union. When finances didn’t allow
the union to hire him full-time, he volunteered to serve. “Who am I to call
myself a Christian and not introduce others to Jesus?” Bjarne asks.
   A learning disability made advanced studies tedious for Kim, so he took
a break from his studies. God led him to the One Year for God program.
“It’s a good fit,” he says.
   The two young men work together to find people who are searching for
something in their lives. Danish law forbids them from going door-to-door
to sell books, so Kim and Bjarne give out flyers offering a free Bible along
with Bible studies. Then they follow up with interested people. After four
months they were studying with seven people. In Denmark, that’s a good
result.
   Danes love to read, so the men sometimes give out free books to people
who pass by on a street corner. And they held an open church worship
service to celebrate the 125th anniversary of one of the oldest Seventh-day
Adventist churches in Denmark. People came.
   “It’s difficult to find people in Denmark who are interested in God,”
Kim says. “People live comfortable lives with plenty of material things.
But we’ve found people hungry to know God.”
   One man reported reading the Bible to give him peace at work. Even
though he’s not yet a practicing Christian, he’s discovering God’s Word
and His love. Another woman who is studying the Bible lessons grew up
in the state church. She says that God had never been part of her life until
she faced difficult times. Now she is turning to Christ for answers.
    “Working One Year for God is strengthening my personal walk with
God. I’m so grateful to be a part of His plan,” Kim says.
   Materials for the One Year for God program are funded in part through
the mission and world budget offerings. Thank you for serving God
through mission giving.

      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 2:21–25, Exod. 20:5,
      Isa. 43:4, 62:5, Song of Songs, John 2:1–11.

Memory Text: “The Lord has appeared of old to me, saying:
      ‘Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with
      lovingkindness I have drawn you’ ” (Jeremiah 31:3, NKJV).

Key Thought: How are we to understand the loving side of God?


      L
              ove is, perhaps, the most readily recalled attribute of God. And,
              indeed, we cannot overestimate God’s love, nor exhaust the
              depth of it. But perhaps there is one aspect of His deep love
      that is not duly regarded; that is, God as a romantic.
         To get a proper perspective on God’s romantic nature, we need to
      remind ourselves, first of all, of the time frame exhibited in the Bible.
      This book covers thousands of years of human history. And like all
      history books, the Bible as a whole contains records of kings and
      queens, wars and battle plans, and political intrigue.
        No history book, though, records everything. The same is true of
      Scripture. One does not find an exhaustive historical record in the
      broad scope of time that the Bible covers. A lot of things are skipped
      over. Most interestingly, though, is that God includes tender romances
      within the historical record He inspired the prophets to write. The
      question is, Why would the Lord include these kinds of love stories,
      stories of romance, in what is so much a history book? Does that tell
      us something about His own nature and how importantly He views
      romance? This week we’ll look at why these accounts are included
      and what we can learn from them.

      The First Romance
        “And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of
      my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out
      of Man” (Gen. 2:23).
        						
        We need to begin with the initial chapters of Genesis for the first
      romance in Scripture, that of Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve are special
      creations of God. Both male and female reflect His image (Gen. 1:26,
      27). Both Adam and Eve receive their life as a result of God’s incredible
      creative power. The complexity of our physical bodies remains one of the
      most powerful testimonies to the wisdom and might of our Creator.

Read the biblical account of the creation of Eve (Gen. 2:21–25). How
      would you describe the kind of relationship between them as
      depicted in this account?

        Perhaps the most obvious point from this account is just how inti-
      mately and closely tied together these two are. God creates the woman
      out of the body of the man; they are, literally, of the same flesh and
      blood.
        Adam then breaks out into what has been called the Bible’s first
      “love song” or “love poem,” in which he openly acknowledges just
      how closely tied each is to the other. In Hebrew, the word for “man”
      that he uses in verse 23 is ish; the word he uses for “woman” is ishah,
      again showing just how closely tied they are.
        In verse 24, the Bible says that a man will leave his parents and
      cleave unto his wife, and they shall be “one flesh,” another power-
      ful indicator of the intimacy meant for them. (Some have wondered,
      What parents is the Bible talking about here, because there were none
      then? The point is, Moses wrote this account many centuries after it
      happened, and he used the story of their creation to explain in more
      detail what marriage meant.)
        Finally, their nakedness also revealed the intense closeness and
      intimacy between this first couple.
        Whatever else their relationship originally entailed, romantic love
      was certainly a major part of it. God is not against romance. On the
      contrary, He created us as beings capable of experiencing it. In fact,
      that seems to be one of the basic elements He created in us.

       Romantic love is such a wonderful, God-given gift to humanity.
       If you are in a proper romantic relationship, what things can
       you do to protect it from all that can go wrong?

     Biblical Romances
       Although the Bible covers a lot of history, it has made time to
     depict some romances. There was a strong, affectionate bond between
     Abraham and Sarah. He doesn’t desert her during her long years of
     barrenness. In fact, it is only at Sarah’s urging that Abraham takes
     Hagar as a surrogate wife. The ties of love between Abraham and
     Sarah are strong. (See Genesis 16.)
       It takes a lengthy chapter in Genesis to record Abraham’s servant’s
     long trip to find Isaac a wife. Upon his return with Rebecca, the
     inspired account includes another love story. (See Genesis 24.)
       Another romance given a lot of time in the Bible is the one between
     Jacob and Rachel. In quick strokes, the picture is painted of Jacob’s
     impulsive and warm response to Rachel. Apart from the Song of
     Songs, there isn’t another example in Scripture of a man and a woman
     kissing, certainly not before marriage. And if we recall that God is the
     ultimate author of Scripture, and through His inspiration the book of
     Genesis was written, we are reminded that God is a romantic, because
     He includes this love story and this kiss in the Bible. (See Genesis
     29.) (If you were writing a history book spanning thousands of years,
     covering the creation of humankind and its Fall, why would you
     include this romantic detail?) In the historical period enclosed within
     the book of Genesis, there must be many time gaps. Yet, God inspired
     the inclusion of these warm love stories.

Go back over the stories of these romances. Whatever the love that
     existed, these accounts are in many ways similar to romance and
     love stories all over the world; that is, these people faced many
     challenges and suffered from the mistakes of one or both parties.
     What were some of the things done wrong that brought so much
     pain and suffering to these relationships? Most important, how
     can we learn from their mistakes?

      Unfortunately, many have made similar mistakes, or even
      worse. The good news is that God not only forgives, He heals.

      to seek the forgiveness and healing that come from the Cross?

     God’s Love
       Genesis shows, right from the start, that romance was to be a basic
     part of the human experience. One man with one woman, period. That
     was God’s ideal, the biblical prototype that models what romantic
     love was to be about.
       It’s fascinating, too, how often the Bible uses imagery of love, of
     marriage, to depict the kind of love relationship God seeks with His
     people. Nothing is to be more intimate than a husband and a wife—
     except, perhaps, a person’s individual relationship with God.

Read Exodus 20:5. What word in there reveals God’s feelings toward
     His people? How are we to understand that word in the context
     of God?

     _______________________________________________________

       Many times God expresses His jealousy over His people. (See also
     Exod. 34:14, Deut. 4:24, Joel 2:18.) Jealousy is a feeling lovers get
     when they think that their beloved is not faithful to them. God is not a
     distant, nonfeeling, impersonal benign “force.” He is a personal Being
     with profound affection for the human family. However hard it is for
     us to grasp, God does love us and, like any lover, He is pained by our
     unfaithfulness.

Look up the following texts. What are they saying? How do they help
     us to understand God’s feelings toward us? Isa. 43:4, 62:5, Ezek.
     16:1–15, Jer. 31:3, Rev. 21:9.

     _______________________________________________________

       The Bible openly teaches that God deeply loves individual human
     beings. This is not an easy concept to grasp, only because the concept
     of God, the Creator of the universe, isn’t an easy concept to grasp.
     After all, we can barely understand the universe as a whole; how
     much less, then, the One who created it? At the same time, though,
     God has not only declared His love for us, He has shown it to us in
     many powerful ways. The greatest, of course, is the Cross and what
     happened there. What more proof do we need of God’s love for us
     than what we have been given at Calvary?

      Think what it would mean were God to hate us or to be indiffer-
      ent to us or to merely like us. But the Bible says that God loves
      us. What does that mean to you, personally, and how does this
      amazing idea (that God loves us) influence how you live?

                                                                         99

      A Book of Romance
         Libraries could be filled with books that deal with the difficult ques-
      tion of human suffering, difficult especially for those who believe in a
      loving and all-powerful God (for the atheist, suffering is merely part
      of what it means to live in a godless and meaningless universe and
      thus doesn’t present the difficult philosophical questions it does for
      Christians). However, without an understanding of the great contro-
      versy between Christ and Satan, most of those books don’t make much
      headway (even with an understanding of the cosmic drama, the ques-
      tion of suffering is, indeed, difficult enough).
         And although the question of human suffering touches all aspects of
      life, we mustn’t forget life’s pleasures either. Why does food taste so
      good? Why so many taste buds perfectly matched to sense the many
      appealing flavors in food? Why are there so many shades of color? Why
      is the human eye able to connect with, and revel in, all the vivid colors?
      Why the joy of married sexuality? Reproduction certainly doesn’t require
      the kind of pleasure that sexual activity offers. Some forms of life simply
      split in half to reproduce. Imagine if that were what we went through in
      order to reproduce. Even now, humans occasionally use methods of arti-
      ficial insemination that don’t involve pleasure. Why do we have the exact
      nerve endings needed to enjoy sensory pleasure, even sexual pleasure?
         The answer to all these questions is the same: it’s because God has
      made us that way. God created humans as physical beings who are
      intended to enjoy physical pleasures.
         No book of the Bible deals with this topic better than the Song of
      Songs. Why is that book in the Bible? It is a book of sheer romantic plea-
      sure. All the sexual pleasures included in the book have no connection
      to child-bearing. The book explicitly reminds us of the specific pleasures
      God designed and intended for husbands and wives. The effervescent
      springs of romantic love can be traced to their source in God.

Skim through the Song of Solomon. What does the book say to you
      about how God views the pleasures of the flesh in the right context?

      _______________________________________________________

         Of course, compared to many of the crude and licentious practices
      of our surrounding culture, Christian ideas about sex, marriage, and
      physical pleasures, in general, can seem outdated, prudish, and restric-
      tive. But these principles come from the One who created our physical
      pleasures, the One who knows how they can best be enjoyed. Who
      alone but God can even begin to assess the pain and suffering caused
      by the abuse of these wonderful gifts? Who hasn’t been impacted in
      one way or another by their abuse?

     Jesus and Romance
Read John 2:1–11. What does this tell us about Jesus’ attitude
     toward marriage and romantic love? What does it mean that He
     gave His blessing to such boisterous and long, drawn-out affairs
     as Jewish weddings were in that day and age?

     _______________________________________________________

        Jesus had just returned from the wilderness of temptation, where He
     Himself had drunk the cup of woe. But from there He came forth to
     give the human family the cup of blessing and to consecrate the warm
     relationships of human life. Jesus, who officiated at the first wedding
     in the Garden of Eden, now performs His first miracle. Where? At a
     wedding meal.
        A Jewish wedding in biblical times was an impressive occasion. A
     marriage in the small village of Cana in Galilee might have been the
     event of the year. The partying went on for days. Rabbis and students
     would stop studying. Everyone brought presents and, in return, the
     hosting family was expected to keep guests well supplied with food,
     drink, and merrymaking.
        The running out of drink was, then, more than a minor disappointment.
     It was a catastrophe, and the mother of Jesus comes to describe the emer-
     gency to Him. She suggests nothing, nor is she passive. She speaks to the
     servants of the household and urges, “Whatever He tells you, do it.”
        Jesus then tells the servants to fill six water pots. Archaeologists say
     that at that time a storage jar could hold 15–25 gallons. At a minimum
     then, we are talking about at least ninety gallons. Some scholars sug-
     gest at least one hundred twenty gallons.
        The next thing we hear is the steward’s exuberant exclamation to the
     bridegroom, congratulating him: “ ‘ Every man at the beginning sets out
     the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior.
     You have kept the good wine until now!’ ” (John 2:10, NKJV).
        If there are four quarts to a gallon and each quart yields six glasses,
     the size generally used at wedding receptions, that amount is a mini-
     mum total of 2,160 glasses. This means, then, 2,160 servings of the fin-
     est drink for one little wedding party in a backwater village of Galilee.
     Jesus, at a wedding, pours out the best that anyone had ever tasted.
        In this miracle we can see God’s creative power, the same power
     that created our world. And, in Jesus’ earthly ministry this creative
     power is first expressed in the context of a wedding.
        Romantic love and marriage are, indeed, wonderful gifts from God.
     We must remember, too, that Jesus was never married, and thus He
     leaves an example that shows that not everyone has to get married.
     Single people can live full and productive and joyful lives as well as
     married people can.
                                                                           101

    Further Study: In both the Old and the New Testament, marriage
          is utilized to represent the tender and sacred union that exists between
          Christ and His people. To the mind of Jesus, the gladness of wedding
          festivities pointed forward to the rejoicing of that day when He shall
          bring home His bride to the Father’s house, and the redeemed with
          the Redeemer shall sit down to the marriage supper of the Lamb. He
          says, “As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God
          rejoice over you” (Isa. 62:5, NKJV). “You shall no longer be termed
          Forsaken” (vs. 4, NKJV). “But you will be called, ‘My Delight’ . . .
          for the Lord delights in you.’ . . . God will rejoice over you” (vss. 4,
1         5, NASB). “He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you
          with singing” (Zeph. 3:17, NKJV).
             Scripture concludes with this same glorious theme. When the vision
          of heavenly things was granted to John the apostle, he wrote, “I heard,
          as it were, the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters
          and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, ‘Alleluia! For the
2         Lord God Omnipotent reigns! Let us be glad and rejoice and give
          Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has
          made herself ready.’ And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine
          linen, clean and bright. . . . ‘Blessed are those who are called to the
          marriage supper of the Lamb! . . . These are the true sayings of God’ ”
          (Rev. 19:6–9, NKJV).

    Discussion Questions:
3
           l1 Which practices in your society and culture could easily lead
           to the abuse of the physical pleasures that God has given us?
           How can you help educate others, especially young people, about
           the dangers of abusing these gifts? How can you show them
           that by following the principles and laws that God has given us,
           people will be in a much better situation to enjoy life than they
           would be if they followed the customs and practices of society
           that go contrary to the principles in God’s Word?

           l
           2 In the civil laws God gave Israel, there is another reminder of
           God’s romantic nature. What kind of honeymoon does God sug-
           gest for a newly married couple? Deut. 24:5. What do we make
           of that time frame given them?

    Summary: For many moderns, God has dwindled into a noble
          “example.” Or He has been diluted into a concept useful for organiz-
          ing world peace. He’s not, however, seen as a Personality whom we
          can feel any love for. But Scripture insists that God is a passionate
          lover. Reflect on the difference that this concept makes for the various
          doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Breakthrough at Bebe Village
by Wilson Kuki
   In the Solomon Islands and many other island nations of the South
Pacific, individual villages and even entire regions are under the domain
of a single church. It’s often difficult to gain access to these villages, for
the people’s culture and identity are wrapped up in their church affilia-
tion.
   As a Global Mission Pioneer, I wanted to enter one of the villages
dominated by another Protestant denomination. I asked permission to
take some Seventh-day Adventist young people to the village to do com-
munity service work. The village leaders agreed to let the young people
help repair the church roof, but they wouldn’t allow us to hold public
meetings. We agreed.
   The village provided a house for us while we worked, and as the young
people worked with the villagers, they became friends.
   Every morning and evening, we gathered outside our house to sing
and pray. Some of the villagers joined us, and this strengthened bonds
of friendship.
   We had planned to spend Sabbath at a small Seventh-day Adventist
church in a nearby village, but the religious teacher of our village invited
us to worship in the church we were repairing. We gladly accepted, but
we were surprised to find this man had invited the villagers to join us
for worship. The majority of the village came to our worship that day.
We told Bible stories using picture rolls and sang songs of praise. The
people loved it!
   After worship, a man named George told us that he had been accused
of sorcery and had been beaten to drive the spirits from him. He was
knocked unconscious, and no one helped him. With tears in his eyes,
George explained that he felt he had been rejected by his own village.
   We prayed with George and gave him a Bible that he had requested.
We arranged to return to the village and study the Bible with him. When
George learned that I planned to hold evangelistic meetings in the next
village, George gladly agreed to come.
   We invited others from the village to join us for Bible studies, and
several have asked for Bibles. We promised to give them Bibles if they’d
come to our meetings, and many did. They’re thrilled that other Christians
would come and help them repair their roof and worship with them. A little
kindness goes a long way toward building bridges—and church roofs.

Key Thought: When is Jesus coming back? It doesn’t matter.
      What matters is that He does.



      A
              t the end of the 1990s, many were wondering whether the
              world would last until the new millennium. Then the year
              2000 came and went. Some argued that the time calculation
      was wrong and that 2001 was the first year of the new millennium.
      But, alas, we’re still here.
         Either way, Seventh-day Adventists, unlike many other Christian
      traditions, believe that the second coming of Christ draws nearer. In
      news reports, even secular reporters sometimes reflect on how the
      world seems edging closer to some great crisis, whether political,
      ecological, economic, military, or any combination thereof. One
      doesn’t need to be a biblical apocalyptist in order to see a world that
      seems to teeter on the brink of catastrophe.
         None of this should surprise us; after all, just about every Bible
      prophecy depicting end times paints a bleak forecast for the world
      prior to the Second Coming.
         When is Jesus coming back? We don’t know. What we do know
      is that He is, and that’s what matters.

     The Beginning and the End
        The description of our pitiful human condition is honestly and
     correctly painted in Scripture. Bible writers did not always despair,
     however, because they knew the final outcome. The last chapters in
     the books of Isaiah and Revelation assure us that the destruction of sin
     is coming and that God’s kingdom will be restored. God revealed to
     His prophets the “last things” that will lead to the end of our world’s
     dark history. These prophets gave full weight to the gravity of the
     situation, but they lived with hope because the remedy had been
     revealed to them.
        As we saw earlier, if you believe the world began by chance, you
     most likely believe it will end that way, as well. This view doesn’t
     really leave much hope for those in between such a beginning and
     such an end, does it?
        In contrast, the Bible consistently refers to and describes a lit-
     eral historical understanding of Genesis 1 and 2. Nothing was left
     to chance in the Creation of the world. Hence, it’s no wonder that
     the Word of God also insists on a literal end of this world, as well.
     Nothing will be left to chance here either.

Read 2 Peter 3:1–10. How does Peter link early events in human
     history with final ones? What message of hope can we take from
     this passage?

     _______________________________________________________

        The primal creation and the final re-creation are vitally linked, each
     enhancing the significance of the other. When studying the doctrine of the
     last things (eschatology), we deal with God’s final, definitive acts toward
     His creation, which lead right into the restoration of His kingdom.
        Jesus clearly links the beginning and the end of things with
     Himself. Three times in Revelation (Rev. 1:8, 21:6, 22:13) Jesus
     refers to Himself as the Alpha and the Omega (alpha is the first letter
     of the Greek alphabet, omega the last). Whatever else He means by
     saying that, at a minimum it shows us Jesus’ power and omnipres-
     ence; it tells us that Jesus was there at the beginning of all things, and
     He will be there at the end. We can trust in Him no matter where we
     are in between. It’s a way of telling us that, however chaotic things
     might seem, He is always there for us.

      Some Christians have moved away from belief in a literal,
      physical return of Jesus and a supernatural restoration of
      God’s kingdom on earth. Instead, they think we need to build
      the kingdom ourselves. Dwell on past attempts to do something
      similar. Why should we think future ones will fare any better?
                                                                           105

      Promise and Expectation
      Because “last things” center around the establishment of God’s
   kingdom, attention to “last things” has always been a paramount
   Seventh-day Adventist concern. So much so that we have drawn
   attention to the end times in our name: Seventh-day Adventist. The name
   itself points to our belief in the second advent of Jesus.
      						
How does Peter express this hope? 2 Pet. 3:13. Why is this hope so
   central to all we believe? Without it, why do we have no real hope
   at all?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Our own human expectations and hopes often are disappointing.
      Many times they fail us because we cannot control future events.
      Our most ardent hopes are often not fulfilled. We cannot control the
      future, no matter how hard we might try. Human beings are faced
      with possibilities and probabilities. Every plan of ours is tentative.
      The unfolding of history is complicated, incalculable, and subject to
      too many varied factors to allow us confidence in what we may decide
      about it. And this uncertainty causes us anxiety.
         But the biblical writers assure us that we need not despair; the Lord
      is in control, and we have the promise of His return and the promise
      of what He’ll do at that return.

Read the following verses. What hope and assurance is found in
      them? What different emphasis is found in each one of these
      promises, as well?

      John 14:2, 3_____________________________________________


      Dan. 2:44_______________________________________________


      Acts 3:20, 21____________________________________________

        In all of these texts, and so many others, we have been given the
      promise not only of Christ’s return but that a radically different new
      world and existence await us when He does. Try to imagine what it
      will be like. We are so used to sin, sickness, death, fear, violence,
      hatred, poverty, crime, war, and suffering that we can’t easily imagine
      a world without them. And yet, that’s exactly the world we’re hoping
      for, the world we have been promised.

      Our Great Assurance		
         As Christians, as Seventh-day Adventist Christians, we live with the
      hope of Christ’s literal return to this earth. Some Christian groups have
      abandoned hope in this teaching or have pushed it off to the side, or
      they have watered it down and so spiritualized it away that the Second
      Coming becomes essentially just a personal thing. They may say, The
      Second Coming is realized in our hearts when we learn to fulfill our
      role in our community, or When we learn to love others as we should,
      then the second coming of Christ is actualized in our life. Though, of
      course, we should love others and be fruitful members of our commu-
      nity, none of these are the same as the second coming of Jesus.
         From our perspective, especially with our understanding of the state
      of the dead, it’s hard to imagine what our faith would mean without
      the physical, literal return of Christ, at which time He will raise the
      dead in Him. It’s so central to what we believe (again, our name itself
      reflects just how central) that, without it, our whole system would
      crumble. And that’s because all that we believe in and hope for cli-
      maxes in the literal return of Christ “in the clouds of heaven” (Matt.
      24:30); remove that and our teachings take us to a dead end.

Of all the assurances we have of the Second Coming, which is the great-
      est? What one event, more than any other, guarantees His return,
      and why? Heb. 9:28, 1 Cor. 15:12–27.

         Of course, the great hope of the Second Coming rests upon what
      Christ accomplished for us at the First Coming. After all, what good
      is the First Coming without the Second? In a sense, one could say
      that the First Coming, and all that Jesus accomplished for us there, is
      incomplete without the Second. At times the Bible uses the metaphor
      of ransom to refer to the Cross. Jesus Himself said that “ ‘the Son of
      Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a
      ransom for many’ ” (Matt. 20:28, NKJV). At the cross, Jesus, by His
      death, paid the ransom for our souls, a ransom that was full, complete,
      and once and for all. At the same time, what good is paying a ransom
      if you don’t come and get what was ransomed? The paying of the ran-
      som isn’t the end of the story. Just as a human parent would come to
      get the child he or she ransomed back, so, too, Jesus will come back to
      get what He paid such a great price for. Hence, Christ’s first coming
      gives us the greatest assurance possible for the second.
                                                                          107

      “Where Is the Promise of His
      Coming?”
         From the earliest days of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Adventists
      believed that Christ’s coming was soon, “nearer than we first believed.”
      As it stands, we’re still here, much longer than many among us antici-
      pated. How are we to understand this “delay”?
         First of all, we’re not the only ones whose expectations about when
      the Lord would act have not been fulfilled as people have thought.
         Eve, for instance, thought God’s promises for a Deliverer (Gen. 3:15)
      would be fulfilled in her first-born son. Read Genesis 4:1. An accurate
      translation of this text should have the word from in italics, because it
      is not in the original language but has been added by a translator. Eve’s
      statement can be more literally translated: “I have gotten a man—the
      Lord.” She was wrong; the child born was Cain, not the Redeemer. The
      Lord’s coming wasn’t until thousands of years later.
          “The Saviour’s coming was foretold in Eden. When Adam and Eve
      first heard the promise, they looked for its speedy fulfillment. They joy-
      fully welcomed their first-born son, hoping that he might be the Deliverer.
      But the fulfillment of the promise tarried. Those who first received it died
      without the sight. From the days of Enoch the promise was repeated
      through patriarchs and prophets, keeping alive the hope of His appearing,
      and yet He came not.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 31.

Read Hebrews 11. What’s the main point of this chapter, and how
      does it fit into the whole question of “delay”? (See especially vss.
      13, 39, 40.)
        							
      _______________________________________________________

         Throughout the Bible, we have examples of people waiting in earnest
      expectation. Look at how long Abraham waited for the promised son;
      look at how long Israel waited in Egypt for deliverance. Time and again
      in the Psalms, we read the question, How long, Lord, until deliverance
      comes? And, of course, we shouldn’t be surprised about the “delay” in
      Christ’s return, not when Peter wrote, almost two thousand years ago,
      the following words: “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the
      last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, where is the
      promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things con-
      tinue as they were from the beginning of the creation” (2 Pet. 3:3, 4).

       Have you thought the Lord would have been back by now? Do
       you sometimes find yourself discouraged by the “delay,” or
       doubting the Second Advent because we’re still here? Think
       about evidence for belief in Christ’s return, realizing that your
       understanding of time is radically different from that of God.

      “Behold, I Come Quickly”
That the Lord had not yet come is undoubtedly the basis for some of
      Paul’s counsel to the Thessalonians. What does Paul counsel the
      church at Thessalonica as they wait for the promised coming of
      Christ? 2 Thessalonians 2.

      _______________________________________________________

        Certain events have to transpire in human history before Jesus will
      return, yet, the hope for the future is glorious.

The book of Revelation, the great book of high points, also gives evi-
      dence of a time lag. At the opening of the fifth seal, what do the
      voices under the altar cry out? Rev. 6:9–11. What’s implied there
      about the question of the “delay”?

      _______________________________________________________

Read Luke 12:42–48. How does that text help us to understand the
      “delay”? More so, what important warning should we take from
      it for ourselves, who could easily start feeling the same way?

      _______________________________________________________

         What about the texts that talk about Jesus’ coming back quickly,
      or soon? For example, “Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that
      keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book” (Rev. 22:7).
         In one sense, as far as our own personal experience is concerned,
      the Second Coming is as “soon” as our death. We die, and regardless
      of how long after we are in the grave—two years, two hundred, two
      thousand—we sleep, and the next thing we know, in an instant, in a
      twinkling of an eye, Jesus has returned. Thus, one could argue that
      from our own personal perspective alone, from what we personally
      experience ourselves, the Second Coming takes no longer than the
      span of an individual human life. Although the Second Coming itself
      is a literal universal event that impacts the whole earth, we experience
      it only as individuals.

       As the years roll by, do you find yourself becoming at ease in
       the world, getting comfortable with things, and less focused on
       the reality of the Second Coming? If so, you’re probably not
       alone. How can we fight this natural, although potentially dan-
       gerous, tendency? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.


                                                                         109

    Further Study: “Another year has almost passed into eternity. A few
          more days, and we shall enter a new year. My brethren and sisters,
          employ wisely the remaining hours of the old year. If you have in any
          wise neglected your duty, repent before God, and return to the path
          from which you have wandered. Remember how brief the period of life
          allotted you. You know not how soon your probation may close. Say
          not presumptuously, ‘To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city,
          and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain.’ God may
1         have different plans for you. Life is but a vapor, ‘that appeareth for a
          little time, and then vanisheth.’ You know not how soon your hand may
          lose its cunning, your step its firmness. There is peril in a moment’s
          delay. ‘Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while
          he is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
          his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy
2         upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.’ ”—Ellen G.
          White, Review and Herald, December 23, 1902.

    Discussion Questions:

           l
           1 In class, discuss your answer to Thursday’s final question.
           Discuss, too, the irony of the fact that the longer we’re here, the
           easier it is to put off the sense of Christ’s return, and yet the
3          longer we’re here, the closer we come to that return.

           l2 What are the reasons that Jesus has not returned yet? Are we
           responsible for that “delay”? How do you justify your answer?

           l
           3 In your mind, what is the greatest reason for trust in the
           promise of the Second Coming?

           l
           4 Although there’s much debate in science about human origins,
           many scientists argue that the long-term prospects for humanity,
           the earth, the universe even, are not good. They predict that the
           universe is going to burn out or collapse back in on itself, leav-
           ing no life anywhere. As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe that
           the long-term prospects for the universe are the opposite: they
           are wonderful. The point is, if science has the end of all things so
           wrong, why should we trust that its understanding of the begin-
           ning of all things is any more accurate? This is especially true
           when science’s common understanding of the beginning is cen-
           tered on various forces, including evolution, that deny a Creator
           or any purposeful design or intention in the creation itself. How
           much more wrong could it be?

    Summary: We have many very good reasons for trusting in Christ’s
          return, no matter when it happens.

  Called Out			
  by Monsuru Akinwande
     I grew up in a non-Christian family in Nigeria. One of my Christian
  friends often talked to me about Christ. One day he invited me to give
  my life to Jesus, but I wasn’t interested. Then I had a dream in which
  Jesus stood between heaven and earth, touching people who were on
  their way to heaven. But when I approached Him, Jesus didn’t touch
  me. Instead He said gently, “You’re not ready yet.” I turned away,
  rejected.
     I told my friend about my dream, and he explained that God was
  speaking to me, inviting me to follow Him. Wow, I thought. God would
  speak to me? He must love me! My friends helped me give my life to
  Christ.
     One day I met a man who lives near the church my friends attended.
  He invited me to study the Bible with him. I wasn’t sure I should, so
  I asked my friends what to do. “Go ahead and study with him,” they
  said. “Just be sure that what he teaches you is truth according to the
  Bible.”
     As I studied the Bible with this man, I realized that he knew his Bible
  well! And when he told me about the Sabbath, he showed me many
  Bible texts to prove that God never changed the Sabbath to Sunday. I
  was convinced that the Sabbath is Saturday. But I didn’t know what
  to do about it.
     My new friend gave me some books to read to help me understand
  the Bible better. He invited me to attend the Seventh-day Adventist
  church with him, and I went, glad to find the truth about God. The devil
  became angry and tried to stop me from being baptized, but I refused
  to give in.
     Before I found Christ, I was nobody. But God has adopted me and
  has called me to serve Him and share my faith with those who haven’t
  met Jesus yet. He has opened the door for me to study at Babcock
  University, the Seventh-day Adventist university in Nigeria. I know
  that God will make a way for me to complete my studies and answer
  His call to service.
     Please pray for me and my fellow Christians who have been called
  out of darkness and want to share God’s light with others. And thank
  you for your mission offerings and Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings that
  have helped establish this great school where thousands of young
  people are being trained to serve God.

Monsuru Akinwande is studying theology at Babcock University in Nigeria.

2012     Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter

         God raised up the Seventh-day Adventist Church to proclaim “present
      truth,” the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6–12. To fulfill our
      mission, we need to be purposeful in leading as many people into God’s
      kingdom as possible by giving those who face eternal destruction the
      opportunity for eternal life instead. Next quarter’s Adult Bible Study Guide,
      Evangelism and Witnessing, by Joseph A. Webb, strives to equip members
      with tools to achieve our core mission of telling the Jesus story with the
      intention that people will accept Him as Lord and Savior and become dis-
      ciples and even disciple-makers. While evangelism and witnessing are the
      personal responsibilities of each believer, the whole body of Seventh-day
      Adventist believers (the church) has a corporate responsibility, as well. As
      each member contributes to the evangelistic goals and strategies of their
      local church, precious people are won to Christ. This needs to be done at
      the local church level, or it just won’t get done. Our challenge must be to
      make all that we do as a church relate to the core business of reaching the
      lost with the “everlasting gospel” (Rev. 14:6) and all that entails.

Lesson 1—Defining Evangelism and Witnessing
        The Week at a Glance:
          Sunday: Evangelism Is . . .? (Acts 4:33, 5:42, 7:56)
          Monday: Witnessing Is . . .? (Mark 5:18–20, 1 John 1:3)
          Tuesday: The Biblical Evidence (Acts 13:1–49)
          Wednesday: Telling Our Stories (Acts 22:2–21)
          Thursday: Our Job Description (1 Peter 3:15)
        Memory Text—Matthew 28:19, 20
        Sabbath Gem: If we are to be involved in the fulfillment of
        the great gospel commission, we must understand what we mean
        by evangelism and witnessing. Thankfully, God’s Word gives us
        direction in these two areas.
Lesson 2—Every Member Ministry
        The Week at a Glance:
          Sunday: Every Member Ministry (Ephesians 4:12,
          2 Corinthians 5:15–20)
          Monday: The Need for Laborers (John 4:35–41)
          Tuesday: Individuals but Together (Ephesians 4:16)
          Wednesday: Working Together, With God (Acts 2:47)
          Thursday: Reporting to the Church (Acts 14:27, 15:4)
        Memory Text—1 Peter 2:9
        Sabbath Gem: Too often evangelism and witnessing are seen as
        the pastor’s job alone; this attitude is wrong.
