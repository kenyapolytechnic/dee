               the Adult Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day

               the Sabbath School Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General
               Conference Administrative Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible

Why Our Church?

A                 lthough experts disagree on the exact number, one thing is certain:
                  many Protestant denominations exist today. Hundreds, even
                  thousands.
   Which leads to such questions as, Why the Seventh-day Adventist Church?
What’s our purpose? What relevance do we have?
   The answer is simple: God raised up this church to proclaim “present truth,” the
three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6–12.
   Yes, a number of churches exist, and many with aggressive outreach and evange-
lism programs too. But, at last count, only one church is specifically proclaiming
the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14. That church is ours—and that’s why
we’re here. Period.
   Thus, whatever else our church is doing, first and foremost, we should purpose-
fully attempt to lead as many people as we can into God’s eternal kingdom. Whether
we call it “spreading the gospel,” “evangelizing the world,” or preaching “present
truth,” our core business is to tell the Jesus story with the intention that people will
accept Him as Lord and Savior and become disciples and even disciple makers.
   Although most local churches are involved in many activities, and (ideally) all of
those activities are good and useful—our challenge must be to make all that we do as
a church relate to the core business of reaching the lost with the “everlasting gospel”
(Rev. 14:6) and all that it entails.

   Of course, even with the benefits of modern technology, the task is huge. And
when all is said and done, the task falls upon millions of volunteers motivated by a
love for God and for lost humanity—a love for those whose sins Jesus bore on the
cross just as much as He bore ours.
   While evangelism and witnessing are the personal responsibility of each believer, the
whole body of Seventh-day Adventist believers (the church) has a corporate responsibil-
ity, as well. As each member contributes to the evangelistic goals and strategies of his or
her local church, precious people are won to Christ. And
here’s a point that can’t be overemphasized: if it’s not done
at the local church level, it just won’t get done.               While evangelism
   In the context of outreach, understanding spiritual gifts     and witnessing
also is important. It is vital, however, to not only encourage   are the personal
members to discover how they are spiritually gifted but to
also present them with opportunities to exercise those gifts.
                                                                 responsibility of
Fundamental belief number 17 says in part: “God bestows          each believer, the
upon all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts,     whole body of
which each member is to employ in loving ministry for            Seventh-day
the common good of the church and of humanity. Given
                                                                 Adventist believ-
by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who apportions to each
member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and min-     ers (the church)

functions.”—Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . . (Nampa,         responsibility, as
Idaho: Pacific Press® Publishing Association, 2005), p. 237.     well.
An understanding of the gospel story coupled with a
personal connection to Jesus Christ will enable people to
work with the right motivation for saving souls. Evangelism and witnessing should be
motivated by a love response, not by fear or guilt.
   As with any study, this quarter’s lessons will help to increase a person’s store of
biblical knowledge. That’s fine, but the goal is not just to gain knowledge, no matter
how wonderful the knowledge. The goal is for us to use that knowledge for good,
and in this context the greatest good is to give those who face eternal destruction
the opportunity for eternal life.
   That’s the reason that the Seventh-day Adventist Church exists. What better one
could there be?

      Defining Evangelism and
      Witnessing


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 4:33, 13:48, 1 John
  1:3, Acts 13:1–49, 22:2–21, 1 Pet. 3:15.
     							
Memory Text: “ ‘Go therefore and make disciples of all the
  nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
  and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I
  have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the
  end of the age’ ” (Matthew 28:19, 20, NKJV).

Key Thought: If we are to be involved in fulfilling the great gospel
      commission, we must understand what we mean by “evangelism”
      and “witnessing.”



      A
              n employee often is given a job description. It’s a detailed
              account of expected duties.
                 The Bible also speaks about a job description, and in this
      case it’s one for God’s people. In 1 Corinthians 15:58 (NKJV), the
      apostle Paul admonishes the Corinthian believers to “always [abound]
      in the work of the Lord.” While Paul does not specify the work to
      which he is referring, a similar phrase is used in 1 Corinthians 16:10,
      with reference to the work of the Lord done by Timothy and Paul in
      evangelism and witnessing about Jesus Christ and the plan of salva-
      tion. Thus, Paul’s admonition in chapter 15 certainly included the
      work of spreading the gospel.
         This week we will explore what evangelism and witnessing actually
      are; in other words, we’ll seek to uncover our biblical “job descrip-
      tion.”

     Evangelism Is . . .?
        We get a clear picture of what evangelism is as we review the
     activities of the first evangelists. Regardless of the major differences
     between their world and ours, both worlds were (and are) sinful,
     fallen, and in disrepair—thus in need of hope and salvation. More
     than a century ago, German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer some-
     what exaggeratedly (he wasn’t known as “the philosopher of pessimism”
     for nothing) expressed the human condition like this: “No one has ever
     lived who has not more than once wished that he did not have to live
     through the following day.”—The World as Will and Idea: Abridged in
     One Volume (London: Everyman, Orion Publishing. Vermont: Tuttle
     Publishing, 2001), p. 204. Little has changed since the apostle’s time, or
     Schopenhauer’s, or during ours. Thus, the main points of the first century
     evangelistic preaching also should be the main points of ours today.

Read Acts 4:33, 5:42, 2:36–39, 7:56, 13:48. What are some spe-
     cific themes about which the disciples preached that should be
     included in today’s evangelistic presentations?
     ________________________________________________________

        To be an evangelist in any sense of the word, one must have per-
     sonal understanding and experience of “the everlasting gospel.” It
     is this gospel that ultimately brings belief, confession, conversion,
     baptism and discipleship, and the promise of eternal life.
        The Jewish leaders saw something in the boldness of the apostles
     that convinced them that the apostles had been with Jesus (see Acts
     4:13). Most likely the leaders formed this conclusion because they
     were confronted with a group of men who seemed unable to talk
     about anything other than Jesus’ life and teachings. Evangelism and
     witnessing surely have to do with speaking about the life and teach-
     ings of Jesus, the difference those teachings and beliefs have made
     in the individual believer’s life, and the difference Jesus can make in
     anyone’s life if He is accepted as Lord and Savior.
        It is important to view evangelism and witnessing as a continual pro-
     cess rather than as a single program or event. A vital part of the process
     is establishment and nurture. The word steadfastly in Acts 2:42 indicates
     a strong commitment on the part of the new believers to an ongoing strat-
     egy for their spiritual nurture. Clearly, the early church saw evangelism
     as much more than just the preaching of a message. Their evangelistic
     process was not complete until people had become disciples and were
     thoroughly incorporated into the local group of believers.

      Of all the gospel promises, which one offers you the most hope?
      How can you learn to cling to that promise and make it your
      own, no matter how difficult your circumstances?
                                                                             7

     Witnessing Is . . .?
       A witness is one who gives a testimony, one who attests to some-
     thing that he or she knows from personal experience. A Christian’s
     personal testimony regarding the work of God in his or her life can
     be very powerful. On one occasion Jesus healed a demon-possessed
     man (see Mark 5:1–19). When the healed man wanted to follow Jesus,
     Jesus told him to “ ‘go home to your friends, and tell them what great
     things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on
     you’ ” (Mark 5:19, NKJV).
       Without question, the short time that Jesus spent with this man
     was insufficient to tutor him in the art of teaching or preaching.
     Nevertheless, Jesus told the healed man to witness about what he
     knew. That is why Jesus said to him, “ ‘Go . . . and tell.’ ”

Read Mark 5:18–20; Acts 22:15, 16; and 1 John 1:3. What common
     and important point is being made by all these texts?


        God has given us the responsibility of sharing the ways in which He
     has changed our lives, just as He did to the formerly demon-possessed
     man at Gadara and to His other followers.
        Witnessing, that is, sharing one’s personal experience of God—all
     with the intention of encouraging others to accept Christ—is not nec-
     essarily as organized or as intentional as radio, television, or crusade
     evangelism. Being a witness can be very spontaneous given that the
     opportunity to share the good news about Jesus can arise anywhere at
     any time with anyone. We must, therefore, be ever alert for opportuni-
     ties to share our knowledge and experience.
        As to the relationship between witnessing and evangelism, we can
     say that they are each essentially different strategies for reaching the
     goal of winning souls for Christ. Witnessing is more spontaneous and
     short term, while evangelism tends to be more long term and inten-
     tional. Sometimes planned evangelism is enhanced by the personal
     witnessing of those involved, and sometimes spontaneous witnessing
     leads people into a more planned program. However it happens, both
     are vital components in the overall process. When we share what
     Jesus has done for us, those who are open to the leading of the Holy
     Spirit will want to know more. Also, it’s a lot easier for people to
     argue against your doctrine, your theology, your beliefs. It’s not, how-
     ever, so easy for them to argue against your own personal testimony.

      When was the last time you had a chance to witness to someone
      about what Christ has done for you? What was the reaction?
      How has Christ changed your life? What is there in your life
      that would make someone want to learn more about Jesus?

     The Biblical Evidence
        The early believers, no doubt, had obstacles to overcome as they
     committed themselves to spreading the good news about Jesus. Not
     the least of these obstacles would have been that most were untrained
     in the religious schools of the day, and, therefore, would have had
     little or no credibility in the eyes of the established church.
        Nevertheless, in spite of all obstacles, the apostles and other
     believers felt strongly called by God to continue in evangelism and
     witnessing. The blessings of forgiveness and assurance that they had
     personally experienced compelled them to share. Witnessing was a
     natural result of conversion.

Read Acts 13:1–49. What work did the Holy Spirit call Barnabas
     and Saul to do?

     ________________________________________________________

        The “Word of God” that was preached everywhere most cer-
     tainly included the messianic passages of the Old Testament. Those
     Scriptures that foretold the death and resurrection of the Savior, and
     His consequent forgiveness and justification of sinners, were pre-
     sented as being fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth.
        The New Testament clearly reveals that the early believers committed
     themselves to preaching and sharing. Among their regularly emphasized
     main points were: Jesus as Lord and Christ, salvation through His righ-
     teousness, the coming kingdom of God, and the promise of eternal life.

Study Acts 6:1–7. Focus particularly on verses 4 and 7. What
     enabled the early church to have so much evangelistic success
     with the professional clergy in Jerusalem?

     ________________________________________________________

       Many people believed in Jesus and accepted Him as their personal
     Savior because of the testimonies of believers who had shared their
     own life-changing experiences and not simply because people had
     observed miraculous events.

      However powerful and compelling the testimonies and witness
      of these first evangelists, these people were constantly referring
      to the Scriptures. That is, they were using the Bible to interpret
      their experiences. How well do you know the Bible, and how
      can you get grounded in it to such an extent that you can use it
      in your own witnessing?

                                                                          9
          W ednesday April 4

      Telling Our Stories
        As stated earlier, the most powerful witnessing that a believer can
      do for Jesus is to share his or her personal testimony. That is, the shar-
      ing of what God has done for me and how He has affected my life and
      experience. Usually a personal testimony is expressed in three distinct
      sections. The first part is a short review of the believer’s life before
      accepting Jesus as personal Savior. The second part is an explanation
      of how the person met the Lord. The third is a declaration of the life
      experience after getting to know Jesus.

Read through Acts 22:2–21. Paul’s defense speech before the
      Jerusalem council is in the form of a personal testimony. What
      are some of the points he makes in each section of his testi-
      mony?

      His life before he knew the Lord Jesus (vss. 3–5):
      How he met the Lord (vss. 6–16):
      His life experience after his conversion (vss. 17–21):

Even if you were raised in a Christian home and did not experience a
      dramatic conversion experience, you certainly had a special time
      when you made your personal commitment to Jesus Christ. Think
      back on your experience and write out some points that will help
      to form your own personal testimony.

      My life before I knew the Lord Jesus (or before I made a commit-
      ment to Him):
      How I met Jesus (or what influenced my commitment to Him):
      My life after I accepted Jesus as my personal Savior:

         A personal testimony should not be a long and detailed autobiogra-
      phy. We mentioned earlier that witnessing is a more spontaneous way
      of sharing Jesus than is a planned evangelistic approach. Christians
      should be able to give their testimony in a short space of time, because
      we don’t know when the opportunity may arise to speak of Jesus. It
      could be in any number of unplanned situations. It may be on a plane
      or at a bus stop. It may be during a short telephone call. However the
      situation arises, we should be ready and willing to speak about what
      the Lord has done for us, what reasons we have for our faith, and the
      hope that God offers not just to us but to others.

       Consider the eternal difference between the lost and the saved,
       between eternal death and eternal life. In the long run, what
       else really matters?

     Our Job Description
Read 1 Peter 3:15. What is this text teaching us about witnessing?
     How does it fit in with that which we have been looking at so far?

     ________________________________________________________

       By now we have considered evangelism and witnessing sufficiently
     in order to be able to suggest what we deem as an adequate biblical
     job description. We don’t need to create a definition of evangelism
     and witnessing that everyone agrees with in every detail, but we must
     make sure that any definition that we accept includes the essential
     ingredients of sharing the truth about Jesus and what He offers the
     world.

Consider the following definition of evangelism. Do you consider
     it an adequate definition? What would you add or take away?
     Evangelism is the process of clearly and persuasively proclaiming
     the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ so that individuals will accept
     Him as their personal Savior and follow Him as Lord in order to
     become disciples and disciple makers.

     ________________________________________________________

        While a definition of a task is not necessarily a detailed job descrip-
     tion, it does give some overall guidance. Of course, when it comes to
     witnessing, the individual situation and the believer’s own experience
     with God will determine the approach. However, an understanding of
     God’s desire to reach a lost world through His church will cause us to
     consider a planned approach to witnessing and evangelism.
        The rapid growth of the early church was due in no small part to the
     conviction and commitment of its members. This in turn was based
     upon their personal experiences with Jesus and the special empower-
     ing outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The teachings of Jesus Christ and
     the influence of the Holy Spirit remain basic and crucial to all wit-
     nessing and evangelism.
        “Thousands can be reached in the most simple, humble way. The
     most intellectual, those who are looked upon as the world’s most
     gifted men and women, are often refreshed by the simple words of
     one who loves God, and who can speak of that love as naturally as
     the worldling speaks of the things that interest him most deeply. Often
     the words well prepared and studied have but little influence. But the
     true, honest expression of a son or daughter of God, spoken in natural
     simplicity, has power to open the door to hearts that have long been
     closed against Christ and His love.”—Ellen G. White, The Colporteur
     Evangelist, p. 38.
                                                                           11

    Further Study: Think about your personal testimony and make sure
         that you are able to give it when the opportunity arises.
            Take some time to sit quietly and consider what areas of church
         life you enjoy being involved in or the areas that you would consider
         being involved in if you were asked. Write them down. You may be
         interested in evangelistic areas in which your church is not currently
         involved. List these areas too.
            Begin to consider the ways in which you can become involved in
         an evangelistic ministry in your church. If you are already involved
         in a ministry and desire to stay there, pray that God will continue to
         bless that ministry. If you are not presently involved, pray that God
1        will reveal to you where He wants you to work for Him.

          l1 In the gospel commission of Matthew 28:19, 20, there are
          four action verbs: go, make disciples, baptize, and teach. The
          commands to go, baptize, and teach are all subordinate to the
2
          imperative that says, “make disciples.” Considering this clear
          emphasis, discuss what it means to be a disciple and how dis-
          ciples are made.

          l2 Consider the following quote and then discuss the question,
          How do we as individuals and as a church group become a part
          of God’s channel of communication to a lost world? “As His rep-
          resentatives among men, Christ does not choose angels who have
3
          never fallen, but human beings, men of like passions with those
          they seek to save. Christ took upon Himself humanity, that He
          might reach humanity. Divinity needed humanity, for it required
          both the divine and the human to bring salvation to the world.
          Divinity needed humanity that humanity might afford a channel
          of communication between God and man.”—Ellen G. White,
          The Desire of Ages, p. 296.					

          l3 Take a look at your own life. What kind of example do you
          present to the world? In what ways do your words, actions,
          dress, demeanor, and attitude impact those around you? In
          short, what kind of witness do you present to the world, even
          when you are not actively “witnessing”? In which areas can you
          definitely improve?

Sharing God’s Love in China
   Deng is a Global Mission pioneer in eastern China. She dreamed of
starting a house church in her elderly mother’s home in a village with no
Seventh-day Adventist church. Deng traveled to the village twice a week to
share God’s love with her mother’s neighbors.
   She ministered to the elderly and the sick whom she met during her
neighborhood visits, and then she invited them to hear God’s message of
love. A little group began meeting in Deng’s mother’s home, and within a
year some forty people were attending. They crowded into the small home,
filling every available space.
    Someone complained to the authorities about the unauthorized meetings
being held in the house, and the police shut down the house church. Deng
went to the government and explained that she was helping the people.
“Some are old, and others were sick; they have no one to care for their
needs. Go and ask them who is caring for them,” she challenged.
   The local people begged the police not to close down the church. “Deng
is a good person. She is helping us,” they said. The police allowed the house
church to continue meeting while Deng sought formal permission to find a
church in which to worship.
   The church members found a small house to rent and converted it into a
church. But soon it, too, was too small, and when Deng asked for land on
which to build a church, the local authorities couldn’t help her.
   The congregation found an old movie theater for sale, and Deng requested
permission to buy it. But she learned that a businessman wanted it and could
afford to pay far more than Deng’s congregation. The believers prayed that
God would influence the government to let them buy the building. But the
price rose, and the congregation had to release its bid to buy the cinema.
   Deng felt impressed to return to the government and ask them to inter-
vene with the businessman, asking him to let the church buy the cinema.
The official explained Deng’s work in the village to the businessman, and
he withdrew his bid to buy the building.
   Deng’s congregation didn’t have the money to buy the building, but the
46 Adventist churches in the region agreed to help buy the cinema. Within
two years the little congregation grew to some 150 people.
   Global Mission pioneers such as Deng work in many regions of China
and throughout the unreached world, sharing God’s love and reaching
souls who otherwise might never hear the message of salvation. Your mis-
sion offerings support the work of Global Mission. To meet more Global
Mission pioneers, visit www.Global-Mission.org.

            Member Ministry




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Eph. 4:12, 2 Cor. 5:15–20,
      John 4:35–41, 1 Thess. 1:5–8, Acts 14:27.

Memory Text: “But you are a chosen generation, a royal priest-
      hood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may pro-
      claim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His
      marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9, NKJV).

Key Thought: Too often evangelism and witnessing are seen as
      the pastor’s job alone; this attitude is wrong.



      A
              ccording to Peter, God’s people are chosen, called to be a “royal
              priesthood.” Because the priests were given a ministry, it follows
              that if we are called to the “priesthood,” then we have a ministry,
      as well. We must understand, however, that we are not called merely in
      order to perform a ministry. First and foremost, God is calling us into a
      relationship with Himself, and it is out of that relationship that we are
      compelled to share with others the great things that God has done, and is
      doing, for us. This is at the heart and soul of personal witness.
         Each of us, therefore, has a personal ministry to perform, and it involves
      proclaiming the praises of Him who has called us “out of darkness into
      His marvelous light.”
         This week we will explore the concept of “every member ministry”
      and see how each individual experience contributes to the church’s cor-
      porate ministry. The point is that each of us has a role to play in the work
      of outreach and evangelism.

     Every Member Ministry		
       Too often we hear Christians lament that they are not talented
     enough to do anything significant for God. While the devil would
     certainly like us to think this way, the Bible tells us that all Christians
     have a God-given ministry. We need to know what it is and then
     determine by God’s grace how to use it for His glory.

Examine Ephesians 4:12 and 2 Corinthians 5:15–20. What do these
     verses say about each believer’s ministry?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Paul clearly says that the saints are to be equipped for a ministry.
     Everyone who has been reconciled to God through the sacrifice of Jesus
     is given the ministry of reconciliation and is an ambassador for Christ.
     An ambassador is one who personally represents a sovereign or head of
     state. This concept emphasizes the personal relationship between Christ
     and all who have been reconciled as they carry the message of His love
     and grace into the world.
        There is much confusion over the word ministry. Today ministry is
     seen to be something that the pastor does; after all, he or she is “in the
     ministry.” Although some engaged in pastoral ministry do have certain
     special areas of work and expertise, Scripture is adamant that part of the
     work of the pastor is to equip the members for a personal ministry.
        The New Testament gives evidence that the early believers under-
     stood the concept of every member ministry. Wherever they went and
     in whatever circumstances they found themselves, they all preached
     about the Lord Jesus (see Acts 8:1–4).
        There is another way in which Jesus shows that we all have a special
     ministry to perform. He clearly stated that He did not come to be served
     but to serve (see Matt. 20:28, Luke 22:27). He also clearly said that His
     followers are to be servants also (see Matt. 23:11; 20:26, 27). If that’s
     not ministry, true ministry, then what is?
        Jesus is not simply ordering us to be servants; He is leading us to
     understand that a servant ministry is a result of our connectedness with
     Him. These verses describe the life of the person who has fellowship
     with the Suffering Servant Jesus Christ. They also affirm that to be in
     Christ is to continue His ministry.

      How willing are you to serve others? Is it your natural inclina-
      tion, or do you tend to try to get from others rather than to
      give? How can you further acquire the attitude of service?

                                                                             15

      The Need for Laborers
         Sometimes we are sent to reap where others have turned the soil,
      sown the seed, and watered the crop. Although there may be the rare
      occasion when one person digs, sows, waters, and reaps all in one
      field, this is certainly not the rule. In our fast-paced modern world,
      people move into and out of our sphere of influence, and we must be
      ready to build upon the evangelistic work that others have begun.

Read John 4:35–41. While we often get excited at the reaping stage
      of a person’s Christian growth, what do these verses tell us about
      rejoicing with others who have contributed along the way?

      ________________________________________________________

         Usually when we refer to reaping, we are specifying a certain time
      of year when the crops are ready to be harvested. For most crops there
      is a specific reaping season. In the spiritual realm, however, there is
      no set time for reaping. Jesus makes this point strongly in John 4:35.
      In agricultural terms, the harvest may well have been four months
      away, but in regard to those who are ready to accept Jesus, some part
      of the field is ever ripe for harvest.
         At Jacob’s well, Jesus sowed the gospel seed in the heart of the
      Samaritan woman. She, in turn, sowed the seed among the people of
      Sychar, and now the Samaritans walk toward Jesus past unripe grain
      fields. As it was with the disciples, the Lord encourages us to be ready
      to reap from the continually ripening field of the world.

Consider 2 Peter 3:9. Why is God so keen for laborers to go out into
      the harvest?

      ________________________________________________________

        It is because of God’s great love and compassion for humankind
      that He desires laborers to go into the harvest (see Matt. 9:36–38). As
      we consider the world field today, the harvest still seems great and
      the laborers few. The disciples were told to pray that reapers would
      be sent out into the harvest. As we modern-day disciples pray for
      laborers, the Holy Spirit will open the way for us to do that which He
      has called us to do.

       Think over the past few days. How many chances did you have
       to witness for your faith, to plant a few seeds that could one day
       reap a harvest? How many of those times did you do it? How
       many opportunities did you pass up?

     Individuals but Together
       The local church is not simply a number of disconnected people
     who sit in the same building for a couple of hours once a week.
     According to Scripture, the church is a group of people who are as
     closely joined as are the parts of a human body. The possibility does
     exist, however, that people can meet together regularly without being
     a part of the body in a biblical sense. Although this unfortunate fact
     can be true in many areas of church life, we are focusing on the need
     to be united in the areas of evangelism and witnessing.

Consider Ephesians 4:16. What would happen to the growth and
     effectiveness of a body if it lost its elbow, wrist, or knee joints?
     And what does Paul’s analogy say about the church as a body of
     believers that has been given an evangelistic mission?

       The apostle Paul says that a church body grows when all of the
     members do their share. What does this say about churches that are not
     growing? Our first reaction might be to blame those whom we consider
     to not be doing their share. That might be true, but think about this:
     how often do churches deprive members of an opportunity to contrib-
     ute to the body? If church leaders don’t understand the ministry of
     all believers principle, they will not intentionally work for maximum
     involvement of the membership in church life and ministries.

Read 1 Thessalonians 1:5–8. What did the Thessalonian church do
     with the gospel that they had received from Paul?

        The church at Thessalonica is an example of a church that received
     the gospel and passed it on. It is still God’s will that His church func-
     tion in this manner.
        The blessings received when each individual member works within
     a planned church evangelistic strategy are many. We will focus here
     on the important areas of encouragement and accountability. Working
     as a team enables us to consider these areas seriously. A lack of team
     encouragement has been the death of many a worthwhile lay minis-
     try. While individuals may possess special talents and gifts, working
     toward common goals through corporate strategies is still the ideal.
     Likewise, the group dynamic encourages accountability, not in the
     sense of judgment but in the sense of review and evaluation.

      In what ways could you work more closely with church mem-
      bers in the effort of reaching out to others? Why is it so easy to
      get complacent, sleepy, and inward focused?

                                                                          17

     Working Together, With God
        Yesterday we noted the importance of working together evange-
     listically as a church. We must also understand that we are working
     together to accomplish a divine objective. Therefore, when a church
     considers witnessing and evangelistic strategies, members must feel
     strongly that they are working together with God, who motivates,
     directs, empowers, and gives the increase.

Read Acts 2:47 and 1 Corinthians 3:5–9. What is the result of God’s
     influence in the church’s attempts to share the gospel?

     ________________________________________________________

Read 2 Peter 3:9 and Titus 2:11. What motivates and empowers
     believers to work together with God?

     ________________________________________________________

       The Scriptures abound with evidence of God’s love for the crown-
     ing act of His creation: human beings. It is not surprising, therefore,
     that He has taken the initiative in the salvation of humankind. In truth,
     the Cross alone provides all the proof we would ever need regard-
     ing how much God loves us and how much He wants us to be in
     His eternal kingdom. The Lord has, indeed, reached out and blessed
     us through His grace; and this amazing grace, as revealed through
     the Cross, creates in us a desire to share that which we have freely
     received (see Matt. 10:8).
       Although sometimes the disciples tried to work alone (see Matt.
     17:14–21), for the most part their experience was one in which the
     divine and human worked together.
       Jesus called the first disciples and promised to make them fishers of
     men. He taught and equipped them, and through their ministry many
     others became believers. However, there was still another divine
     aspect that they would need after Jesus had returned to heaven. That
     was, of course, the Holy Spirit, who would empower the early church
     in its witnessing and evangelism mission.
       Those who become involved in evangelism today are still co-
     laborers with God for the salvation of others. We must pray that the
     Holy Spirit will teach us how to present God’s love and provision in
     ways that will reach the hearts of those in need of the Savior. We need
     to be aware that we cannot do anything apart from the Lord and that
     only by an attitude of faith, submission, humility, and willingness to
     die to self and to serve others can we be the most effective witnesses
     in God’s hands. Self must be put aside in order for the Lord to use us
     as effectively as possible.

      Reporting to the Church
        This week we have noted some important aspects of a believer’s
      work for God. We now can touch on the topic of “reporting” (we will
      look at this in more detail in week 12). Reporting to the church on wit-
      nessing and evangelism activities builds a climate of encouragement
      and blessing. Those reporting can receive the encouragement of the
      church membership, and those hearing the reports are blessed as they
      realize what God is accomplishing through His people.

Read Acts 14:27 and 15:4. Why do you think that reports were brought
      into the church?

      ________________________________________________________

        A reading of the context of the above verses reveals that reports
      were brought into the church after some extended period of cross-
      cultural evangelistic preaching. These reporting sessions show the
      church’s interest in, and support for, spreading the gospel.
        The whole book of Acts is a report of the early church’s missionary
      endeavors, and it is filled with lessons for the modern-day church. The
      importance of reporting is underscored as we imagine what it would do to
      the book of Acts if all reports of evangelistic activity were removed.

Read Mark 6:30. Why do you think the disciples reported to Jesus
      what they had done?

      ________________________________________________________

         While it is true that there is personal witnessing and evangelism that
      happens spontaneously, it is also true that the church as a whole must
      have an intentional planned approach. Working with an overall church
      strategy helps to maintain focus and the logical progression of activities.
      It also brings regular opportunities to evaluate and report. Reporting is not
      simply listing the things we have done. Through reporting, the church and
      those witnessing can again see that they are co-workers with the Lord.
         Some people are hesitant to turn in reports because they wonder if
      it is a form of boasting in human achievement; however, by our faithful
      reporting, God is glorified, and His church is strengthened in faith.
      The early Christians glorified God when they heard the missionary
      reports of the apostle Paul (see Acts 21:19, 20).

       If you were to report to the church your most recent evange-
       listic efforts, what would you say? What does your answer say
       about yourself, and what about it, perhaps, might need some
       changing?
                                                                               19

    Further Study: Choosing a Ministry in Which to Become Involved In.

           Last week you were encouraged to consider all of the witnessing
         and evangelistic areas of church life in which you like being involved
         or in which you would become involved if asked. The challenge this
         week is for you to decide upon an evangelistic activity and to become
         involved in it. The following are this week’s key areas of focus:

         1. Review the list of evangelistic activities in which you could pos-
         sibly become involved. Shorten your list to two or three evangelistic
1
         ministry areas by considering where you feel that your talents lie and
         to which area of ministry you feel that God is calling you.

         2. Further reduce your list by considering the amount of time you
         will be able to regularly devote to a ministry. Also consider being
         committed to a ministry that will continue for twelve months so that
2
         you will be able to move through the planning, implementation, and
         evaluation stages.

         3. Choose a ministry and inform your pastor and personal ministries
         leader of your desire to become involved in your preferred area.
         Request a meeting with them to share your ideas and dreams. Inquire
         about their plans for the church’s evangelism and determine how you
         can get involved or where your preferred ministry can complement
3
         whatever plans (if any) that the church already has in place.

         4. Humbly ask your pastor and personal ministries leader to share their
         thoughts on your suitability for the ministry you have chosen. They will
         want you to be successful in whatever area of witnessing and evange-
         lism you choose; therefore, their counsel will be invaluable.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 How does the following quote relate to the biblical truth of
          the priesthood of all believers? How does it support the need for
          every member to work together? “The work of God in this earth
          can never be finished until the men and women comprising our
          church membership rally to the work, and unite their efforts
          with those of ministers and church officers.”—Ellen G. White,
          Gospel Workers, p. 352.

          l
          2 As a class, discuss what strategies your church could put in
          place that will help members to understand that they are impor-
          tant to the church’s witnessing and evangelism. How best can
          you work toward maximum participation of members?

Jewels of Truth
   Afet knew that she had found great truth at the small group meeting that
she and her mother and sister had been attending. Within a year all three
were baptized.
   Afet’s heart burned to share her faith with others, but it wouldn’t be
easy. Most people in her country consider Christians to be infidels. Afet
prayed for wisdom, and God showed her texts in the dominant religion’s
holy book that could help to lead people to Jesus. Afet printed these texts
out and gave them to people.
   “Your holy book says that Jesus will come again,” she told people as
she gave them the cards that she’d made. As people read the verses, God
opened their hearts to hear about Jesus. “I tell them that the Bible teaches
many of the same things their holy book teaches, sometimes in greater
detail,” says Afet. “They are surprised. I show them verses from their holy
book that say that the Bible is the word of God and it never changes.”
Using this approach, Afet and her fellow believers have led many to
Christ and organized several small groups.
   With help from the church headquarters in her country, Afet and her
fellow believers bought 10,000 books to sell door-to-door in their city of
800,000 people, where very few people are Christians.
   One day an older man answered Afet’s knock. He saw that Afet was
selling books and sent his son to fetch a young man who sells religious
books of his own faith. Afet prayed for wisdom and asked God to guide
her words. When the young man arrived, the home owner took a copy
of Steps to God [Steps to Christ] from Afet and showed it to the young
man. “Do you sell this book?” he asked. The young man said that he
didn’t know the book. The older man bought two copies of Steps to God
and gave one to the young man to read. He kept the other for himself and
thanked Afet for the opportunity to read more about God.
   A girl on the second floor had seen Afet going door-to-door. She hur-
ried to catch Afet before she left the building. She asked to see Afet’s
books and picked up Steps to God. “I saw this book in a dream!” she said.
“I must have it!”
   God is using Adventist books to lead these people to the Bible and to
the Savior. Your mission offerings help to support ministries such as this
in countries where it’s difficult for Adventists to share their faith.




Afet shares her faith as a Global Mission pioneer in a country in central Asia. To protect
her identity, her full name hasn’t been used.

      Spiritual Gifts for Evangelism
      and Witnessing




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Pet. 4:10; John 16:8,
      13; 1 Cor. 12:28–31; Acts 2:40–47; 13:4, 5.

Memory Text: “And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some
      prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for
      the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edify-
      ing of the body of Christ” (Ephesians 4:11, 12, NKJV).

Key Thought: Spiritual gifts are special attributes given to each
      member to be used for God’s glory and for the saving of souls.



      A
              s a church we have rightly emphasized the spiritual gift of
              prophecy, but we have not always stressed the importance of
              other spiritual gifts for ministry. Yet, it’s important that we
      do so. It’s a clear biblical doctrine; thus, as a church, we need to take
      these gifts seriously in order that members can become comfortable
      with receiving and exercising those gifts.
        It is unfortunate that many church members do not take advan-
      tage of the gifts they have been given. There are many reasons for
      this lack. Sometimes the fault lies with the members themselves.
      Sometimes, perhaps, more could be done to encourage members to
      discover their gifts and then use these gifts in ministry and outreach
      under the direction of the Holy Spirit. What a waste to have a gift and
      never use it for that which it was intended.

     Gifted Believers
       If you asked the members of your church, many of them would
     have to think long and hard before they could conclude that they
     had any spiritual gift that the Bible lists, even though many of these
     people have probably already been exercising a spiritual gift. They
     have just not consciously recognized it as such. A number of people
     who have not formally sought to discover their giftedness do expert
     ministry in areas to which they feel called, and their church affirms
     them. Very often a spiritual gifts discovery seminar simply confirms
     the gifts already manifested in a ministry. It is clearly possible, there-
     fore, that people can exercise a spiritual gift under the leadership of
     the Holy Spirit without formally discovering and naming that gift. At
     the other end of the spectrum there are those who find it difficult to
     become involved anywhere in the church because they don’t consider
     themselves gifted in any way. It is important to encourage them to
     discover their giftedness and intentionally seek to work within it.

Read 1 Peter 4:10. What does this verse say about everyone who is
     committed to the Lord having some gift?

     We have already seen that every believer has a ministry, so it should
     come as no surprise that God will equip us to perform it. Therefore,
     everyone who takes the great gospel commission as a personal evan-
     gelistic mandate from God will be equipped by the Spirit to become
     involved. Regarding the church’s soul-saving work, God knows what
     is needed in what place and at what time.
        Read 1 Corinthians 12:11. It reveals that the bestowal of spiritual
     gifts to believers is a part of the Holy Spirit’s work of equipping the
     saints for every good work (see Eph. 2:10). Not only does the Holy
     Spirit distribute spiritual gifts among believers but, also, as Acts 1:8
     reveals, He empowers us to use our gifts.
        None of the Bible passages that list spiritual gifts are identical. This
     suggests that the lists of gifts given are not complete; that is, there
     might be other gifts as well that could be added to the list.

      Think about the word gift or gifts. What does the word imply?
      What does it tell you about your responsibility to use that which
      has been freely given you for the work of the Lord (as opposed
      to only for some other purpose)?

      The Spirit and His Gifts
         To a certain extent a person’s spiritual gifts define his or her place in
      the local church. In other words, to discover spiritual gifts is to discover
      where the Lord wants you to function in the body. Have you ever been
      asked to be involved in an area for which you just had no passion or
      interest? Do you know people who have accepted church positions only
      to resign partway through the church year because they feel that they are
      the wrong person for the job? Most likely in these situations, people have
      been asked to undertake, and in some instances have tried to become
      involved in, a church ministry that they are neither called to nor gifted for.
      Though this does happen, it doesn’t have to be the norm.

Read Acts 13:1–3. What happened here, and what does it tell us
      about the importance of being called to a ministry?

      ________________________________________________________

         It is significant that the Holy Spirit is the one who calls us to min-
      ister for God. Barnabas and Saul were called and equipped by the
      same Spirit. Verse 2 gives us some important information. It reveals
      that Barnabas and Saul were already involved in ministering for the
      Lord before they were called for a specific ministry. We know that it
      was a specific ministry because Simeon and Manaen were not called
      at this time.
         Just before Jesus left the earth, He promised that the Holy Spirit
      would come to be our Helper. Part of the Spirit’s work is to equip
      us to spread the gospel. If, therefore, He gives us gifts to accomplish
      the evangelistic task, then they are surely important, and we need to
      exercise them.

What do the following texts reveal about the Spirit’s interaction with
      us? John 16:8, 13; Acts 13:4; Rom. 8:11; Acts 1:8.

      ________________________________________________________

        When we understand why the Spirit gives spiritual gifts, we see
      how vital they are to the salvation of those we are to reach for
      Christ. Through the Holy Spirit’s calling and gifting, each believer is
      involved to varying degrees, and in diverse ways, in the great work of
      spreading the gospel.
        Although we may designate some gifts as important or special, in
      reality all gifts are crucial to the life and mission of the church. While
      we sometimes place a gifted evangelist, preacher, or teacher on a ped-
      estal, those with gifts that nurture and disciple are just as crucial.

      Discovering Our Gifts
         Discovering our gifts is not difficult. You will be able to recognize
      quickly the gifted ministry areas of your pastor and other key leaders in
      your church. All you have to do is observe what they are doing and notice
      how people respond to their ministry. However, it is another matter when
      it comes to considering what one’s own spiritual gifts might be.
         The process of discovering an individual’s spiritual gifts has some-
      times been presented as rather simplistic: fill out an inventory, apply
      a formula, and your gift is discovered. Many church members have
      attempted to discover their spiritual gifts through this avenue but have
      been disappointed when their local church does not place them in
      positions where they can exercise their gifts within the body.
         An appropriate spiritual gifts seminar is perhaps the easiest way to
      begin to discover your spiritual gifts. However, it is wise to consider
      the seminar as only the beginning of the search, as, indeed, most pre-
      pared seminars point out.

Read 1 Corinthians 12:28–31. What is Paul telling us in these verses
      about spiritual gifts?

      ________________________________________________________

         These verses are not directing us all to desire one or two gifts that
      are commonly thought to be the best. In this passage Paul shows that
      spiritual gifts are distributed according to the needs of particular situa-
      tions facing any church in any place at any time. The best gifts would
      be those that would empower members of the local church.
         When seriously considering your possible gifts, don’t underestimate
      what other church members say. When members sit on the nominat-
      ing committee to choose the various leaders and support teams for the
      coming church year, they look for people who have already exhibited
      an interest and ability in certain ministries. Even though the commit-
      tee may not understand or intentionally consider spiritual gifts, they
      are in fact looking for people gifted in specific areas of ministry.
         When someone shares his or her belief that you would be really
      effective in a certain ministry position, it may well be a confirmation
      of your gifts. It would be wise to listen and pray about it.
         The results of a spiritual gifts seminar—coupled with the affirma-
      tion of fellow believers and the results of a trial period in a particular
      ministry field—would be a clear indication of what the Lord has
      called and gifted you for.

       What do you think your own gifts are, and why?

      Other Gifts
        When we think of spiritual gifts and witnessing and evangelism, we
      tend mostly to focus on the gifts of evangelism, preaching, and teach-
      ing. Though not all gifts are overtly evangelistic, if ministered within
      the church body they will have varying degrees of impact upon the
      church’s evangelistic mission.

Read Acts 6:1–4 again. People were given similar responsibilities to
      those we would expect of deacons today. What reasons did the
      disciples give for not wanting to do this work? How are we to
      understand the principle that is revealed here?


         The newly elected deacons were contributing to the overall evangelis-
      tic program of the early church by freeing up the disciples to be engaged
      full time in evangelism and preaching. So while we may not consider the
      actions of the deacons as gifts that would equip them for the evangelistic
      front line, they did have evangelistic impact behind the scenes. Of course,
      it is quite possible that the deacons’ ministry of distributing aid to needy
      widows rendered people more ready to listen to the gospel when it was
      preached. God alone knows the good these people did in their roles.
         For a church to function, leaders and administrators are necessary in
      the areas of organization, finances, and so forth. Those who serve their
      Lord in these varied capacities must understand that they are part of a
      team and that their contribution is essential to the church’s overall evan-
      gelistic thrust.

Read Acts 2:40–47. What spiritual gifts were being manifested here,
      and what was the result, not only in witnessing but in discipleship?
      What important lessons can we take from this for ourselves?


         The word added in Acts 2:47 is used in the sense of incorpora-
      tion into a society. While the new converts were certainly added to
      the church, they were also brought into fellowship and cared for.
      Therefore, we can conclude that spiritual gifts in the areas of admin-
      istration, leadership, hospitality, pastoral ministry, and service would
      be among those present. This is a good example of the exercising of
      individual spiritual gifts to benefit the whole church through support-
      ing the evangelistic ministry of others.

       Think of your own part, your own role, your own ministry in
       the church. Where does it fit in with the mission of the church
       as a whole?

     Gifts and Christian Responsibility
        Spiritual gifts are not discovered just to satisfy our curiosity but rather
     to indicate that which the Lord would have us do and to show where we
     fit into the church body. This, of course, brings great responsibility as
     we seek to fulfill that for which God has especially equipped us.

Compare Romans 12:4, 1 Corinthians 12:12, and Ephesians 4:16.
     What do these verses say about spiritual gifts and the body?

     ________________________________________________________

       It is significant that the three main chapters that list spiritual gifts all
     do so in the context of the church body. This shows that although an
     individual may be involved in a witnessing or evangelism event on a
     personal level, as with Philip and the Ethiopian treasurer (Acts 8), we
     each have the responsibility to exercise our gifts through the church.
       As we have seen already, whatever the church does, it must do
     under the authority and direction of the Holy Spirit. It is our responsi-
     bility to seek the will of God and to work in harmony with that which
     the Spirit reveals. We must not fall into the trap of making plans and
     then seeking divine approval. Often we ask, “What can our church do
     for God?” We would do better to discover and get involved with what
     God is already doing among His people.

What do Matthew 10:19, 20; Acts 13:4, 5; 16:6, 7 tell us about how
     the disciples were directed by the Holy Spirit?

     ________________________________________________________

       The disciples allowed the all-knowing Holy Spirit to direct their
     ministry. Sometimes they tried to enter a field of labor and were
     prevented by the Holy Spirit. Most probably Paul received a vision in
     which the Holy Spirit gave him specific instructions as to where the
     disciples were to work (see Acts 16:9, 10).
       Spiritual gifts must be used responsibly, and the best way to ensure
     this is for the receiver of a gift to maintain an open communication
     channel with the Spirit. We have a responsibility to maintain the unity
     of the church. If we are Spirit-led, there will be the desired unity. The
     Spirit directs individuals, and He directs the church. The direction He
     gives to one member, He gives to the whole church. The Spirit does
     not lead individuals away from the body.
       When we have committed ourselves to the service of Christ, we can
     expect great things to happen as the Holy Spirit is poured out upon us.
     The key is for us, as individuals and as a church, to be ready to receive
     that which the Spirit gives.
                                                                               27

    Further Study: Discover or Organize Local Training Opportunities.

           If you have decided upon an area of witnessing and evangelism and
         have discussed it with your pastor and evangelism leaders, it is time to
         consider your readiness for the task. You will want the best possible
         chance of influencing people for Jesus; thus, training is important.
         Remember, working as a team rather than individually will ensure
         encouragement, support, and success. The following are this week’s
         key areas of focus:

1        1. In consultation with your pastor and evangelism leader, discuss
         what, if any, training events and processes can be undertaken. All
         training does not have to be at the local church. Explore the possibil-
         ity of attending regional training or being sponsored to attend some
         training seminars, if available.

2        2. Another training option is to request that your pastor or other
         trainers provide local witnessing and evangelism training. If costs
         are prohibitive and there are only a few people wishing to be trained
         at your church, why not advertise regionally and make it a regional
         training event based at your place?

         3. While you are undergoing training for your chosen area of witness-
         ing and evangelism, consider what resources are available. Becoming
3        familiar with resources, and how to use them, forms an important part
         of preparation for your ministry.

         4. Crucial to your outreach and evangelism ministry is personal spiri-
         tual preparation. You will become increasingly aware of your personal
         spiritual needs as you begin to serve God. As you then request and
         receive a greater infilling of the Holy Spirit, you will be empowered
         for greater service. Pray for the Holy Spirit to direct and use you.

    Discussion Questions:			
          l1 “God has set in the church different gifts. These are precious in
          their proper places, and all may act a part in the work of prepar-
          ing a people for Christ’s soon coming.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel
          Workers, p. 481. Consider to what extent spiritual gifts are empha-
          sized in your local church. What can you do to raise their profiles?

          l
          2 “All men do not receive the same gifts, but to every servant of
          the Master some gift of the Spirit is promised.”—Ellen G. White,
          Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 327. How can we encourage all church
          members to discover, develop, and use their spiritual gifts? Why
          is it important that we do so?

A Home of Hope
   Eddah watched the activity in the Masai camp nervously. It seemed that
the whole clan had come to help her mother prepare for her wedding feast.
But Eddah didn’t want to marry; she wanted to continue her studies. She
is a bright girl and had completed several years of primary school several
miles from her home. Then one day she was attacked and raped on her
way to school. Even after Eddah realized that she was pregnant, she con-
tinued her studies, stopping only to have her baby.
   Eddah wanted to return to school, but her father found a man who
would marry her and take her baby. He already had several wives. The
wedding would take place the next day; Eddah’s only hope was to run
away to a school she’d heard about, Kajiado Adventist Education and
Rehabilitation Center near Nairobi, Kenya, a self-supporting school oper-
ated by Seventh-day Adventist lay men and women.
   When the women went to buy supplies for the wedding, Eddah wrapped
her 4-month-old son in a blanket and set off to find the school. She walked
more than 25 miles through bush country to the school.
   Eddah and her baby arrived sunburned and dehydrated after their long
walk. The matron fed them and listened as Eddah told her story. The
matron agreed to take Eddah, but they had no facilities for her infant son.
However, there was an orphanage not far away.
   Eddah’s family learned where she had gone. Her father was angry that
she had run away, but he is proud that she is at the top of her class. Eddah
will soon graduate from high school. “I want to study law,” Eddah says.
“I want to fight for the rights of other girls to study and have a brighter
future.”
   Eddah’s family, like many Masai families, is learning that education is
a better investment for their daughters than an early marriage.
   Kajiado Adventist Education and Rehabilitation Center must find spon-
sors for more than 100 Masai girls whose families cannot or will not pay
their tuition. The girls learn responsibility by sharing chores and caring
for their personal needs. And while they study they learn to love and obey
Jesus.
   The work at Kajiado has changed the lives of dozens of Masai boys and
girls over the past several years. Global Mission pioneers are being sent
into the area to reach the Masai with God’s message of love. Your mission
offerings help support this work in the farthest corners of the world.



Kajiado Adventist Education and Rehabilitation Center near Nairobi, Kenya, is a self-
supporting school operated by Adventist lay members.

      Evangelism and Witnessing
      as a Lifestyle




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Cor. 3:2, 3; Matt. 9:36–38;
      1 Cor. 9:20–22; Mark 5:1–19; John 17:11–19.

Memory Text: “At Joppa there was a certain disciple named
      Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good
      works and charitable deeds which she did” (Acts 9:36, NKJV).

Key Thought: Whether we acknowledge it or not, all believers
      preach a message by the example of their lives.



      I
           t has often been said that Christianity is not just an adherence to
           a set of beliefs; it is also a way of life, a lifestyle. After all, what
           we believe will, ultimately, impact the choices we make and the
      kind of lives we live.
         It is also true that those who claim to be Christians are keenly
      observed by others who are looking to see whether their lives match
      their professed beliefs. Even if we don’t intend it, those who watch us
      do learn from us. So, the important question is not, “Are we influenc-
      ing other people and passing things on to them?” but rather, “How are
      we influencing other people, and what are we passing on to them?”
         While we should always remember the importance of our uninten-
      tional influence on those around us, we must also intentionally plan
      to help people to make a connection between faith and lifestyle. This
      week we will study how the Christian’s lifestyle can demonstrate the
      relevance of faith in everyday existence.

      Silent Sermons
         How would you have recognized the followers of Jesus back in the
      first century? You could recognize the priests and the Pharisees by
      the way they dressed. Likewise, you would recognize a fisherman, a
      peasant, or a Roman soldier by their clothes. But, again, how would
      you recognize a Christian?

Read John 13:35. According to Jesus, what is one special way His fol-
      lowers are identified? What does that mean in practical terms?

      ________________________________________________________

        Jesus said that if we love one another, others will know that we are
      His disciples. How will they know? Because love in action will con-
      vince them. The love we have for Jesus and for fellow believers will
      determine how we respond to God’s will and, in turn, how we treat
      one another. Furthermore, the love and concern that we have for those
      outside of God’s fold will determine how we treat them too. This is
      the sermon that they will see and observe, and it speaks louder than
      anything you could ever say. Many parents have noticed that very
      early in life their children develop an internal “hypocrisy detector”
      that becomes enhanced and fine-tuned as they grow older. We must
      be aware, therefore, that many of the people we associate with, and
      witness to, also have a highly developed ability to recognize the dif-
      ference between a genuine spiritual experience and a mere profession
      of spirituality.

Read 2 Corinthians 3:2, 3. What is Paul saying about the way in which
      God wants to use His people to influence the lives of others?

      ________________________________________________________

         We must not underestimate both our intentional and unintentional
      influences on those around us. The Christian’s life is to be like a letter
      sent from Jesus Christ to the world. From a heart that is renewed by
      divine grace, this letter will demonstrate the power of the gospel to
      transform lives and thereby will witness for the Lord.

       How have you been affected by those whose actions matched
       their profession? How have you been affected by those whose
       actions didn’t match their profession? What will help you to
       always remember that your actions will influence others, one
       way or another?

     Having Compassion for People
        Each day we all fleetingly brush past people we don’t know. We
     pass them on the street, sit near them in cafés, and wait with them in
     lines. Sometimes we even acknowledge their presence with a nod or
     a smile as we move past them. Although we could never personally
     contact each person we see each day, God’s desire is for all these
     people to accept Him into their lives. For someone, somewhere, we
     can be a part of God’s plan to save him or her.

Read Matthew 9:36–38. Though spoken in a specific and unique
     context, the sentiments Jesus expressed are not limited to just that
     context. What was Jesus saying, and how do those words apply to
     the field in your immediate area?
       			

        The multitude that Jesus saw on this occasion was troubled and
     distressed. The people were so downcast that they had all but given
     up on any remnants of a religious experience they had left. Those
     whom God had placed in charge of the spiritual welfare of His people
     had neglected their duty. Consequently the people were scattered and
     disheartened. Jesus had compassion for them because He knew that
     they needed a spiritual shepherd.
        Among the masses of people with whom we mingle, many are com-
     mitted to Jesus Christ. But many more also desperately need the Good
     Shepherd. Somehow they must be reached for Christ.
        Jesus, the disciples, and a few other followers had been engaged in
     the gospel harvest, but as the harvest grew, so did the need for more
     laborers. Although Jesus’ invitation to pray for more reapers was
     probably also calculated to get some followers to consider their own
     call to the harvest field, it also promises that God understands the
     need for more workers and will supply them.
        Most churches are surrounded by such a large harvest field that it
     is not practical to leave the reaping up to a few members. When we
     have compassion for the people who live around our churches and our
     homes, in some cases numbered in the thousands, we again will sense
     the need to pray that the Lord of the harvest will send out workers, and
     perhaps, in turn, we will realize our potential as laborers for the Lord.
        As we focus on outreach and evangelism, it is important that we
     continually review our potential local harvests. These local people,
     many of whom are already seeking God, will be impacted for good
     by the compassion we show them.

      Discuss what the word compassion means. How can you learn
      from your own suffering and your own need for compassion?
      How can you be more compassionate to those around you?

     Walking in Their Shoes
       Here’s an important point: rather than providing what we think
     people need, we must learn to recognize what they see as important
     priorities. What are they concerned about? What are their problems?
     What do they feel that they need?

Read 1 Corinthians 9:20–22. What do these verses tell us about
     Paul’s approach to different peoples and his desire to identify
     with their needs and concerns? What can we take from this for
     ourselves in our attempts to reach out to those around us? See
     also Heb. 4:15.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Without compromising on matters of principle, the apostle Paul
     was willing to go anywhere and do anything he could to be in a better
     position to convince people of the truth of the gospel. In other words,
     he was willing to walk in their shoes in an attempt to understand them
     and to determine the best way to reach them for Jesus Christ.
        The point is that often we try to provide what we think people need.
     Yet, we should seek first to understand what they see as their needs.
     To walk in the shoes of another means that we attempt to understand
     life and all its intricacies and issues from their perspective; it is to
     try to understand their hurts and joys. In other words, to meet them
     where they are.
        Of course, this is what Jesus did. His earthly life was one of iden-
     tifying with those He came to save. He can understand our struggles
     and pain because He experienced the same. He had great disappoint-
     ments, endured false accusations, rejection, and unfair punishment.
     He was “God with us” in the fullest sense of entering into our lives.
        Furthermore, because He entered into our experiences, He can meet
     people where they are. As we read through the Gospels we discover
     that Jesus did not have just one method of evangelism and witness-
     ing. He reached out to people in their own life context. When He met
     the woman at Jacob’s well, He spoke about living water. To farmers,
     He told stories about sowing seeds, harvest time, and the weather. To
     fishermen, He spoke about fish, nets, and storms. Jesus had a wonder-
     ful way of presenting great spiritual truths as He identified with the
     normal issues of daily life, and those who listened learned about the
     water of life and the need to sow the gospel seed. Many of them even
     became fishers of men.
                                                                         33

     A Hospitable Lifestyle
        There is a saying that is often voiced when we speak of reaching
     people for Christ. “People don’t care how much we know until they
     know how much we care.” The point is that we can teach and preach
     all we want, but if people feel misunderstood, unloved, and unac-
     cepted, then our witness will be severely hampered, no matter how
     eloquent our preaching or how reasonable and true our teachings.
        This leads to the simple idea of hospitality. Hospitality includes the
     areas of acceptance, welcoming, openness, caring, generosity, kind-
     ness, and friendship. These qualities all have to do with the way that
     God would have Christians relate both to one another and to those
     whom they seek to reach for the Lord.

Read the story of the demon-possessed man in Mark 5:1–19. What did
     Jesus tell this man that illustrates the principle that friends are more
     receptive to our sharing the gospel? How can we learn to apply this
     principle in our own work of personal witness and ministry?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Jesus could have directed this man to go back to his town and tell
     everyone about his healing experience. The fact that the Lord specifi-
     cally directed him to seek out his friends underscores the truth that
     those with whom we already have relationships are the most receptive
     to the good news that we want to share about His love, grace, and
     deliverance. Those friends would then share the exciting news with
     their other friends, and so the gospel message goes forward.
        Important to this whole process is that we have friendships outside
     of our circle of believers. Because many work out in the world, they
     will naturally have many acquaintances, but acquaintances are not
     close friends. However, acquaintances can become friends through
     what has been called hospitality evangelism, and hospitality evan-
     gelism flows out of a hospitable lifestyle. In other words, hospitality
     evangelism is not something that is turned off on occasion; rather, it
     is the way we live. See also Luke 14:12–14.

      In what ways could you be more hospitable to those around
      you? How can you learn to be more willing to give of yourself
      in order to meet the needs of those whom you are seeking to
      reach?

     Widening Your Friendship Circle
        While a searching soul occasionally may approach a Christian and
     ask, “What must I do to be saved?” for the most part believers must go
     out in search of the lost sheep. Some suggest that the church acts too
     much like a fortress from which a few people go out on a campaign
     or mission in order to collect some converts who are then admonished
     not to get too close to the world from which they have been saved.
     Whether this is true or just a perception is not the point. The point
     is that many Seventh-day Adventists have few, or no, meaningful
     relationships outside of the fellowship. Though it is important for us
     to avoid unholy influences, there is a degree to which such isolation
     detracts from our ability to reach people with the gospel message.

Examine closely John 17:11–19. What do these verses reveal about
     the Christian’s place in the world? See also Col. 4:2–6.

     ________________________________________________________

       From these verses we can extract the following truths about Jesus’
     disciples and the world:
       They are in the world (vs. 11).
       They are not of the world (vss. 14, 16).
       They are not yet to be taken out of the world (vs. 15).
       Jesus sent them into the world (vs. 18).

        We are all born into this world. While we are here, God also has a
     work for us to do in it. Just as with His first disciples, Jesus has sent us
     into the world to introduce whomever we can to Him and the promise
     of salvation that He offers all humanity.
        The challenge for each one of us is to intentionally expand our
     personal mission field. This may mean adjusting our lifestyle in order
     to rub shoulders with more unchurched people. This is not to say that
     we compromise principles, convictions, and values, but, rather, that
     we look for opportunities where we can, in clear conscience, interact
     with others in a way that will allow us to become both friends and, as
     a result, channels of God’s truth.
        Often we excel in sending out invitations for the people to come to
     us. Yet, Jesus actually told us to go to them. Thus, we need to ask our-
     selves if we have withdrawn too much from the world and therefore
     have lost some of our evangelistic effectiveness.

      Look at yourself: do you tend to be too insular, too remote from
      the world? Or, perhaps, are you too cozy with the world? How
      can you better learn to be in the world (and thus witness to
      others) and yet not be “of it”?
                                                                             35

    Further Study: Discover Where Your Ministry Fits Into Your
         Church’s Overall Plans.

           While most local church departments may have a well-organized
         program and be quite busy, the chances are that those involved in each
         department may not know much about what is happening in other
         areas of church life. Furthermore, there may not be an overall church
         evangelistic plan of which each department group is aware and,
         therefore, can contribute toward. For the purposes of encouragement,
         support, and effective evaluation, it is best that your evangelism and
         witnessing ministry be a part of an overall church strategy. To achieve
1        this, the following suggestions are important:

         1. Meet with your pastor, elders, or evangelism leaders to understand
         what, if any, evangelism and witnessing goals are in place and what
         strategies are being followed to reach these goals. Remember, you
         are trying to discover where your chosen evangelism and witness-
2        ing activities will fit with the church’s plans and help to reach their
         goals.

         2. You may discover that although there is much evangelistic activity
         in your church, there are no documented goals or strategies. If this is
         the case, then request a meeting with the pastor, elders, or evangelism
         leaders, and ask them what their personal goals for evangelism are.
         Take some notes during your discussions. You are building up a pic-
3        ture of your leadership’s evangelistic vision that will help to suggest
         goals and ways of reaching others.

         3. At this stage you may decide to join with an already established
         evangelistic ministry. If, however, your chosen ministry is in a new
         area of evangelism or witnessing, you will need to gather a small
         group of people who share your vision. Document your goals and the
         strategies you will employ to reach those goals.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 “Too often the influence of the sermon preached from the
          pulpit is counteracted by the sermon preached in the lives of
          those who claim to be advocates of truth.”—Ellen G. White,
          Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 21. What kind of witness
          does your life, as opposed to your words or profession, reveal?

          l2 Think about your church as a whole. How integrated into the
          community is it? If your church vanished tomorrow, how much
          difference to the community would that make? Would it make
          any difference at all?

Stubborn Atheist
   I was an absolute atheist, a teacher of physics and astronomy on a mis-
sion to convince my students in Bulgaria that God doesn’t exist.
   Then my brother became a Christian—a Seventh-day Adventist Christian!
I wasn’t sure what he believed, but I was sure it meant trouble. My brother
tried to convince me to study the Bible and give Christianity a chance, but
I refused to listen. In fact, I refused to allow him to say one word about
it in my presence.
   He sent me Bible studies and literature, but I refused to open the enve-
lopes. I reminded my brother that Karl Marx had said that religion is the
opiate of the people, and I refused to be tainted by such superstition.
   But my brother kept sending the literature. Finally, I decided to read
what he sent, only so I could show him the errors of his new beliefs.
I opened the first envelope, and read through the lesson. Then I read
another and another. The sixth lesson talked about Jesus’ second coming.
Something about this lesson touched my heart. My interest was aroused.
I went back and reread each lesson and filled in the study sheet. I found
myself looking forward impatiently for each lesson to arrive.
   I found the tiny Seventh-day Adventist church in my city and began
to visit it. I began reading the Bible, too. When I finally told my brother
that I was studying the Bible, we shared precious moments of discovery
together. For the first time in my life I experienced the presence of God in
my life as we prayed together.
   At first I thought that only absolute vegetarians who wore ultra-
conservative clothes were God’s true children. But over time God revealed
that His children don’t focus on outward appearances and actions, but on
being heart-right with God. As I realized this, I felt a wonderful freedom
and joy. I learned to love the believers who didn’t eat like me or look like
me. I learned to love others because Jesus loves them, and He relies on us
to be His light in this dark world.
   Four years after my baptism God surprised me again. I had wanted to
teach a few old women in a village how to serve God, but the conference
invited me to become the women’s ministries director! Imagine, me, the
stubborn atheist, teaching other women to love God! He never ceases to
amaze me.
   God reached me through a praying brother and literature provided by
the mission offerings of faithful people around the world. Imagine what
He can do with your mission gifts.

      Sequential Evangelism and
      Witnessing


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 25:35–40, 1 Cor. 3:1–3,
  1 Pet. 2:2, John 6:54–66, Luke 8:4–15.
    							
Memory Text: “I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for
  until now you were not able to receive it” (1 Corinthians 3:2,
  NKJV).

Key Thought: In all evangelism and witnessing, it is important
      that we first present the simple truth of the gospel.



      S
             equential evangelism is a strategy based on the understanding
             that people will move from one church program to another when
             the programs are arranged in the right sequence. This, however,
      has to be done correctly or else it can do more harm than good.
        Our key text shows how Paul understood the fact that we can undo
      by overdoing. We can deliver so much complex material, and in the
      wrong order, that the receiver either chokes on the volume, fails to
      grasp the depth of meaning, or is reluctant to apply personally what is
      learned. Just as a baby’s diet begins with milk and gradually comes to
      include solid food, babes in Christ must receive spiritual food so that
      their developing spiritual understanding can assimilate.
        This week we will explore how evangelism and witnessing strate-
      gies and programs blend and how they build on, and support, each
      other throughout the church’s sequential evangelistic year.

      Sequential Evangelism and Felt Needs
         As we have already noted in earlier weeks, the discovery of individual
      or community felt needs will influence how we approach people and the
      programs and services that we make available to them. As we under-
      stand felt needs, we are better able to plan a sequence of programs that
      meets those basic needs, whether for an individual or a community.

Read Luke 9:11. What does this verse indicate regarding Jesus’ desire
      to heal both physically and spiritually? In our spheres, how can we
      seek to do the same thing for those whom we are trying to reach?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         No doubt many who came to Jesus were primarily focused on His
      ability to relieve physical suffering. Jesus would help them physically,
      of course, but He would also address a need that perhaps was not keenly
      felt by each person—the need for spiritual healing.
         While God’s people today are active in meeting people’s personal
      or community needs, they must follow Jesus’ example and somehow
      help to turn minds to eternal issues.

Examine Matthew 25:35–40. What is the message here? How seri-
      ously do we really take those words, or do we just see them as a
      metaphor? That is, if we really believed them, how differently
      would we act?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Ministering in any way to those whom Jesus loves and for whom
      He gave His life is ministering to Jesus Himself. This demonstrates
      just how closely related Jesus is with His creation. When any are
      hurting, He is concerned for them and sympathizes with them; we
      must do the same. Matthew 25:35–40 indicates that meeting felt needs
      does not always have to be a part of a fixed church strategy. When
      needs are discovered, they must be met, no matter where a church is
      in its sequential strategy. While many people will move along from
      program to program as their spiritual interests develop, others will
      need spiritual nourishment right away. A church need not abandon
      its planned sequence of programs and events, but it must be able to
      respond to any eventuality by having trained personnel and adequate
      resources available at all times.
                                                                           39

     Milk and Solid Food
     						
Compare 1 Corinthians 3:1–3 and 1 Peter 2:2. What do you think
   Paul and Peter were specifically referring to when they spoke of
   milk and solid food and the need to grow? In your mind, what is
   theological milk as opposed to solid food?

     ________________________________________________________

        Evidently the members of the church at Corinth had not progressed
     very far in their spiritual development after Paul had established the
     group. Consequently, when he preached to them, his message was an
     appeal for them to surrender themselves to God and grow in spiritual-
     ity to the extent that they could grasp the deep truths of the gospel. His
     preaching at this time would have been evangelistic rather than edify-
     ing. Paul would not preach on the deeper themes while the people were
     not spiritually mature enough to understand and respond to them.
        As we reach out to people today, we must be ever mindful of Paul’s
     strategy. We must lead people to surrender to Christ before we expect
     them to accept the deep, life-changing truths of His Written Word.
        When we speak of an evangelistic sequence, it can refer to a long strat-
     egy or a short process. When people have progressed through a sequence
     of programs to the place where they are open to God’s call, they can
     be led through a full evangelistic series or begin a personal Bible study
     series. Whatever the program the principle is still the same: first the milk
     (simple gospel themes to begin a relationship) and then the solid food
     (deeper and more testing truths leading to firm commitment).

Read John 16:12. What important point do we find here? How can
     we learn to apply this principle in the ways in which we deal with
     others?

     ________________________________________________________

       A new Seventh-day Adventist was so excited about the truth he
     had learned that he wanted to tell everyone. Often, the first thing he
     wanted to share with others was all about “the mark of the beast.”
     However well-meaning, he was a prime example of how truth needs
     to be presented in a sequential manner.

      Think about some Bible truth that you struggled with at first
      that you found hard to accept. Over time, how did you eventu-
      ally settle into that truth? What did you learn from this experi-
      ence that could help you to be more sensitive in your outreach
      to others?

     Testing Truths
       A testing truth is a biblical teaching that, once understood, chal-
     lenges the individual to make significant changes in his or her per-
     sonal beliefs or lifestyle. Some testing truths, such as seventh-day
     Sabbath observance and the avoidance of unclean foods, impact both
     belief and lifestyle. This underscores once again the necessity of lead-
     ing people to accept Christ before urging them to do things for Him.

John 6:54–66 shows that some people turned away from Jesus when
     they faced a testing truth. Why did some who had followed Jesus
     eventually turn away? What lesson is here for us personally? What
     “testing truths” still, perhaps, challenge your commitment to Jesus?


        Many who had witnessed, and benefited from, the feast on the
     mountainside the previous day followed Jesus in order to be fed again.
     As Jesus attempted to turn their minds to spiritual things by using the
     illustration of His body and blood, many turned away. It wasn’t that
     they could not grasp the truth of salvation through Christ alone; it was
     that they refused to accept it. It was a testing time, and when their
     personal wants were not met, they chose to walk away.

Read John 14:15. In what ways do these words present a “testing
     truth”?


        Here is a challenge for those who claim to love Jesus to consider
     seriously their commitment to Him. Sooner or later the time will come
     when a professed belief will be tested by the call to action. The reality
     is that sometimes, at any stage in the evangelism process, people turn
     aside when faced with testing truths. Experience has shown, however,
     that people respond more easily and positively to a testing truth when
     a love relationship with the Savior has been cultivated. In other words,
     it is still true that the right sequence brings the best results.
        Jesus had many things that He wanted to tell the disciples, but He
     knew that they would not understand them yet (see John 16:12). His
     promise that the Holy Spirit would guide them into all truth (John
     16:13) is a promise that extends to our time, to us, and to those we
     seek to lead to Christ.

      However free the gift of grace is, the commitment that results
      from accepting that gift can, at times, be very costly. How can
      you help someone struggling with this cost, whatever the specifics?
      What have you learned about the cost of commitment that you
      could share with someone who is facing the same challenge?
                                                                          41

     Measuring Spiritual Growth
        Just because we deliver biblical information through a public lec-
     ture, seminar, or Bible study, there is no guarantee that we have influ-
     enced those present in a spiritual way. Many people have attended an
     evangelistic series, a Revelation seminar, a Bible study, or maybe all
     of the above. Though they might have gained an intellectual under-
     standing of Bible truth, this doesn’t mean that they have integrated
     these truths into their lives.
        How, then, can we better determine that people who hear what we
     have to say are being impacted by truth in a life-changing way?
        One important way in which we can measure people’s spiritual
     growth is by asking questions. Asking questions is a good way to
     gauge a person’s spiritual understanding and growth. It is best to ask
     open-ended questions. These are questions that encourage an informa-
     tive answer and that cannot be answered simply by yes or no.
        Some typical questions might be, What do you think these verses
     are saying to us today? How would you share this Bible truth with a
     friend? How do you feel about God’s promise to you? What changes
     do you think you need to make in your life, in your attitude toward
     others, and in how you live in general, because of what you have been
     studying? How do these truths help you to love Jesus more? Of all the
     things you have been learning, what impresses you the most? What
     gives you the most hope? The most fear?
        Bible studies, as well as other evangelistic presentations, should be
     arranged in a logical and orderly sequence. That is, the more simple
     and easy-to-understand studies are presented first, while more com-
     plex studies are presented later in the series when the Bible student’s
     understanding has grown. It is important that searching questions be
     asked throughout each study to gauge spiritual understanding and
     growth.

Look up the following verses and consider why a God who knows
     everything would ask such questions: Gen. 3:9, 13; Matt. 16:13–15;
     22:41–46; Mark 9:33; Luke 2:46. What does this tell us about how
     questions can be a powerful tool for helping people grow in God’s
     grace?

     Preparing a Harvest
        Leading a person along in his or her spiritual journey is like prepar-
     ing for a harvest. Anyone who has worked a vegetable garden knows
     that there is a definite time frame and sequence of steps to follow if
     the desired harvest is to be realized. We must dig in the soil, remove
     the weeds, plant the seeds, and water the garden. It is also necessary
     to create the right environment for the plants; some may require full
     sunlight, while others may need some shade. Furthermore, it is neces-
     sary to protect the plants from birds and other garden pests. In other
     words, plants in a garden must be nurtured from seeds to fruitful and
     mature plants. For people on the spiritual journey, a similar process
     begins before they are baptized, and it must continue afterward, as
     well. Ideally a person is nurtured along until he or she is able to start
     nurturing others. This truth again underscores the vital nature of a
     planned sequence that provides the right time frames, takes the right
     steps, and creates the best nurturing and protective environment.

Read the parable of the sower and Jesus’ explanation in Luke
     8:4–15. What challenges does this parable bring to us in regard
     to nurturing to maturity the seed that falls on good ground? See
     also John 16:7, 8, 13.

       Jesus’ explanation of the parable reveals some interesting facts.
     Verse 12 suggests that some people began to believe but were sidetracked
     by the devil before their belief was firmly established. Verse 13 describes
     some who received the word with joy. They believed for a while, but,
     when tempted, they chose another direction. Verse 14 mentions another
     group who heard but did not go on to Christian maturity. Most of the
     people started on the journey toward Christ and His kingdom, but things
     happened at various stages along the way that prevented their growth
     progress.
       Simply sowing the seed is rarely enough to bring about a good
     harvest. Our challenge as a church, and as individuals, is to sow the
     gospel seed and then sequentially nurture to maturity all those who
     begin the journey.

      What part of the parable best describes your own spiritual
      experience? What choices can you make that can improve your
      situation?
                                                                            43

    Further Study: Finding a Target Audience

            By now you will have discovered that the evangelism strategy
         we are following week to week will take longer than one quarter to
         achieve. For instance, we would not expect that the local evangelis-
         tic training opportunities mentioned in Lesson 3 will be discovered,
         planned, and attended in just one week. However, while you are con-
1
         sidering training and where your ministry will fit into your church’s
         overall plans, it is important that you consider your target audience.
            The following points are worth considering:
         1. In consultation with your pastor, elders, and evangelism leaders,
         decide upon your witnessing and evangelism programs and target
         audiences. Considering your target audience will help you to focus
2        on all aspects of the process. For instance, with a children’s program,
         it will be better to advertise in schools and in neighborhoods that
         contain young families. Other target audiences may be the retired, the
         unemployed, students, and so on.
         2. Focusing on a target audience will help you to choose the best
         personnel, location, time, and follow-up strategies. It will also help
         in effective evaluation at the conclusion of your program, as well as
3        providing you with a specific prayer focus.
         3. You may not have to look further than your church to select a target
         group. Consider people who attend church but are not baptized, or the
         church’s unbaptized young people, or people who regularly attend
         special church or church-school programs.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 “One truth received into the heart will make room for still
          another truth.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol.
          6, p. 449. In what sequence should the truths we hold be presented
          in order to increase the effectiveness in our outreach? Why should
          Christ’s substitutionary death always be at the forefront of all that
          we teach?

          l
          2 “Christ drew the hearts of His hearers to Him by the manifesta-
          tion of His love, and then, little by little, as they were able to bear
          it, He unfolded to them the great truths of the kingdom. We also
          must learn to adapt our labors to the condition of the people—to
          meet men where they are.”—Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 57.
          How should love for those to whom we are speaking to about God’s
          Word temper the way we present Bible truth, especially points of
          doctrine that might challenge a person’s existing beliefs, or do we
          need to?

No Longer Alone
   “Sometimes, I wonder if my mother has seen me but didn’t recognize
me,” 16-year-old Ginny said.
   Born in the Haitian countryside, Ginny was given up at birth. She lived
in several different homes and even lived on the streets. When Ginny was
4, a woman took her home to live with her. “I got to go to school!” Ginny
said. “But when Ginny was 10, the woman invited a man to live in the
house. He beat Ginny and tried to rape her. “I screamed, but no one came
to help me,” she said stoically. “I was so scared; I couldn’t sleep.”
   Ginny left the woman’s home and lived with a neighbor, where she
cleaned house in exchange for food. Ginny was mistreated in this home,
too.
   “I’ve suffered a lot,” Ginny said. “I just wanted to have a home and a
mother.”
   One day someone told Ginny that her mother was in Port-au-Prince.
They gave her a telephone number. Ginny called the number and heard
her mother’s voice. She learned that she had five sisters. When Ginny
asked if she could visit, her mother agreed.
   Excited that at last she’d have a home and a family, Ginny made plans
to visit her mother.
   But the January 12 earthquake shattered Ginny’s plans. Ginny survived
the earthquake, but she lost everything else. She searched for her mother’s
home to find it was now only a pile of rubble. “Day and night, I wonder
if my mother and sisters are still alive somewhere,” she said. “I came so
close to meeting her, and then the earthquake took everything away.”
   Ginny made her way to a displaced-persons camp, where ADRA pro-
vides shelter, food, and understanding adults who can help her to deal with
the traumas she’s experienced. ADRA is working with other agencies to
keep these children safe and unite them with their families. They have
given Ginny hope.
   Ginny met another girl who also was separated from her family. “We
look out for each other,” she said. “For the first time in my life, I have a
sister. We are no longer alone.”
   Our church has more than 330,000 members in Haiti. ADRA has been
working to help the Haitian people for some thirty years. Your mission
offerings and a recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is helping to rebuild
the work in Haiti so that more people can experience God’s love.

      Personal Evangelism and
      Witnessing


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 4:13, 14; John 1:37–50;
      Psalm 139; 1 Pet. 3:1–15; John 4:37, 38.

Memory Text: “ ‘You are My witnesses,’ says the Lord, ‘and My
      servant whom I have chosen’ ” (Isaiah 43:10, NKJV).

Key Thought: Those who have the joy of assurance of salvation
      will want to lead others to experience the same.



      A
               lthough many people will hear the good news about Jesus
               through a church’s witnessing and evangelism endeavors,
               there is a special sense in which the individual’s influence
      contributes significantly to the success of the corporate church pro-
      gram. Over the last few decades, surveys have shown that friends,
      relatives, neighbors, or acquaintances (all under the power of the
      Holy Spirit) were the most influential factors in leading people to give
      their hearts to Christ. Research has shown that up to 83 percent of
      new members surveyed stated the influence of their church-member
      friends, relatives, and acquaintances as being significant. Of those
      who attended some form of public evangelistic meetings before join-
      ing the church, 64 percent attended at the invitation of someone in
      their close-people network.
         This week we will review some biblical examples of networking
      and consider our connectedness to Jesus and our personal influence
      on those close to us.

     My God and Me		
        Our personal relationship with Jesus will have a direct bearing
     upon our success in witnessing for Him. It is so easy to learn some
     witnessing and evangelism formulas and then rally forth in our own
     assumed wisdom and strength. While God can still bless our efforts,
     we must ever remind ourselves that it is His work, and we accomplish
     it through His power. Do we want to merely impart knowledge (albeit
     important knowledge), or do we want to encourage a vital spiritual
     relationship? And how can we pass on to others what we don’t have
     in and of ourselves?
        Of course, there are always examples of people—however weak in
     faith themselves, however close to tottering on the edge of apostasy
     and backsliding—who nevertheless are used by God to lead others to
     Jesus. In a large city a number of years ago, a young woman, having
     joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church, worked tirelessly to reach
     her brother. After years, the brother was baptized. One month later,
     the sister left the faith and, as of now, still renounces it. Although
     cases like this happen, the fact is that the stronger our own connection
     with Jesus, the more powerful a witness we will be.

Read Acts 4:13, 14. What do these verses reveal about the relation-
     ship that Peter and John had with Jesus and what this connection
     enabled them to accomplish? Think through what was meant
     when it says that “they realized that they had been with Jesus.”
     What does that mean? What should a person who has just “been
     with Jesus” be like?

       The lesson in God’s Word is pretty clear. As we think about our
     personal mission fields, as we assess the ripeness of the grain and the
     urgent need of laborers, we need to allow the Lord to draw us into a
     close and powerful relationship with Him; a relationship that will give
     us power that, otherwise, we wouldn’t have.

      How is your own personal relationship with the Lord? How
      does your mere presence, the way you talk, act, and treat peo-
      ple, reveal your relationship with God? Be as painfully honest
      with yourself as you possibly can.
                                                                         47

     My Personal Mission Field
       When Jesus looked at the crowds of people, He was filled with
     compassion (see Matt. 9:36). Sometimes we may think that Jesus sim-
     ply saw the crowd, but, in reality, He saw each individual that made
     up the crowd. In the same way, we should be aware of the individuals
     in the crowds through which we walk and those in which we live.
     Our church can be aware of individuals in the crowd only if church
     members interact on an individual basis with those who are in their
     sphere of influence.
       Those with whom we personally interact on various levels of
     intimacy are, in reality, our personal mission field. From our closest
     family relationships we can move outward to other relatives, friends,
     and acquaintances. Occasionally others may fleetingly move in and
     out of our sphere of influence and, for a brief time, become a part of
     our personal mission field.

Read John 1:37–42. Why do you think Andrew told his brother about
     finding the Messiah before he told anyone else?


        Andrew had been a disciple of John the Baptist, and as John’s min-
     istry was to prepare the way for Jesus, it is understandable that some
     disciples made the transition to following Jesus. Andrew’s conversa-
     tion with Jesus excited him so much that he immediately went looking
     for the person closest to him, the brother with whom he had spent
     many long nights fishing on the Sea of Galilee.

Read John 1:43–50. Look at what is going on here. What interper-
     sonal relations are revealed? In what way does Philip respond
     to Nathanael’s skepticism? What lessons can we take from this
     story that can help us to understand how personal witnessing
     works?

     ________________________________________________________
     								
     ________________________________________________________

        The early movement to follow Jesus seems to have gained momen-
     tum through social networking in the Capernaum and Bethsaida areas.
     Notice that Philip does not argue when Nathanael has doubts that the
     Messiah would come from a small, insignificant, rural village. He just
     issues a simple invitation, “Come and see.”
      How much self-sacrifice will it take on your part for you to be
      a better witness to those in your vicinity?

My Personal Potential			
   When our personal ministries leaders call for volunteers to be
involved in witnessing and evangelism, we often think that many
people are more qualified and gifted than we ourselves are. Others
seem more confident and capable. However, the Bible reveals to us
that God is not necessarily looking for those who are the most quali-
fied as much as those who are willing to be used, whatever their gifts
and talents.
   A good example of this is God’s calling Moses to deliver His
people from Egyptian slavery. Moses could see many reasons why
someone else would be more qualified to do what God proposed (see
Exod. 3:11, 4:10). In Moses’ mind, he had what he thought were good
reasons not to do what the Lord asked of Him.
   In response to a call to evangelistic action, many modern-day
believers echo some of Moses’ concerns—“Who am I to be consid-
ered for such a task?” “What if they ask me some hard questions?” “I
am not a good enough speaker.” We can smile at Moses for thinking
that God needed to reconsider His personnel-recruitment strategy,
but God knew Moses’ potential, and despite his personal fears and
concerns, he was the right person for this special task.
   The calling of Moses to lead God’s people is one that convinces us
that God knows us infinitely better than we know ourselves. God does
not focus upon past performance but upon personal potential. Each
believer has tremendous potential to contribute to the Lord’s work.
   On the other hand, we must guard against overconfidently running
before the Lord. While it is true that we should often search our own
hearts in order to evaluate where we are spiritually, we need also to
understand that the human heart can be less than objective with self-
evaluation. Therefore it is also good to ask God to examine us and show
us our true condition, because our condition affects our potential.

 Read Psalm 139. Why did David ask God to search His heart?
 What lessons are here for us, not just in terms of witnessing but
 regarding our walk with the Lord, in general? What can we
 take away from this psalm for ourselves right now? What com-
 fort, hope, and encouragement is there for you? At the same
 time, what does it say to you about the changes that you need to
 make in the way you live?

     The Witness of a Righteous Life
        Do actions really speak louder than words? Yes, immensely so. It is
     true, therefore, that while a message can be given through actions without
     words, an equally strong message can be given through words without
     actions. There is something very powerful about a message that incor-
     porates both actions and words that are in agreement. To profess to love
     God and then act as if you don’t is hypocrisy, and the worst witness that
     can be given is profession and action that are not in harmony.
        Consistency speaks loudly. While your family and friends may not
     seem to be listening to what you say, they are watching to see if it is
     in harmony with what you do and how you live.

Read 1 Peter 3:1–15. What do these verses tell us about the power
     of a Christian life and its potential to win unbelievers to Christ?
     Imagine the power that would attend our witness were we to live
     as we are told to in this passage. What message especially does
     verse 15 give in the whole context of our personal witness? See
     also Matt. 5:16.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        We can imagine the strife that could have arisen when a pagan
     woman accepted Jesus as her Savior while her husband remained in
     paganism. Her burden for his salvation could lead her to exhibit an
     argumentative and nagging spirit as she considered him to be part of her
     personal mission field. On the other hand, as Peter suggests, she could
     be faithful to her God and hope and pray that her godly life would win
     her unbelieving husband to the Master. In other words, she could let the
     actions of her daily life be a constant and powerful witness.
        Letting our light shine incorporates all the possibilities of influenc-
     ing lost men and women for the kingdom. Those around us must not
     only hear our good words, they must also see our good works, for in
     so doing they will see the power of God working through us, and the
     Spirit will challenge them to recognize the possibility and blessing
     of God’s presence in human lives. People must be convinced that
     Christianity is not only a title that we claim but also an empowering
     relationship that we enjoy. Using examples is an important method of
     teaching, and Christians are examples, whether intentionally or unin-
     tentionally. We witness by what we do and who we are even more
     than by what we say or profess to believe. If that’s a scary thought,
     it ought to be.

      My Contribution to the Whole
         This week we have been considering our personal mission field and
      our witnessing and evangelism potential. It is also important to grasp
      the truth that, because the church consists of all the members, each
      one’s individual effort contributes to the church’s overall corporate
      evangelism. Are you aware of what strategies your church has in place
      in its work to lead people to Jesus? You may be able to invite people
      from your personal mission field to attend church functions and pro-
      grams. On the other hand, are your church’s evangelism leaders aware
      of what you are doing in your personal mission field? They may be able
      to support you through prayer and with specific resources.

Read John 4:37, 38. What encouragement can we get from Jesus’ words,
      “ ‘ “One sows and another reaps” ’ ”? What is He saying here, and
      how have you seen that truth realized in your own experience?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________
      									
      It is very probable that on this occasion Jesus was making reference to
      the gospel seed sown by Himself, John the Baptist, and the Samaritan
      woman. The disciples were reaping where others had sown, and the time
      had indeed arrived when sowers and reapers were rejoicing together.
         When Jesus said “ ‘ “One sows and another reaps,” ’ ” He was not
      saying that, as individuals, we are either sowers or reapers. Although our
      churches have probably put more emphasis upon the reapers, it is true
      that, were there no sowers, the reapers would wait in vain for a harvest.
      We are all called to sow and to reap, and in any local church scene there
      are many combinations of sowing and reaping activities. It may be that
      your sowing in your personal mission field will be reaped at a corporate
      church reaping process. It may also be that the seeds that others have
      sown will be reaped as people come into your personal mission field.
         As we consider the ways in which each individual contributes to
      the whole (see 1 Cor. 12:12–27), the farming process reminds us that
      even before the seed is sown, someone else has cleared the ground
      and ploughed the soil.
         Clearly the sowing and reaping are parts of a process that continues
      after a person has joined the body. The harvest must not be left in the
      fields but gathered into the barn.

       How can you be more involved in the sowing and reaping pro-
       cess in your church? In what ways have you discovered that by
       working for the salvation of others, your own faith is strength-
       ened? Why do you think that is so?
                                                                            51

    Further Study: Spiritual Preparation for a Personal Ministry

           While we would not deny the importance of Bible knowledge and
         the proven procedures of witnessing and evangelism, we must be
         careful not to neglect an emphasis on personal spiritual preparation.
1
         The essential ingredient in personal spiritual growth is, of course, the
         Holy Spirit, and to experience the Holy Spirit’s power for evangelism
         we must give Him access to our lives.
           As Christians begin to serve their God, they become more aware of
         personal spiritual needs. As they then request, and receive, a greater
         indwelling of the Holy Spirit, they are empowered for a continuing
2        ministry.
           The key is a daily surrendering of our will to God, a daily willing-
         ness to die to self, a daily keeping of the grace of Christ before us, a
         daily remembrance of what we have been given in Christ and what He
         asks of us in response to that gift.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 In regard to winning souls, Ellen G. White wrote this chal-
3         lenging statement: “Your success will not depend so much upon
          your knowledge and accomplishments, as upon your ability to
          find your way to the heart.”—Gospel Workers, p. 193. What
          important point is she making here? After all, how often do we
          see people turn away from the powerful and convincing evidence
          for our message? So often doctrine itself—no matter how bibli-
          cal, logical, uplifting, and sensible—will not impact a person
          with a closed heart. How, then, do we reach the heart? In this
          context, how much more important is it to live out what we pro-
          fess rather than just profess it?

          l
          2 Ponder the following statement as you consider the ways in
          which you can share your personal experience with others: “The
          last rays of merciful light, the last message of mercy to be given
          to the world, is a revelation of His character of love. The children
          of God are to manifest His glory. In their own life and character
          they are to reveal what the grace of God has done for them.”
          —Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 415, 416. The
          question is, How do we in a daily and practical way “manifest
          His glory”? How often in the past 24 hours have you manifested
          God’s glory in your life? What kind of witness for your faith
          does your lifestyle reveal? How can your local church as a whole
          “manifest His glory”?

Fwachi’s Faith
   “I hear you’re attending the Adventist church,” Fwachi’s mother greeted
her. “I hope you haven’t been baptized!”
   Fwachi stood silent, unsure of what to say. She had come home from
Zambia Adventist University planning to tell her mother that she had been
baptized. Now what should she say?
   Fwachi had grown up in a Christian home. Her sister invited her to
visit the Seventh-day Adventist church, but Mother refused to let her go.
However, when Fwachi finished high school, she wanted to study at Zambia
Adventist University. Her sister agreed to pay her school fees, so her mother
allowed her to go. “Just don’t join the church,” Mother warned.
   At school Fwachi enjoyed her Bible classes and was drawn closer to
Christ. During the Week of Prayer, Fwachi rededicated her life to Christ,
but for months she resisted the invitation to be baptized.
   The next year during the Week of Prayer, Fwachi decided to follow
Christ, even if it angered her mother. She waited to tell her mother until her
school break. Then her mother greeted her by saying, “I hear you’re attend-
ing the Adventist church; I hope you haven’t been baptized!”
   “I do enjoy going to the Adventist church,” Fwachi stammered, lost for
words. Maybe it’s best to wait to tell Mother of my decision, she thought.
As Sabbath drew near, Fwachi made an excuse to visit her cousin in town,
where she could attend church. Her vacation ended, and Fwachi hadn’t told
her mother that she was an Adventist.
   Then Fwachi’s sister died. Fwachi was devastated; her faith was shaken.
So many people were praying for her, she thought. How could God let my
sister die? She found comfort in the songs of faith that her sister often sang.
As she sang the precious songs, she no longer felt forsaken. Still, she faced
the question of who would pay her school fees.
   She told her mother of her baptism, expecting her mother to be angry.
Instead her mother nodded. She even agreed to help pay Fwachi’s tuition.
Although Fwachi works at school, it still isn’t enough to pay her fees. She
trusts God will provide the rest.
   One day Mother called Fwachi to tell her she’d visited the church. She
hasn’t attended again, but Fwachi feels this was one small step of faith.
“There will be other steps,” Fwachi says. “I pray that God will use me to
draw my mother to Him again.”
   Zambia Adventist University is one of hundreds of Adventist schools
around the world that receive help from the mission offerings. These
schools make a difference in the lives of their students and the communi-
ties they serve. Thank you for giving to mission so that others can meet the
Savior who loves them.

                         mission under the light of

                         Commission: sharing Jesus!
                         He clearly states that sharing
                         the gospel has less to do with
                         filling up churches and more
                         with filling up hearts; God’s
                         desire is for individuals who
                         are filled with His glory and
                         eager to glorify His name!
                         Sharing Jesus comes as the

      Corporate Evangelism and
      Witnessing


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Eccles. 4:9–12; Psalm 37;
  Phil. 1:5–18; Eph. 4:15, 16; Col. 1:28, 29.
    							
Memory Text: “And the things that you have heard from me
  among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be
  able to teach others also” (2 Timothy 2:2, NKJV).

Key Thought: The dissemination of the truth of God is not con-
      fined to ministers. The truth is to be scattered by all who claim to
      be disciples of Christ.



      A
               s we have seen, it is important that all believers recognize
               their God-given potential. Scripture gives many examples
               where believers used their gifts while working with appointed
      leaders in an evangelistic team ministry.
        In Acts 13:13, Luke’s reference to “Paul and his party” suggests
      that the apostle Paul was the recognized leader of a missionary group
      that included Barnabas (vs. 1). Luke tells us that sometimes the mis-
      sionary work of Paul and Barnabas showed that they worked together
      (Acts 13:50, 14:1).
        Sometimes it is difficult for someone to become involved in local
      church witnessing and evangelism because leaders are not constantly
      looking for gifted people to incorporate into that work.
        Last week we looked at the contributions of individual members in
      relation to the church’s witnessing and evangelism. This week we will
      look at some aspects of the church’s corporate strategies and the way
      in which individuals can become involved.

      Letting the Left and Right Hand Know
        Most people in the church are busy; others, for various reasons, do
      comparatively little. Either way, people often are not aware of what
      their church as a whole is planning or working toward; consequently,
      they don’t see how the activities in which they may be involved are
      contributing to the church’s overall goals.

Read Ecclesiastes 4:9–12. What do Solomon’s words tell us about
      working together? How might these words be helpful to you in
      other settings?


         These verses describe the benefits of mutual help, support, and care,
      whatever the situation. What is true for two or three people is also true for
      the local church. For the blessings described in Ecclesiastes 4:9–12 to be
      realized, each person must be aware of the activities of the others. If one
      person is not aware of what the others are doing or planning, how can they
      know what support is needed, and when? If we consider these points with
      our local church’s witnessing and evangelism in mind, we see again that
      if most members are unaware of what their church is involved in, they are
      not able to give support and assistance when needed. Sadly, because of a
      lack of support, those who are on the front line of witnessing and evan-
      gelism sometimes feel that no one cares about this vital ministry when
      it simply may be the case that others just don’t know what is going on.

The following verses record people performing special support tasks.
      Write down how you think these activities contributed to the
      overall mission of spreading the gospel. Acts 16:14, 15, 33, 34.


        What may at first seem to have nothing to do with the church’s
      witnessing and evangelism strategies will, upon further consideration,
      be revealed as being vital to the whole process. Those who provide
      food and lodging for the visiting evangelist play as vital a part as those
      who welcome the public to the program. Many church members will
      volunteer to support when they are aware of the program and what is
      needed and when they are assured that their contribution is an integral
      part of the whole church program. In this context, it is important to let
      the right hand know what the left hand is doing.

       Take a few moments to reflect upon your church’s evangelism
       and witnessing activities. Are you aware of the corporate church
       goals and strategies? Do you know at what stage the church is in
       this year’s program? How could you become more involved in
       your church’s attempts to fulfill the gospel commission?
                                                                               57

     Planning Together					
     		
        Often, when it comes to the planning of witnessing and evangelism
     goals and strategies, only a very few people are involved. Then when
     plans have been decided, those few people set about the task of trying
     to get others involved in the implementation stages. It is much better
     to get a larger group involved right from the start. This is why the
     Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual states that a chief concern of
     the church board is the work of planning and fostering evangelism in
     all of its phases.

What do Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 14:40 tell us about the need
     to plan? What does this verse suggest may be the results of a lack
     of, or inadequate, planning?

     ________________________________________________________

       There are a number of mistakes that churches can make when con-
     sidering their involvement in witnessing and evangelism. They can
     set goals but then neglect to introduce strategies necessary to reaching
     them; they can try to work on some strategies without setting any firm
     goals; or they can attempt either of the above without considering a
     process of evaluation. Goals and plans go hand in hand, but goals
     always come first so that plans that enable the goals to be reached can
     be laid. Furthermore, it is the process of evaluation that helps to keep
     the church on track and measures progress toward its goals.
       Every church should be aware of the concept of goal ownership.
     Those who set goals and are involved in strategic planning are
     typically the ones who buy into the whole direction and process. It is
     important, therefore, that as many people as possible have some input
     into all phases of the planning so that they, too, have a sense of own-
     ership. If this does not happen, then, most likely, the long-term plans
     will become the property of a select few who will struggle to fulfill
     those plans. In this case, success is unlikely.

      Read Psalm 37. What assurance can we gain from this text in
      relation to the success of our witnessing and evangelism activi-
      ties (as well as a host of other things)? What principles and
      promises can we take from this passage?

     Working in Teams
       It is logical to think that there were times when each of the disciples
     would have shared their faith on a one-to-one basis, but for the most
     part we see them in a shared ministry with fellow disciples and being
     supported by other believers. There is something special about work-
     ing on an overall plan and receiving support and encouragement from
     others on the team.
       The Bible provides us with a blueprint for effective witnessing and
     evangelism, and it should not surprise us that, even today, when God
     raises up someone for a significant responsibility, He inspires a team
     to gather around the leader.

Read Matthew 10:2–4, Mark 3:16–19, and Luke 6:12–16. What
     simple lesson can we learn from these lists?

     ________________________________________________________

        Without question, the early believers worked together in groups. It
     makes a lot of sense. Besides each one having specific gifts and talents
     that others don’t, there’s also protection in numbers. There’s a sense
     of accountability: others are watching you, others can help guide you,
     others can help to protect you from wandering into directions that
     tragically might lead you astray. A solid team of faithful brothers and
     sisters, each one looking out for the other, yet all with the common
     goal of soul-winning, presents the ideal way of doing outreach.

Read Philippians 1:5–18. What do we see in Paul’s commendations
     to the believers at Philippi that indicates they were engaged in
     corporate witnessing and evangelism?

     ________________________________________________________

        At the beginning of his letter to the Philippians, Paul speaks of their
     fellowship (partnership, NIV) in the gospel (vs. 5). They had defended
     and confirmed the gospel (vs. 7) and had spoken the word of God
     without fear (vs. 14). He also shares his joy because Christ is continu-
     ally preached (vss. 15–18). Remember, Paul is writing to the church,
     not to individuals. Of course, it would have been individuals who
     preached Christ, but the fact that Paul commends the church reveals
     that this evangelistic preaching was a corporate strategy.

      Eager to witness, have you ever found yourself tempted in ways
      that being in a group could have protected you from? Why is it
      important to cultivate an attitude of humility and accountabil-
      ity if you are going to work with others in a group?
                                                                           59

     Every Part Does Its Share
        When a unified church is focused upon the evangelistic task at hand,
     the Lord will bless its combined efforts. A careful study of the Bible
     will reveal how much of the New Testament was written to show
     Christians how to live and work together in harmony. “One another”
     passages are scattered thickly throughout its pages. We are commanded
     to love one another (John 15:12), forgive one another (Eph. 4:32), pray
     for one another (James 5:16), to mention just a few. Besides the “one
     another” passages, many scriptures relate to the corporate church, the
     work that it does, and the corresponding growth.

Read Ephesians 4:15, 16. How does working together contribute to
     the growth and edification of the church?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Paul tells us that it is God’s will that we grow into Jesus Christ.
     This shows that we are all on a spiritual journey, and, to a degree,
     it is our own spiritual journey. However, the text explains that each
     individual’s growth will affect the growth of the body both numeri-
     cally and spiritually.
        As believers grow up into Christ, something happens that is won-
     derful, even supernatural. They are “joined and knit together” through
     their personal contributions to the church as a whole. Optimum effec-
     tiveness of any church is achieved when every part does its share.
     According to Acts 1:12–14, what did the early believers do while they
     waited in Jerusalem for the promised Holy Spirit? The answer should
     tell us a lot about what corporate worship meant. Indeed, it wasn’t
     until the Holy Spirit had come upon the early believers that they were
     ready for the task of fulfilling the gospel commission. This group,
     numbering about a hundred and twenty, were united in prayer and
     continued in prayer. No doubt it was Jesus’ promise of the Holy Spirit
     that united them and constantly brought them together for prayer as
     they waited for the power that would enable them to do the Lord’s
     bidding. We, as a church, should be doing the same.

      As you think about your local church, ask yourself this ques-
      tion: How much time and effort does your church, as a corpo-
      rate whole, spend in outreach, witnessing, and evangelism in
      contrast to the time it spends over internal issues, everything
      from liturgy, worship format to music, and so on? Discuss the
      answer on Sabbath.

     The Need for Corporate Unity
       It has been well said that a Christianity that does not begin with
     the individual does not begin, but a Christianity that ends with the
     individual ends. This statement underscores the importance of every
     new believer being incorporated into the body of believers. As with
     witnessing and evangelism, it is also true that incorporation cannot
     be left to certain individuals in the fellowship. Incorporation is the
     responsibility of the entire church.

Read Colossians 1:28, 29. What specific goal did Paul place before
     his new converts?

     ________________________________________________________

        The Christian’s maturity, growing into the fullness of Christ (Eph.
     3:19), is the proper goal of the local congregation. Working for the matu-
     rity of new converts is just as important as working to get them to accept
     Christ and to join His church. In fact, the church’s work of incorporation
     will help to ensure that their evangelistic efforts will not become a waste
     of time. Usually, before any witnessing and evangelism project gets
     under way, there is a time of preparing the church. This is a time when we
     focus on transportation, child care, greeters, prayer teams, and visitation
     teams. The apostle Paul would have us focus on incorporation as another
     important part of church preparation. Consider the following question:

Which is more important to ask, and why: How can new believers
     get involved in church life and its programs? How can the church
     enter the lives of new believers and help them to mature? Are
     both these concepts related and, if so, how so?


        Often we see the work of follow-up and incorporation as the work
     of the one who has led the person to Jesus Christ. We only have to
     realize how impossible it would have been for the apostle Paul to
     nurture all who believed through his ministry in order to see that this
     is not the biblical way. Follow-up is not just the work of one or two
     designated leaders, it is the work of the whole church.
        Too often we lament the fact that new people come in the front door
     and leave by the back door soon after. This is a tragedy of eternal
     consequence.

      Think about new members in your local church. How can
      you—not the pastor or the elder, but you—get involved in help-
      ing them to become solidly grounded in the church community
      and its teachings?
                                                                            61

    Further Study: Setting Realistic Evangelism Goals

            Both as a church and as a smaller ministry team, we must make sure
         that all witnessing and evangelistic goals are realistic. The following
         are some key areas to consider.
            Affordable. Finances play a big part in many church strategies
         today. Consider the costs of advertising, transportation, resources,
         postage, venue hire, refreshments, to mention just a few of the
         expenses incurred in evangelistic activities.
1           Achievable. Are the set goals realistically achievable? Do we
         really have the money, time, support, facilities, and personnel needed
         to achieve the planned outcomes? It is better to start small and build
         into a larger project as others join the team and key support is given
         in other important areas.
            Sustainable. If a witnessing and evangelism ministry is successful,
2        it is surely worth repeating. It may also be that your ministry is part
         of an ongoing strategy, in which case you will need to keep looking
         ahead in order to organize what is needed to sustain the ministry.
            Able to be evaluated. Be sure that you evaluate all aspects of the min-
         istry: personnel, finances, training, results, to name just a few. For
         ongoing ministries, definite and regular evaluation times must be set
         and adhered 10. Also be sure to examine how this venture contributed
         toward the church’s overall strategic plans for evangelism.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Go over your answer to Wednesday’s question as a class. Why
          is it that churches busy fighting internally rarely do outreach?
          In contrast, how could outreach unify a church that’s otherwise
          preoccupied with internal strife? How can you help your church
          to move away from preoccupation with itself and get busy with
          the work of outreach? Why is that so important?

          l
          2 As you consider the following quotation, think about your
          local church. To what extent are the members involved in
          witnessing and evangelism teams? What part can you play in
          organizing team-training events? What is your personal attitude
          toward working in teams? “In laboring where there are already
          some in the faith, the minister should at first seek not so much to
          convert unbelievers, as to train the church members for accept-
          able co-operation.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 196.
          How many members of your church have even the slightest idea
          of how to work for the conversion of souls? If not many, how can
          that situation be changed?

God’s Patient Pursuit: Part 1
   I grew up in a non-Christian family in India. I attended a Christian
boarding school and lived a highly regimented life. So I wasn’t ready for
the freedom I found when I moved to Australia at age 16 to study.
   Many of the young people at school smoked and drank. I wasn’t inter-
ested in these things and avoided the young people who were involved in
these activities. I attended church for my first year in Australia, but then I
quit. I told God that I wanted a break from Him, to see what life was like
without Him. That was the most miserable year of my life.
   I finished high school and started my university studies. One day while
studying, I felt a sudden pain in my chest. I thought I was having a heart
attack. Then I realized that it wasn’t physical pain, but an ache for some-
thing. Could this be God? I wondered. I hadn’t prayed in a year, but that
day I prayed. “God, if this is You, please take away this unbearable pain!”
The pain went away, and I forgot about it. But when the pain returned,
I knew it was God speaking to me. I found a church and attended a few
times. But my job in a bar required me to work Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday, so I quit attending church.
   One evening on the train home from work I met a young man, Daniel,
and his friend Keith. Daniel struck up a conversation with me. I asked him
why he had chosen to speak to me, and he said God had prompted him.
We continued talking, and he invited me to his home for dinner. I gave
him my phone number. I got to know Keith, and I sensed that he knew
God. The peace I saw in him made me wish for a relationship with Christ.
I accepted his invitation to worship with him on Saturday, but the idea of
worshipping on Saturday instead of Sunday seemed strange.
   I graduated and began searching for a job. I couldn’t find one, and I
felt frustrated and out of control. I remembered Keith and the peace he
exuded. I visited him, and he invited me to a small group meeting.
   I went. The group was indeed small, but the members were so genuine,
friendly, and loving that I enjoyed attending. As I studied the Bible, I
realized that it was the Holy Spirit who had been speaking to me all these
years, urging me to let God back into my life. I had come to God broken
and hurting, but God put me back together.
   I learned that the small group meeting was actually a Global Mission
church plant designed to attract young people just like me.

      Equipping for Evangelism
      and Witnessing




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:19, 11:1–11, 10:1–14,
      1 Pet. 5:8, 2 Pet. 3:9.

Memory Text: “Then He said to them, ‘Follow Me, and I will
      make you fishers of men’ ” (Matthew 4:19, NKJV).

Key Thought: Whatever the important proper training, we must
      first be grounded in our relationship with Jesus before we can be
      “properly equipped” to effectively witness for our faith.



      I
          t is highly unlikely that a person who has no personal assurance
          of salvation will be able to lead another into an intimate saving
          relationship with Jesus (although it does happen). They might be
      able to convince others to believe some Bible doctrines and some
      facts, biblical dates, and charts. Such convictions and beliefs may
      even cause people to make significant lifestyle changes. However,
      because good deeds can be performed apart from Jesus Christ, it is
      imperative that any witnessing and evangelistic training feature both
      the doctrinal and the spiritual. To be a true evangelist, one must have a
      firm grasp and experience of “the everlasting gospel.” It is this gospel
      that ultimately brings belief, confession, conversion, assurance, and
      discipleship.
         This week we will see that spiritually and skillfully equipping
      people for evangelism and witnessing is indeed a biblical principle
      and that we need to encourage people to make this a reality in their
      local church.

     The Need for Training
        In Matthew 9:37 Jesus told the disciples that the harvest was plen-
     tiful but the laborers few. Today the harvest is infinitely larger and
     the laborers are still relatively few. There is a great need to send out
     harvest workers who are thoroughly trained and equipped. While it
     ever remains true that the Holy Spirit’s influence is the major factor
     in the success of witnessing and evangelism, it is still important that
     those whom God calls to service be trained through formal instruc-
     tion, observation, and participation. According to Ephesians 4:11, 12,
     there should be a definite endeavour to equip people for the many and
     varied aspects of ministry and service.
        God has promised to bless leaders with certain gifts that will help
     them to function as leaders and trainers for ministry. We can’t stress
     enough, however, that evangelists, pastors, and teachers are not fol-
     lowing scriptural guidelines if they are doing all the work themselves
     and are not equipping others for service. Everyone who is training for
     witnessing and evangelism work must be brought to the strong con-
     viction that it is indeed God’s will that the world be saved from sin,
     that the God-given work of the church is to reach out to a lost world,
     and that it is God’s will that His church in the world will grow.

Read Matthew 4:19 and Mark 1:17 in the context of Matthew 28:19.
     What significance do you see in the fact that the first recorded
     command of Jesus was “ ‘Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of
     men’ ”? What should those words mean to us today as Seventh-day
     Adventists with our understanding of the three angels’ messages?
     How much “fishing for men” are we really doing as opposed to
     just “tending to our own boats”?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       It is significant that Jesus did not simply call the disciples to be fish-
     ers of men. He did not say “Follow Me, and be fishers of men.” He said,
     “ ‘Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men’ ” (ital. supplied).
     Right at the beginning of their formal association with Jesus these men
     understood that they were embarking upon important training. Jesus
     called them into a learning environment where they would be trained
     for the task to which He had called them. The disciples would learn
     much through watching and doing. Only when they had learned, on the
     local scene, what to do and how to do it would Jesus issue to them a
     worldwide commission. Without the appropriate training, instruction,
     and personal spiritual development of workers, the task of taking the
     gospel to our neighborhoods would seem impossible.
                                                                             65

      Learning by Observing
        There are two aspects to learning for those who wish to serve the
      Lord, and one leads to the other. First there is learning to know Jesus;
      then comes learning how to share Him and what He offers to the
      whole fallen human race.

Read about the time Jesus fed the 5,000 (Matt. 14:13–21, Mark 6:30–44,
      Luke 9:10–17, John 6:1–14). List the things that the disciples would
      have observed that would help to equip them for their future min-
      istry. What things can we safely assume they observed that are
      not specifically mentioned in the Gospel accounts? Read also what
      Ellen White adds to this story in The Desire of Ages, pp. 364–371.

      ________________________________________________________

        How exciting not only to listen to the greatest preacher but to
      observe His presentation as He preached about the kingdom of God
      (Luke 9:11) in a way that would have created a desire for the kingdom
      in every heart.
        The principle of learning through observation is applicable to
      everyone. Book learning, or listening to instruction, must always be
      built upon through observation and involvement. Jesus expected the
      disciples of John the Baptist to learn from what they had observed.

Examine Matthew 11:1–11. What had the disciples of John the
      Baptist observed, and what did Jesus expect them to tell John as
      a result of their observations? What was the lesson that Jesus was
      teaching to not only John but His own disciples?

      ________________________________________________________

         John the Baptist had previously presented Jesus as the Lamb of God
      who takes away the sin of the world. But then John was imprisoned
      with no opportunity to preach, and he heard only secondhand reports of
      Jesus’ ministry. It seems that his prison experience caused some doubts
      to surface in his mind regarding Jesus. When doubts arise we should go
      to Jesus, and that is exactly what John did. Jesus sent John’s disciples
      back to tell him what they had heard and seen. As their reports encour-
      aged John, we are left to wonder how the things that they had seen
      impacted their own witnessing and evangelistic ministry.

       In most cases we can’t do the kind of miracles performed by
       Jesus. But with a willingness to die to self and live for others,
       what can we do in our own sphere that reflects the kind of work
       that Jesus did when here?

     Learning by Doing
       No matter how many books people read about their favorite sport,
     and no matter how many games are watched, if they want to be a player
     they have to put their boots on and get out on the field. We call it hands-
     on experience, learning by doing, and without it a person is simply not
     equipped for the task. This universal truth even applies to the Christian’s
     witnessing and evangelism. Sometimes we hear people say that they
     don’t want to get involved because they are not completely ready. They
     must understand that active participation is a vital part of becoming
     ready. Starting small, step by step, building up, is the way to go. As the
     Holy Spirit leads us, our skills, experience, and confidence increases.

Matthew 10:1–14 records Jesus equipping His disciples and then
     sending them out. However different the situation than that which
     we face today, what can we learn from Him sending them out that
     reveals how this was part of their training?

        Jesus had taught the disciples “in the classroom,” so to speak. He had
     also taken them out into the field where they learned by observing what
     He did. Then after Jesus had equipped them with power to heal the sick,
     raise the dead, and cast out demons (vs. 8), He sent them out without
     Him. But notice the amount of instruction He gave as He sent them out.
     Jesus instructed them about what to preach, what miracles to perform,
     what not to take with them, with whom to lodge, and when to leave an
     unfruitful field of labor. We can safely assume that they received other
     instructions, as well. Only through this interaction with people would
     many important lessons be learned. This passage shows on-the-job
     training at its best. They couldn’t minister to those with whom they
     didn’t come into contact; this is a point we must never forget.

Read Luke 10:1–11. What similarities are there between the instruc-
     tions that Jesus gave to the 12 and to the 70? Again, what prin-
     ciples can we learn for ourselves from His instructions?

       Although initially Jesus sent the 70 into places where He intended
     to shortly go Himself (vs. 1), He knew what the disciples and other
     missionaries would encounter as they attempted to spread the gospel
     after His ascension when they were on their own. The instructions
     given to the seventy disciples as they were sent out indicates that
     Jesus was preparing them for what lay ahead.

      How many excuses do you manage to find to not witness for your
      faith when the opportunity arises? What’s your usual one?

     Learning Through Failure
        Sometimes we may fail to reach all of the goals that have been set
     for a particular evangelism activity. Does this mean that we have totally
     failed? Of course not. Regardless of the strategy we employ in our search
     to win the lost, we will have both successes and failures. We may even set
     the bar too high. For instance, if we fail to reach set baptismal goals, we
     may have set unrealistic goals; or this activity may have been more of a
     seed-sowing venture than a reaping program. In short, however much we
     might think the harvest is ready for reaping, it might still only be sowing
     time. We aren’t always in a position to know.

Read 1 Peter 5:8. What other power is dedicated to undermining
     your attempts to win people to God’s kingdom? How can being
     conscious of this threat help us to better prepare and execute wit-
     nessing and evangelism strategies?

       In all of our attempts to win souls, we are up against a supernatural
     foe that is very active to influence people against the gospel. Sometimes
     when we let go of the hand of the Lord, the evil one can cause some
     problems with our efforts to work for God. Our only defense is the
     complete surrender to Christ every moment of our lives.
       As with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, failure may some-
     times cause us to play the blame game, one of Satan’s most successful
     tools for bringing disharmony among God’s people. Rather than look-
     ing for people to blame, we would do better to undertake serious, hon-
     est, and intensive evaluation, remembering that even Jesus, the greatest
     Preacher/Evangelist, did not win everyone to whom He appealed.

Compare Luke 10:17 and Matthew 17:14–20. What did the dis-
     ciples do when they encountered failure in their ministry?

       Rather than give in to despair over our perceived failures, we can
     learn from the disciples again. Even though they had been given the
     power over evil spirits and had indeed been successful in casting them
     out, it is evident that sometimes they failed to accomplish that for
     which Jesus had gifted them. On such occasions they came to Jesus
     and asked Him to explain what was happening and why (see Matt.
     17:19). Here is a principle that we would do well to note; an important
     part of our search for reasons for failure, and how to do better, is to
     take our witnessing and evangelism situations to the Lord.

      What have you learned from your failed attempts at witnessing
      to others that can help you in future attempts? How often does
      fear of rejection hold you back?

     Learning Through Success
        There are two areas in which we can learn through success: the area
     that can be called practical/procedural and the area that can be called
     spiritual cooperation. Although it can be rightly argued that there is
     a spiritual aspect to both areas, we will deal with them separately in
     order to better highlight what can be learned from success.
        The practical/procedural is where we learn from what we actually
     do. For instance, we learn the most acceptable sequence in which to
     present Bible studies in our area. We learn which preaching venue is
     best, which advertising draws the most people, and a host of other
     practical and procedural choices that best fit our particular location.
        Spiritual cooperation is an emphasis upon the fact that God is inti-
     mately involved in the believer’s witnessing and evangelism. After
     all, it is God’s will that everyone be saved.

Read 2 Peter 3:9. What crucial lesson must we take from this verse
     that we should always keep in mind and claim in all our witness-
     ing activities? See also 1 Cor. 3:6.

     ________________________________________________________

        It is no use planting if no one is going to water the seeds. Likewise,
     it is no use watering if you don’t put the water where the seeds are
     planted. And even if the sower and the one who waters get it all right,
     there is still no increase unless given by God. As we see the blessing
     of God bringing success to our humble efforts, we learn. We learn the
     extent to which God is, and wants to be, involved in our endeavors.
     We learn to trust Him more. We learn the importance of a close spiri-
     tual cooperation with God as we strive to reach the souls for whom
     Christ died because there isn’t a person you witness to for whom
     Christ has not died and whom He doesn’t want to see saved. How
     important it is that we never forget this crucial truth.

      How do we take the words of Jesus in John 15:5 and make
      them practical and real in our lives, particularly in our work of
      witnessing and evangelism? How can we as individuals or as a
      team ministry truly experience what Christ tells us in this text?
      What things must we change in order to have that kind of con-
      nection with Him?

    Further Study: Formulate Evangelistic Strategies.

            As your church seeks to do its part in outreach, keep the following
         points in mind:
          • At the very least, involve all of the witnessing or evangelism team
            in the strategic planning process. Ideally the whole congregation
            will be involved in the church’s setting of goals and direction.

          • Initially plan for the next church year. A 12-month strategy is long
1
            enough to start with. Later, you can add more plans and strategies
            that will continue beyond the initial period.

          • Give great attention to helping strategic personnel know exactly
            what is expected of them and at what time. When people are not
            sure of what to do or when and how to do it, a church’s strategic
2
            momentum toward its goals may be slowed or halted.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 “Every church should be a training school for Christian
          workers.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 149. How
          well does your local church fare in this area? If not very well,
          what can be done to bring about the needed changes?

3         l
          2 “Every day Satan has his plans to carry out—certain lines
          that will hedge up the way of those who are witnesses for Jesus
          Christ. Now, unless the living, human agents for Jesus are
          humble, meek, and lowly of heart because they have learned of
          Jesus, they will just as surely fall under temptation as they live;
          for Satan is watching and artful and subtle, and the workers, if
          not prayerful, will be taken unawares. He steals upon them as a
          thief in the night and makes them captives. Then he works upon
          the minds of individuals to pervert their individual ideas and
          frame their plans; and if brethren see danger and speak of it,
          they feel that a personal injury is done them, that someone is try-
          ing to weaken their influence. One draws one way, and another
          in an opposite direction.”—Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 101.
          How can we, as we seek to do the work of witnessing, deal with
          the danger so graphically presented in this passage? What is our
          only defense?

          l
          3 In class, talk about someone or some church evangelistic proj-
          ect that has been successful as a whole. What can you learn from
          that person or project? How can you adapt what you have learned
          to the work in your area, realizing that every situation is different
          and what works in one place might not work in another?

God’s Patient Pursuit: Part 2
   I found a job and was doing well, but I wasn’t satisfied. I sensed that
God had something else in mind for me. A friend called and offered me my
dream job. It was everything I wanted, and the pay was excellent. I could
rise quickly to the top of my field. It seemed perfect! I agreed to interview
for the job.
   That same week a Seventh-day Adventist evangelist came to hold meetings
in our town. His wife would hold training sessions for people interested in
becoming Bible workers. I didn’t plan to go to the workshop; I didn’t even
know what it meant to be a Bible worker. But God impressed me to attend.
   As the week progressed, war raged within me. I had a chance for a perfect
job and great pay, but God seemed to be calling me to work for Him. Should
I quit my present job and work for God as a Bible worker? The struggle
made me miserable until I surrendered to God. I quit my job and signed up
for further training to become a full-time Bible worker.
   I returned to India to tell my parents of my decision. I knew that they
would be disappointed, and maybe even angry to learn that I was giving up
a career to work for God. But the confrontation was far more difficult than
I imagined. My father cried and tried to convince me to stay in India and
work. Finally my step-mother convinced my father to let me do as I wished
with my life.
   I took a three-month Bible training course and returned to Australia to
begin work as a Bible worker at Gateway, the church plant focusing on uni-
versity students and young professionals in Melbourne, Australia. We meet
with young people on the campus and become friends. Then we invite them
to our Bible study and worship group. Most of the young people who come
know almost nothing about God. They socialize, eat, study God’s Word
together, and pray and praise God. In one year about 90 people have come
at least once, and 12 to 15 come regularly. A number of these are studying
the Bible with us regularly.
   Many international students come who have no concept of God. Others
have attended church before but have had no personal relationship with
Jesus. We tailor our Bible studies to what the students need.
   This church plant has received funding from Global Mission, and the mis-
sion offerings support the ongoing work. I praise God that He called me to
work for Him and that He calls each member of His church to make such
ministries possible through their offerings.

      Releasing Into Ministry




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 18:13–26; Matt. 7:17,
      18; Acts 6:1–8; John 4:36; Acts 15:36–40.

Memory Text: “And how shall they preach unless they are sent?
      As it is written: ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who preach
      the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!’ ”
      (Romans 10:15, NKJV).

Key Thought: It is not enough that people be trained for evan-
      gelism and witnessing work; they must actively work for souls.



      M
                 any church members lament the fact that although they are
                 prepared to attend witnessing and evangelism training semi-
                 nars, they are not encouraged to become involved when they
      return to their home church. Consequently, many churches that are not
      very active in witnessing and evangelistic activities are unaware of the
      well-trained people in their midst. Occasionally some people will volun-
      tarily offer their services, but many others conclude that they are either
      not needed or not wanted. The most successful way to stifle member
      involvement in any church activity is to deny them involvement in areas
      in which they are equipped to function. It is the responsibility of every
      local church to discover where, and how, each member can contribute
      to the witnessing and evangelism strategies of the church. All who are
      willing do have a place. The key is to find that place.
         This week we will explore the concept of intentionally sending out gos-
      pel workers and the ways in which maximum member involvement con-
      tributes to overall church harmony and spiritual and numerical growth.

     Shared Responsibility
        Many a dedicated church leader has cut short, or at best diminished, his
     or her effectiveness by unwillingness to share the ministry load with oth-
     ers. This is not a new problem generated by our fast-paced modern world.
     Even the great Old Testament leader Moses needed some help in order
     to see the big picture of shared leadership. We can learn much from his
     experience and the good advice received from his father-in-law, Jethro.

Carefully read Exodus 18:13–26. What significance do you see in
     the words “let them” in verse 22?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       We can only guess at how long Moses would have been able to
     keep up his unrealistic work schedule. Likewise, we can only surmise
     as to what extent Moses was aware of the availability of capable help-
     ers. What the story does reveal, however, is that there were many who
     were able and willing to help. Moses would need to let them become
     involved, delegating certain duties of leadership to them.
       The ministry that church leaders must willingly share includes witness-
     ing and evangelism. The principles of properly organized and shared
     responsibility that we glean from Moses’ experience are invaluable to
     our efforts to win souls for the kingdom.

What significance do you see in the way that Moses chose men with
     specific characteristics (vs. 21) and gave them varied degrees of
     responsibility (vs. 25)? How would these principles apply to the
     evangelistic strategies of today’s churches?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       It was probably the intense spiritual nature of the task of speaking
     for God that made Moses reticent to share his responsibilities. We, too,
     sense the awesome responsibility of talking to people about God and
     speaking for God. Our witnessing and evangelism is serious business.
     We are mindful that eternal lives are at stake. And while this would,
     and should, cause us to be careful as to how we proceed, we must be
     ever willing to involve everyone in outreach and evangelism.
       Read again Exodus 18:21, 22. Notice that the newly appointed leader-
     ship made their ministry of the leaders available at all times. Thus, we
     should always be ready to give an answer for the hope that is within us.
                                                                            73

     Risking for Success
        Members of Seventh-day Adventist churches have tremendous
     ministry potential. Many are enthusiastic about involvement in their
     church’s evangelism strategies; however, those in leadership are
     sometimes reticent to let them get involved. Behind this “only profes-
     sionals can do it” mind-set is the fear that church members may do
     or say something wrong, causing people to turn away from Christ
     and His church. Sadly, this resistance to member involvement is so
     ingrained that it prevails even when people have been adequately
     trained for a ministry. The Holy Spirit and the promises He brings
     aren’t just for the leaders; they are for all who are willing to surrender
     in faith and submission to the Lord, for all who are willing to deny
     self and work for the salvation of others.

What principle taught by Jesus in Matthew 7:17, 18 should allay the
     fears of concerned leaders? How do we distinguish between good
     and bad fruit, and how should the church leadership as a whole
     be involved in this process? Also, how do we do this without judg-
     ing others?

        If every sound tree bears good fruit, church leaders should focus
     on growing sound trees. As with everything that has to do with our
     response to the gospel call, we must first be someone for Jesus before
     we can successfully do things for Him. If we give adequate attention
     to the leading of people into a meaningful and deepening relationship
     with Jesus, the Holy Spirit will ensure that they bear the right fruit.
     Our part is to lead, teach, and train. God’s part is to bless their minis-
     try. We need to trust them and God. If we give adequate attention to
     spiritual growth and practical skills, we can trust people to produce
     the right fruit of evangelistic success. Certainly, there may be an ele-
     ment of risk depending on the ministry undertaken and the level of
     training, but we must remember that even the disciples, who had the
     greatest Teacher ever, never won every soul to whom they appealed.

      Have you ever felt that your gifts and talents were not appreci-
      ated? What might be the cause? Look inside yourself and see
      if, perhaps, the fault might lie there with you and some of your
      own attitudes (pride, and so on) instead of somewhere else?

     Matching the Laborers With the Harvest
        When people show an interest in learning more about God and His
     church, we must choose carefully the ones who will be given the task
     of witnessing to them. In a multicultural society, we would do well to
     assign someone of the same nationality and language as the inquirer and
     possibly someone of a similar age group. Furthermore, we would con-
     sider the spiritual maturity, biblical knowledge, communication skills,
     and salvation experience of the worker. In other words, we should take
     seriously the matching of the laborer to those with whom he or she will
     be working.
        When it comes to witnessing and evangelism, there is no such thing
     as one size fits all. There is uniqueness to everyone’s life journey
     and uniqueness to each one’s spiritual journey. However, while this
     uniqueness exists, there are also similarities in people’s experiences,
     and it makes good sense to match as well as possible the experiences
     of the believer and the seeker.

Read Acts 6:1–8. What tasks are listed here? What were the results
     when specific ministries and abilities were matched?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Notice the progression of these events: the disciples were made
     aware of a pressing problem. The disciples asked the believers to find
     seven men to address the problem. The believers brought their selec-
     tion to the disciples. The disciples appointed them with the laying on of
     hands, and the number of disciples multiplied greatly.
        Although Stephen and the other six appointees were to “serve tables,”
     the qualification for this task did not seem to be that they had the ability
     to organize and distribute food. The believers still looked for spirit-
     filled men because their ministry to the Greek-speaking Jewish widows
     would also be a witnessing and evangelism work. Thus, we see that the
     newly appointed men were crucial to the evangelism of the early church
     in that they freed up the frontline evangelists and also actively sup-
     ported their work (see vs. 8). Again we can affirm that any ministry that
     church members get involved in will directly or indirectly contribute to,
     and support, witnessing and evangelism endeavors of a church.
         Although natural talents, spiritual gifts, and specific training are
     important to a successful church ministry, personal attitudes are, per-
     haps, even more important. Notice that in Acts 16:1–5 and Acts 4:36,
     37, both Timothy and Barnabas had the attitude of doing whatever it
     took to support this gospel ministry. Barnabas would give of his per-
     sonal means, and Timothy would submit to circumcision so as not to
     offend some Jews. The lessons for us are, indeed, obvious.
                                                                             75

      Spiritual Growth Through Ministry
      Involvement
        Spiritual growth comes only as we connect with Jesus. It cannot
      be produced by human beings simply performing specific tasks, even
      witnessing and evangelism tasks. A church cannot “program” spiri-
      tuality into its members. However, it is a great truth that as believers
      respond to God’s call to be disciples, their personal walk with the
      Lord deepens and strengthens. Although we should not engage in
      witnessing and evangelism solely in an attempt to grow spiritually,
      when undertaken with a genuine love for God and for the lost, these
      activities bring numerous spiritual blessings to all involved.

Read John 7:17. What does this verse tell us about the doing of God’s
      will and increased spiritual growth?

         A valid question is, “How can a person seeking truth be sure when the
      genuine has been found?” In verse 17 Jesus presents a truth that will help
      all who want to follow Him. Those who are willing to do God’s will can
      know if a doctrine is, or is not, of God. How can this be? Clearly there
      is spiritual growth through connectedness. Jesus is saying that those who
      are living up to received Bible truth will receive greater light.
         There is a strong connection between hearing and doing (see
      Rev. 1:3). Those who do God’s will, however little of His will they
      know, will be blessed with a deepening Christian relationship which,
      coupled with prayerful Bible study, will lead to greater revelations of
      truth and exciting spiritual growth.

Read John 4:36. What are the spiritual wages received as a result of
      being involved in the harvest of souls? What spiritual fellowship
      is suggested by the sower and reaper rejoicing together?

        Many commentators suggest that the disciples were reaping where
      John the Baptist and Jesus had sown. The Samaritan woman herself
      had clearly planted some gospel seed among the people of her town.
      How they must have rejoiced together as the ripened spiritual harvest
      was gathered into the kingdom. Success through working together
      in witnessing and evangelism creates a bond between God and us
      and between us as fellow believers. As we respond to God’s call to
      be involved in soul winning, this bond, this spiritual closeness and
      growth, blossoms as a natural result of being on God’s team.

       How has your own faith been strengthened through your own
       personal witness, both from success and failures? How does
       witnessing impact your relationship with the Lord?

     Bringing Harmony
     Through Involvement
        There is a phenomenon that is sometimes difficult to explain but can
     best be described as “circular influence.” Concerning harmony and
     involvement, circular influence goes like this: by getting people involved
     you promote harmony, which in turn encourages people to become
     involved, which in turn promotes harmony. You can see the circular-
     influence principle at work. It is clearly demonstrated in the old saying
     that those who are pulling on the oars don’t have time to rock the boat.
        There were some key decisions made in the development of the
     early church’s organization that could have caused major conflict, but
     the personal preferences of the believers were submitted to what was
     best for the task that their Lord had given them.

Consider the appointment process recorded in Acts 1:15–26. Al-
     though we don’t cast lots today, what key points were they looking
     for here, and what principles can we take from this example for
     the work of ministry today?

        Of course, whenever human beings are working together, there is
     the potential for conflict. We would be right in assuming that the evil
     one is working to undermine the effectiveness of believers. It is only
     fair, then, that we briefly review an incident in the evangelistic min-
     istry of the early church where the conflict was real.

Examine Acts 15:36–40. What caused the difference of opinion
     between Paul and Barnabas? What was the result of their dis-
     agreement, and what can we learn from it?

       On a previous missionary trip, John Mark had left Paul and his
     other companions and returned to Jerusalem. It seems that this inci-
     dent (see Acts 13:13) made Paul reluctant to take John Mark along on
     this current trip. But Barnabas saw it would benefit both John Mark
     and the venture to take John Mark along. Consequently, while Paul
     chose Silas to accompany him, Barnabas traveled with John Mark.
       There was no argument regarding what missionary work should be
     done, and rather than let personal differences overshadow the evan-
     gelistic task, they sent out two witnessing groups. Although Paul and
     John did work profitably together again (see 2 Tim. 4:11), their differ-
     ences at this time were not allowed to interfere with their mission.

      Think of someone with whom you might be struggling now in
      church. How much humility, death to self, and willingness to
      forgive and to turn the other cheek will you need in order to
      bring reconciliation?
                                                                           77

    Further Study: Setting Realistic Ministry Time Frames

           As mentioned in last Friday’s Further Study section, 12 months is a
         good length of time to plan ahead. Depending on what witnessing and
         evangelism program you are planning, specific time frames will vary
         with different goal strategies and priorities. However, there are some
         general points to consider.
           1. Document what you aim to achieve throughout these next 12
         months. Specify desires in terms of people and discipleship, not just
         the completion of programs.
1
            2. Write out a procedural time line. This can be as detailed as you
         like, but make sure that it is not too brief. It should include major train-
         ing times, program start and finish dates, and set evaluation times.

            3. As you document major stages of the program, make sure that you
2        also specify which individuals or teams are responsible at those times.

            4. Document how your program strategies integrate with the overall
         witnessing and evangelism program of the church. Specify where and
         how other church strategies will support yours and where yours will
         strengthen those of the church. This will help you to remember that
         you are a part of a larger team and of the need to work together.

3
           5. Seriously consider whether your program will be ongoing or
         whether it will be repeated the next church year. This will help you
         determine what ongoing recruitment training will need to be under-
         taken. If your program is a developing ministry, each evaluation ses-
         sion will also need to have a forward-looking time.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 The following statements reveal that God has expectations of
          every believer and that He has appointed a work for each one.
          What do you think God expects of His church regarding the
          equipment of and the organization of their involvement in witness-
          ing and soul winning? What can a church do to help members to
          understand the expectations of God? As you dwell on the quotes
          below, ask yourself how they apply to you personally.
            “God expects personal service from everyone to whom He has
          entrusted a knowledge of the truth for this time. Not all can go as
          missionaries to foreign lands, but all can be home missionaries in
          their families and neighborhoods.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies
          for the Church, vol. 9, p. 30.
            “To everyone who becomes a partaker of His grace, the Lord
          appoints a work for others. Individually we are to stand in our
          lot, saying, ‘Here am I; send me.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Prophets
          and Kings, p. 222.

Our Great Healer
   Three-year-old Jenny never missed the morning and evening worships
in our village. So when she didn’t attend one morning, I missed her.
“Where is Jenny?” I asked.
   “She’s sick, teacher!” one boy answered.
   After worship I went to check on Jenny and found her lying in her fam-
ily’s one-room house, writhing with pain. I prayed for her and mixed some
simple herbal medicine for her. Soon Jenny fell asleep.
   When I returned later to check on Jenny, I found several traditional
healers in the family’s home. They were performing sacrifices and rituals
to heal Jenny. I knew that if I tried to stop these false healers I could be
killed. I found Jenny’s mother sitting outside and told her, “We must pray
to God in heaven to heal Jenny. He is the true Healer, the greatest healer
of all.” She stared at me as if to say, You are new here. You don’t know
that we do these rituals every time someone is sick in the village.
   We prayed for Jenny at school that day. But after school, Jenny’s
brother told me, “My father said you must not come to our house today
because you will disturb the healers.” My heart sank. I wanted to help, but
I couldn’t. Lord, I prayed, please help Jenny. If it is Your will, heal her.
Help her parents know that You are the true God.
   But Jenny’s condition worsened, and the family took her to the forest to
be closer to the spirits they worship. The healers continued their sacrifices,
and we continued praying for Jenny.
   Two days later as we prepared to welcome the Sabbath, Jenny and her
mother appeared at our door smiling broadly. “We did everything our
rituals decreed, but Jenny didn’t get better,” she said. “Finally we prayed
to your God. We promised Him that if He would heal Jenny, we would
give our lives to Him. As soon as we prayed, Jenny’s pain left. The next
morning we awoke to hear Jenny singing the songs that you taught her. I
heard her thanking God for healing her. Then she came to me and asked,
‘Mama, can we go home now? I want to attend worship.’ ”
   Today Jenny’s entire family attends worship in the village church. They
plan to be baptized as soon as possible.

      A Love Response
        							




      Sabbath Afternoon				
        		
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 John 4:18, 19; Rom. 3:19,
      20; John 15:13; Rom. 5:6–8; John 6:28, 29.

Memory Text: “ ‘If you love Me, keep My commandments’ ” (John
      14:15).

Key Thought: We should work to win souls to Christ; the question
      we need to ask ourselves is, What motivates us to do just that?



      A
                lthough our memory text is most often considered to refer to
                the Ten Commandments, there are other commandments, as
                well, not the least being “ ‘Go therefore and make disciples of
      all the nations’ ” (Matt. 28:19, 20, NKJV).
         Our motivation for witnessing and evangelism should be primarily
      God’s grace to us and not a sense of guilt, mere obligation, or debt.
      One doesn’t need to be a behavioral psychologist to know that pretty
      much everything we do as humans is in response to something. This
      is true also of our involvement in witnessing and evangelism. We can
      discover our motivation simply by asking why we do what we do.
      Why do we become involved in the church’s witnessing and evange-
      listic strategies? Or indeed, why don’t we?
         This week we will explore the right motivation for getting involved
      in the Lord’s work and also expose the dangers of working with
      the wrong motivations, such as obligation, guilt, or shame. We will
      explore why evangelism and witnessing should be our love response
      to God’s gift of salvation to us.

     Motivated by Love
        Have you ever wondered why often it seems difficult to motivate
     people to make long-term commitments in church projects? Perhaps
     the answer can be found as we think of some other situations where a
     very high degree of motivation and commitment are evident. What is
     it that motivates a parent to donate a kidney to save the life of his or
     her child? Why do moms and dads spend a small fortune to provide
     the best possible education for their children? Are these things done
     because the parents would feel guilty if they didn’t? Do they think that
     they owe their children these things? Of course not.
        While parents do have a sense of responsibility for the welfare of their
     children, love is surely the major motivating force. They do what they do
     because they love. We cannot spell this out enough times: we do things
     for God because we love Him and because we know He loves us.

Read 1 John 4:18, 19. What do these verses mean? Write out their
     meaning in your own words.


        Our love for God must be rooted in His love for us. God existed
     before we did, and He has loved us supremely from the creation of
     humankind. Love can come only as a result of, and in response to, love.
     Obedience to the great gospel commission for any other reason than the
     fact that we love is all but fruitless. This is why spiritual preparation is
     vital as we seek to become involved in witnessing and evangelism.
        Our love for God and our willingness to work with Him in the sav-
     ing of souls is dependent upon our knowing Him. It is not usual that
     we love people whom we don’t know. Therefore, it is vital that to
     obey God out of love, we must know Him personally.

What do the following texts reveal about love for God and the moti-
     vation to obey Him and work for Him? Josh. 22:5, Luke 7:41–43,
     John 14:23, 2 Cor. 5:12–18.


       Love and obedience are inseparable as long as they occur in
     that order. True love for God will always result in obedience to
     His revealed will, but obedience will not necessarily lead to love
     (although it can). If we want people to work for Jesus, we must help
     them to create a loving connection with Him.

      How much does your love for God motivate what you do? Does
      it motivate you at all? What does your answer say about your
      relationship with Him and what needs to change?

     Not by Guilt
        Over the centuries guilt has been used to motivate people to action.
     Evangelism leaders have often reminded us that God has given us respon-
     sibility and that we must use our God-given talents and gifts. We are told
     that God or the church is depending on us. If God has done so much to
     save us, how can we remain evangelistically inactive? All these attempts
     to call us to action, delivered, no doubt, with the best intentions, subtly
     appeal to our sense of guilt and indebtedness to God. Motivation always
     seems to become counterproductive when we remove the emphasis from
     what God has done and place it onto what we must do.

Read Romans 3:19, 20. What did the apostle Paul mean when he said
     the whole world is guilty before God? What’s his point?

       The way that Paul uses the word guilty in this passage communicates
     the sense of accountability. He has already stated in Romans 3:10 that
     “ ‘there is none righteous, no, not one’ ” (NKJV), and in verse 19 he
     confirms that the law makes “all the world” guilty before God.
       The law’s function has often been likened to a mirror that reveals
     our sinful condition but which cannot provide the cleansing soap and
     water. Looking into God’s law, we become aware of our sinfulness and
     are driven to the Savior to receive His free pardon and cleansing.
       After we come to Christ, we are no longer motivated by guilt,
     because the guilt has been washed away, covered by the righteousness
     of Jesus. We stand in Him, perfect and guiltless and forgiven. Yes, we
     are sinners, but we have been forgiven, our guilt has been atoned for;
     now—based on the salvation that is ours through Christ—we are moti-
     vated to witness to others about that which Christ has done for us.

Read James 2:10. What is the main point that James is trying to
     make? How would you explain this verse to a new believer?

       The fact that an offense on one point makes one guilty of defying
     the God who commanded the whole law underscores the futility of
     the attempt to gain favor in God’s sight through law keeping. Law
     breaking, even to a small degree, reveals an underlying desire to do
     our own will rather than God’s.

      While acknowledging your wrongs you have to surrender them
      to Jesus, claiming His righteousness, His forgiveness, His grace,
      regardless of how unworthy you are. And lest you be mistaken,
      you are unworthy, more than you could imagine. If not, the sal-
      vation offered to you wouldn’t be from grace but from a debt
      God owes you (see Rom. 4:1–4), and do you really think that
      God owes you anything?

      Motivated to Serve
        What would you think of someone who constantly and loudly
      declared that he or she was motivated and yet attempted nothing?
      What about someone who claimed to be dedicated yet never revealed
      to what, or to whom, he or she was dedicated? As we have seen,
      love is a most powerful motivator; but to only declare our love, even
      our love for God, means nothing unless we act on that love. In other
      words, we expect love to be revealed through actions. In this sense
      love is an active word as it reveals itself through loving actions.

Read John 15:13 and Romans 5:6–8. What do these verses reveal to us
      about Jesus’ love as manifested in His actions? How are we to take
      the principles revealed here and manifest them in our own lives?


        What a wonderful Savior is He who deliberately and willingly gave
      His life because of His great love for us. Here is the ultimate example
      of where the one who loves is compelled to act for those who are
      loved. What if Jesus had pledged His love for us and remained in
      heaven? What if He had declared His love but made no promises to
      us or provisions for us?

Read John 14:21. What does this verse tell us about love in action, on
      the part of both Jesus and us?
        						
      ________________________________________________________

         We are not just talking about love here; we are talking about a lov-
      ing relationship. In any loving relationship our motivation is to please
      the one who is the object of our love. Jesus’ decisive saving act on
      our behalf was motivated only by His love for a race that had broken
      its connectedness to God. Anything that we do for God that does not
      come from a similar motive suggests that we do not really understand
      what it is to have a love relationship with God. God doesn’t want us
      to be involved in witnessing and evangelism because we think we
      owe Him. Rather, He desires our connectedness to Him be such that
      it compels us to do the things that please Him and to be in tune with
      things that matter to Him. God wants us to love Him so much that we
      will reach out to the people whom He loves.

       How can we be sure that we do things for God with the right
       motivation? Can we be a blessing to others even if we are wrongly
       motivated in our action? If so, in what way? Are right actions for
       the wrong reason good actions anyway? Whatever your answer,
       bring it to class on Sabbath and discuss.

     The Legalism Trap
       There’s an English expression that says, “There is no such thing as
     a free lunch”—the idea that if you receive something free, it really
     isn’t free because somewhere, somehow, sometime, you will have
     to pay or repay. The theory that nothing is ever really free has subtly
     infiltrated Christian thinking to the extent that many try to be deserv-
     ing of God’s salvation through obedience to His will.
       Legalism in the Christian vocabulary describes the attitude of those
     who believe that their obedience to God will somehow cause Him to
     justify them in His sight. Of course, although God’s grace does not
     negate His expectation of obedience, salvation is based solely on this
     grace and nothing else, certainly nothing else that we could do.

What do the following texts reveal about the misunderstanding of
     salvation so prevalent in the minds of many? In what ways can
     we, ourselves, get caught up in that same kind of thinking? Why
     is it so easy, in fact, to do so?

     Rom. 10:1–4 _____________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     Rom. 11:5, 6 _____________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     Gal. 2:16 ________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       A legalistic religion causes the individual to focus upon personal
     performance (and often on the performance of others) rather than on the
     gospel commission. Legalistic attitudes can lead to pride and arrogance
     on the part of those who are so blind that they actually deem themselves
     holy enough to be saved. Or, just as bad, legalistic attitudes can lead
     to discouragement and despair for those who realize just how far they
     are from the divine standard. Either way, it’s a trap that needs to be
     avoided, especially by a church such as ours where obedience to law is
     so central to our understanding of what the gospel is all about.

      Read John 6:28, 29. How does Jesus reveal the truth of salva-
      tion by faith in these verses? What, though, does it mean to
      believe in “him whom he hath sent”? How should that belief be
      manifested in our lives? How well do you manifest that belief,
      especially when no one is looking?

      Free to Be a Slave
        The Bible makes it clear that we were once slaves to sin, but through
      Christ we have been released (Rom. 6:6), set free (Gal. 5:1), delivered
      (1 Thess. 1:10), adopted (Rom. 8:15), and born again (1 Pet. 1:23).
        The effective worker for God is the one who has given the past to
      Him and has accepted His power to work in the present and the future.
      In other words, those who have been delivered by Christ are able to
      be His slaves. If we don’t understand this truth, it may seem strange
      that deliverance leads to slavery, but it is as true as the sayings, “To
      be spiritually filled we must continually empty ourselves” and “The
      way to victory is constant surrender.”

Read Philippians 1:1, James 1:1, and 2 Peter 1:1. What did Paul,
      Timothy, James, and Simon Peter mean when they announced
      themselves the bondservants of God and Jesus Christ? How are
      we to understand these ideas for ourselves?

      ________________________________________________________

         Usually bondservants, or slaves, would be owned by and compelled
      to work under a master. To work for the Master in the Christian sense
      is a totally voluntary choice. God loves us too much to force our will.
      When Timothy, James, and Simon Peter used these words, they were
      indicating their entire identification with Christ and His cause. They
      were declaring their unreserved service to Him as their Lord. They
      were renouncing their self-importance so that others would focus
      only upon Jesus. In this picture of slavery we see dedicated followers
      pledging their loyalty and devotion through selfless service.

Read John 8:34–36. What do these verses tell us about slavery to sin
      and the way to freedom?

      ________________________________________________________

         Jesus’ hearers knew full well that slaves had no security. They could
      be sold at the whim of the master, while the son of the master was
      always secure in the household. Here Jesus uses the contemporary slave
      situation to impart a vital spiritual truth. If the Son of God makes you
      spiritually free from slavery to sin, you will be free indeed. It would be
      unusual for literal freed slaves to voluntarily place themselves back in
      bondage, but, spiritually, this is what happens when we are freed from
      the slavery to sin and become slaves of Christ (Rom. 6:17, 18). If we
      are free from the things that make us focus upon ourselves, we are free
      to consider others and what we have that can benefit them. Herein lies
      the key to a life of service.
                                                                            85

    Further Study: Keeping on Track.

           Just as any good motor vehicle will ultimately break down as a
         result of a lack of regular maintenance, so many good and worthwhile
         church ministries have fallen by the wayside because of a lack of
         regular intentional maintenance.
           To keep your ministry healthy and on track, consider the following
1
         maintenance checklist:

           1. Maintain your personal connection. Remind yourself often that
         you are in a partnership ministry with the Lord.

           2. Maintain your personal vision. Do you still sense the impor-
2        tance of your ministry? Are your goals as clear and as strong as they
         were when you became involved in this ministry?

            3. Maintain your communication. Regular reporting is important
         to continued support. People are busy, and they need to be reminded of
         how this ministry is going and also of how they can become involved.

           4. Maintain your enthusiasm. It is a true saying that “Nothing
3
         breeds enthusiasm like enthusiasm.” Show your continued excitement
         about your ministry, and others will become excited too.

           5. Maintain your focus. Don’t get sidetracked with other duties
         or programs that will prevent you from spending the time and energy
         that your current ministry needs to survive and grow.

          2 What insights does the following quotation give into the
          relationship between love for God and service for Him? “The
          watchful Christian is a working Christian, seeking zealously to
          do all in his power for the advancement of the gospel. As love
          for his Redeemer increases, so also does love for his fellow men.”
          —Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 261.

          l
          3 “Those who have never experienced the tender, winning love
          of Christ cannot lead others to the fountain of life. His love in the
          heart is a constraining power, which leads men to reveal Him in the
          conversation, in the tender, pitiful spirit, in the uplifting of the lives
          of those with whom they associate. Christian workers who succeed
          in their efforts must know Christ; and in order to know Him, they
          must know His love.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
          550, 551. In class, share your own personal experiences of God’s
          love and how you have come to know it for yourself.

But Now I See
   Dilip Tapu had lost his sight, and his future looked grim. His parents had
taken him to many doctors in northeastern India, but no one could help him
to regain his sight. His parents found a special school for the blind where
Dilip could learn Braille. But soon after he enrolled, the school closed,
crushing the family’s hope of an education for their son.
   With nothing else to do, Dilip hung around with the street children and
soon became addicted to chewing tobacco. Often he stole his mother’s rice
and sold it to buy tobacco. He discovered he could earn a few rupees by
singing popular songs in the streets and on the trains, but when his money
was stolen one day, he returned home defeated. He was 10 years old.
   A man offered to help the boy but only took him home and forced him to
work for a little food. Dilip escaped and returned home. His mother told him
that she had found a school where he could study. “Your life will be better,”
she assured him. Dilip didn’t want to leave home again, but he obeyed.
   He arrived at his new school and heard children singing. He didn’t recog-
nize the songs they sang, but he liked the music. However, Dilip soon real-
ized that his new school was operated by Christians, and he was prejudiced
against Christians. He resisted his teachers’ attempts to introduce him to the
Savior and even tried to be expelled from the school by writing something
bad about a teacher. But instead of becoming angry, the teacher forgave him
and spoke kindly to him.
   Slowly Dilip realized that these Christians were different from others he
had known. He apologized to the teacher he had wronged, and she in turn
led him to accept Jesus into his heart. But when Dilip’s friends and family
learned that he had become a Christian, they scolded and mocked him. In
spite of his new faith, Dilip struggled with cravings for tobacco. He prayed
fervently for deliverance, but it took many months before the craving for
tobacco left him.
   When he completed high school, Dilip wanted to continue his studies.
His parents had no money, so he worked as a literature evangelist for three
years to save enough to start college. Dilip continues his studies at Spicer
Memorial College, where he is preparing to become a pastor.
   “I thank God for the Adventist school where I met my Savior,” he said.
“Through this school my life was changed. Now I want to share God’s love
with others.”
   Seventh-day Adventist schools throughout India and around the world are
making a world of difference to young people. Thank you for supporting
Christian education through your mission offerings.

        Lesson           11 *June 9–15
      Let the Church Know




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 4:1–31, 21:19–25,
      1 Cor. 9:19–23, Num. 13:17–33, Acts 11:1–18.

Memory Text: “Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him
      all things, both what they had done and what they had taught”
      (Mark 6:30, NKJV).

Key Thought: As a report of the early church’s missionary endeav-
      ors, the book of Acts is filled with lessons for us today.



      T
             he incredible growth of the early church has caused many to
             study the book of Acts. Consequently, many areas of church
             life have been examined in the light of the book—areas such as
      church growth, foreign missions, church administration, and evange-
      lism. Though much has been gleaned from Acts on these topics, there
      are other areas, such as reporting, that have not received the attention
      they deserve.
         Reporting in the book of Acts builds upon the reporting in the
      Gospels and shows that this important activity of church life has a
      significant impact upon the success of witnessing and evangelism.
      Quite simply, we need to know what is going on, what works, and
      what doesn’t.
         This week we will examine how the early evangelists reported to
      their leaders and to the church as a whole. The aim is to understand
      the importance of reporting and to see where it can positively enhance
      the witnessing and evangelism strategies of a local church.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, June 16.

     A Biblical Principle
        As soon as someone mentions reports, you may imagine reams
     of paper filled with facts and statistics that will probably do little
     more than gather dust. However, reporting is not a modern invention
     designed to frustrate those involved in witnessing and evangelism. It
     is a biblical principle. As our memory text for this week reveals, when
     the disciples returned from a missionary tour, they reported to Jesus
     all that they had done and taught. This seems to be a central part of
     the work of the gospel.
        While we cannot point to one specific Bible text that says, “You
     must report because,” there is ample evidence that reporting was
     important in both the Old and New Testaments. Reporting is an activ-
     ity in a chain of events. That is, someone prepares a report, someone
     receives the report, the report is evaluated, and then decisions are
     made and actions are planned in response to what was reported.

Examine Acts 4:1–31. What did Peter and John report back to
     their companions, and what did this report prompt the church to
     do? What lessons are there for us today?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Consider that without newspapers, radios, or satellite television, word
     of mouth was the primary way of spreading the good news about Jesus.
     If these early believers had given in to the threats made against them,
     their influence for God would have been severely curtailed. So, they
     gathered together, listened to the reports, and then decided upon a strat-
     egy that would enable them to be true to their evangelistic calling.
        Central to it all, of course, was their praying and their reading of
     Scripture. If we take nothing else from this story, we can see how
     important prayer and reliance on the Word of God was to them. It
     shouldn’t be any different for us today.
        Although we don’t have details of what they might have planned,
     verse 29 shows that in spite of the threats made against them, they
     were going to continue to speak about Jesus.

      John and Peter quoted Scripture before both the leaders in
      Israel and the other Jewish believers, showing how crucial it
      was to their faith and their witness. How central and crucial is
      Scripture in your own life? (Hint: you can discover the answer
      by asking yourself how much time you spend with it.)
                                                                           89

     “What God Had Done”
        We are continually reminded that in most areas of life, effective com-
     munication is the key to understanding and harmony. As we consider the
     church family we see that the reporting of activities and their results is
     a vital part of internal communication. In many churches there is much
     activity, but only those involved in each ministry know what is happen-
     ing there. Because of this, there is a corresponding feeling among those
     who lead ministries that there is not much interest in what they are doing.
     These feelings are not surprising if leaders never share their goals and
     strategies with the church and never report their activities and results.

Read Acts 21:19–25. How was the church affected when they heard
     the missionary reports of the apostle Paul? At the same time, even
     amid the good reports, there were indications of division among
     the believers. What were those problems, how did Paul respond,
     and what lessons are there for us today? See also 1 Cor. 9:19–23.

       Returning to Jerusalem from a missionary journey, Paul reported to
     James and all the elders of how God had blessed his ministry among
     the Gentiles. As Paul related one by one the many gospel advances, the
     church leaders responded with spontaneous and genuine praise to God.
       At the same time, however, evidence of division and confusion
     existed, even amid the good news of Paul’s witnessing.
         “Many of the Jews who had accepted the gospel still cherished a
     regard for the ceremonial law and were only too willing to make unwise
     concessions, hoping thus to gain the confidence of their countrymen, to
     remove their prejudice, and to win them to faith in Christ as the world’s
     Redeemer. Paul realized that so long as many of the leading members
     of the church at Jerusalem should continue to cherish prejudice against
     him, they would work constantly to counteract his influence. He felt
     that if by any reasonable concession he could win them to the truth
     he would remove a great obstacle to the success of the gospel in other
     places. But he was not authorized of God to concede as much as they
     asked.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 405.

      Today we also struggle with division among us as to how to
      best reach souls. What are some of the struggles particular to
      the church in your part of the world, and how can you help to
      bring about resolution?

      The Importance of Reporting
          The importance of reporting evangelism and witnessing activi-
      ties and their results has not always been seen and consequently not
      always undertaken. In all areas of our modern busy lives, importance
      is placed upon things in proportion to their perceived value. Things
      that are seen as a waste of time and effort generally don’t receive a
      lot of our time and attention. Therefore, the importance of reporting
      needs to be demonstrated. That is, the church members need to see
      what any evaluation of reports is achieving.
         A difference exists between the simple reporting of cold hard facts
      and the sharing of how the activities that these facts represent are a
      successful part of the church’s endeavors to reach people for Christ. It
      is the responsibility of those reporting to make sure that they convey
      the excitement and joy of success that come from being involved in
      the reported ministry.

If we removed all reports of evangelistic activity from the book of Acts,
      what exciting and encouraging information would we miss that is
      provided in the following verses? Acts 5:14; 8:4, 12; 11:21; 14:21.
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

         The amazing church growth that is reported in the book of Acts did
      not simply happen. Empowered by the Holy Spirit, and remember-
      ing Jesus’ promise of success, the believers engaged in activities that
      brought about these results. They were focused on what they wanted
      to achieve and on how best to achieve it. It is reported that through
      the preaching of the gospel, multitudes of men and women turned
      to the Lord and were baptized as part of their discipleship process.
      This again underscores the importance of reporting the results and
      the activities in as much detail as possible. In fact, the Bible records
      the results of the witnessing and evangelism activities more than the
      details of the activities themselves.
         Those very early missionaries went everywhere they possibly could,
      preaching about Jesus and His kingdom. Because of the reported and
      recorded results, we can assume that they also issued powerful invita-
      tions to their hearers. This continual preaching and appealing caused
      the dramatic results in church growth recorded in the book of Acts.

       It is, of course, encouraging when we hear stories of successful
       evangelistic efforts. How do we respond, however, when things
       don’t go so well, when our plans seem to fail, when our efforts
       appear to do no good at all? What should our response be?
       Discuss your answer in class on Sabbath.
                                                                          91

     Reporting and Motivation
       When we speak of motivation, we are referring to the deep-seated
     reasons for why we believe or do things. This is also true of reporting.
     When we report, we do so for a reason or for reasons. Our reasons
     could simply be an attempt to convince a committee to continue
     funding. Or we could report in a way that will convince people to
     discontinue a program or change leadership personnel. If selected
     information is reported or emphasized, then perhaps decisions made
     on the evaluation of such reporting may not be the best. Hence, our
     reporting needs to be honest and fair.

Read Numbers 13:17–33. All twelve spies saw the same things; what
     caused only two of the twelve to respond as they did? What lesson
     should we take from this incident for ourselves, today?

     ________________________________________________________

       God had promised that the children of Israel could certainly take
     the land. Joshua and Caleb gave a good report of the land and sug-
     gested that they go at once to possess it (vs. 30). Others who were with
     them when they spied out the land gave a bad report, emphasizing the
     obstacles to possessing it and suggesting that they return to Egypt.
       As we formulate reports, we must do so with thought to the revealed
     will of God and in the light of His blessings. We will not just report
     on how well we are doing but how well we are doing the will of God
     (see Matt. 7:21). There is always the potential to get caught up in
     the latest models of evangelistic ministry and measure our successes
     by how well we are implementing the principles in comparison with
     other churches. As we report on our apparent successes, we may be
     more interested in appearing successful than in seeking God’s will for
     our church and pursuing that by His grace.
       This is a challenge to our churches today as we seem to be bombarded
     by never-ending “better” ways of outreach. In the report of the spies,
     Joshua and Caleb surely also saw the obstacles to taking the land, but
     they also knew God’s will. Therefore, an important part of their report
     assured the people that possessing the land was surely possible. On
     the other hand, those spies whose thinking did not include reflections
     on God’s will brought back a completely negative report calculated to
     convince the people that returning to Egypt was a better option.

      How do we strike a harmony between living by faith, claiming
      God’s promises, and acting on them—as opposed to living by
      presumption and doing things that might not be the wisest but
      utilizing dubious claims of God’s “leading” in order to justify
      them? How can we do the first and avoid the latter?

     Giving Him the Glory
        Some people are hesitant to turn in successful reports because they
     wonder if it is a form of boasting in human achievement. In reality,
     however, God is glorified by faithful reporting, and His church is
     strengthened in the faith and resolve to continue working for Him.
     While it is true that occasionally someone may report with less than
     honorable motivation, this should not stop humble believers from
     sharing the mighty things that God has wrought through them as He
     has empowered them to be witnesses and evangelists for Him. If done
     with humility, enthusiasm, and a love for souls, reporting can greatly
     encourage other church members also to get involved in the work of
     evangelism and soul-winning.

Read Acts 11:1–18. How did the leaders and members of the
     Jerusalem church respond to Peter’s report of the work among
     the Gentiles? How could the principles revealed there prove
     important for us today?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        There had been criticism of Peter and the others who had ventured
     to witness and evangelize outside of Jewish circles; then, however, as
     a result of Peter’s report to the Jerusalem church, the criticism ceased
     and the other Jewish believers glorified God.
        From our perspective today, it’s not easy to understand the issues
     at stake then. Of course, the gospel is to go to everyone, Jew and
     Gentile—even if to “the Jew first” (Rom. 1:16). Everyone knows
     that. Yet, in the context of the book of Acts, the idea of the covenant
     promises extending to the Gentiles would have required a major shift
     in Jewish thinking. However, because of the reports of God’s activ-
     ity and blessing, the church members gained a new understanding of
     God’s desire to save all people everywhere, even though it had always
     been God’s plan from the start to save everyone who would be saved
     (Eph. 1:1–4, Isa. 53:6, Heb. 2:9).
        For the average reader, it will probably take less than two minutes
     to read Peter’s report in Acts 11:1–18. We can safely assume that his
     report, and the ensuing questions and further report responses, would
     have taken considerably longer. Furthermore, although Peter refers
     to himself throughout the report, and although some members would
     surely have said, “Well done, Peter,” all the glory was given to God,
     and the church leaders were encouraged as they understood better that
     the gospel commission to the entire world could become a reality.

                                                                         93

    Further Study: Reporting Your Ministry

            As we have seen this week, others need to know what you are
         doing. Specific reports such as attendance figures and financial state-
         ments are certainly necessary. It is also important that you present
         reports at church evangelism councils and church boards. While a
         verbal report may touch briefly on the main points, you should hand
         in a written report that contains as much detail as possible.
1
            Not only will this information keep people interested in your min-
         istry and make it easier to encourage involvement, it will directly
         enhance evaluation and future planning and direction.
            Make sure that your reports are given with reference to the overall
         evangelism plans of the church. Explain how your ministry is part of
         a strategy that is contributing to the achievement of church goals.
2
            Challenge yourself regarding your motivation for reporting. To
         what extent are you focused on both the will of God for your church
         and the saving of souls?
            				
    Discussion Questions:
          l1 Go back to the last question on Tuesday. How do we report
          “bad news”? It’s only natural that we talk about the successes
3         we experience. People do that even in the mundane things of life.
          But what about in the work of evangelism? What do we do if a
          church program isn’t working? How should it be discussed and
          reviewed in ways that will bring about needed changes? Also,
          discuss this question: If we attribute success in evangelism to the
          Lord, whom do we blame if things aren’t going so well?

          l
          2 Think about the change in attitude that the Jewish believers
          needed in regard to the work among the Gentiles. Look around
          at your own church, culture, and society. However much we
          might dogmatically assert our belief that the gospel is for all the
          world, in what ways might our own cultural and social preju-
          dices need the same kind of shift as the one experienced by these
          early Jewish believers?

          l3 Although this week’s context was about reporting evangelis-
          tic activities, think about the whole concept of giving any kind
          of report in any kind of situation. How can we make sure that
          we are always honest and truthful and not dishonestly slanting
          information in ways that will give us what we want, regardless of
          how skewed our words are? Why is that so easy to do, and why
          is it so easy to fool ourselves as we do it?

Loved Into the Church
   Stephanie lives in Denmark, a largely secular country. When Stephanie
experienced bullying in her middle school, she transferred to a Seventh-day
Adventist school. Although at first she thought it was strange to have so
many religion classes in school, Stephanie appreciated the accepting atti-
tude of the teachers and students. She quickly made friends in the school,
and several of them invited her to attend church. “I was curious about
what Adventists believe,” Stephanie said, “so I went.” She noticed that
her friends’ families seemed happy. Her own family wasn’t. “I decided the
reason for their happy families must be the church, so I gave it a chance and
went.” Before long Stephanie gave her life to Christ.
   “At first my parents didn’t mind that I went to church,” she said. “My dad
would even take me. But when I asked to be baptized, my parents weren’t
happy at all. But I was determined.”
   She completed middle school and enrolled in the Seventh-day Adventist
boarding academy so she could stay with her friends. Stephanie found the
stability she needed in a family of teachers and students who really cared
for one another.
   “I continued asking my mother to let me be baptized,” Stephanie said.
“But Mom resisted. Finally she let me become an Adventist when I was 17.
It’s the best decision I’ve made.”
   Stephanie graduated from the Seventh-day Adventist academy and now
shares her faith through a café church in a city near the university where
she studies.
   “The café church attracts about 30 young people every Sabbath after-
noon,” Stephanie said. “We have midweek prayer services, small group
meetings to study the Bible and share what’s important to us.
   “In Denmark most churches struggle to maintain a small membership, but
we’re growing, and our growth is among young people! We have a semi-secular
social time when we invite anyone in the community who wishes to come.”
   Stephanie leads the music team for several of the services and is a
member of the outreach team that seeks to raise awareness of Seventh-day
Adventists in this town through fun and attractive methods. “During festi-
vals we make waffles and have a bouncing castle,” she said.
   Denmark is a difficult place to attract people to church. Stephanie is a
product of Seventh-day Adventist education, and she and her friends are
now bringing Christ into the lives of people who didn’t know they needed
Him. Your mission offerings help to fund experimental worship services
designed to draw in those who are seeking to fill the spiritual hole in their
hearts. Thank you for supporting such work with your mission offerings.

      Evaluating Witnessing and
      Evangelism


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Cor. 13:5, 6; Heb. 10:24,
      25; Deut. 10:12, 13; Matt. 23:15; Rev. 14:6, 7.

Memory Text: “To one who listens, valid criticism is like a gold
      earring or other gold jewelry” (Proverbs 25:12, NLT).

Key Thought: It is a mistake to become involved in God’s great
      task of evangelism without effective evaluation.



      T
              oo often we are satisfied with minimal results through evange-
              lism when we could have had greater impact and significantly
              better success if we had evaluated previous witnessing and
      evangelistic endeavors and allowed our findings to influence future
      direction and strategy.
         Sometimes large sums of money are spent on witnessing and evan-
      gelism ministries that give minimal results. This has led to suggested
      changes in budget allocations and/or procedures. If done with a non-
      critical spirit, these questions can be a part of valid evaluation. We
      must quickly add, however, that we really don’t know the full results
      of any specific program because we can focus only upon the tangible
      results (such as the number of people being baptized) and are unaware
      as to what extent gospel seeds have been sown. Nevertheless, there is
      still the need to evaluate in a way that involves making judgments but
      abstains from being judgmental.
         This week we will consider evaluation as a biblical principle and
      explore its value as an ongoing procedure in local church life today.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, June 23.

     Why Evaluate?
        Evaluation will take place whether we realize it or not. Evaluation is
     being undertaken every Sabbath and at every public meeting. People
     evaluate the content, clarity, and even the length of the sermon, and
     those who attend public meetings expect a high level of professional-
     ism. Wherever and whenever people have expectations there will be
     evaluation. Although we cannot point to a text where formal evalua-
     tion was carried out, it is evident that evaluation was a serious part of
     early church life.

What do the following texts tell us about the importance of evalua-
     tion? And what kind of evaluation do the following verses sug-
     gest? 1 Tim. 3:1–13; 1 Cor. 11:28; 2 Cor. 13:5, 6.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        When God’s Word sets a standard, expects or prescribes specific
     actions, or issues a command, our responses are open to evaluation.
     Evaluation asks very important questions: “How are we doing in this
     particular ministry?” “How can we be more effective?”
        The fact that Paul gave certain qualifications for deacons and elders
     shows that some kind of evaluation was to take place. This would be
     evaluation of fitness for the position and also an evaluation of effec-
     tiveness in that ministry.

Read through the gospel commission of Matthew 28:19, 20. What
     evaluative questions would you ask when considering your
     church’s response to this command?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       As God’s servants we are entrusted with the immeasurably valuable
     gospel truth. Considering that this gospel message is to go to all the
     world, it should not surprise us that God also has an evaluative pro-
     cess. God is interested in the progress of the work that is entrusted to
     those who have responded to His call to be co-laborers for souls.

      Read again 2 Corinthians 13:5. What does the text say to you
      personally? How can you apply it to yourself? What evidence
      do you have that “Jesus Christ is in you”?
      ______________________________________________________
                                                                          97

     Evaluate Kindly
        While there are many benefits to evaluation, there are some pitfalls
     that we must be aware of and avoid. If we are overly active in evalua-
     tion and focus mostly on the negatives, there is the potential to create
     a critical environment that will discourage and decrease your pool of
     volunteers. To avoid evaluation being perceived as criticism, it must be
     accompanied by genuine affirmation. Indeed, most often we forget to
     affirm our workers, particularly those who have served in their chosen
     ministry for a considerable time. They are always there and always do
     the job, and we come to expect that they always will be there to do the
     job. Evaluation will give you the opportunity to affirm them.

What affirmation do you see in the following verses? In what ways
     could such affirmation be given today to individual workers or
     teams? Acts 16:1, 2; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 11:2; Phil. 4:14.

       On many occasions the apostle Paul had to set the church or indi-
     viduals straight in matters of attitude, behavior, or doctrine. This shows
     that some evaluation had taken place. Whenever he could, Paul also
     affirmed people for their support of Him personally or for their faithful-
     ness to God or for the faithful performance of a specific ministry.
       To be fair in evaluation, we must evaluate not only the outcomes
     but also the processes. Outcome evaluation asks whether a program
     achieved its planned results. Process evaluation reviews internal project
     management.

Carefully read Hebrews 10:24, 25. What does “consider one
     another” mean here? What evaluative principles are suggested?

     ________________________________________________________

       These verses are more than a suggestion. They strongly admonish
     us to take the spiritual growth and development of one another seri-
     ously. If we are to consider what God requires in our Christian lives
     and also fulfill a need to consider the point at which each of us is at
     in our experience, then it also follows that appropriate evaluation will
     be undertaken as we “consider one another.”

      Think about how encouraging it is when someone affirms you
      for either simply who you are as a person and/or your minis-
      try. It’s amazing how just a few simple words can do so much!
      What’s your general attitude toward others? Do you tend
      toward criticism or toward affirmation? If the former, how can
      you change this destructive character trait?

      What the Lord Asks
Read the following verses and then, keeping in mind the context of this
      week (the whole quarter, actually), answer the questions that follow:
      “ ‘And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but
      to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to
      serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
      and to keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I
      command you today for your good?’ ” (Deut. 10:12, 13, NKJV).

How would you summarize the essential meaning of these two
      verses?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

Of which New Testament text does this remind you, and why does this
      show us the great importance of the admonition of these verses in
      Deuteronomy?

      ________________________________________________________

The texts say that God “requires” (or “asks”) these things of us. How
      are we to understand the meaning of this in the context of salvation
      by faith alone?

      ________________________________________________________

The texts themselves deal greatly with our heart, our soul, with love and
      with fear—things that are often hard to judge from outward appear-
      ances. What outward manifestations of these inward things do the
      verses talk about? How does the link here between the inward and
      outward fit in with our understanding of Revelation 14:6–12?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         In Matthew 23:15, Jesus gave the scribes and the Pharisees a
      stern evaluation of their “witnessing” and “evangelism” outreach
      toward the Gentiles. Thus, in a well-meaning quest to fulfill the gos-
      pel commission, we must always keep the deep truths expressed in
      Deuteronomy 10:12 and 13 before us. After all, with all our outreach
      efforts, the last thing we want to do is create more “son[s] of hell.”


                                                                        99

      Evaluating for Spiritual Growth
        “But the Lord said to Samuel, ‘Do not look at his appearance or
      at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the Lord
      does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appear-
      ance, but the Lord looks at the heart’ ” (1 Sam. 16:7, NKJV).

         Previously in this study guide we have noted that any goals set by
      individuals or churches must be able to be evaluated. While it is rela-
      tively easy to monitor and evaluate numerical growth, it is true that
      there is more to church than numbers.
         It’s obvious (or should be, anyway) that we don’t simply want to
      fill the church with people. We want to fill it with people who are
      growing in their relationship with Jesus, who love the Lord, and who
      express that love in obedience to His commandments. The last thing
      we want to do is what Jesus said the scribes and Pharisees did: to
      “ ‘travel land and sea’ ” (that is, engage in missionary efforts) to make
      a new convert and make him “ ‘twice as much a son of hell as your-
      selves’ ” (Matt. 23:15, NKJV). That strong rebuke of their “outreach
      efforts” shows us how important it is that we give attention to the
      evaluation of spiritual growth, not only of those whom we bring into
      the church but, even more so, of ourselves.

Read Matthew 26:41; 1 Thessalonians 5:17; Romans 8:6; Ephesians
      6:17, 18; 2 Timothy 2:15, 16; and Psalm 1:2. What spiritual dis-
      ciplines do these verses suggest are important? In what ways are
      all of these things crucial to our spiritual growth?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        How do we, as sinners in need of divine grace ourselves, evaluate
      something as “intangible” as the spirituality of others? The fact is that
      there is no documented spirituality scale against which we can evaluate
      personal spirituality. It is therefore more appropriate and profitable to
      consider whether each believer is on a spiritual journey, rather than to
      determine at what point he or she is on that journey. Indications of a spiri-
      tual journey are the spiritual disciplines in which we become involved.
      The things listed in the verses above certainly are indicators; yet, we
      always need to be careful regarding how we judge the experience of oth-
      ers. At the same time, especially if we are dealing with new members,
      we should—in a kind and loving way—help them to understand how
      important things such as prayer, Bible study, and obedience are to their
      spiritual growth.

     Evaluating for Church Growth
        The very reason why our church exists is the reason why we evaluate.
     We believe that the Seventh-day Adventist Church has been raised up at
     this particular time in earth’s history as part of God’s plan to take the gos-
     pel to the world. In other words, we exist to win souls for the kingdom.

Read Revelation 14:6, 7. How do we understand these verses in rela-
     tionship to our identity as Seventh-day Adventists?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Evaluating how we are doing is a method of keeping true to the task
     in the most effective way possible. Any evaluation of what the church
     does should be an assessment of how the evangelism and witnessing
     strategies are affecting church growth. How is that in which we are
     involved helping us to reach the goal?

Read Matthew 6:33, 10:7, 24:14, and Luke 4:43. What are these texts
     talking about? How should their meaning impact both us as a
     church and our work of witnessing and evangelism?
       		
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The record of Jesus’ ministry on earth contains numerous refer-
     ences to preaching as a way of winning souls to the kingdom of God.
     Jesus preached that the kingdom of God was at hand. He chastised
     the religious leaders for shutting up the kingdom of God and making
     it difficult for people to enter. He sent His disciples out to preach the
     kingdom of God. Clearly, the overriding goal of Jesus, the apostles,
     and the church was the winning of people for the kingdom.
        The reports of the numbers of people who were added to the church
     at various times, and the reports of churches being established among
     the Gentiles, are evidence that evaluation was being carried out in
     regard to how the church was reaching the goal of kingdom growth.

      Jesus made a very powerful and blunt statement that if you are
      not with Him, you are against Him (Matt. 12:30), that if you
      are not gathering with Him, you are scattering. Put aside your
      profession of faith or your name on a church book. Are you
      gathering or scattering? How do you justify your answer?
                                                                             101

    Further Study: Inviting Others to Join Your Ministry

            Have you ever heard of a one-man band? This is a band in which one
          person plays all the instruments. The drum is strapped to his back and
          operated by a foot pedal; cymbals are strapped between the knees and
          so on. In the metaphorical sense, a one-person band is one in which one
          individual plays all parts.
            One-person bands have the potential to burn out because they have no
          physical or emotional team support. One-person bands sometimes com-
          plain about the lack of church support, but the congregation has probably
1         not been asked to be involved in any way other than financially.
            Whether you are just beginning a ministry or evaluating an existing
          one, the following are some suggestions regarding ways in which to
          multiply your ministry by getting others involved:

            1. Review what is involved in every aspect of the ministry you are
2         undertaking and see how many people could take part.

            2. Decide on the areas where significant help is needed and look for
          key people to fill these major roles. Think about some team leaders.

             3. Prepare a fairly detailed written outline of all aspects of the min-
          istry. This will be useful when talking to prospective team members.
          They will be able to understand exactly what is required of them.
3
            4. Report regularly to the whole church. This will let everyone see
          that your ministry is a part of the local church’s overall witnessing and
          evangelism strategy, and they will be more likely to get involved.

            5. Have regular team meetings. Affirm team members and review
          progress. Ask the questions, “How have we done?” “How are we
          doing?” and, “Where do we go from here?”

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 When and how do you cross the line between evaluation and
           the kind of judgment that we are warned against in Scripture?

           l
           2 Dwell more on the words of Jesus in Matthew 23:15. How can
           we, as a church, prevent this from happening, especially when
           new converts are so often full of zeal? How can we make sure
           that zeal is focused in the right direction so that we don’t create
           more “ ‘son[s] of hell’ ” in our midst?

           l
           3 Consider a current ministry in your church and suggest a
           good evaluation process of the program, the process, and the
           personnel.

Learning Lessons of Love
   I had been assigned to a congregation in Cameroon that was facing a
huge crisis.
   A man had given to the church land on which the congregation built
a simple church. But the land transfer had not been completed when the
man died, and his widow wanted the land back. She took the church to
court, and the judge ruled that the church must buy the land for a huge sum
of money or vacate the land within two weeks.
   I called the members together to pray. But some were angry, and others
felt the situation was hopeless. Those who were willing prayed day and
night that God would intervene.
   On the Sabbath before we had to vacate the property, I preached on
Joshua and his “impossible” situation at Jericho. I challenged the mem-
bers to believe that God would deliver us just as He had delivered the
children of Israel at Jericho.
   After the service I invited those who were willing to go with me to
visit the woman, who was not a Seventh-day Adventist. Several members
refused, saying it would do no good. I sensed that it was these members’
lack of love that had driven this woman to take back the church land.
   Those who remained prayed with me that God would cleanse our hearts
from animosity and prepare the way. Then we walked to the woman’s
home. We arrived at her home singing, and the woman sat listening qui-
etly. I told her that we had come to apologize to her and to ask her forgive-
ness for treating her unkindly. I recounted her husband’s reason for giving
the land to the church, and then I prayed that God would bless her.
   Silence fell on the group. Then the woman said, “Last week I dreamed
that you would come today. Now go; you’ll hear from me later.” The
church members greeted her warmly before we left.
   The next day I was called to visit the woman’s home. “I have decided
to give the church half the land my husband originally gave you,” she
said. “But you must build the school you have planned on the land I am
giving you.”
   That afternoon we had a prayer and praise meeting in the church. Many
confessed their unbelief and the unkindness they had felt toward the
woman, and everyone praised God for saving the church. The members’
attitudes have changed, and they often visit this woman and invite her
family to the church.
   Today an Adventist school serves the community, and the members
have learned critical lessons in love, forgiveness, and faith.

      A Perpetual Ministry
        							




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: John 4:7–30, Acts 2:42,
      11:19–23, 2 Tim. 2:1–7, 2 Cor. 5:18–20.

Memory Text: “ ‘What is the kingdom of God like? And to what
      shall I compare it? It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and
      put in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the
      birds of the air nested in its branches’ ” (Luke 13:18, 19, NKJV).

Key Thought: Evangelism and witnessing are the means by which
      the mustard seed (the church of God) becomes a huge tree that
      fills the whole world.



      Y
               ou may have heard it said—you may even have said it
               yourself—“I have done my bit; I will now leave it to the
               younger people.” Or, “I have been evangelism leader for years,
      let some of the new people take over now.”
         In one sense these kinds of statements are understandable. People get
      older, sometimes their health fails, or other life circumstances prevent
      them from maintaining their leadership in church ministries. Sometimes
      people just burn themselves out and need a break. Some may believe the
      Lord requires them to fulfill His will in other areas of church work.
         There is, however, a great difference between changing ministry
      emphasis and ceasing to minister; as long as we have breath we should,
      in one capacity or another, continue to minister.
          This week we will focus on our need to stay involved in witnessing
      and evangelism ministries. No matter what our role is in the church,
      there are always going to be opportunities for us to minister.

     Never-ending Witnessing and
     Evangelism
       It must be emphasized again that witnessing and evangelism must
     continue as long as there are people who need salvation. It is God’s
     plan to save as many people as possible. Meanwhile, those who have
     accepted Jesus as their personal Savior are called upon to work with
     God in this soul-saving work. No matter who we are, where we are,
     and in what situations we find ourselves, if our hearts are tuned to
     Christ, if we have a deep-seated appreciation for what He has done
     for us and for what He asks us to do in response, we will always have
     opportunity for witness and ministry.

Review Jesus’ conversation with the Samaritan woman in John
     4:7–30. What was it about Jesus and what He said that she was
     excited to share with her townspeople? What principles of wit-
     nessing can we take from this account that can help us as we seek
     to reach others?

     ________________________________________________________

        It seems that Jesus followed a simple “formula” when He spoke to the
     woman of Samaria. (1) He arrested her attention: “ ‘Give Me a drink’ ”
     (vs. 7, NKJV); (2) He secured her interest: “ ‘How is it that You, being a
     Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?’ ” (vss. 9, 10, NKJV); (3)
     He created a desire: “ ‘Sir, give me this water’ ” (vs. 15, NKJV); (4) He
     brought a conviction: “ ‘Sir, I perceive that You are a Prophet’ ” (vs. 19,
     NKJV); and (5) actions followed: “ ‘Come, see a Man who told me all
     things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?’ ” (vs. 29, NKJV).
        These five stages of evangelism do not necessarily need to take place
     all in one meeting as they did with Jesus and the woman at Jacob’s well.
     They may happen over a period of time as you continue to witness to
     someone. The situations will vary greatly, but the principles seen in this
     passage can be broadly applied to our attempts to reach souls.
        In addition, although the initial conversation is concerned with literal
     water, Jesus’ goal is to create in the Samaritan woman a desire to drink
     the Water of Life. In the end, although we are called to help people in
     whatever situation we find them, and to minister to their needs however
     we can, we must never forget that their greatest need is salvation in Jesus.

      How often do you take advantage of opportunities to witness or
      to minister? Isn’t it true that so often we go about our lives, meet-
      ing people who—despite their interaction with us—have no idea
      of what we believe, what we stand for, or the hope that we have?
      How can we change so that we can be better witnesses?

                                                                            105

      A Nurturing Environment
         A vital part of evangelism takes place in church every week. This
      aspect of evangelism is called “nurture” and “incorporation.” We have
      been very good at inviting people to our churches, but we have not
      always done so well in the creation of an environment that will encour-
      age them to return and settle into the fellowship. If we are to make
      disciples, we must give attention to the establishment and nurture of
      every new Christian.
         What does this mean? “Establishment” gives the idea of setting
      something up on a firm and permanent basis. It is to help provide
      them with a foundation of faith and fellowship. To “nurture” is usually
      explained by concepts such as “to rear,” “to bring up,” “to care for,” “to
      foster,” “to train,” and “to educate.” When someone accepts the Lord
      Jesus as his or her personal Savior, all of these areas of establishment
      and nurture must be applied spiritually and socially within the Christian
      fellowship. In other words, a new Christian needs to be brought up,
      cared for, fostered, trained, and educated in the ways of the Lord.
         Fellowship is key. This is how lives touch and affect one another.
      People who join a church must be cared for through spiritual fellowship.

What do the following texts tell us about the importance of spiritual
      fellowship among believers? Why are these things especially
      important in the case of new believers, those who have come into
      the church through our evangelism and outreach? 1 John 1:7; Acts
      2:42; 11:19–23; 20:35; and Rom. 1:11, 12.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         The word we in 1 John 1:7 impresses upon us that, although we are
      to walk in the light as individuals, we are to walk in the light together.
      If believers walk in the light, there will be fellowship and unity.
      Consequently, there will be a nurturing environment where people are
      focused both upon God’s will for their lives and the encouragement of
      one another along the Christian path. While it is important to help new
      members be happy and contented in church, it is also important to
      lead them to become disciples in the fullest sense of the word, which
      includes developing the ability to lead others into a saving relation-
      ship with the Lord Jesus.

       Does your church have an intentional focus on establishing new
       members in their faith? How can you become better involved in
       helping to nurture new members (or even “old” ones, for that
       matter)?

     Training Trainers					
       We live in a world where people are highly mobile. Local churches
     seem to regularly process transfers out and transfers in and often
     lament the loss of capable members who have been involved in
     significant ministries. Because of this potential transfer of skills,
     and because the local church’s evangelism and witnessing ministry
     should continue expanding, there is a great need to multiply these
     ministries.

What principles concerning the training of trainers can we glean
     from Paul’s instructions to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:1–7? How
     should all these words apply to us today in our work for the Lord,
     in whatever capacity we find ourselves?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________
     			
        Paul communicates to Timothy the importance of seeing the big
     picture of the church’s work, both regarding extent and duration. The
     pastoral and teaching ministries are not to be centered in just one
     man. They are to be the work of a multiplied number of witnesses and
     evangelists in the church. Primarily, Paul is telling Timothy to train
     up others for leadership in the church because, eventually, the older
     generation of leaders will have passed on. Implicit in this instruction
     to Timothy is that those he instructs will also, in turn, teach others,
     thereby ensuring that the church’s mission in the world will be con-
     tinuous and expansive. This process is in harmony with Jesus’ call for
     more laborers for the harvest.
        It has been said, “Give a man a fish, and you will feed him for a day;
     teach him how to fish, and you will feed him and his family for as long
     as he lives.” The problem is that if the man does not pass his fishing skill
     on to his children, the next generation will go hungry. Perhaps the saying
     should be modified to say, “Give a man a fish, and you will feed him for a
     day; teach a man to fish and to pass on his knowledge and techniques, and
     untold numbers of people will continue to be fed.” This is the difference
     between training someone and training them to be trainers.

      Think through your experience in our church. Has anyone ever
      taught you how to witness to others? Have you ever asked to
      be trained to witness to others? Discuss your answer in class
      on Sabbath.
                                                                            107

      Reclaiming Former Members
         Backslider is a word we wish did not exist in the Christian vocabu-
      lary. It is a fact, however, that many people slide away from church
      and from a saving relationship with the Lord. Although people do, at
      times, leave us over doctrine, most of the time they leave over other
      things, usually personal disputes and so forth. Whatever the reasons,
      we need to do all that we can to create a loving and nurturing environ-
      ment that will help those who join us want to stay among us, despite
      whatever personal issues inevitably arise.
         At the same time, we should have a ministry to former and non-
      attending members as an intentional part of our witnessing and evange-
      lism program. A quick look at the various churches’ lists of members will
      likely reveal that there are many more names listed there than those who
      attend worship each Sabbath. These names could form the beginnings of a
      special ministry to people whom God has never ceased to love supremely.

Thoughtfully consider 2 Corinthians 5:18–20. Although the con-
      text is somewhat different from ours, the principle is important.
      In what ways is a “ministry of reconciliation” special to those who
      once followed God but have slidden away?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Reclaiming former members is a special ministry. Furthermore, this
      ministry is as evangelistic as when we reach out to people who have
      never accepted Christ before. The very word reconciliation implies
      that there was a former unity and fellowship between humankind and
      God that has now been restored through Jesus Christ. Furthermore, we
      are now given a ministry of reconciliation that includes reaching out
      to those who once worshiped with us.
        In fact, one could argue that in Matthew 10:5, 6, Jesus sent His
      disciples to win back members of the Jewish nation who had fallen
      away from a saving relationship with their Lord. Thus, it is entirely
      appropriate that we today also enter into a work for those people who
      have a special history with God and His church.

       Think about those who have left the church and the reason
       why they did. Is there any one person with whom you could re-
       establish contact and resume friendship—ministering to them
       and seeking to reconnect them with the church? Pray about
       how you could go about doing this.

     The Back Door
       Have you ever noticed that people often lament the fact that mem-
     bers slip out “the back door”? They even state firmly that the church’s
     back door needs to be closed but fail to tell us how to close the door
     or even the location of the door. Some growing churches may think
     that their back door is closed, but in reality it may be simply that more
     people are coming in the front door than are going out the back. And
     while that is better than more going out the back than coming in the
     front (which is true in some places), we still want to do what we can
     to retain our members.
       Discovering the back door and attempting to close it will take strat-
     egies that are indeed evangelistic given that our mandate is not simply
     to win people for God but to hold them.

Read Hebrews 10:25. Why is it important that Christians meet
     together regularly? When in fellowship together, how much
     “encouraging” do we give one another? How can we do even more
     than we are now?

     ________________________________________________________

        The decision to leave the fellowship is usually not a sudden one.
     Rather, most people go through a process of quietly leaving. Just as
     coming to Christ and His church was a journey, the process of leaving
     is a journey. Most often for those who leave, this is not a consciously
     planned strategy. They just start to slowly get disconnected, disen-
     chanted, and dissatisfied with things in the church. Maybe, even in
     some cases, justifiably so. We should, therefore, seek to be aware of
     the journey of those around us at church.

Read Romans 14:13, Galatians 5:13, and Ephesians 4:32. How would
     living in harmony with these admonitions help to keep the back
     door closed? What can you and your church do to live out these
     important truths?

     ________________________________________________________

      A caring church, one that continues to care, is a place where each
     individual is focused upon his or her personal relationship with Jesus.
     They have a clear concept of the value that Jesus places upon each
     individual. Closing the back door involves getting close to people,
     discovering their needs as they are willing to share, and meeting those
     needs when appropriate. This is something no church program can
     provide. Only loving, caring individuals can.

                                                                         109

    Further Study: Planning to Continue and Grow Your Ministry

            Everyone involved in a witnessing and evangelism ministry should
          give attention to how he or she can ensure that it will continue rather
          than be a one-time event. There are many things we can do to ensure
          this. We will review a few of the vital ones.

            1. Be comfortable with sharing leadership rather than being a one-
1
          person band. Maintain a team approach where both the work and the
          affirmation are shared.

            2. Do whatever you can to keep the importance of your team’s
          ministry before the church. This will include regular reports to major
          evangelism committees, bulletin inserts, newsletters, notice board
          posters, and requests for budgets.
2
            3. Be on the constant lookout for people you can invite to join your
          team or to form another team. If someone volunteers to join your team
          as a result of your activities and reports, that is fine; however, it will
          be better to personally invite people instead of sending out a general
          invitation for volunteers.

            4. Regular training events are a must, especially concerning wit-
3         nessing and evangelism activities.

    Discussion Questions:

           2 “We are to be channels through which the Lord can send light
           and grace to the world. Backsliders are to be reclaimed. We are
           to put away our sins, by confession and repentance humbling
           our proud hearts before God. Floods of spiritual power are to
           be poured forth upon those prepared to receive it.”—Ellen G.
           White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 46. What is needed,
           and why, to help bring people back into this church and the
           wonderful “present truth” message that, in fact, no one else is
           preaching to the world?

           l
           3 When people leave, let’s love them, let’s keep in touch, let’s
           not judge and call them “apostates,” or, even worse, let’s not
           hurl at them Ellen White quotes about people falling away.
           Instead, let’s use these sad experiences, as Paul said, to “examine
           yourselves, whether ye be in the faith” (2 Cor. 13:5) and ask what
           we might’ve done differently, if anything, that could have helped
           to keep these souls among us. Most important, let’s not do any-
           thing that would make it harder for them to come back should
           they change their minds. How can we as a church apply these
           principles toward those who, for whatever reason, have left us?

My Sister’s Faith
   My family is Buddhist, the traditional religion of Mongolia. I often vis-
ited the Buddhist temple to pray and even learned to chant some Buddhist
prayers. I planned to become a Buddhist nun when I finished college.
   Then my younger sister, Mungu, began attending the Seventh-day
Adventist church. I told Mungu that her religion was foolish, but she
continued attending church and even invited me to go. I began noticing
that Mungu no longer stayed out until late at night, and refused to argue
over petty issues when I tried to pick a fight. The changes in her life were
remarkable.
   Mungu often brought books home from church and left them for me to
read. I read the books and became curious about what her church teaches.
So the next time Mungu invited me to church, I went.
   The people were friendly, and even the church leaders stopped and
talked to us. I decided to return to the church. I learned about heaven and
hell, Jesus’ second coming, and faith in God. I believed what they were
saying. I kept coming. My ideas of what Buddhists believe were vague,
but these Christians were very clear about what they believe.
   Little by little I gave up my desire to become a Buddhist nun and
embraced God’s love and claim on my life. My sister and I were baptized
together. Our parents tried to talk us out of joining a Christian church. But
as they saw the changes in our lives that Jesus made, they let us attend.
   Mungu and I share our faith with our parents and elder sister. Our sis-
ter believes in God and knows that He has answered her prayers in the
past. But according to Buddhist traditions, the eldest child must remain a
Buddhist so that when our parents die there will be someone to open the
door to the next life. Mungu and I pray that our parents will give their lives
to God and give up their beliefs in reincarnation. Then my elder sister will
be released from her obligations and can follow God.
   The church in Mongolia is still young and small. Most members are
under 30 years old, and many are still in school. Your mission offerings
help support the growing and maturing church in Mongolia. And recent
Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings have helped to build or buy church build-
ings, establish a dormitory for Seventh-day Adventist students in the
capital, Ulaanbaatar, and helped to buy a youth training center where we
can learn to become the leaders of the church in Mongolia for many years
to come. Thank you!



Erdenechimeg and Mungu Sukhbaatar are working in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of
Mongolia.

2012    Bible Study Guide for the Third Quarter
          The Thessalonians faced stress, strains, struggles, even outright
       persecution. In other words, life for them, as for all of us, had its
       hard moments. Despite these moments, the Thessalonians had a sure
       hope, a hope based on what Christ had done for them, a hope that
       pointed to the greatest promise of all—the Second Coming. Though
       Paul had chided the Thessalonians, they had issues in the church—
       behavioral as well as theological (sound familiar?)—it was to them,
       and us, that Paul wrote some of the most incredible, uplifting, and
       hopeful words in all inspiration.
          In this quarter’s Bible study guide on 1 and 2 Thessalonians by
       Jon Paulien, we will get a glimpse into the life of an early Christian
       church. We will see some of the struggles and challenges that it
       faced, including the difficulties that arose from the fact that Christ
       had not yet returned. Fascinating, too, is that however different their
       circumstances, so often the principles reflected in Paul’s words to
       them deal with the issues and challenges that we, too, confront as we
       await the return of our Lord Jesus, whose death on the cross at the
       first coming guarantees His return in glory at the Second.
