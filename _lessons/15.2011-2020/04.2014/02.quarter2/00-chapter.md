The Law and Love

F            rom the very beginning of the great controversy in heaven it has been
             Satan’s purpose to overthrow the law of God.”—Ellen G. White, The
             Great Controversy, p. 582.
   Why? Because the law, as the foundation of God’s government, expresses the
moral integrity of the cosmos; and to overthrow that law would be to overthrow the
moral order of the creation itself.
   Think about it. If no god existed, and no life either, the universe would be amoral.
Not immoral, as in having bad morals, but amoral, as in having no morals, because
nothing in it—such as lifeless rocks hurling through a godless cosmos—could mani-
fest moral qualities.
   However, God exists, and humans do as well, and we have been created as moral
beings with the capacity to give and to receive love. For this love to exist, however,
freedom, moral freedom, must exist, too, because love is a moral concept that couldn’t
arise in an amoral universe (such as one composed of only rocks and cold space).
   Morality, though, means the ability to choose right or wrong, good or evil—and
the only way for the universe to be moral, to allow the potential for good or evil, for
right or wrong, would be for it to have a law that defines right or wrong.
   And, of course, it does have such a law.
   “What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have
known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what cov-
eting really was if the law had not said, ‘Do not covet’ ” (Rom. 7:7, NIV).
   Is it sinful to have red hair? Why not? Because God’s law doesn’t forbid red hair.
If it did, as the law forbids covetousness, then having red hair would be a sin. But it
cannot be sin if no divine law defines it as such.
   Morality without law is as impossible as is thought without mind. Our universe
is moral because God created free beings answerable
to His law. If there were no law against coveting,
there would be no sin of covetousness; if there were
no law against red hair, there would be no sin of red The link between
headedness—no matter how many red-haired coveters our loving God
populated the cosmos.                                        and the keeping of
   God created humans as creatures who can love.
Love, though, can’t exist without freedom, moral
                                                             His commandments
freedom. And moral freedom can’t exist without law, is stronger than
moral law. Love rests on freedom, and freedom rests we realize.
on law. Hence, the core of God’s government, the
foundation of that government—a government of
love—has to be His law. That’s why Ellen G. White
wrote what she did about Satan’s desire “to overthrow the law of God.” The attack
on the law is an attack not just on Christ’s character but on the moral order of the
creation itself.
   Hence, the topic for our quarter: Christ and His law. We will study the law, espe-
cially the question of why so many Christians—misunderstanding the relationship
between law and grace—have fallen into the trap of denying the continued validity
of the Ten Commandments, thus, unwittingly helping the attempt to “overthrow”
God’s law.
   The Bible, though, is clear: “For this is the love of God, that we keep His com-
mandments” (1 John 5:3, NKJV). The link between our loving God and the keeping
of His commandments is stronger than we realize. We can love God because we live
in a universe where love can exist, and it can exist because the universe is moral. That
morality is based, at least for us as created beings, on God’s moral law—the subject
we will now explore.

sertation from Northwestern University focused on the role of the law in Paul’s letter to
the Romans.

      Laws in Christ’s                            Day



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 2:1–5, Heb. 10:28, Deut.
      17:2–6, Lev. 1:1–9, Luke 14:1–6, James 2:8–12.

Memory Text: “For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do
      instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a
      law to themselves” (Romans 2:14, NASB).



      I
          n most societies, various laws function at the same time. There can
          be general laws that apply to everyone and, simultaneously, local
          laws that prevail in one community but not in another.
        In New Testament times, when a person used the common word for
      “law” (nomos in Greek, lex in Latin, and Torah in Hebrew), he or she
      could have been referring to any one of a number of laws. Often the
      only indicator as to the exact law being discussed was the context of
      the conversation. Thus, as we study this quarter, we’ll always need to
      keep the immediate context in mind in order to understand best what
      law is being discussed.
        This week’s lesson investigates the various laws that functioned in
      the community during the time of Christ and the early church. We will
      study these various laws but only in the context of helping to set a
      foundation for the study of the law that will be the major focus of this
      quarter—God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments.

     Roman Law
Read Luke 2:1–5. What lessons can we learn from the ways in which
     these two faithful followers of the Lord interacted with their politi-
     cal environment?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Since the time of the early republic, the Romans recognized how
     important written laws were for the governance of society. In fact,
     the system of constitutional law established by the Romans remains a
     foundation of the legal systems found in many of today’s democratic
     societies.
       For the most part, Rome allowed vassal kingdoms to maintain their
     own customs, but all subjects were expected to obey imperial and sena-
     torial laws. Obviously, this included Joseph and Mary.
       Roman law was concerned with order in society. As such, it not
     only addressed issues of government but also legislated behavior in
     the domestic arena. In addition to stipulating the procedures for select-
     ing people to public office, Roman law also dealt with things such as
     adultery and master/slave relationships. Many of the social codes are
     similar to the ones found in the Old Testament and other societies.
       All attempts to understand the culture in which the New Testament
     books were composed must take into account the fact that the Roman
     Empire formed the political backdrop for the world in which Jesus and
     the early church lived. Many things taking place in the New Testament,
     from the death of Jesus to the imprisonment of Paul, make much better
     sense when we understand whatever we can about the environment of
     their times. Of course, one doesn’t need to be a scholar of Roman his-
     tory in order to understand that which we need for salvation. However,
     when it is possible for us to obtain it, historical knowledge can indeed
     be helpful.

      Despite the amazing providences of Mary’s pregnancy and the
      obvious hand of the Lord in it, these two people still obeyed the
      law of the land, which required them to leave their home, even
      when Mary was quite far along in her pregnancy. Would it not
      have been better simply to have stayed home, considering the
      extraordinary circumstances? What might their actions say to us
      about how we should relate to civil law? (Think how easy it would
      have been for them to have justified not obeying.)
                                                                            7

     Mosaic Law: Civic
        Although the Jews were under Roman rule at the time of Jesus,
     they were granted authority over those issues that were unique to their
     customs and religion (see Acts 18:15). The legislative body responsible
     for administering Jewish law was called the Sanhedrin. Sometimes
     referred to as the council (John 11:47, Acts 5:27), the Sanhedrin con-
     sisted of 71 men selected from among the priests, elders, and rabbis
     and was presided over by the high priest. It served as a type of Supreme
     Court that dealt with Jewish customs, traditions, and laws.
        Jewish societal law was founded upon the civil codes revealed in
     the five books of Moses. Because Moses was the author of the first
     five biblical books, the laws are referred to as the law of Moses. When
     God originally gave the laws to Moses, He envisioned a state where He
     would be the head and the people would enforce His legal mandates.
     By the time of Jesus, the Jews were subject to Roman law. However,
     the Roman government allowed them to use Mosaic law in order to
     settle issues relating to their customs. Here is where the work of the
     Sanhedrin was especially important.
        The New Testament provides several examples of the Mosaic law
     being applied, or alluded to, in civic matters: Jewish men were still
     expected to pay the half shekel temple tax (Matt. 17:24–27, Exod.
     30:13); divorces were still being governed by the stipulations set forth
     by Moses (Matt. 19:7, Deut. 24:1–4); people still adhered to the law of
     levirate marriage, in which a widow was to marry her husband’s brother
     (Matt. 22:24, Deut. 25:5); boys were still circumcised on the eighth day
     (John 7:23, Lev. 12:3); and adulterers were to be punished by stoning
     (John 8:5; Deut. 22:23, 24).


Read Matthew 26:59–61, Hebrews 10:28, and Deuteronomy 17:2–6.
     What important principle is seen here? What does this tell us about
     biblical concepts of justice and fairness?

      Read some of the civil legislation found in the early books of the
      Bible. Some of those laws do seem strange to us, don’t they? (See, for
      example, Deuteronomy 21.) Considering who the Author is of these
      laws, what should this tell us about how we must learn to trust the
      Lord in all things, especially those things we don’t fully understand?

     Mosaic Law: Ceremonial
Read Leviticus 1:1–9, 2:14–16, 5:11–13. To what are these laws refer-
      ring? What was their purpose? What important truths were they
      meant to teach?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Besides the civil laws in ancient Israel, there was also what is often
     called the “ceremonial law.” This law centered around the sanctuary and
     its services, all of which, of course, were designed to teach the children
     of Israel the plan of salvation and point them to the coming Messiah.
     In the texts for today, twice it is mentioned that through these services,
     “atonement” would be made. In their own way, these laws were what
     has been deemed “miniprophecies” of Christ and His work of atone-
     ment for the sins of His people.
        “The ceremonial law was given by Christ. Even after it was no longer
     to be observed, Paul presented it before the Jews in its true position and
     value, showing its place in the plan of redemption and its relation to
     the work of Christ; and the great apostle pronounces this law glorious,
     worthy of its divine Originator. The solemn service of the sanctuary
     typified the grand truths that were to be revealed through successive
     generations. . . . Thus through age after age of darkness and apostasy
     faith was kept alive in the hearts of men until the time came for the
     advent of the promised Messiah.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 367.
        Though instituted by Jesus, the ceremonial system was meant to
     function only as a type, a symbol of a future reality—the coming of
     Jesus and His death and High Priestly ministry. Once He completed His
     work on earth, this old system—along with its sacrifices and rituals and
     feasts—no longer was needed (see Heb. 9:9–12). Though we no longer
     keep the ceremonial law today, by studying it we can garner insights
     into the plan of salvation.

      Central to the sanctuary service was the sacrifice of the animals,
      which pointed to the death of Jesus. Think what it means that our
      salvation could come only through His death on our behalf. What
      should this tell us about just how costly sin is?

     Rabbinic Law
       In addition to the Mosaic laws, Jews at the time of Jesus were also
     familiar with the law of the rabbis. The rabbis were the scholastic
     arm of the Pharisees, and they took the responsibility of ensuring that
     the Mosaic law remained relevant to the people. The rabbis counted
     613 laws in the five books of Moses (including 39 pertaining to the
     Sabbath), and they used these laws as the basis for their legislation.
     They supplemented these written laws with an oral law that consisted
     of the interpretations of leading rabbis.
       Oral law is known as halakah, which means “to walk.” The rabbis
     felt that if the people adhered to their numerous halakoth (plural of
     halakah), they would walk in the way of the 613 major laws. Although
     originating as oral law, the rabbinic halakoth were collated and
     recorded in book form. Some of the interpretations from Jesus’ day
     survive in commentaries known as Midrash, while others are recorded
     in a legal collection called Mishnah. Many religious Jews through the
     ages, and even today, seek to adhere strictly to these laws.

Read Luke 14:1–6 and John 9. Although Jesus was accused of violat-
     ing the Sabbath with His miraculous healings, where can you find
     in the Old Testament that it’s a sin to heal on the Sabbath day?
     How does the answer help us to understand some of the issues with
     which Jesus had to address? More important, what lessons can we
     learn from these incidents that could help us to make sure that we
     don’t make similar mistakes in our attempts to “walk in the way”
     faithfully?

     _________________________________________________________

       Though it’s easy from our perspective today to deride many of these
     oral laws, especially when they were used as they were against Jesus,
     the fault exists more with the attitude of the leaders and not with these
     laws themselves. Though often kept very legalistically, halakoth were
     meant to be very spiritual, infusing a spiritual element into the most
     mundane of actions, giving them a religious significance.

      How can we learn to give even the most mundane tasks a religious
      significance?

     The Moral Law
       However much Roman law, Mosaic law, and rabbinic law impacted
     the lives of Jews living in first-century Israel, many people who fol-
     lowed the religion of Israel lived outside of Palestine and beyond the
     borders of the Roman Empire. Thus, many of these laws would not
     have played a big role in their lives.
       At the same time, however, anyone professing to be a follower of the
     God of Israel would have adhered to the Ten Commandments.
       “The Ten Commandments provide Israel with the moral framework
     for maintaining it [their relationship with God]. The metaphor that the
     Bible uses to express this relationship is covenant. While the metaphor
     comes from the sphere of international law, it is wrong to understand
     the commandments merely as a summary of Israel’s obligations toward
     God. . . . Israel’s obedience to the commandments was not a matter of
     submission to the divine will as much as it was a response to love.”
     —Leslie J. Hoppe, “Ten Commandments,” Eerdmans Dictionary of the
     Bible (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2000), p. 1285.
       The Ten Commandments surpassed any system of law known to
     Jews in the first century. Even the Pharisees, who had meticulously
     memorized the 613 Mosaic laws, recognized the importance of the
     Ten Commandments. The division of the Mishnah called Tamid
     (5:1) contains a rabbinic command to recite the Ten Commandments
     daily. It was believed that all the other laws were contained in the Ten
     Commandments. In fact, the Jewish philosopher Philo, who was a con-
     temporary of Jesus, wrote an entire book on the central place the Ten
     Commandments held among all biblical law.

Read Matthew 19:16–19, Romans 13:8–10, and James 2:8–12. What
     do these verses say about the role that the Ten Commandments play
     in the lives of those who are followers of Christ?

       Like their Jewish counterparts, the inspired writers of the New
     Testament recognized the purpose of the Ten Commandments for
     God’s people. Although some of the lessons for this quarter will dis-
     cuss the way in which Christ interacted with other systems of law in
     His day, the primary emphasis will be on His relationship to the Ten
     Commandments—what is often known as “the moral law.”
                                                                         11

Further Study: Read also Ellen G. White, “Oath Taking,” pp. 201–
     204, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1.

       “If Adam had not transgressed the law of God, the ceremonial law
     would never have been instituted. The gospel of good news was first
     given to Adam in the declaration made to him that the seed of the woman
     should bruise the serpent’s head; and it was handed down through suc-
     cessive generations to Noah, Abraham, and Moses. The knowledge
     of God’s law, and the plan of salvation were imparted to Adam and
     Eve by Christ Himself. They carefully treasured the important lesson,
     and transmitted it by word of mouth, to their children, and children’s
     children. Thus the knowledge of God’s law was preserved.”—Ellen G.
     White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 230.

Discussion Questions:
       Long before Moses penned the laws that were to govern Israel,
      the Egyptians and Babylonians had systems of societal laws that
      were, in some cases, similar in content to some of God’s laws. Even
      atheistic societies have laws that protect people and property.
      Law, though, is often based on moral concepts; that is, law should
      encourage people to refrain from certain types of evil and to do
      certain types of good. From where, though, do societies get their
      sense of good and evil?

       How does the whole concept of good and evil impact the ques-
      tion of God’s existence? In other words, if there is no God, from
      where do the concepts of good and evil come? From where is the
      only place that they could come if no God existed?

       We often use the concept of “law” in different ways. We talk
      about the law of gravity, the law of motion. We talk about interna-
      tional law. We talk about the law of the land. We talk about tax law.
      What do all of these laws have in common? In what ways do they
      differ? What is the probable consequence of violating any of these
      laws? What are the benefits of cooperating with these laws? How
      do the principles of law help you to understand the purpose of the
      Ten Commandments as it relates to the life of believers?

       In class, go back to Wednesday’s lesson and deal with the issue
      of how we as a church need to be careful that we don’t make the
      same mistake that some of the leaders did by adding burdens to
      the law that were never meant to be there. Why is such a mistake
      easier to make than we might think, no matter how well-meaning
      we might be?

                                                    Story
A Life of Influence
  Elizabeth Kimongo was born into a traditional Maasai family in
Kenya. In her culture, girls are expected to marry soon after their twelfth
birthday. Women have little say about their lives, but Elizabeth refused to
leave school to marry. She had a dream.
  While home for vacation before starting high school, Elizabeth learned
her father had arranged for her to marry an older man. With her mother’s
blessing, she escaped and returned to her Seventh-day Adventist school.
  During high school, Elizabeth took her stand for Christ and later
was baptized. When she told her mother that she wanted to study at the
Adventist university, her mother encouraged her to go.
  Elizabeth is majoring in agriculture, a field that will help her teach her
people how to preserve their land and provide a better life. She works on
campus and receives some scholarship funds to help her pay her school
fees. Sometimes she must take a semester off to work full time to earn
the money to continue her studies.
  Elizabeth’s example has helped her younger sisters stay in school and
avoid early marriage. Her father, once angry that his daughter would
refuse to marry the man of his choice, now accepts her decision. But he
pressures her younger sisters to marry this man. Elizabeth encourages
her sisters to walk close to God and to continue their studies to make a
better life.
  Elizabeth urges other Maasai girls to study hard and trust in God.
“Don’t allow life’s circumstances to steal your life away,” she says. “Satan
wants to destroy you. You must trust God and not let Satan have his way.”
  Elizabeth is old enough now that her community will not force her to
marry. They accept her as an adult woman who can make her own deci-
sions. “I want to teach my people by example how to produce better crops
for a better life,” she says. “The village has given me a piece of land that
                               I use to plant crops so that my fellow villagers
                               can see for themselves the success they can
                               have by following my example.”
                                  Elizabeth is grateful for Adventist schools
                               that have prepared her to live a life of influ-
                               ence among her Maasai people. Our mission
                               offerings and Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings
                               help these schools reach young people in all
                               walks of life, including Maasai girls in the
                               heart of eastern Africa. Thank you.
                               Elizabeth Kimongo will soon complete her studies
                               and return to her village to work for her people and
                               share God’s love among them.

      Christ and the Law of
      Moses


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 2:21–24; Exod. 13:2,
      12; Luke 2:41–52; Matt. 17:24–27; John 8:1–11; Deut. 22:23, 24.

Memory Text: “ ‘If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for
      he wrote about me’ ” (John 5:46, NRSV).



      M
                 any Christians have been raised on stories about Jesus’
                 supposedly negative relationship to the Jewish religion, an
                 unfortunate misconception that has only helped feed anti-
      Semitism through the centuries. Jesus spoke out against abuses of the
      religion, that’s true, but not against the religion itself. After all, He was
      the founder of it.
        Indeed, the Gospel accounts of His life and ministry show that Jesus
      was a faithful Jew fully immersed in Jewish culture from the moment
      of His birth to the final week of His life in human flesh.
        Like every loyal Jew in the first century, Jesus was subject to the
      Mosaic law. Raised in a home with loyal Jewish parents, He fully
      appreciated His rich earthly heritage, which was rooted in Divine
      providence. He knew that God Himself had inspired Moses to pen these
      laws, with the purpose of creating a society that reflected His will and
      served as a beacon to the nations. He adhered faithfully to the letter of
      the law. From circumcision to His visit to the temple to the feasts and to
      His attitude about taxes, Jesus remained steadfastly faithful to a system
      that, He knew, would over time be fulfilled through His death and His
      ministry in heaven.
        This week we’ll look at more of the laws that Jesus Himself kept.

     Circumcision and Dedication                             (Luke 2:21–24)

       God established His covenant with Abraham, saying that he would be
     the father of many nations (Gen. 17:4). When God made this covenant,
     the 99-year-old Abraham had only recently fathered Ishmael and had
     not yet seen the birth of his promised son, Isaac. Nonetheless, he was
     commanded to circumcise himself along with every male member of
     his household, and he was instructed to ensure that every son born into
     his household from that day forth be circumcised on the eighth day
     (Gen. 17:9–12). So important was this sign that the circumcision took
     place even if the eighth day fell on a Sabbath (Lev. 12:3, John 7:22).
       This truth gives us a better understanding of the earliest days of
     Jesus’ life. The Gospels do show that Joseph and Mary were chosen
     to be the earthly parents of Jesus at least in part because of their piety.
     Joseph is described as a “righteous man” (Matt. 1:19, NASB), and
     Mary is said to have “found favor with God” (Luke 1:30, NASB). When
     Jesus was eight days old, His parents held a naming and circumcision
     ceremony in the same manner as an untold number of Hebrew males
     had experienced in times past.
       Imagine, the spotless Son of God, now in human form, undergoing
     the very ritual that He Himself had instituted many centuries earlier!

Read Luke 2:21–24 in light of Exodus 13:2, 12 and Leviticus 12:1–8.
     What more do these texts tell us about Joseph and Mary? What
     can we learn for ourselves, in our own time and sphere, from their
     example?

       The Bible is clear that Mary was a virgin when she was chosen to
     be the mother of Jesus (Luke 1:27); so, Jesus was the first child that
     “opened her womb.” According to Exodus 13, every firstborn among
     the Israelites (whether animal or human) was to be dedicated to the
     Lord. The law also stipulated in Leviticus 12:2–5 that after the birth
     of a male child, the woman was ceremonially unclean for a total of 40
     days (80 for a female child). At the end of this period, she was required
     to show herself to the priest and offer a sacrifice. As pious Jews, Mary
     and Joseph meticulously fulfilled the obligations of the Mosaic law and
     ensured that the Son of God bore the marks of the covenant.



                                                                            15

     Jewish Feasts            (John 5:1)

       “After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to
     Jerusalem” (John 5:1, NKJV).

       The first major festival period in the Jewish calendar year is
     the seven-day Feast of Unleavened Bread, which commences with
     Passover. The festival commemorates the deliverance of the Israelites
     from Egyptian slavery, when the angel of death passed over the homes
     of those who put the blood on their doorposts. The Gospels record
     three occasions when Jesus celebrated Passover (Luke 2:41–43, John
     2:13–23, Matt. 26:17–20).
       Fifty days after Passover came the feast of Shavuot, often referred
     to by its Greek name, Pentecost. Although the Scriptures don’t provide
     a reason for Pentecost, the rabbis believed that it commemorated the
     giving of the law to Moses. There is no record in the Gospels that Jesus
     celebrated Pentecost. However, before His ascension He counseled His
     disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the baptism of the Holy Spirit (Acts
     1:4, 5). This event actually occurred on the Day of Pentecost (Acts
     2:1–4).
       The final festival season in the Jewish calendar were the Feast of
     Booths (Tabernacles) and the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). The
     Day of Atonement signifies the day on which sin was cleansed from the
     camp and the people were at one with God. Booths commemorates the
     time when Israel had to live in tents in the wilderness.
       In addition to the feasts of Moses’ laws, the Jews have two other
     festivals that commemorate God’s historical intervention. The first is
     Purim, which marks the deliverance of the Jewish people from geno-
     cide, when Esther appealed to the Persian king. The second is Hanukah,
     also known as the Feast of Dedication (John 10:22), which celebrates
     the victory of the Maccabeans over the Greeks in 164 b.c.
       Of course, the biblical feasts were done away with long ago, at least
     as far as Christians are concerned. They all met their fulfillment in
     Christ. However, we can learn a great deal through studying them and
     the messages that they contain, because all of them teach lessons about
     God’s saving grace and power to deliver.

      Though we no longer keep the feasts, what things can we do that
      help to keep before us the reality of God, what He has done for
      us, and what He asks of us?

      Jesus in the Temple
        The New Testament does not tell us too much about the childhood of
      Jesus. One account, though, that gives great insight is Luke 2:41–52,
      the story of Jesus and His parents’ visit to Jerusalem during the Feast of
      Passover. Read it over and then answer the following questions:


How does this story help to illustrate the decidedly Jewish character of
      the Gospels and how central the religion was to all that took place?

Though Jesus was an obedient child, His answer to His parents

      top priority in our lives?

     Taxes      (Matt. 17:24–27)

        As last week’s lesson noted, the law of Moses had both civic and
     ceremonial components. The ceremonial aspect means that the temple
     was at the center of Jewish religious life. In fact, by the first century,
     the temple was probably the only remaining structure that gave the Jews
     any sense of national identity.
        The temple that stood in Jerusalem was undergoing renovations dur-
     ing Jesus’ ministry. Herod the Great had started the grandiose project
     in about 20 b.c., and it would not be fully completed until a.d. 66.
     Recognizing how serious many Jews were about their faith, the Romans
     allowed the Jews to collect their own taxes in order to cover the costs
     involved with the maintenance of the temple. Every Jewish male over
     the age of 20 was to pay the half-shekel tax regardless of his economic
     status (Exod. 30:13, 38:26).

Read Matthew 17:24–27. What did Jesus mean when He said: “Lest
     we should offend them”? What principle do we find here that we
     should apply in our own lives, as well?

        It seems that the temple tax collectors traveled throughout the prov-
     inces to ensure that every male fulfilled his legal obligation. Peter’s
     initial response to the tax collectors gives the impression that Jesus
     regularly paid His taxes (Matt. 17:24, 25). However, as the Son of God,
     Jesus appears to question the appropriateness of having to pay taxes for
     the upkeep of His Father’s house.
        “If Jesus had paid the tribute without a protest, He would virtually
     have acknowledged the justice of the claim [that He was under obliga-
     tion to pay], and would thus have denied His divinity. But while He
     saw good to meet the demand, He denied the claim upon which it was
     based. In providing for the payment of the tribute He gave evidence
     of His divine character. It was made manifest that He was one with
     God, and therefore was not under tribute as a mere subject of the king-
     dom.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 434.
        Notwithstanding, Jesus chose to comply with the authorities and
     directed Peter to retrieve the tax from the mouth of the first fish that he
     caught. The shekel in the fish’s mouth was enough to cover the tax for
     both Jesus and Peter.

      Jesus paid His temple tax even though He knew that the mag-
      nificent structure would soon be destroyed (Matt. 24:1, 2). What
      should this tell us about our obligations to be faithful in our tithes
      and offerings, regardless of whatever problems we believe exist?

     Law Enforcement (Matt. 5:17–20)
       As we have seen, Jesus was a faithful citizen who fulfilled His
     responsibilities as a Jewish male, even when His life was in danger
     (see, for example, John 7:1, 25, 26; 10:31). In fact, Jesus makes it clear
     that it was not His purpose to abolish “ ‘the Law or the Prophets’ ” (Matt.
     5:17–20, NKJV).

How, then, are we to understand John 8:1–11 and Matthew 19:1–9 in
     light of Deuteronomy 22:23, 24 and 24:1–4? What is happening
     here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Some of the Pharisees were always trying to expose Jesus as a law-
     breaker (see, for example, John 8:6). When they present Him with the
     woman who was caught in the act of adultery, they pose this ques-
     tion: Moses says she should be stoned; what do You say? Interestingly
     enough, Jesus does not directly respond to their inquiry. In fact, He
     affirms the law of Moses with His response, “ ‘He who is without sin
     among you, let him throw a stone at her first’ ” (John 8:7, NKJV). He
     isn’t saying that she shouldn’t be stoned; He simply forces these men
     to see their own violations of the law. Even the woman’s release is
     in harmony with the law of Moses, because there is none to point an
     accusing finger, and at least two witnesses are needed to administer
     justice (Deut. 17:6).
        In the incident concerning divorce and remarriage, Jesus appears
     to contradict the law of Moses with His insistence that there were
     originally no grounds for divorce (Matt. 19:4–6). When the Pharisees
     point to Moses’ commandment in Deuteronomy 24:1–4, Jesus places
     everything in perspective. Nowhere does Moses command that divorce
     should take place. However, because of the people’s obstinacy, Moses
     made an allowance for divorce (Matt. 19:8). Thus, we see that even
     when Jesus critiques a Mosaic law, He does not set it aside. Jesus was a
     faithful Jew in every way, adhering to the laws of Moses.

      How do we learn to balance justice and grace for those who,
      like ourselves, fall into sin? If we are going to err, as we as fallen
      beings inevitably do, what side is it better to err on, and why?

Further Study: For more information on this week’s topic, read Ellen
     G. White, “At the Feast of Tabernacles,” pp. 447–454; “Among Snares,”
     pp. 455–462, in The Desire of Ages.

        “Three times a year the Jews were required to assemble at Jerusalem
     for religious purposes. Enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, Israel’s invis-
     ible Leader had given the directions in regard to these gatherings.
     During the captivity of the Jews, they could not be observed; but when
     the people were restored to their own land, the observance of these
     memorials was once more begun. It was God’s design that these anni-
     versaries should call Him to the minds of the people.”—Ellen G. White,
     The Desire of Ages, p. 447.
        “It was natural for the parents of Jesus to look upon Him as their own
     child. He was daily with them, His life in many respects was like that
     of other children, and it was difficult for them to realize that He was
     the Son of God. They were in danger of failing to appreciate the bless-
     ing granted them in the presence of the world’s Redeemer. The grief
     of their separation from Him, and the gentle reproof which His words
     conveyed, were designed to impress them with the sacredness of their
     trust.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 81.

Discussion Questions:
       Dwell on the incredible truth that though Jesus instituted these
      laws, when He enters into humanity He places Himself under
      them. What does this tell us about the character of God?

       Try to put yourself in the position of Joseph and Mary. Is it
      any wonder that they didn’t fully understand all that was involved
      with Jesus? Are there not a lot of things about Jesus that we don’t
      understand either? How can we learn to trust and obey, despite
      the many things that we don’t understand?

       What would you say to a Christian who argues that we are to
      keep the feasts? (Hint: You might start by asking, “How do you
      intend to keep them, given that the feasts all centered around the
      temple, which has long been destroyed, and the shedding of blood,
      which has stopped?”)

                                                     Story
An Offering of Praise
   Yesuvadian was in his 60s when he first met Jesus through a dream.
God called him to serve Him, and Yesuvadian answered. He left his farm to
his family and walked away to follow God’s leading.
   For several years, he walked from village to village, sharing his newfound
faith in God with others. In the past 25 years, he has led more than four
hundred people to Christ, revived three dying churches, and started four new
congregations. When the local field saw what Yesuvadian was doing, they
offered him a stipend to help him.
   When Yesuvadian finds a dying church, he visits the people in the area
and leads them to Jesus. Then he oversees the work to rebuild the church
so that the growing congregation has a suitable house in which to worship.
   When he finds a village without believers, he settles among the people
and begins planting seeds of faith. He stays until a congregation and a
simple church building have been raised.
   Recently, Yesuvadian walked to a village and began seeking out people
who were willing to hear about Jesus. He began studying the Bible with
them, and their interest grew. Yesuvadian has spent two years in that village
and continues working there. So far more than twenty people have been
baptized, and the congregation is growing stronger. But Yesuvadian, now
in his 80s, is thinking of moving on to start a new congregation someplace
else. While he’s waiting for God’s call, he’s helping to give Bible studies for
an upcoming series of meetings to be held in a central town nearby.
   “God has blessed me in so many ways,” Yesuvadian says. “He leads me to
the rich and poor alike. He leads me to those who want to know more about
God. I stay and study with anyone who wants to hear God’s message.” While
some of the people he studies with are from a Christian background, many
are not. He finds special needs in the village and tries to help meet those
needs, whether it’s for food or clothes or community support.
                                “I have no intention of retiring,” he says
                             with a smile spreading across his weathered
                             face. “I’m looking forward to holding another
                             series of meetings, raising up another church.”
                             Usually Yesuvadian doesn’t preach, but he
                             invites evangelists to come and speak at the
                             evangelistic meetings after he has tilled the soil
                             and planted seeds of faith.
                                “God has shown me His love and given me
                             strength to do His work,” he says. “Sharing my
                             faith is my offering of praise to my God.”
                               Yesuvadian, a former farmer, shares his faith with others
                               in southeastern India.

      Christ and Religious
      Tradition


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 23:1–7, Matt. 15:1–6,
      Isa. 29:13, Matt. 5:17–20, Rom. 10:3.

Memory Text: “ ‘ “This people honors me with their lips, but
      their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as
      doctrines the precepts of men” ’ ” (Matthew 15:8, 9, RSV).



      J
          ohn Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, suggested
          that one’s theology is influenced by four factors: faith, reason,
          Scripture, and tradition. He didn’t mean, however, that all sides
      are equally authoritative. He acknowledged that the Bible was foun-
      dational, but he also recognized that one’s individual faith, ability to
      reason, and religious tradition affect the way in which the Bible is inter-
      preted. If Wesley were brought back to life today, he would be shocked
      to discover that many modern theologians in the Wesleyan tradition
      (and other traditions, as well) now value reason, tradition, or personal
      opinion over the clear teaching of Scripture.
        This week’s lesson investigates the religious traditions upon which
      the scribes and Pharisees based many of their teachings. The rabbis
      who originally penned these traditions greatly respected the Scriptures
      and had no intention for these traditions to be elevated to the status of
      God’s Word. However, some of their zealous disciples confused the
      method with the message and in doing so shifted the focus from God’s
      written revelation to human tradition.

     Seat of Moses
       While the “scribes and Pharisees” appear to be two separate groups
     who just happened to be lumped together, the scribes were likely a
     subset of the Pharisees (see Acts 23:9). The Pharisees became a visible
     group during the time of the Grecian Empire. They are believed to be
     the remnants of a pious Jewish sect, known as the Hasidim, who helped
     to fight in the Maccabean revolution against Greece.
       The name Pharisees is derived from the Hebrew paras, which means
     “to separate.” In an age when many Jews had become greatly influ-
     enced by pagan cultures, the Pharisees saw it as their duty to ensure
     that every Jewish male was taught the law. To accomplish this task,
     they established the position of rabbi, which literally means “my great
     one” or “my teacher.”
       In saying that the “ ‘scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat,’ ”
     Jesus acknowledged their positions as teachers of the people (Matt.
     23:2, 3, NKJV). After all, at least they had taken the responsibility to
     ensure that the people were instructed in the way of the law.

Read Matthew 23:1–7. From these verses, what was one of Jesus’ big-
     gest problems with the scribes and Pharisees?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Most of the references to the scribes and Pharisees in the Gospels are
     negative, and considering the complicity that many (but not all) had in
     the death of Jesus and the persecution of His followers, that negativ-
     ity was well deserved. Members of these groups seemed to be lurking
     around corners and hiding behind trees just waiting for people to make
     mistakes so they could enforce the law against them. This image of
     the Pharisee is so frequent in Scripture that the word is often used as a
     synonym for legalist. As we look closely at this text, we find that Jesus’
     big problem with the Pharisees was not so much that they wanted oth-
     ers to keep the law of Moses but that they themselves were not keeping
     it. They were hypocritical—they said one thing, but did another—and
     even when they did the right thing, they did it for wrong reasons.

      Read again what Jesus said about the scribes and Pharisees.
      How can we make sure that we don’t become guilty of similar
      attitudes?

     Human Commandments
        Although the scribes and Pharisees “sat in Moses’ seat,” their
     source of authority for religious instruction extended beyond the
     Old Testament. The law that the Pharisees utilized consisted of bibli-
     cal interpretations of leading rabbis. These interpretations were not
     intended to replace the Scriptures but to complement them. At first they
     circulated orally; later the scribes began to assemble them into books.
        The first official publication of rabbinic law did not appear until the
     end of the second century a.d., when Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Nasi (Judah
     the Prince) published the Mishnah. The laws recorded in the Mishnah
     reflect about four centuries of rabbinic interpretation. Included among
     the contributing rabbis are many who lived at the time of Jesus, the
     most notable being Hillel and Shammai. There was also Gamaliel, the
     grandson of Hillel and also Paul’s teacher.

Read Matthew 15:1–6. What is the controversial issue here? What
     error is Jesus seeking to correct?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In lesson 1, we learned that the rabbinic laws were called halakah,
     which means “to walk.” The rabbis felt that if a person would walk in
     the ways of the minor laws, they would keep the major ones by default.
     However, somewhere along the way the minor laws began to take on
     major status, and after a while it was difficult to distinguish the tradi-
     tional from the biblical.
        It does not appear that Jesus had a problem with the Pharisees
     having their own rules. However, He did have a problem with the
     elevation of these rules to the status of “doctrine.” No human has the
     authority to create religious restrictions and elevate them to the level
     of divine mandate. But this is not to say that groups of believers are
     prohibited from creating regulations that help to govern community
     behavior. Practical instruction could help people greatly in keeping
     the law. However, the instruction should never be allowed to take the
     place of the law itself.

      As Seventh-day Adventists, what rules, traditions, and customs
      do we have that we believe help us to live more faithfully and
      obediently to the law? Write them down and bring them to class
      on Sabbath, asking questions about the role that they play in the
      life of your faith community.

      Traditions of the Elders
         As we saw, some of the rabbis paid so much attention to the rules and
      traditions created to assist in the keeping of the law of Moses that they
      failed to distinguish between the two. After a while, the words of the
      rabbis gained canonical status; people thought they were as binding as
      Scripture. In all probability, when the rabbis originally wrote their com-
      mentaries, they had no intention of adding to the pages of Scripture.
      However, their devoted disciples probably saw it as their duty to share
      these unique interpretations with the general populace.

Read again Matthew 15:1, 2. The tradition is based on what text in the
      first five books of Moses? What is the significance of your answer?
      See also Mark 7:3, 4 and Matt. 15:11.

         One is hard pressed to find a biblical text that commands, “Thou
      shalt wash thy hands before thou eatest.” However, this injunction
      would not have surprised the scribes and Pharisees as they confronted
      Jesus, for they made it clear that the disciples were not in violation of
      Mosaic law but the “tradition of the elders.” The intensity with which
      they asked the question makes it seem that, for the Pharisees, this was
      a serious religious violation.
         Health professionals and parents would probably like to provide a
      hygienic or psychological rationale for the Pharisees’ apparent obses-
      sive compulsion with hand washing. However, scholars believe that
      the issue was really about ceremonial uncleanliness. Apparently, the
      Pharisees were concerned that as people went about their daily business
      they would touch items that had been defiled. Consequently, if they ate
      without washing, they would contaminate themselves ceremonially by
      touching the food.
         Given the fact that they levied their charge against Jesus’ disciples,
      we might conclude that Jesus Himself was not in violation of the well-
      known tradition (Mark 7:3). Nonetheless, He was well aware that the
      Pharisees were majoring in minors.

       Read Isaiah 29:13. What crucial biblical principles are revealed
       here? Why are they so important for us to remember?

     The Precepts of Men
       “The substitution of the precepts of men for the commandments of
     God has not ceased. Even among Christians are found institutions and
     usages that have no better foundation than the traditions of the fathers.
     Such institutions, resting upon mere human authority, have supplanted
     those of divine appointment. Men cling to their traditions, and revere
     their customs, and cherish hatred against those who seek to show them
     their error. . . . In place of the authority of the so-called fathers of the
     church, God bids us accept the word of the eternal Father, the Lord of
     heaven and earth.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 398.

Read Matthew 15:3–6 but in the context of Exodus 20:12, Deuteron-
     omy 5:16, Matthew 19:19, and Ephesians 6:2. What two serious
     charges does Jesus make against the Pharisees?

     _________________________________________________________

        When the Pharisees confronted Jesus about the hand-washing inci-
     dent, they expected Him to respond directly to their charge. However,
     in His unique style, Jesus confronted them with a question that got to
     the real heart of the issue. Jesus wanted them to know that the problem
     was not about hand washing or tithe paying but about the elevation of
     human standards over divine standards. The Pharisees could provide a
     logical explanation for their stance on hand washing. Undoubtedly, they
     probably also reasoned that their channeling of resources to the cause
     of God rather than to their parents was an expression of their unparal-
     leled love for God.
        Although the Pharisees may have had logical motives for their
     actions, God does not expect humans to love Him on their own terms.
     It was good that they were concerned about discipline and holy living,
     but that concern should never eclipse the will of God. The Pharisees
     should have recalled that the 613 laws recorded in the law of Moses
     were harmonious and not contradictory. None of the laws sought to
     supplant another. However, their insistence in following the “tradition
     of the elders” invalidated the Word of God (Matt. 15:6), at least as far
     as they themselves were concerned. No doubt, seeing themselves as
     the protectors of the law, they must have been shocked, even scandal-
     ized, by the claim that they were actually violating it, even making it
     of “none effect” by the very traditions that they thought were helping
     people to keep the law better!

     Excessive Righteousness (Matt. 5:20)
Read Matthew 5:17–20. In the context of this week’s lesson, what are
     some of the ways that Jesus’ admonition in Matthew 5:20 could be
     understood? See also Rom. 10:3.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        If read in isolation, Matthew 5:20 could be seen as an invitation to
     out-Pharisee the Pharisees; that is, do what they do, only do it more.
        But is this what Jesus is saying? Fortunately, the answer to that ques-
     tion is within our reach. Yesterday’s lesson pointed out that it was not
     unusual for the scribes and Pharisees to elevate traditional laws over the
     law of God. Jesus had to tell them that their actions in effect invalidated
     the plain Word of God. Sunday’s study also mentioned that, although
     the scribes and Pharisees probably had good content in their teaching,
     many of them lived hypocritical lives.
        Given this background, it is not hard to see the true sentiment behind
     Jesus’ statement. He very well could have been referring to that which
     He had elsewhere warned about: “ ‘Anyone who breaks one of the
     least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will
     be called least in the kingdom of heaven’ ” (Matt. 5:19, NIV). The
     Pharisees were so focused on the laws of human origin that they bla-
     tantly broke the law of God. Their righteousness was based on their
     own efforts and, as such, was defective. Isaiah had long declared that
     human righteousness is nothing but filthy rags (Isa. 64:6).
        The kind of righteousness that Jesus promotes is one that starts in
     the heart. In the hand-washing incident, Jesus pointed to the Pharisees’
     error by quoting from Isaiah 29:13: “ ‘These people . . . honor me with
     their lips, but their hearts are far from me’ ” (NIV). The righteousness
     that God seeks goes deeper than visible action.
        Jesus calls for a righteousness that exceeds what the Pharisees them-
     selves thought that they possessed. The righteousness that counts is
     not obtained by checking off every item on a task list; it can be gained
     only by faith in Jesus Christ and by claiming His righteousness for
     ourselves. It is a righteousness that comes from a complete surrender
     of self and a passionate realization that we need Jesus as our Substitute
     and Example.

      Read Romans 10:3. How does this text help us to see what true
      righteousness is all about?

                                                                            27

Further Study: For more information on this week’s topic, read Ellen
     G. White, “Tradition,” pp. 395–398; “Woes on the Pharisees,”
     pp. 610–620, in The Desire of Ages. Also read Matthew 23.

        “Let all who accept human authority, the customs of the church, or
     the traditions of the fathers, take heed to the warning conveyed in the
     words of Christ, ‘In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines
     the commandments of men.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
     p. 398.

Discussion Questions:
       What are some of the traditions that we as Seventh-day
      Adventists follow? Why is it important to recognize them as such?
      Why are traditions important, and what role do they have in the
      life of our community? Which ones have universal significance,
      and which ones are based on local and cultural factors?

       “Believers have not infrequently allowed the enemy to work
      through them at the very time when they should have been
      wholly consecrated to God and to the advancement of His work.
      Unconsciously they have wandered far from the way of righteous-
      ness. Cherishing a spirit of criticism and faultfinding, of phari-
      saical piety and pride, they have grieved away the Spirit of God
      and have greatly retarded the work of God’s messengers.”—Ellen
      G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 125. How does one
      “unconsciously” wander far from the way of righteousness? What
      steps can a person take to avoid getting trapped in a self-righteous
      rut?

       Reflect on the order of the divine worship service in your
      church. Why does your church have that particular order? What
      is the meaning of each item in the service (for example, invocation,
      doxology, pastoral prayer, and so on)? What lessons can you learn
      from the church service that help to reveal just how much tradi-
      tion is interwoven in our faith? At the same time we need to ask:
      just because it’s tradition, and nothing else, is it bad?

                                                    Story
Making a Difference
   When I was a child, my family lived near the Seventh-day Adventist
church in our town in northern Namibia. Mother took us to church,
though we weren’t Adventists. I liked church. On Sabbath afternoon, we’d
go to Himba villages to sing and talk to them about God. Then when I
was eight years old, we moved away, and I couldn’t go to church anymore.
   As I grew up, I began bullying other kids at school. I knew it was
wrong, but I enjoyed the power. My parents kept me busy selling things
in the market so I would stay out of trouble. One Saturday, I slipped away
from work to play soccer. I saw the Adventist church near the field and
watched the children walking to church. They were dressed nicely and
seemed so happy. I wished I could be more like those children.
   I left the soccer field and walked to the church. I recognized a few
of the kids who went to my school. I expected these kids to treat me
badly, but they didn’t. They welcomed me into their group. When church
started, they invited me to join them. I was embarrassed. My clothes were
old, and I didn’t have shoes. But no one cared.
   During church one of the leaders announced that the new Pathfinder
Club needed more members. I didn’t know what Pathfinders was, but it
sounded like fun, so I asked to join. The leader invited me to the meeting
that same afternoon.
   I told my mother that I had attended church and wanted to go back.
She nodded. In time I took my younger sisters with me. Then I invited my
cousin. She started attending Pathfinders and eventually came to church.
   I gave my life to God. Mother sees how God is changing me, and she’s
glad. Others have noticed too. I no longer bully people. God has shown
me how the kids I had bullied felt when I treated them badly. Now I try
to be kind to others and encourage other kids.
   God has given me a great job! I help record and edit Bible stories for
                             the Himba people, most of whom can’t read.
                             I’m happy that God is letting me make a dif-
                             ference in other people’s lives. My mother is
                             Himba, and I want to help teach the Himba
                             that Jesus loves them and wants them to live
                             with Him forever.
                                A recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is
                             helping us to record more stories to reach
                             the Himba in a way they can understand and
                             respond 10. Thank you!

      Christ and the Law in the
      Sermon on the Mount




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 5:17–20, Luke 16:16,
      Matt. 5:21–32, Rom. 7:24, Matt. 5:33–37, 5:38–48.

Memory Text: “ ‘Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or
      the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I
      say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot, or one tittle will
      by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled’ ” (Matthew 5:17,
      18, NKJV).



      W
                 hen most people think about the Sermon on the Mount,
                 they automatically think of “the Beatitudes” (Matt. 5:1–12).
                 However, the Sermon on the Mount actually covers three
      chapters that have been divided into four sections. The Beatitudes com-
      prise only the first section. In the second, Jesus compares Christians to
      light and salt (Matt. 5:13–16). The third, Matthew 5:17–48, is where
      Jesus gives us a new and deeper perspective on the law. And then there
      is the final and longest section, Matthew 6:1–7:23, in which Jesus pro-
      vides clear teaching on Christian behavior. The whole talk ends with
      the parable of the wise and foolish builders (Matt. 7:24–27), which
      stresses the importance of obedience to what God calls us to do.
         This week we will investigate the third section, Matthew 5:17–48
      (which theologians call the antitheses, cases in which sharp contrasts
      are presented), to see what it teaches us about the law.

     “One Jot or Tittle”
Read again Matthew 5:17–20. How interesting that Jesus would greatly
     emphasize the law here, while at the same time making the state-
     ment that He did about the scribes and Pharisees, who so greatly
     emphasized the law, as well. What important lesson does this pas-
     sage teach about true obedience to the law?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Jesus begins this section with the assurance that He has not come to
     abolish “the Law or the Prophets” (Matt. 5:17, NKJV). Although there
     is no reference to it, many see this as a formulaic expression for the
     entire Old Testament (see also Matt. 7:12, 11:13, 22:40, Luke 16:16,
     Acts 13:15, 24:14, Rom. 3:21). In spite of what His opponents claimed,
     Jesus did not attack the very book that revealed the will of His Father.
     Instead, His purpose was to “fulfill” the law and the prophets, not to
     do away with them.
        The word used for “fulfill” (plero) literally means to “fill up,” or
     “complete.” It carries the sense of “filling to the brim.” There are two
     ways to understand fulfill. One is to place the emphasis on Jesus as
     being the fulfillment of Scripture (for example, Luke 24:25–27, John
     5:39). However, key to understanding this text is the immediate con-
     text, which shows that Jesus did not come to destroy Scripture but to
     reveal its inner essence.
        Having established His overall intent, Jesus switched emphasis from
     the Old Testament in general to the law in particular. Almost as if He
     knew that people would one day accuse Him of abolishing the law, He
     cautions that as long as heaven and earth remain, the law will exist until
     everything “is accomplished” (Matt. 5:18, NIV). With this statement,
     Jesus confirms the perpetuity of the law.
        In fact, the law is so important that all those who violate its precepts
     will be called “the least in the kingdom.” This is just a way of saying
     that they are wrong in what they are doing. Jesus is quick to point out
     that He is not promoting the empty righteousness of the scribes and
     Pharisees but instead a righteousness springing from a heart that loves
     God and seeks to do His will.


                                                                            31
              M onday April 21

     Murder (Matt. 5:21–26)
        After He clarified His intention to uphold the law, Jesus started to
     explain a righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees.
     He begins by citing the sixth commandment (Exod. 20:13) and summa-
     rizing, from the law of Moses, the penalty for violation (Exod. 21:12,
     Lev. 24:17).
        The sixth commandment does not include all cases in which one
     person kills another. In cases of manslaughter, a person could flee to a
     city of refuge and gain temporary asylum (Exod. 21:13, Num. 35:12).
     However, one who intentionally took another’s life would receive swift
     judgment. In His explanation, Jesus does not focus on the act itself but
     on the motive and intents of the one who commits the act. One might
     take a life accidentally, but the person who purposes to take a life has
     gone through a period of deliberation. The sin took place before the
     person even carried out the terrible deed. Many potential murderers are
     stopped only by a lack of opportunity.

Read Matthew 5:22. What does Jesus equate to murder? How does
     1 John 3:15 help to emphasize the point? What is the real issue here
     that Jesus is pointing to, and what does this tell us about the real
     reach of God’s law?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Though the Bible often talks about the power of words, Jesus here
     takes it to a deeper level. Often, the sole purpose of harsh words or
     cursing is to evoke negative feelings in the victim. Jesus’ point is
     crystal clear. It’s not just those who carry through with the crime who
     are guilty of murder but also those who speak harsh words to others or
     who even harbor murderous thoughts. Jesus counsels those harboring
     these thoughts to reconcile with their victims before coming to the altar
     (Matt. 5:23–26).

      Dwell on the implication of Jesus’ words in the texts for today.
      How well have you done in this regard? What does such a high
      standard tell you about the need to be covered by Christ’s righ-
      teousness at all times?

     Adultery (Matt. 5:27–32)
        Jesus’ next example involves commandments concerning adultery.
     He first cites the seventh commandment, You shall not commit adultery.
     In the context of the law of Moses, adultery took place when a married
     person was sexually involved with someone other than a spouse. The
     law was very clear that both parties found guilty of adultery should be
     put to death. As with the sixth commandment, Jesus gave the deeper
     implications of this particular commandment.
        Adultery often starts long before the acts are committed. In the same
     way that murder starts with the intention to inflict permanent harm on
     an individual, adultery begins at the very moment when an individual
     lustfully desires another person, married or single, to whom he or she
     is not married.

Read Matthew 5:29, 30. How much more forceful could Jesus be in
     describing the danger of sin? After looking at these texts, read
     Romans 7:24. What important truths are found here?
     _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Here, too, Jesus provides an instant remedy for those sins that have
     been exposed. The solution is not to follow through with the sin but to
     have a conversion of the heart. With strong metaphors, Jesus counsels
     the one who has the problem to do what is necessary if he or she wishes
     to enter the kingdom. This may mean taking a different route to work or
     terminating a cherished friendship, but eternal gain far outweighs the
     passions of the moment.
        As we saw before, Moses permitted divorce even though he knew
     it was not a part of God’s original plan. After addressing married men
     with roaming eyes and admonishing them to control their impulses,
     Jesus encourages lifelong marriage fidelity.

      “The surrender of the will is represented as plucking out the eye
      or cutting off the hand. Often it seems to us that to surrender the
      will to God is to consent to go through life maimed or crippled.
      But it is better, says Christ, for self to be maimed, wounded, crip-
      pled, if thus you may enter into life. That which you look upon as
      disaster is the door to highest benefit.”—Ellen G. White, Thoughts
      From the Mount of Blessing, p. 61. What implication might these
      words have for you?
                                                                         33

     Promises, Promises . . . (Matt. 5:33–37)
       The first two antitheses (murder and adultery) are based on the
     Decalogue. The antithesis regarding divorce and the ones that follow
     are taken from other sections of the Mosaic law, including the one
     about swearing falsely and performing oaths to the Lord.

Read Leviticus 19:11–13. What specific points do we find here? See
     also Exod. 20:7.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The Mosaic law, from which Jesus quotes, is listed in a section of
     Leviticus that condemns a number of deceptive practices. Here again
     it is evident that Jesus’ concern is with the intentions. Anyone who
     makes a promise with no intention of fulfilling it has made a conscious
     decision to sin.
        Though the command against swearing falsely relates to promises
     made to other people, the second command concerns promises made
     to God.

Read Deuteronomy 23:21–23. In what way do these verses relate to
     Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:33–37? See also Acts 5:1–11.
     _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

       Unlike the person guilty of false swearing, the one who makes
     a financial pledge to God is not necessarily intending to defraud.
     However, Jesus knows human nature and cautions against making
     promises that one may later regret. Rather than making promises that
     may not even be in the power of the individual to fulfill, a Christian
     should be a person of integrity whose “yes” means “yes” and “no”
     means “no.”

      Think about a time that you made a promise (either to a person
      or to God) that you intended to keep but ultimately didn’t. How
      can you learn to be careful about this problem? What about
      promises to yourself that you have reneged on?

Lex Talionis (Matt. 5:38–48)
   It appears that the common theme here (Matt. 5:38–48) is revenge.
This theme concerns the many commandments in the Mosaic law
that are built on the principle of repaying a crime with an equal
punishment, an idea called lex talionis, a Latin term meaning “law
of retaliation.”
   As we see in a number of passages (Exod. 21:22–25, Lev. 24:17–21,
Deut. 19:21), the law called for the offender to suffer the same expe-
rience as the victim. If the victim lost an eye, arm, foot, or life, the
offender must also. This “law of retaliation” was common among a
number of ancient civilizations. Why not, since it seems to reveal a
simple principle of justice?
   It’s important to realize that this principle is there to limit retaliation;
that is, to keep people from extracting more from a wrong done to them
than they are rightfully entitled to extract. Thus, in many ways, this law
was to ensure that justice was not perverted.
   Therefore, in Matthew 5:38–42 Jesus was not necessarily attacking
the legitimacy of a law that demanded a person to be punished for a
crime. Instead, Jesus focused on the Christians’ response to people
who try to take advantage of them. Rather than seeking opportunities
for revenge, Christians should “retaliate” with kindness, something
that we can do only through the grace of God working within us. In
this appeal, Jesus has taken us to a deeper level in our understanding
of what it means to be a follower of the Lord.
   The final antithesis addresses the attitude that promotes love for
friends and hatred for enemies. The command to love your neighbor is
found in Leviticus 19:18. There is no explicit text that calls for hatred
of enemies, even despite Deuteronomy 23:3–6.
   In the context of Jesus’ world, the Jews were under foreign occupa-
tion by the Roman oppressive power and were second-class citizens in
their own land. Given their oppression, they probably felt justified in
hating their enemy, who at times severely oppressed them. Jesus was
showing them a better way to live, even under less-than-ideal circum-
stances.

 Read Matthew 5:44, 45. What is Jesus saying to us here? More
 important, in what way can you apply this teaching in your own
 life with someone who has done you wrong?

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “The Sermon on the Mount,”
     pp. 298–314, in The Desire of Ages.

        “Jesus takes up the commandments separately, and explains the
     depth and breadth of their requirement. Instead of removing one jot of
     their force, He shows how far reaching their principles are, and exposes
     the fatal mistake of the Jews in their outward show of obedience. He
     declares that by the evil thought or the lustful look the law of God is
     transgressed. One who becomes a party to the least injustice is breaking
     the law and degrading his own moral nature. Murder first exists in the
     mind. He who gives hatred a place in his heart is setting his feet in the
     path of the murderer, and his offerings are abhorrent to God.”—Ellen
     G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 310.
        Love is the binding principle in God’s law. In each of the antitheses,
     Jesus elevates the principle of love: love keeps a person from harboring
     hatred toward her sister; love keeps a husband and wife together; love
     challenges the Christian to be always honest in his dealings with others
     and God; love allows a person to react in kindness when he has been
     wronged; and love empowers the individual to treat the enemy as he
     himself would like to be treated.

Discussion Questions:
       In this week’s section, Jesus said, “You have heard it has been
      said by them of old,” and then later said, “but I say unto you,” and
      then gave the antitheses. Notice that some of the sayings “of old”
      were direct quotes from the Bible or taken from Old Testament
      teachings. Thus, the problem was not with the references but with
      how they had been interpreted. What lesson can we take from
      this regarding, if not our doctrines, the way in which we interpret
      them? How might we be in danger of looking at things too super-
      ficially and missing the deeper meaning?

       Many fall into the trap of interpreting texts in isolation from
      other texts. One such text is Matthew 5:48, where we are told to be
      as perfect as our Father in heaven. How does the interpretation of
      this text in its immediate context (Matt. 5:43–48) demonstrate the
      importance of careful Bible study? How would you respond to a
      person who claimed that this text was teaching sinlessness? What
      is the text really teaching, and why does this teaching reveal the
      true meaning of being a follower of Jesus?

       How do the texts we studied, particularly about murder and
      adultery, help to show how wrong those are who claim the law was
      abolished after the Cross?

                                                    Story
Patricia’s Prayer
   Patricia lives in central Cameroon. She’s a lot like other girls. She likes
to jump rope and talk with her friends. But in some ways Patricia is dif-
ferent from other children. She has HIV and often feels sick. Two years
ago, Patricia’s mother died of AIDS, and Patricia and her sister went to
live with their grandmother. Her father couldn’t pay the girls’ tuition at
the Seventh-day Adventist school they had been attending, so he sent
them to the public school near their home.
   But the children in the public school shunned Patricia because of her
illness. The girl begged her father to let her return to the Adventist school.
“The teachers and children in the Adventist school don’t tease me,” she
said. “They pray for me. They help me if I don’t feel well or need help.
Please, please, let me go to the Adventist school.”
   Finally, Patricia’s father allowed her to return to the Adventist school.
“I love my school,” she says. “When I’m feeling well, I’m just one of
the children in my class. And when I’m not well, the teachers and the
children help me.”
   Patricia’s father can’t always pay her tuition. So Patricia prays that God
will make a way for her to remain in school.
   Patricia enjoys attending Sabbath School, too. She likes the Bible sto-
ries the most. “My favorite story is about Moses,” she says. “When he
was born he was hidden in a basket and found by the pharaoh’s daughter.
God saved him from death because his mother prayed for him.
   “God loved Moses very much,” Patricia says with a smile. “He gave
Moses a special work to do. I know that God loves me, and He has some-
thing special for me to do, too. God can use me to help people come to
Jesus. I don’t know how He will do that, but I know He will.”
   Patricia wants others to know that even if they have problems in life—
whether they are poor or sick or have no money—God is with them
                              and will help them. “Trust God and worship
                              Him,” she says. “Whatever you do, do it for
                              Jesus. That way others will know that Jesus
                              lives in your heart.”
                                 Patricia knows that God didn’t make her
                              sick, but He can use her sickness to help other
                              people learn about His love. She learned that
                              at the little Adventist school in a village in
                              Cameroon.

Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 2:1–3, Heb. 1:1–3, Acts
      13:14, Mark 2:23–28, John 5:1–9, Isa. 65:17.

Memory Text: “ ‘The Sabbath was made for man, and not man
      for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the
      Sabbath’ ” (Mark 2:27, 28, NKJV).



      T
             he vast majority of Christian denominations observe Sunday as
             the day of “rest” and worship (even though the vast majority of
             Sunday keepers don’t really rest on Sunday). Sunday “keeping”
      is so prevalent among modern Christians that many believe the day to
      be the “Christian Sabbath.”
         This was not always the case. On the contrary, as a continuation of
      the Israelite faith, Christianity did not discard all of the symbols of its
      parent religion, including the seventh-day Sabbath. For a time, the only
      Bible that early Christians had to guide them was the Old Testament.
      No wonder, then, that the issue of an alternative day of worship was
      not introduced into Christianity until more than a century after Christ
      ascended to heaven. Furthermore, it was not until the fourth century,
      with the edict of Constantine, that Sunday observance became the
      policy of the dominant church. Unfortunately, even after the Protestant
      Reformation, almost all Christianity has adhered to keeping Sunday,
      despite the Bible teaching that the seventh day remains the true Sabbath.
         This week’s lesson will cover Christ and the Sabbath.

     The Jewish Sabbath? (Exod. 20:8–11)
       Although many refer to the seventh day as the “Jewish Sabbath,” the
     Bible reveals that the Sabbath predates the Jews by many centuries. Its
     roots go back to the Creation itself.
       Genesis 2:1–3 declares that after God had completed His acts of
     creation in six days, He rested on the seventh day and then “blessed
     the seventh day and made it holy” (NIV). This clearly shows the high
     place of the Sabbath in God’s creation. In addition to the blessing, the
     Sabbath was also “made holy.” In other words, God applied some of His
     own qualities to this monument in time.

Compare the two Sabbath commandments in Exodus 20:8–11 and
     Deuteronomy 5:12–15. In what ways do these relate to the theory
     that the Sabbath is not only for Jews?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The most notable difference between the two commandments is the
     rationale for Sabbath observance. Exodus makes a direct reference to
     Genesis 2:3 as it elevates the fact that God both “blessed” and “made
     holy” the Sabbath day. On the other hand, Deuteronomy 5:15 points to
     Israel’s divine deliverance from Egyptian bondage as being a rationale
     for Sabbath keeping. On the basis of the Deuteronomy text, many
     believe the Sabbath is only for the Jews. However, this argument totally
     ignores the fact that the Exodus text points to the Creation, when God
     established Sabbath for all humanity.
        Furthermore, the Deuteronomy 5:15 reference to deliverance from
     Egypt is symbolic of the salvation we have in Christ. Hence, the
     Sabbath is a symbol not only of Creation but also of Redemption, two
     themes that are linked with each other in the Bible (Heb. 1:1–3, Col.
     1:13–20, John 1:1–14). Only by the fact that Jesus is our Creator could
     He also be our Redeemer, and the seventh-day Sabbath is a symbol of
     His work as both.

      Anyone can claim to be resting in Christ. In your own experience,
      how does keeping the seventh-day Sabbath help you to find that
      rest?

     A Time for Rest and Worship (Luke 4:16)
        According to Colossians 1:16 and Hebrews 1:2, the preincarnate
     Christ was directly involved in the creation process. These texts declare
     that all created things came into existence through Him. Paul further
     expresses that Christ had a part in creating “invisible” things (Col. 1:16,
     17), which would, of course, include the Sabbath. Although Christ was
     central in the creative process, when He was transformed into human
     flesh, He subjected Himself to His Father’s commandments (John
     15:10). As earlier lessons showed, Jesus was opposed to certain tradi-
     tions and used every opportunity to correct religious behavior that was
     not grounded in the will of God. If Jesus had intended to abolish the
     Sabbath commandment, He had plenty of opportunities to do just that.
        Most of the Sabbath texts in the Old Testament speak of the Sabbath
     as a day of rest. The understanding of “rest” in many modern languages
     may lead some to believe that the Sabbath should be spent sleeping and
     generally relaxing. While we can definitely enjoy these activities on the
     Sabbath, the true meaning of rest is “cessation,” “stop,” or “pause.” The
     Sabbath is a time when we can take a break from the routine labor of
     the first six days and spend special time with the Creator.
        By the time of Christ, the Jews were holding a weekly divine worship
     service on the Sabbath (see Luke 4:16). Those who lived in Jerusalem
     would attend special prayer services in the temple, where the liturgy
     was different from what it was on the other days of the week. Jews who
     lived in other parts of the world developed the synagogue as a place of
     social gathering and worship. On Sabbaths, as long as a minimum of
     ten males was present (a minyan), a divine worship service could take
     place.

What do the following texts inform us about Sabbath keeping among
     the earliest Christians? What does this tell us about those who
     claim the Sabbath was changed to Sunday in honor of the resurrec-
     tion? Acts 13:14, 42, 44; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4; Heb. 4:9.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Given their Jewish roots, it was only natural for early Christians to
     worship on the day prescribed in the Old Testament. Yet, almost twenty
     years after the ascension of Jesus, it was still Paul’s “custom” to attend
     a synagogue on the Sabbath (Acts 17:2). Thus, no biblical evidence
     shows that the first Christians kept Sunday instead of Sabbath.

     A Time for Enjoyment (Mark 2:27, 28)
       Many who claim to keep the Sabbath do not always understand what
     Sabbath keeping entails. As did some of the Pharisees in Jesus’ time,
     people even today have imprisoned the Sabbath behind rigid walls of
     rules and regulations (while others have almost made it a day no dif-
     ferent than any other). The Sabbath is supposed to be a delight, not a
     burden, but it is still a day to be kept holy.
       During the time when Jesus walked this earth, some of the religious
     leaders had surrounded the Sabbath with 39 other commandments.
     They reasoned that if people could keep the 39 laws, then the Sabbath
     would be perfectly kept. As a result of this well-­intentioned law-making,
     the Sabbath—which was intended to be a joy—did, indeed, become a
     yoke to many.

Carefully read Mark 2:23–28. Why did the disciples pluck grain?
     Does the text indicate that Jesus participated with the disciples?
     What biblical laws were being violated, if any?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       As Jesus and His hungry disciples walked through a field one
     Sabbath, the disciples decided to satisfy their hunger by plucking grain.
     Although it was not their field, their actions were permissible under the
     law of Moses (see Deut. 23:25), even if the Pharisees interpreted it as
     a violation of another Mosaic law that forbade plowing and harvesting
     on the Sabbath (see Exod. 34:21). Apparently, Jesus did not partake of
     the grain; nonetheless, He took the time to defend the disciples’ actions.
     Jesus reminded the Pharisees that even David and his men had eaten the
     “forbidden” sanctuary bread when hungry.
       In Mark 2:27, 28, Jesus said that the Sabbath was made for the
     benefit of humans, not vice versa. In other words, the Sabbath was not
     made to be worshiped, but rather to provide opportunities for worship.
     As God’s gift to all humans, the Sabbath is not meant to oppress but to
     provide release and liberation. It is truly a way to experience our rest
     and freedom in Christ.

      What are some things that you can do on the Sabbath that you
      can’t so easily do other days of the week? Think through this
      question, and bring your answers to class on Sabbath.

     A Time for Healing                    (Luke 13:16)

       When God created the world, He pronounced that everything was
     “very good” (Gen. 1:31), no doubt perfect in every way. However, with
     the advent of sin, the creation has been corrupted with evil, an impact
     seen everywhere. Humans, though created in the image of God, became
     subject to sickness, deterioration, and death. We often say that death is
     part of life; death, though, is the negation of life, not part of it. Death
     was never meant to be something that we experience.
       Given God’s original plan for humanity, it is no surprise that some
     of Jesus’ most dramatic healing miracles took place on the Sabbath.

Review the Sabbath-healing stories in Mark 3:1–6, Luke 13:10–17,
     John 5:1–9, 9:1–14. What lessons do these miracles teach about the
     true purpose of the Sabbath?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Each of the Sabbath-healing miracles is spectacular and serves to
     demonstrate the true meaning of Sabbath. Before Jesus healed the man
     with the withered hand (Mark 3:1–6), He asked the rhetorical question,
     “ ‘Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or
     to kill?’ ” (Mark 3:4, NKJV). If a person has an opportunity to relieve
     suffering on the day of liberation, why shouldn’t he do it? In fact, the
     miracle with the woman who had a bent back powerfully demonstrates
     the liberating purpose of the Sabbath (Luke 13:10–17). When criticized
     for the healing, Jesus asked, “ ‘Then should not this woman, a daughter
     of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be
     set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?’ ” (Luke 13:16, NIV).
        The theme of liberation is also present in the accounts of the healing
     of the man by the pool of Bethesda, who had been sick for thirty-eight
     years (John 5:1–9), and the healing of the man born blind (John 9:
     1–14). In response to the Pharisees’ charge that Jesus broke the Sabbath
     with His healing miracles, He reminded them, “ ‘My Father is always
     at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working’ ” (John 5:17, NIV).
     If God did not allow the healing, it would not have happened. When it
     comes to relieving human misery, God does not rest.

      What should we learn from the mistakes of these religious lead-
      ers about how preconceived notions can so blind us to even the
      most obvious of truths?

     A New Creation
       Sabbath not only reminds us of God’s creative ability, but it points to
     His restorative promises. Indeed, with every healing of a person on the
     Sabbath, the promise of eternal restoration was powerfully reinforced.
     In its own unique way, the Sabbath provides a view that reaches back
     to earth’s earliest history and stretches forward to humanity’s eventual
     destiny. Again, we can say that the Sabbath points both to Creation and to
     Redemption.
       God created this world once already. Due to sin, however, His creation
     has been defiled, but this defiling will not last forever. A key element of
     the plan of salvation is restoration—not just of the earth but, even more
     important, of people, beings made in His image who will be restored to
     that image and who will live on the new earth. The same God who made
     the first earth, whose work we celebrate every seventh day, will create the
     earth again. (Think about how important remembering our creation must
     be that we are commanded to do it once a week in a special way.)

Read the following texts. What message does each one have that can be
      linked to the meaning of the Sabbath?

      The Sabbath “declares that He who created all things in heaven and in

      and that by His power we are reconciled to God. . . . The Sabbath is
      a sign of Christ’s power to make us holy. And it is given to all whom
      Christ makes holy. As a sign of His sanctifying power, the Sabbath is
      given to all who through Christ become a part of the Israel of God.”

Further Study: “From the very beginning of the great controversy
     in heaven it has been Satan’s purpose to overthrow the law of God. It
     was to accomplish this that he entered upon his rebellion against the
     Creator, and though he was cast out of heaven he has continued the
     same warfare upon the earth. To deceive men, and thus lead them to
     transgress God’s law, is the object which he has steadfastly pursued.
     Whether this be accomplished by casting aside the law altogether, or
     by rejecting one of its precepts, the result will be ultimately the same.
     He that offends ‘in one point,’ manifests contempt for the whole law;
     his influence and example are on the side of transgression; he becomes
     ‘guilty of all.’ James 2:10.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy,
     p. 582.

Discussion Questions:
       Look at the Ellen G. White statement in Friday’s study, a fuller
      rendition of the reference used in the introduction to this quarter.
      How does the Sabbath and what has happened to the Sabbath in
      Christendom help us to understand Satan’s attack on the law of
      God?

       In the following texts (Mark 3:2, Luke 13:14, John 5:18, 9:16)
      Jesus is charged with breaking the Sabbath. Review Exodus
      20:8–11 and evaluate the merit of this charge. What do you say to
      those who claim that these passages provide evidence that Jesus
      broke the Sabbath?

       In class go over your answer to the final question at the end of
      Tuesday’s lesson. That is, what are some things that the Sabbath
      frees you up to do that on other days of the week you might not be
      able to do because of worldly obligations?

       Review your own Sabbath experience. Is the Sabbath for you a
      day of liberation, rest, and freedom or a day of foreboding, bond-
      age, and stress? How can you learn to enjoy the Sabbath, to make
      it a delight, as we are told to do in this verse: “If thou turn away
      thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day;
      and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable;
      and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine
      own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words” (Isa. 58:13)?

Sharing the News
   I’ve done a lot of things I’m not proud of. Although my mother didn’t
attend any particular church, she prayed for me. And because of her
prayers, God took hold of my life. I was in the army when I first felt God’s
presence leading me. I began visiting churches, from large, influential
ones to some pretty strange ones.
   One day as I walked down the street in the capital city of Bulgaria, I
saw a sign for a church I had never heard of. I felt the Lord pointing me to
it, so I stepped inside and sat down to listen to the pastor’s sermon. It was
a Seventh-day Adventist church. The members’ warm welcome touched
my heart. After the service, I went searching for a Bible.
   I attended the Adventist church occasionally, but I still drank and
visited discos. One day while drunk, I broke into a car and was arrested.
I realized that drinking would lead me to prison—or worse—so I quit.
   I asked the Adventist pastor to study the Bible with me, and a year later
I was baptized.
   One day two members of the church invited me to visit a man they
knew. I learned that this man, Simon, was a former leader in the Mafia.
He was an alcoholic and was paralyzed. The men introduced me as a
friend of theirs and a former alcoholic. Simon perked up and started
asking me pointed questions such as how God led me to Himself and the
Adventist Church and how He saved me from alcoholism. Before I left,
I gave him a couple of small books to read.
   Two weeks later, I visited Simon again, this time alone. Simon had
read the two books I had given him and had started reading the Bible. He
asked me question after question and wouldn’t let me go. I suggested that
we study the Bible together.
   It wasn’t logical, but I started with Daniel 2. I learned that Simon knew
a lot about world history and the countries of the prophecies included in
Daniel. He was excited by the study and later told me that he had studied
                              my notes and his history books until two-thirty
                              in the morning. “And it all fits!” he said, amazed.
                                 Simon stopped drinking and smoking and
                              is recovering from his paralysis. Now he no
                              longer needs his wheelchair. He has given his
                              life to Jesus and is looking forward to baptism.
                                 I thank God for my mother’s prayers and for
                              God, who saw potential in an alcoholic whose
                              life was going nowhere. And thank you for giv-
                              ing to mission so that others in this world can
                              know that our wonderful Savior loves them.

      Christ’s Death and the Law




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 7:1–6; 8:5–8; Rom.
      7:7–13; Rom. 4:15; Acts 13:38, 39; Gal. 3:10.

Memory Text: “In the same way, my friends, you have died to the
      law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another,
      to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear
      fruit for God” (Romans 7:4, NRSV).



      A
               woman is driving way over the speed limit. Suddenly, she sees
               in her rearview mirror the flashing red and blue lights of a
               police car and hears the familiar wail of the siren. She pulls
      over, grabs her purse, and takes out her driver’s license. The police
      officer approaches, takes her license, and returns to his car.
         She wonders how much the ticket is going to be (she was way over
      the limit); she also worries about how she will be able to pay it. A few
      minutes later the police officer comes back and says, “OK, miss, what
      we are going to do, so that you don’t have to face the penalty of the
      law again, is abolish the law. You no longer have to worry about the
      speed limit.”
         As ludicrous as that story is, it’s no more so than the theology that
      teaches that after Jesus died, the law, the Ten Commandments, was
      abolished.
         This week we’ll look at the death of Jesus and what it means in rela-
      tion to the law.

     Dead to the Law (Rom. 7:1–6)
Carefully examine Romans 7:1–6 and summarize as well as you can
     what Paul is saying. Read it carefully, keeping in mind other Bible
     passages about the law.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Although some Bible versions incorrectly translate verse one to read
     that the law is binding until death, a literal interpretation is: “every liv-
     ing person is under the rule of law.” The emphasis is not on the dead
     but on the living.
       The example from marriage demonstrates that any married person
     who has an intimate relationship with someone other than his or her
     spouse has broken the law and is guilty of adultery. Only if his or her
     spouse dies can he or she enter a relationship with another person with-
     out violating the law.
       Also, some argue that this passage shows the death of the law;
     however, it really shows a person’s death to the law through the
     body of Christ (Rom. 7:4). According to Romans 6:6, the part of
     the person that dies is “the old self.” When united to the old self,
     the person is condemned by the law and thus trapped in a miserable
     relationship (Rom. 7:9–11, 24). After the old self dies, the person is
     free to enter into a relationship with another—the resurrected Christ
     (Rom. 7:4).
       What Paul is saying is that because law binds every living person,
     God’s law must also govern the new union. However, the fact that the
     believer is now married to Christ means that the law is no longer an
     instrument of condemnation; the believer in Jesus is free from the con-
     demnation of the law because he or she is covered in the righteousness
     of Jesus.
       Paul is not stating that the Ten Commandments, which define sin,
     are now abolished; that would be contrary to so much of the Bible, his
     own writings included. Instead, he is talking about a new relationship
     one has to the law through faith in Jesus. The law still is binding; it’s
     just that for the believer in Jesus, the one who died to self and to sin,
     the law no longer holds him or her in the grip of condemnation because
     the person now “belongs to another,” Jesus.

                                                                              47
               M onday May 5

      The Law of Sin and Death (Rom. 8:1–8)
         Paul assures the Christian that “there is therefore now no condemna-
      tion to those who are in Christ Jesus. . . . For the law of the Spirit of
      life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death”
      (Rom. 8:1, 2, NKJV). If we read these verses apart from their immediate
      context, it would appear that Paul was referring to two opposing laws:
      the law of life and the law of sin and death. However, the difference
      is not with the law but with the individual before and after he or she
      receives Christ.

In what ways does Paul’s discussion in Romans 7:7–13 illustrate the role
      of the law?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         The function of the law depends on the person with whom it is asso-
      ciated. The same knife, for instance, can be used by a surgeon to heal
      or by a murderer to kill. In the same way, a thief who breaks a law to
      steal someone’s purse will stand in a different relationship to the law
      than will the one whom the law was meant to protect (the owner of the
      purse). The law itself is described as “holy and righteous and good”
      (Rom. 7:12, NASB), or as the “law of sin and of death” (Rom. 8:2,
      NASB). However, in the same way that God’s retributive vengeance
      does not stop Him from being a God of love, the law’s function as an
      agent of sin and death does not make it sinful.
         According to Romans 8:5–8, the law is an instrument of “sin and
      death” for those who “set their minds on the things of the flesh” (Rom.
      8:5, NASB). This describes the person who is still married to the “old
      self ” and has no apparent desire to sever the relationship and be joined
      to the resurrected Christ. As a result of the sinful union, the person
      finds himself or herself “at enmity” with God and His law since they
      are on opposing sides (Rom. 8:7).
          Paul then emphasizes that it is impossible for the “mind set on the
      flesh” to submit to God’s law, or even to please Him (Rom. 8:7, 8,
      NASB). This is obviously not a reference to the struggling individual
      of Romans 7:13–25, since that person serves the law of God “with my
      mind” (Rom. 7:25, NASB). Paul is probably referring to those who by
      their wickedness “suppress the truth” (Rom. 1:18, NASB). It is for these
      rebels against God’s sovereignty that the law becomes an instrument of
      sin and death (Rom. 2:12).

       How do you relate to the law when you violate it?

     The Power of the Law
According to Romans 4:15, 5:13, and 7:7, what is the function of
     the law? Also, what does Romans 7:8–11 say about the effect that
     the law has on the person who violates it?
     _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Every instrument has its purpose. Just as a key is used for opening a
     lock or a knife is used for cutting, so the law is used to define sin. Had
     it not been for God’s law, there would be no absolute method of know-
     ing what actions were acceptable or unacceptable to Him. And though
     sin cannot exist without the law, Paul makes it clear that the law is not
     a willing partner with sin: “Did what is good, then, bring death to me?
     By no means! It was sin, working death in me through what is good, in
     order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment
     might become sinful beyond measure” (Rom. 7:13, NRSV).

In what ways do the above texts help to shed light on 1 Corinthians
     15:54–58?
     _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       If read in isolation, 1 Corinthians 15:54–58 would appear to promote
     a negative view of God’s law. Paul’s point, however, is that the law
     “empowers” sin only because it defines what sin is. And, of course,
     the “wages of sin is death” (Rom. 6:23). Had it not been for the law,
     there would be no death because it would be impossible to define sin.
     In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul’s purpose is not to demonize the law but to
     demonstrate how, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, all who
     believe can experience victory over death, a death that comes because
     of violation of the law.

      When was the last time that someone sinned against you; that is,
      the last time that someone violated God’s law in a way that hurt
      you? How does such an experience help us to understand why the
      belief that states that God’s law was abolished after the Cross is
      so wrong?

     The Impotent Law
       Though in one sense, as we saw, the law “empowers” sin, in another
     real way the law is terribly impotent. How can the same object be both
     powerful and impotent at the same time?
       Here again, the difference lies not in the law but in the person. For the
     one who discovers that he is a sinner, the law forces him to acknowl-
     edge that he is going against God’s will and is consequently on a path to
     death. Upon discovering his sinfulness, the sinner may decide to follow
     the law to the letter. However, the fact that he has already sinned has
     made him a candidate for death.

Read Acts 13:38, 39, Romans 8:3, and Galatians 3:21. What do they
     tell us about the law and salvation?
     _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Some people believe that strict adherence to the law will grant salva-
     tion, but this is not a biblical teaching. The law defines sin (Rom. 7:7);
     it does not forgive it (Gal. 2:21). Hence, Paul remarks that the same
     law that empowers sin is also “weak” (Rom. 8:3). It is able to convict
     the sinner of sins but cannot make the sinner righteous. A mirror can
     show us our faults; it just can’t fix them. As Ellen G. White wrote: “The
     law cannot save those whom it condemns; it cannot rescue the perish-
     ing.”—Signs of the Times, November 10, 1890.
        When we fully consider the purpose of the law, it is easier to under-
     stand why Jesus became the atoning sacrifice for the human race. The
     death of Jesus placed formerly sinful human beings in a right relation-
     ship with God and with His “holy and righteous and good” law (Rom.
     7:12, NASB). At the same time, too, His death showed us the futility
     of salvation by keeping the law. After all, if obedience to the law could
     save us, Jesus would not have had to die in our place. The fact that He
     did reveals that obedience to the law could not save us. We needed
     something much more drastic.

      Though we are promised again and again the power to obey
      God’s law, why is this obedience not enough to secure our salva-
      tion? In one sense the answer shouldn’t be that difficult. Look at
      yourself and your law-keeping. If your salvation depended upon
      your obedience, how much hope would you have?

      The Curse of the Law (Gal. 3:10–14)
What do the following texts tell us about human nature? How do we see
      the reality of this truth every day? Ps. 51:5, Isa. 64:6, and Rom. 3:23.
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        With the exception of Christ, all human beings have a common
      experience in that all have been infected by Adam’s sin. Consequently,
      no natural person can ever claim to be fully righteous. There are some,
      such as Elijah and Enoch, who lived exceptionally close to God, but
      no one has been able to live a completely blameless life. Indeed, it is
      with this reality in mind that Paul declares: “For all who rely on the
      works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone
      who does not observe and obey all the things written in the book of
      the law’ ” (Gal. 3:10, NRSV). The truth is, the law demands total and
      complete conformity, and who has ever always given that, except Jesus?


How does Romans 6:23 help to define what the “curse of the law”
      means? See also Gen. 2:17 and Ezek. 18:4.
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Everyone is naturally under the curse of the law. Because the law
      has no margin for error, it is impossible for a person to correct a past
      sin. Consequently, death is the individual’s fate. James paints an even
      bleaker picture by reminding us that transgression in one area of the
      law is just as bad as transgression in all areas (James 2:10). The wages
      of sin is death, and death has no proportions.
         When we recognize the helpless condition of those under the curse, it
      is easier to appreciate the extent of God’s love: “But God demonstrates
      His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died
      for us” (Rom. 5:8, NKJV). Through His death, “Christ redeemed us
      from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us” (Gal. 3:13, NIV).

       Think about what Paul said: “For all who rely on works of the
       law are under a curse” (Gal. 3:10, RSV). This is because the law
       can’t save us; thus, we are cursed with death. How can acknowl-
       edging this truth help us to better appreciate what we have been
       given in Jesus? In what ways do we manifest such appreciation
       in our lives? See 1 John 5:3.

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “ ‘It Is Finished,’ ” pp. 758–764, in
     The Desire of Ages.

        “The law requires righteousness,—a righteous life, a perfect charac-
     ter; and this man has not to give. He cannot meet the claims of God’s
     holy law. But Christ, coming to the earth as man, lived a holy life, and
     developed a perfect character. These He offers as a free gift to all who
     will receive them. His life stands for the life of men. Thus they have
     remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. More
     than this, Christ imbues men with the attributes of God. He builds
     up the human character after the similitude of the divine character, a
     goodly fabric of spiritual strength and beauty. Thus the very righteous-
     ness of the law is fulfilled in the believer in Christ. God can ‘be just,
     and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.’ Rom. 3:26.”—Ellen
     G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 762.
        In summary, the death of Jesus powerfully demonstrated the per-
     manence of God’s law. When our first parents sinned, God could have
     abolished His laws and taken away the penalties for violation. However,
     this would have meant a miserable existence in a lawless society for the
     earth’s inhabitants. Instead, God chose to send His Son as a Substitute
     for us, in that He received the just penalty for sin as required by the law
     on behalf of all people. Through Jesus’ death, the entire race stands in
     a new relationship to God. This means that any one of us, through faith
     in Jesus, can have our sins forgiven and stand perfect in God’s sight.

Discussion Questions:
       Many religions teach that at the end of a person’s life God
      balances the person’s good deeds against the bad deeds before
      determining whether that person will be rewarded in the afterlife.
      What is so terribly wrong with this kind of thinking?

       Jesus, the One who was equal to God, died for our sins. If we
      think that obedience to the law can somehow add to that, in terms
      of saving us, what does this say about the efficacy of Christ’s sac-
      rifice?

       What are some other reasons why the belief that states that
      God’s law was abolished after the Cross is false? When people say
      that, what do they really mean was abolished; that is, what com-
      mandment do they think was abolished?

                                                    Story
A New Life
   Ten-year-old Moses stared out the airplane window at the large city
below. This would be his new home. What will it be like to live in the
United States? Moses wondered. Will I make friends here? Will I even be
able to talk to them?
   For as long as Moses could remember, his family had lived in one refu-
gee camp after another in central Africa. His home had been a plastic tarp
held up by sticks. When it rained, everything got wet, and there seldom
was enough food to eat or clean water to drink.
   One day Moses’ father told the family, “Soon we will leave this camp
for a new home in the United States.”
   The family arrived in their new home and settled into an apartment. On
the first day of school Moses felt lost. He couldn’t find his class and couldn’t
speak English to ask for help. Finally someone took him to his class.
   Moses studied hard and soon could speak enough English to talk to his
classmates. He began telling his new friends that Jesus loves them. Some
listened, but others ignored him. His father and mother studied English so
they could find work. Everything seemed so hard. They struggled to find
a grocery store and a church. Riding the bus was difficult until they could
speak the language. After months of studying and searching for work,
Moses’ father found a job.
   Then one day Moses’ father stumbled into the apartment, blood spat-
tered on his face and clothes. “Some teenagers don’t want us here,” he said.
“One of them hit me with a rock.” His father lost eyesight in the injured
eye. But he refused to be angry. “We can’t be angry when someone hurts
us. We must forgive them and pray for them.” Moses knew that his father
was right, but it was still hard to forgive the teens who had hurt his father.
   The family has found a different place to live, and church mem-
bers are helping to pay the children’s tuition so they can study in
the Seventh-day Adventist school.
                                Moses wants to be a pastor, as his grandfa-
                              ther in Africa was. He shares God’s love with
                              others and offers to study the Bible with them
                              so they will learn to love God too. “God has
                              been with my family through hard times,” he
                              says. “He will never leave us.”
                                A recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is
                              helping to reach millions of refugees in North
                              America with the message of God’s love.
                              Thank you for reaching out to the world by

      Christ, the End of the Law




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 5:12–21, 6:15–23,
      7:13–25, 9:30–10:4, Gal. 3:19–24.

Memory Text: “For Christ is the end of the law so that there may
      be righteousness for everyone who believes” (Romans 10:4, NRSV).



      A
              well-known magazine ran a full-page ad with a headline that
              read: “Achieve Immortality! (we’re not kidding).”
                 In a sense they were kidding, because the ad went on to say,
      “To find out how you can leave a charitable legacy that will make gifts
      in your name forever, contact us for our free booklet.”
         Writers, scholars, philosophers, and theologians through the millen-
      nia have all wrestled with the question of death and what death does
      to the meaning of our lives. Hence, the ad was a clever, if ultimately
      unsuccessful, way to help people deal with their mortality.
         In contrast, all throughout the New Testament we have been shown
      the only way to achieve immortality, and that is through faith in Jesus
      as opposed to the keeping of the law—even though we are to keep it.
      Indeed, obeying the law is not in conflict with grace; on the contrary,
      it’s what we’re supposed to do as a result of receiving grace.
         This week we continue exploring law and grace.

     Where Sin Abounded (Rom. 5:12–21)
       Though it points out sins, the law is powerless to save us from them.
     That very powerlessness, however, shows us our need for Jesus, the
     only solution for sin.

Read Romans 5:12–21. In what way is the message of God’s grace
     revealed in these texts?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Notice in this passage the constant association between sin and
     death. Time and again they appear in immediate relationship with
     each other. And that’s because sin, the violation of God’s law, leads
     to death.
        Now read Romans 5:20. When the law “entered,” sin abounded, in
     the sense that the law clearly defined what sin was. However, instead
     of bringing in the natural result of sin, which is death, Paul says this:
     “But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more” (NKJV). In
     other words, no matter how bad sin is, God’s grace is sufficient to
     cover it for those who claim His promises by faith.
        Influenced by the translation of 1 John 3:4 in the King James
     Version (“sin is the transgression of the law”), many restrict sin to the
     violation of the Ten Commandments alone. However, a more literal
     translation is “sin is lawlessness” (NKJV) (anomia). Anything that
     goes against the principles of God is sin. Hence, although the Ten
     Commandments had not yet been formally revealed when Adam ate
     the forbidden fruit, he violated a command of God (Gen. 2:17) and
     was consequently guilty of sin. Indeed, it is through the sin of Adam
     that the curse of death has affected all generations of humanity (Rom.
     5:12, 17, 21).
        In contrast to Adam’s unfaithfulness, Jesus’ loyalty to God’s law
     resulted in the hope of eternal life. Although tempted, Jesus never
     yielded to sin (Heb. 4:15). Here in Romans, Paul extols Jesus’ righ-
     teous obedience, which has resulted in eternal life (Rom. 5:18–21)
     for those who accept it. As the Second Adam, Jesus kept the law fully
     and broke the curse of death. His righteousness can now become that
     of the believer’s. A person condemned to death by inheriting the sin
     of the first Adam can now embrace the gift of life by accepting the
     righteousness of the Second Adam, Jesus.

                                                                          57

     Law and Grace (Rom. 6:15–23)
        One of the most difficult concepts for Christians to comprehend is
     the continued role of the law for the one saved by grace. If a believer
     attains righteousness by accepting the sufficiency of the life and death
     of Jesus, why is it still necessary to keep the law? This question pro-
     vides another opportunity to repeat a key point: the law was never
     intended to provide salvation; its function (after the Fall) was to define
     sin. Yet, the Cross doesn’t negate the need for a person to follow God’s
     law any more than someone having been pardoned for violating the
     speed limit can now continue to violate it.

According to Romans 6:12, 15–23, what are the implications for
     living a life of grace? See especially Rom. 6:12, 15, 17.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Grace and the law are not contraries; they do not negate each other.
     Instead, they are powerfully connected. The law, because it can’t save
     us, shows us why we need grace. Grace is not opposed to law but to
     death. Our problem was not the law itself but the eternal death that
     resulted from violating it.
        Paul warns the Christian to be careful about using the promised gift
     of grace as an excuse to sin (Rom. 6:12, 15). Because sin is defined
     through the law, when Paul tells Christians not to sin, He is basically
     telling them: keep the law, obey the commandments!
        “Paul had ever exalted the divine law. He had shown that in the
     law there is no power to save men from the penalty of disobedience.
     Wrongdoers must repent of their sins and humble themselves before
     God, whose just wrath they have incurred by breaking His law, and they
     must also exercise faith in the blood of Christ as their only means of
     pardon.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 393.

      Why is it so easy to get caught up in the faulty logic that says that
      because we are not saved by the law, we no longer have to obey it?

     O Wretched Man! (Rom. 7:21–25)
Read Romans 7:13–25. How are we to understand these verses? Is
     Paul talking about an unconverted man, or is this the experience of
     the converted? What reasons can you give for your answer?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        If you were unsure as to whom these verses refer, you are not alone.
     Theologians also have wrestled with this question for centuries. The
     person described here is someone who delights in the law of God
     (hardly sounds like a nonbeliever) yet who seems to be enslaved to
     sin (which makes no sense because Christians are promised power
     over sin). The SDA Bible Commentary, after looking at the arguments
     from both sides, says: “Paul’s main purpose in the passage seems to
     be to show the relationship that exists between the law, the gospel, and
     the person who has been awakened to earnest struggles against sin in
     preparation for salvation. Paul’s message is that, although the law may
     serve to precipitate and intensify the struggle, only the gospel of Jesus
     Christ can bring victory and relief.”—The SDA Bible Commentary,
     vol. 6, p. 554.
        No matter how we look at these verses, we must always remember
     that the person who struggles with sin is still capable of making right
     choices. If this were not the case, all the Pauline (as well as other) prom-
     ises about power over sin would be meaningless. Also, as Matthew 5
     demonstrates, sin often starts before an act is committed. Consequently,
     a person is in violation of the law simply by thinking something sin-
     ful. Ordinarily, this reality could be a source of frustration. However,
     in the context of Romans 7, the individual may be helpless, but he is
     not hopeless. For the person who lives in the Spirit, the ever-present
     law serves as a constant reminder that deliverance from condemnation
     comes through Jesus (Rom. 7:24–8:2).

      Read again the verses for today. In what ways do they parallel
      your own experience with the Lord? Despite your struggles, how
      can you experience the hope that Paul nevertheless expressed
      there?

     The Goal of the Law (Rom. 9:30–10:4)
        The title for this week’s lesson comes from Romans 10:4—“Christ
     is the end of the law” (NKJV). Many who have been preconditioned to
     think negatively about the law automatically interpret the text to mean,
     “Christ made the law obsolete.” However, this reading goes against the
     many references in the book of Romans and other parts of the New
     Testament that discuss the continued relevance of the law.

Read Romans 9:30–10:4. How is Paul explaining here how salvation is
     by faith and not by the law?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       As with the rest of the epistle to the Romans, Paul’s purpose in these
     verses is to demonstrate the true source of righteousness. The law is an
     indicator of righteousness, but it is powerless to make people righteous.
     Hence, Paul portrays a paradox: the nations (Gentiles) who did not
     even strive for righteousness have obtained it, while Israel, who strove
     to keep the righteous law, did not obtain it. Paul is not excluding Jews
     from righteousness; neither is he saying that every non-Jew is righ-
     teous. He is simply saying that the law does not bring righteousness to
     a sinner, whether Jew or Gentile.
       Many Jews were sincere in their desire for righteousness, but their
     quest was futile (Rom. 10:2). They were zealous about serving God but
     wanted to do so on their own terms. They had taken an object of God’s
     revelation (the law) and confused it with the Source of their salvation.
     As good as the law is, it’s not good enough to save anyone. In fact,
     rather than making a person righteous, the law highlights the indi-
     vidual’s sinfulness; it amplifies the need for righteousness. That’s why
     Paul describes Christ as the “end” of the law. He is not the “end” in the
     sense of terminating the law, but in the sense of being the “goal” of the
     law, the One to whom the law points. The law leads a person to Christ
     as the repentant sinner looks to Him for salvation. The law reminds all
     Christians that Christ is our righteousness (Rom. 10:4).

      People who take the law seriously are always in danger of legal-
      ism, of seeking to establish “their own righteousness.” As we seek
      to obey God’s law, how can we be careful not to fall into what can
      be a very subtle trap?

      The Disciplinarian (Gal. 3:19–24)
        In harmony with the book of Romans, Paul is careful to stipulate in
      Galatians that the purpose of the law is to define sin and not to make
      people righteous (Gal. 3:19, 21).

Read Galatians 3:23, 24. What images does Paul use to describe the
      purpose of the law? What do you think the images mean?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Depending on the translation, the law is identified in verse 24 as
      a “schoolmaster,” “taskmaster,” “tutor,” and “custodian,” among other
      designations. The Greek term refers to a slave employed by a wealthy
      individual to be a disciplinarian for his son. It was the tutor’s respon-
      sibility to ensure that the son learned self-discipline. Although a slave,
      the tutor was given the authority to do that which was necessary to keep
      the son in line, even if it meant physical punishment. When the son
      reached adulthood, the tutor no longer had authority over him.

In light of the explanation of the role of the tutor, what do you think is the
      purpose of the law for someone who has received salvation in Christ?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Although the tutor no longer had authority over the adult son, it was
      expected that the lessons that the son had learned would enable him to
      make mature decisions. Similarly, while the Christian is not under the
      condemning power of the law, as a person who has attained maturity,
      he or she is expected to govern his or her actions in accordance with
      the principles of the law.
        In addition to its role as tutor, the law also operated as a caretaker that
      protected the believer until “the faith” came (Gal. 3:23). Here again we
      see that Christ is the “end,” the goal, of the law. Paul makes that point
      explicitly when he says that the law brought us to Christ, so that “we
      might be justified by faith” (vs. 24).

       Read carefully Galatians 3:21. What does it say that should forever
       end any idea that we can be saved by obedience to the law? Why is
       this such good news? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.
                                                                               61

Further Study: “The law reveals sin to us, and causes us to feel our
     need of Christ and to flee unto Him for pardon and peace by exercising
     repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. . . .
       “The law of ten commandments is not to be looked upon as much from
     the prohibitory side, as from the mercy side. Its prohibitions are the sure
     guarantee of happiness in obedience. As received in Christ, it works in
     us the purity of character that will bring joy to us through eternal ages.
     To the obedient it is a wall of protection. We behold in it the goodness
     of God, who by revealing to men the immutable principles of righteous-
     ness, seeks to shield them from the evils that result from transgres-
     sion.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 234, 235.

Discussion Questions:
       In class, talk about the wonderful hope found in Galatians 3:21.
      How is the gospel of grace so clearly presented there? Why should
      this text be the absolute antidote to legalism?

       Godly living is not optional for those who call themselves
      children of God. Many well-meaning individuals stress the need
      for us to attain “perfection” if we desire to enter the kingdom.
      Unfortunately, those who embrace this doctrine not only promote
      self-sufficiency as a key to salvation, but they also ignore the real-
      ity of sinful human nature. Humans have to live with inherited
      tendencies toward sin and are constantly bombarded with temp-
      tation. Even more troubling is the discouragement that can come
      to those who are constantly looking to themselves and how well
      they are doing as a barometer of their salvation. Compared to
      the holiness of God and His law, who among us can ever measure
      up? How, then, can we be careful that while seeking to live godly,
      faithful lives, we do not get caught up in any theology that puts the
      hope of our salvation in anything other than the righteousness of
      Christ covering us?

                                                    Story
Toogii’s Triumph
  My friends call me Toogii [TAW-gee]. I live in the capital city of
Mongolia.
  My family isn’t Christian, so I grew up not knowing much about
Jesus. One day a friend of my grandmother gave her an invitation to
meetings at the Seventh-day Adventist church, where a missionary was
speaking. Grandmother gave the invitation to my aunt, who asked me to
go with her to the meetings. I wasn’t really interested, but I went out of
respect for her. And I was curious about Christians.
  I was surprised that I enjoyed the meetings. The people were kind, and
the pastor spoke about the kingdom of God. I decided to return to the
church again. Before too long, I asked to join the church.
  I am the only member of my family who is a believer, and this creates
some problems for me. My father tries to keep me from attending church
by giving me work to do on Sabbath. But my mother lets me go because
what she’s heard about Jesus and His teachings is good.
  My friends teased me about becoming a Christian, and I felt ostra-
cized by them. Some of them were a bad influence, so when I became
a Christian, I quit hanging out with them. Some kids thought I was bad
before I became a Christian, and when I became a Christian, they thought
I was becoming something even worse. I didn’t know how to explain my
faith. There aren’t that many Adventists in Mongolia, so I felt alone.
  The pastor invited me to camp meeting that summer. I was so excited!
I made lots of new friends and had lots of fun playing sports and learning
about God. It was a great experience. Being with other Christian young
people has helped me mature in my faith.
  I was shy and didn’t talk a lot before, but I’m learning to speak in front
of people and express myself. Christ and my new friends in church have
given me confidence. Now I can talk to people easily and can express
myself better. When my classmates see the changes in me, they realize
                            that God has made a difference in my life and
                            that Christianity isn’t a bad thing.
                               It’s difficult to be the only believer in my
                            family, but the friends I’ve made in church are
                            like my family. They help me stay faithful to
                            God when I feel weak. I’m especially grate-
                            ful for the youth ministries the church offers.
                            The youth camp was established in part with
                            a recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering. Thank
                            you for caring.

      35; Gal. 6:1–5; Acts 17:31; John 5:30.

Memory Text: “ ‘If you keep My commandments, you will abide

      abide in His love’ ” (John 15:10, NKJV).

          n most nations a hierarchy of laws exists. At the top are laws that
          come from the national government and that bind all who reside in
          the country. Then there are laws on the provincial level that pertain
      to the inhabitants of certain territories. Finally, local laws govern the
      smallest districts. Although each division within a country is permitted
      to make laws that are relevant to its constituents, none can make a law
      that contradicts the law of the nation. And though circumstances may
      dictate that a certain law be applied in different ways, the application
      cannot deviate from the spirit of the law.
         As the Supreme Head of the universe, the Creator God has estab-
      lished laws for all of His creatures. When Jesus Christ voluntarily
      transformed Himself into human flesh, He gave Himself to a life of
      obedience to His Father (Phil. 2:5–11) and to His commandments.
      Thus, everything that Jesus taught, the perspective that He put on the
      law, even the “new” commandment that He gave, was always in full
      harmony with the law of God.

     The Law and the Prophets
        Some believe that the Ten Commandments, delivered through Moses
     at Sinai, were relevant only to the Israelites before the Cross and are not
     binding in the New Covenant era of grace. Others teach that Christians are
     free from the old law, but only those of Jewish heritage, and not Christians,
     are still expected to adhere to it. As we have seen, though the Bible does
     teach that the works of the law can save no one, no passage gives a person
     license to violate God’s law. If any did, it would be a license to sin, and the
     Bible would blatantly contradict itself on a crucial topic.
        In this context we remember that God revealed the terms of His cov-
     enant to Israel on tablets of stone that contained the law. However, the
     Bible contains many other commandments that cover details not found
     in the Decalogue. In seeking a comprehensive understanding of God’s
     will, the rabbis counted 613 scriptural laws, which they anchored in the
     Ten Commandments. Jesus appears to go beyond the rabbis when He
     announces that He has not come to “ ‘abolish the law or the prophets’ ”
     (Matt. 5:17, NRSV; emphasis supplied). While summarized in the Ten
     Commandments, the law of God contains every divine command spo-
     ken directly to or through His prophets.

Compare Matthew 19:16–22 and 22:34–40. What do these verses
     tell us about Jesus and the Ten Commandments?

     _________________________________________________________

        Although there are hundreds of commandments that God has
     revealed in His Word, the Ten Commandments provide solid principles
     that can be applied to all other laws. Hence, Jesus mentioned five of the
     Ten Commandments when speaking to the rich young ruler. There is an
     even more potent summary of God’s law in the commandments found
     in Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18, which is to love God and to
     love one’s neighbor. Jesus declares, “ ‘On these two commandments
     hang all the Law and the Prophets’ ” (Matt. 22:40, NKJV). Ultimately,
     Jesus and His Father are united in purpose as they urge the people of
     God’s creation to love as they have been loved, and obedience to the law
     is foundational to how that love is to be expressed.

      What in your life shows your love for God and for your neighbor?

     The “Rules” of Love (John 15:10)
        Scripture provides a number of examples of Jesus’ fidelity to the
     law of God. For instance, although His words in Luke 2:49 imply that
     at a young age He understood His identity, when His earthly mother
     expressed the hurt she felt that resulted from His straying from the
     family, He humbly accompanied His parents home and “was obedi-
     ent to them” (Luke 2:51, NIV). On another occasion, Jesus refused to
     bow to Satan when tempted in the wilderness because worship was
     reserved for God alone (Luke 4:8). And there are several illustra-
     tions of His Sabbath keeping (for example, Luke 4:16). Paul wrote
     that Jesus’ entire life was based on obedience to God’s will (Phil.
     2:5–11), and Hebrews says that, although tempted, He never sinned
     (Heb. 4:15). Thus, He could say as He approached His final hours,
     “ ‘I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love’ ”
     (John 15:10, NKJV).

Read John 13:34, 35. What did Jesus mean by saying that this was a
     “new” commandment?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Jesus understood that there is a relationship between commandment
     keeping and love. Though we’re not used to talking about “rules” of
     love, one could say that, in a real sense, the Ten Commandments are
     those rules. They show us how God wants us to express our love for
     Him and others.
        God is love (1 John 4:16), and so in presenting His commandment
     to His disciples (John 13:34, 35), Jesus is simply amplifying the law of
     love that originated in His Father (John 3:16). Now, though, more than
     just loving each other as ourselves, we are to love as Jesus loved us.
        “At the time when these words were spoken, the disciples could not
     understand them; but after they had witnessed the sufferings of Christ,
     after His crucifixion and resurrection, and ascension to heaven, and after
     the Holy Spirit had rested on them at Pentecost, they had a clearer con-
     ception of the love of God and of the nature of that love which they must
     have for one another.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 547.

      With today’s lesson in mind, read 1 John 3:16. How can we have
      this kind of love in our own lives? How can we die the kind of
      death to self that is needed in order for us to express such love?

     All Things to All Men
Take a close look at the references to law in 1 Corinthians 9:19–23.
     What is Paul saying here? Why such a strong emphasis on law?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        God’s desire is that all people accept His gift of eternal life and become
     citizens of His everlasting kingdom. In 1 Corinthians 9, Paul reveals his
     method of attracting people to God’s kingdom. He understands that there
     are cultural barriers that hinder people from making a decision for the
     gospel. Paul is willing to adapt to the culture of the group to whom he
     was witnessing for the sole purpose of seeing them saved.
        Ultimately, all who become a part of God’s kingdom will be subject
     to His law. Consequently, those who minister for God must also be in
     line with God’s will. Paul is quick to state that although he uses innova-
     tive methods to reach people, he is always careful to remain under the
     dictates of God’s law. His desire to see people saved will not allow him
     to compromise the laws of the God he is asking them to serve. He may
     adapt to cultural laws, but only if there is no conflict with the ultimate
     law. The principle that governs his method is the “law of Christ” (1 Cor.
     9:21, NASB).
        We can also understand Paul’s reference to the “law of Christ” as the
     method that Christ used. It was a method based on love for all people
     and not for just a select few. Paul does not intend for the law of Christ to
     be seen as an alternative to the law of God. The two work harmoniously
     together as the loving law of Christ is used to introduce those saved by
     grace to the law of a loving God. In fact, the entire section, in which
     Paul so openly explains all that He is willing to do in order to reach
     the lost, is a perfect example of the kind of self-sacrificing love that is
     revealed in the “law of Christ.”

      How much self are you willing to deny in order to reach others
      for Christ? How much self have you already denied in reaching
      out to others? How much of the “law of Christ” do you follow?

     Fulfilling the Law of Christ (Gal. 6:2)
        Whether revealed in written documents or in nature, the law of God
     discloses His will to every person capable of understanding (Rom.
     1:20, 2:12–16). Consequently, no one can claim to be ignorant of the
     basic requirements of God. “All have sinned and fall short of the glory
     of God” (Rom. 3:23, NKJV) and thus are destined for destruction (Rom.
     6:23, Ezek. 18:4). However, all is not lost: the curse has been reversed
     by the gift of eternal life, which has been made available through the
     life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:8).
        According to Paul, grace should empower the believer to live an obe-
     dient life (Rom. 6:15, Eph. 2:10, Titus 2:11–14), though, as we all know
     too well, we don’t always live as obediently and faithfully as we should.

According to Galatians 6:1–5, what is one way to manifest the “law
     of Christ”?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        It is important to remember that everyone is subject to temptation
     and can submit to sin in moments of weakness. With this recognition,
     it is insensitive for a person to immediately condemn a fellow Christian
     who has fallen. Even Jesus, who had never sinned, was willing to assist
     those who have been overcome by sin. As Ellen G. White wrote of Jesus,
     “He did not censure human weakness.”—The Desire of Ages, p. 353.
     Paul admonished Christians to provide assistance for the purpose of res-
     toration (Gal. 6:1). In other words, the person who has sinned should be
     encouraged to abide once again by the precepts of God’s law.
        The law of Christ is driven by mercy. Had it not been for His sacrifi-
     cial death, there would be no reason to keep the law of God. However,
     because Christ has made eternal life possible, there is an incentive for
     the faithful to resume keeping God’s law after moments of weakness.
     Fellow believers should use the law of Christ as a vehicle to transport
     the repentant sinner back to the arena of God’s law of love.

      Think about a time when you messed up and were shown grace,
      though you didn’t deserve it (after all, if you did deserve it, it
      wouldn’t be grace). How can you make sure that you remember
      the grace that you have received the next time that someone
      needs to beg some grace from you?

      Law and Judgment (John 5:30)
         Although God’s law is a law of mercy, God will eventually use it as
      the standard of judgment. God has continued to provide opportunities
      for sinners to repent and pledge loyalty to Him, but the hour is coming
      when the cry will go out, “ ‘Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy
      still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy’ ”
      (Rev. 22:11, NRSV). This announcement serves as a prelude to the final
      judgment.

In Revelation 14:7, the first angel proclaims God’s judgment, though a
      number of other texts speak of Christ’s judgment (for example, Acts
      17:31, 2 Tim. 4:1, 2 Cor. 5:10). How does John 5:30 help us under-
      stand the role of Jesus in judgment?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Although Christ had laid aside His divine nature when He became
      human (Phil. 2:5–11), He still had a special relationship with the
      Father. When the religious leaders accused Him of blasphemy, He
      informed His accusers that God had given Him authority to fulfill
      specific divine tasks (John 5:19–30), one of which was judgment.
      The fact that Christ has been assigned the responsibility of judg-
      ment demonstrates the mercy of God. Because Christ has become
      one with the human race, He is in a position to judge impartially.
      Given His familiarity with the human experience, Christ would not
      condemn a person unjustly. In fact, Christ suggests that condem-
      nation does not come from Him, but that the unrepentant sinner
      condemns himself when he refuses to heed the command of God
      (John 12:48).
        Many are familiar with the content of God’s law but don’t know
      how to keep it. The law is not a checklist we use to see how close
      we are to the kingdom; instead, it is an instrument that expresses
      various principles of love. Fulfilling the law does not mean that
      we obey it to gain personal favor with God, but it beckons each
      Christian to share the love of God with those who need it. As the
      standard of judgment, the law serves to measure the level of love
      that the individual has shared with God and humanity. When Christ
      presides over the final judgment, He will use God’s unchanging law
      of love as the standard by which to judge (James 2:12).

                                                                                  69

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Church Discipline,” pp. 260–
     264; “ ‘Consider One Another,’ ” pp. 265, 266, in Testimonies for the
     Church, vol. 7.

       “ ‘Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.’
     Here, again, our duty is plainly set before us. How can the professed
     followers of Christ so lightly regard these inspired injunctions? . . .
       “We know but little of our own hearts, and have but little sense of
     our own need of the mercy of God. This is why we cherish so little of
     that sweet compassion which Jesus manifests toward us, and which
     we should manifest toward one another. We should remember that
     our brethren are weak, erring mortals, like ourselves. Suppose that a
     brother has through unwatchfulness been over-borne by temptation,
     and contrary to his general conduct has committed some error; what
     course shall be pursued toward him? We learn from Bible history that
     men whom God had used to do a great and good work committed
     grave sins. The Lord did not pass these by unrebuked, neither did he
     cast off his servants. When they repented, he graciously forgave them,
     and revealed to them his presence, and wrought through them. Let
     poor, weak mortals consider how great is their own need of pity and
     forbearance from God and from their brethren. Let them beware how
     they judge and condemn others.”—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times,
     January 25, 1883.

Discussion Questions:
       Reflect on the above two paragraphs from Signs of the Times. Why
      is it so important that we bestow grace on those who fall into sin?

       Think about some well-known Bible characters who fell into
      sin, whom God was yet able to forgive and continue to use. What
      important lesson is there for us in these examples?

       In what ways can we enforce church discipline while at the
      same time showing grace and mercy toward those among us who
      fall into sin? Why should we see the two concepts, discipline and
      grace, as not being in contradiction with each other?

                                                    Story
The Man God Intends
   Rober [roh-BEHR] and his family live in a small town in eastern Peru.
Rober’s wife, Roxana, began attending the Seventh-day Adventist church
and took the couple’s children with her. She often invited Rober, but he
wasn’t interested in religion.
   However, in his heart, Rober sensed that his life wasn’t what it should
be. He often drank, but later felt guilty that his bad habits weren’t a good
example for his children. He wanted to be a better husband and father,
but he didn’t know how.
   Then an accident turned his life around.
   “I was drunk when I lost control of my motorcycle,” he says. “I landed hard
on the street, fracturing my skull and breaking other bones. I was taken to
the hospital, unconscious. When I finally recovered enough to return home,
Roxana spent hours reading the Bible to me and talking about what Jesus
means to her. I had a lot of time to think about my life and God. One day I told
Roxana that I wanted to make my life right with God. I wanted to marry her
legally and be baptized. The pastor and a lay member came to study the Bible
with us, and when we were ready, we were baptized together.”
   “Before we were united in Christ, our lives were sad,” Roxana says. “But
now we sing and pray and read the Bible together as a family. We’re so happy.”
   Rober has returned to work, where he shares his new faith with his fel-
low workers. “Whenever I have a chance, I tell them what I’m learning
about Christ,” he says. “I have a small computer and use it to show my
fellow workers videos about the Bible and God.” Rober shares his faith
with his extended family. Although they aren’t Adventists, they listen,
because they’ve seen changes in his life. Seeing the difference Jesus has
made in Rober’s life makes them want to make changes in their lives.
   Rober has gone from wishing he could be more actively involved with
his family to being a model of faith for his family. “We need fathers who
will teach their children about Jesus and all He stands for,” Rober says.
“It’s the most important thing we as parents can do.”
                                  With Roxana’s support, Rober hopes to return
                               to school and study public health so he can help
                               people live a more healthful life. It’s one way he
                               can be an example of faith to those around him.
                                  Our mission offerings help to build churches
                               in poor regions of Peru and throughout South
                               America. Thank you for supporting mission
                               with your gifts to God.

                               Rober Aquino and his family share their faith in
                               central Peru.

      Christ, the Law and the
      Gospel


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 7:7–12; Deut. 30:15–20;
      Matt. 7:24–27; Acts 10:34, 35; John 15:10; Eph. 2:1.

Memory Text: “For the law was given through Moses, but grace
      and truth came through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17, NKJV).



      A
               century before Christ, Roman poet Lucretius wrote a famous
               poem “On the Nature of Things” that was lost in history until
               the Middle Ages. Though often accused of being an atheist,
      Lucretius didn’t deny in his poem the existence of the gods; he just
      argued that by virtue of being gods, they would have absolutely no
      interest in anything human.
        In contrast, the Bible argues that there is only one God, and that He’s
      fervently interested in what happens here. And two manifestations of
      that passionate interest in humanity are found in His law (which is
      to guide how we live) and in His grace (His means of saving us even
      though we have violated that law). Though often seen as contrary to
      each other, law and grace are inseparably linked. Their methods of
      operation may be different, but together they reveal that righteousness
      must triumph over sin. The manifestations of God’s law and His grace
      provide powerful evidence of His love for humanity and His desire to
      save us into His eternal kingdom.

     Sin and the Law
Read Romans 7:7–12. What is Paul saying here about the relationship
     between sin and law? Why would he even ask such a question as,
     “Is the law sin?” (NKJV)?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Paul so closely relates the law and sin that he asks the rhetorical
     question, “Is the law sin?” The answer, of course, is that it’s not; on the
     contrary, at the end of the section he says, “Therefore the law is holy,
     and the commandment holy and just and good” (NKJV). The “there-
     fore” shows the conclusion of his argument: that, far from being sin,
     the law is indeed holy and good.
        What Paul says here is analogous to the relationship between crimi-
     nal law and crime. Something is criminal only if a law depicts it as
     such. You might go to jail in one country for doing something that in
     another country is legal. The reason: one country has a law forbidding
     that action, the other doesn’t. It is the same action but with two different
     consequences. What makes the difference? The law.
        A crucial point to remember, too, is that just because something is a
     law doesn’t make it good. In early America, a law required people to
     return escaped slaves to their masters. It was the law; yet, it was hardly
     a just one. In the case of God’s law, however, we know that it reflects
     His loving character. Thus Paul’s words that the law is holy and good;
     what else could it be, considering who created it?

What significance is there in the commandment that Paul uses in
     Romans 7:7 to prove his point about the law? Why does he use that
     one instead of another, such as “Thou shalt not steal”?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Perhaps Paul uses that specific commandment instead of some of the
     others because it’s not so obvious that it’s wrong. Many people, in and of
     themselves, might not believe that coveting is wrong. Murder, stealing, yes;
     one generally doesn’t even need the Ten Commandments to know that. But
     coveting? So it is a perfect example to make his point that it’s the law that
     shows us what sin is. Otherwise, he might not have known that coveting
     was wrong.
                                                                              73

     The Law and Israel (Deut. 30:15–18)
       The giving of the law to Israel was a special act. Just before He gave
     the law to Moses, God reminded His people that they are “ ‘a kingdom
     of priests and a holy nation’ ” (Exod. 19:6, NKJV). Among all nations
     on the face of the earth, it was to Israel that God specially revealed
     His law (Rom. 9:4). The law was not intended to be a burden to the
     people but to be a tool through which the chosen nation would reveal
     to the masses the moral code that is the foundation of God’s govern-
     ment. Israel was to be a partner with God in the mission of universal
     evangelism, and God’s law was to be the identifying mark for God’s
     spokespersons.

According to Deuteronomy 30:15–20, what is the relationship
     between the law and the promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and
     Jacob? Also, even more crucial, how do these principles apply to us
     today as well, under the new covenant? See Matt. 7:24–27.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        God chose Israel to be His representatives. Israel would be the people
     through whom the nations of the earth received the blessings promised
     to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. However, the blessings were by no means
     automatic. As a chosen nation, Israel was expected to walk in harmony
     with the Lord’s will. Moses made it clear that life and prosperity would
     come to the people only if they observed God’s “commandments,
     decrees, and ordinances” (Deut. 30:15, 16, NRSV).
        Given the numerous stories of rebellion that mar Israel’s history, Israel
     as a nation failed to live up to the covenant conditions. Yet, we must not
     forget that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Rom.
     3:23, NKJV). No nation on earth has fulfilled the will of God. Even in
     recent history, nations that profess to be Christian have misrepresented
     the cause of God with warmongering, prejudice, and oppression.

      In your own experience, how are obedience and faith related?
      That is, when you obey, what happens to your faith in contrast to
      when you disobey? How does obedience strengthen faith?

     The Law and the Nations (Acts 10:34, 35)
Read Acts 10:34, 35; 17:26, 27; Romans 1:20; and 2:14. What is the
     central teaching of these texts?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Despite Israel’s mistakes, God did not leave the people in other
     nations without a witness. Those who were not privileged to receive
     God’s written revelation received divine messages through the pages of
     natural revelation (Rom. 1:20). God’s book of nature contains enough
     information to direct a person to Him.
        God has also instilled a measure of spiritual desire in every human
     being. According to Paul, those who sense God’s indwelling Spirit will
     engage in a quest to find Him (Acts 17:27). So many people sense an
     emptiness in their lives that nothing this world offers—fame, power,
     money, sex—can ultimately fulfill. At its heart, this was the message
     of the book of Ecclesiastes. This emptiness, this dissatisfaction, often
     leads people in a quest for something beyond, for something that tran-
     scends everyday existence. They are drawn to revealed truth in a desire
     to quell the longings and emptiness of their souls.
        Whether God’s will is revealed through written documents or nature,
     the person who receives it has the responsibility to live it. Truth is
     truth, regardless of the vehicle that delivers it, and those who suppress
     the truth will experience the wrath of God (Rom. 1:18). Consequently,
     although many people may not have received the Bible or the Ten
     Commandments, God still holds them accountable for the portions of
     truth that they have gleaned. Ultimately, everyone will be judged, and
     the standard of judgment will be law: either the law God expressly
     revealed through His prophet Moses, or, for those who are ignorant of
     the written law—the law of conscience, which has been developed by
     listening to God’s voice in nature.

     Grace and Truth (John 1:17)
       John condensed the history of salvation into one verse: “The law was
     given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ”
     (John 1:17, NKJV). As a result of Adam’s sin, all humanity has been
     affected by the curse of death. The curse is intensified by the fact that
     no one born to human parents, except Jesus, has been free from sinful
     inclinations. Therefore, God selected a people to whom He revealed
     His law, intending that those elected would be His light to the other
     nations. God did not give the law to Israel as a means to salvation but
     as a constant reminder of their need for righteousness.

What do Philippians 2:8, John 15:10, and Matthew 26:39 tell us about
     the kind of life that Jesus lived?

        When he disobeyed the express command of God, the first Adam
     plunged the entire world into disarray and bondage. On the other hand,
     through His obedient life, the Second Adam, Jesus, came to deliver the
     world from the bondage that the first Adam had brought. When Jesus
     walked this earth, He voluntarily subjected His own will to the will of
     His Father and chose not to sin. Unlike the first Adam, who brought
     condemnation and falsehood into the world, Jesus brought in “grace
     and truth.” Grace and truth did not supplant the law. Jesus showed,
     instead, why the law alone was not enough to procure salvation. The
     truth that He brought was a more complete understanding of grace.

According to Romans 6:23 and Ephesians 2:8, what is the nature
     of the grace that originates in Jesus? How did Jesus supply grace
     for humans?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The Greek word translated as “grace” (charis) can also mean “gift”
     and is related to the term for joy (chara). The gift that Jesus gives to
     humanity is eternal life. Further, grace manifests itself as the indwell-
     ing presence of Christ that enables the individual to participate in the
     righteousness that the law promotes. Paul states that in condemning sin
     in the flesh, Jesus has made it possible that “the righteous requirement
     of the law might be fulfilled in us” (Rom. 8:4, NKJV). Grace not only
     frees us from the condemnation of the law, but it enables us to keep the
     law in the way that we are called to do.

     The Law and the Gospel (Rom. 1:16, 17)
       No matter how “good” our lives are, none can escape the constant
     reminders of sin. Inevitably, happiness is interrupted by sickness, death,
     disaster. On a personal level, feelings of spiritual security are often
     challenged by memories of past sins and, even worse, by the urge to
     sin again.

In what ways do Romans 6:23, 7:24, and Ephesians 2:1 describe the
     impact of sin?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        A person living in sin, in unrighteousness, is merely a walking corpse
     just waiting for the day when the last breath exits his body. When Paul
     assesses the human condition, he cries out in desperation, “Who will
     deliver me from this body of death?” (Rom. 7:24, NKJV). This is a cry
     for liberation from unrighteousness. Paul quickly realizes that deliver-
     ance comes through Jesus (Rom. 7:25).
        This is the gospel. The good news is that we who have been trapped
     in bodies of unrighteousness can be covered with the righteousness of
     Christ. The gospel is the guarantee that we can escape the condemna-
     tion of the law because we now possess the righteousness that the law
     promotes (Rom. 8:1).
        When Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome, the story of Jesus’ death
     was still being circulated throughout the empire. Those who had heard
     were fully aware that the way He had died was scandalous. People
     whose loved ones had been executed on a cross were often left to a life
     of shame. However, Paul and countless other Christians understood
     that Christ’s “shameful” death was the most powerful event in human
     history. That is why Paul declares, “I am not ashamed of the gospel, for
     it is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes” (Rom.
     1:16, author’s translation). And the heart of that gospel is the great
     promise that in the end, death will not have the final say and that those
     saved by Jesus will live forever in a new earth.

      Many people believe that life is meaningless because it always
      ends in death. So, nothing we do will matter in the long run. It’s
      hard to argue with that logic, isn’t it? If everything we have ever
      done and every person we have ever influenced will all forever be
      lost and forgotten, what can life mean?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Preaching the Distinctive
     Truths,” pp. 231, 232, in Evangelism; “The Faith That Works” and “How
     Faith Is Made Perfect,” pp. 88, 89, in The Faith I Live By.

        “Let the subject be made distinct and plain that it is not possible to
     effect anything in our standing before God or in the gift of God to us
     through creature merit. Should faith and works purchase the gift of salva-
     tion for anyone, then the Creator is under obligation to the creature. Here
     is an opportunity for falsehood to be accepted as truth. If any man can
     merit salvation by anything he may do, then he is in the same position as
     the Catholic to do penance for his sins. Salvation, then, is partly of debt,
     that may be earned as wages. If man cannot, by any of his good works,
     merit salvation, then it must be wholly of grace, received by man as a
     sinner because he receives and believes in Jesus. It is wholly a free gift.
     Justification by faith is placed beyond controversy. And all this controversy
     is ended, as soon as the matter is settled that the merits of fallen man in
     his good works can never procure eternal life for him.”—Ellen G. White,
     Faith and Works, p. 19.

Discussion Questions:
       Dwell on the Ellen G. White statement in Friday’s study. Think
      through the wonderful and hopeful truths found in these words
      for even the worst of sinners. How can we learn to claim these
      promises for ourselves and live as if we really believe them?

       Although God gave His law to Israel through Moses, the Bible
      suggests that He uses other methods to reveal His will to people
      who may not have access to His written revelation (for example,
      Rom. 1:20; 2:14; Acts 17:26, 27). If God does indeed speak to all
      people, what is the purpose of missionaries and evangelists?

       John 1:17 states that “grace and truth” originated with Jesus
      Christ. Using that text, many people place the law in opposition to
      “grace and truth.” Why is this a false dichotomy? In what ways do
      the law and “grace and truth” all work together to reveal to us the
      character of God as seen in the plan of salvation?

       Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky created a character who
      wanted to study why more people didn’t kill themselves. As an
      atheist, he couldn’t understand why people would want to live
      meaningless lives that were often so full of pain. Discuss the logic
      of this thinking.

                                                    Story
The Stolen Watermelon
   Mpo [m’POH] and Tendai [TEN-dai]* live in Zambia. One day they
were hot and thirsty after playing. They sat down in the shade to rest.
Then Mpo jumped up. “There’s a b-i-g watermelon growing in a field
near here. Let’s go get it!”
   The two boys set off toward the field. Mpo ran ahead and grabbed the
watermelon from the vine and raced toward the bushes. Tendai followed
his friend. He wanted to ask permission to eat the watermelon before
taking it, but when he reached his friend, Mpo had already broken the
watermelon open. The sight of the juicy melon made Tendai’s mouth
water. He scooped up a piece of melon and ate it. Soon the boys had
eaten the entire watermelon. They sat back, full and satisfied.
   It was getting late, and Tendai hurried home. When he arrived home,
his mother said, “Dinner is almost ready.”
   “I’m not hungry,” Tendai said. “I ate with Mpo.”
   Mother frowned. “OK,” she said. “Then do your chores and come
inside for worship.”
   After worship, Tendai lay down on his straw mat and fell asleep. He
dreamed that his family went to heaven, but he couldn’t enter because
he had stolen the watermelon. He awoke with a start, crying. The next
night and the next he had the same dream. He awoke the third morning
knowing that he must tell his mother about the stolen watermelon.
   “We must tell the farmer whose watermelon you stole,” his mother
said. They walked to the farmer’s house. Tendai confessed that he and his
friend had stolen the watermelon. “It was wrong,” he said. “I’m sorry.”
   The farmer nodded. “It was wrong to take the watermelon. Now I
must buy another one. Do you have the money to pay for a watermelon?”
   Tendai shook his head.
   “Then you will work to pay for the watermelon,” the farmer said. His
mother nodded at Tendai. “I need a new rubbish pit. I’ll show you where
to dig it.” Tendai took the man’s shovel and followed him to a field. He
began digging. It was hard work, and the sun was hot on his back. But
he kept digging until the rubbish pit was done. Then he gathered the
rubbish from the land around the pit.
   Now when Tendai is tempted to do something wrong, he remembers
the hot sun beating on his back as he dug the rubbish pit. He remembers
his dreams, too, and he turns away from temptation, for he doesn’t want
to miss out on heaven.

      Christ, the Law and the
      Covenants


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 9:12–17, 17:2–12, Gal.
      3:15–28, Deut. 9:9, Heb. 10:11–18, Heb. 9:15–28.

Memory Text: “For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new
      covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal
      inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from
      the sins committed under the first covenant” (Hebrews 9:15, NIV).



      G
               od’s eternal decision to save humanity has been revealed to us
               through the ages by the covenants. Though the Bible speaks of
               covenants in the plural (Rom. 9:4, Gal. 4:24, Eph. 2:12), there
      is really only the covenant of grace, in which salvation is given to sin-
      ners, not on the basis of their merits but on the merits of Jesus that are
      offered to all who claim those merits by faith. The plural, covenants,
      simply means that God has advanced His saving purposes by restating
      the covenant in various ways in order to meet the needs of His people
      in different times and settings. It is always, though, one covenant—the
      eternal covenant of God’s saving grace.
         The heart of this covenant is our Lord’s steadfast, faithful love, a love
      that the Bible at times even equates with the covenants themselves (see
      Deut. 7:9, 1 Kings 8:23, Dan. 9:4). As part of that covenant, God calls
      His people to obey His law, not as a means of salvation but as the fruit
      of it. Law and grace together have always been central to God’s eternal
      covenant.

     Covenant Signs (Gen. 9:12–17)
        A covenant can be simply defined as an agreement between two par-
     ties based upon promises made by either one or by both parties. There
     are two basic methods by which a covenant can operate. In the first,
     both parties to the covenant agree to the terms of the relationship and
     make mutual promises. This would be the case in a marriage, busi-
     ness merger, or even the purchase of property. In the second category,
     one party initiates the covenant by stipulating both the promises and
     the nonnegotiable terms, and the other party is invited to participate.
     Examples include payment of taxes or enrollment at an educational
     institution. In both instances, either party is free to withdraw from the
     covenant, but there is usually a consequence. (For instance, a person
     who fails to pay his mortgage will lose his home, or a citizen who
     refuses to remit taxes will be prosecuted.)
        A covenant is usually sealed with at least one symbol. For instance,
     a person purchasing a home places several signatures on a mortgage
     agreement with a lending institution, which keeps the title deed for the
     property in trust until the full amount is paid. Or married people are
     issued a legal document of marriage by the state. The symbol itself is
     not the covenant but an indicator that a person is obligated to a cov-
     enant.

Read Genesis 9:12–17 and 17:2–12. What is the difference between the
     symbol and the covenant in these cases? Also, what are the differ-
     ences between these two covenants?

        In Genesis 9:9, God covenants with creation that He will never again
     destroy the earth with water. Whenever a rainbow appears in the sky, all
     are expected to remember God’s promise. The same is true for the mark
     of circumcision, which was supposed to remind every Jewish male of
     His people’s role in blessing the nations. One covenant was made with
     all humanity; the other, specifically with the nation of Israel. Also, in
     the covenant made with humanity after the Flood, the people didn’t
     have to do anything; the promise was just there, regardless of what
     the people did. This wasn’t so with the second one, the one made with
     Israel; the people had to fulfill their part of the deal.
                                                                          81

     Covenant Promises
       Covenants are based on promises. In fact, it is possible to use the
     two terms interchangeably. Of course, when a covenant is made, it is
     expected that the person who makes the promise (covenant) has the
     ability to deliver what is promised (covenanted).
       In the Old Testament, some covenants were local and limited affairs
     (see, for instance, Gen. 31:43–54).
       The incident with Jacob and Laban demonstrates that covenants can
     be transactions made within and between societies. The monument at
     Mizpah was to serve as the sign of a treaty that would apply only to the
     two clans. When those to whom the treaty applied had died, the terms
     of the treaty would be irrelevant. Unlike this covenant made between
     humans, the covenants that Yahweh instituted with Noah and Abraham
     have everlasting implications.

How does Galatians 3:15–28 help to explain the broader implications
     of the Abrahamic covenant?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Throughout the Bible, God has made several universal covenants in
     which He makes promises that are relevant to all humanity. Recognizing
     that the entire earth had been affected by the Flood, Yahweh promised
     not to allow His creation to be devastated by water again. In the case
     with Abraham, God saw humanity’s need for righteousness, and so He
     promised to provide a blessing for all nations through Abraham’s seed
     (Gen. 22:18).
       Though God made the Sinai covenant with a specific nation, it
     also has universal significance. God was very clear that any foreigner
     could be a part of the chosen people (for example, Exod. 12:48, 49),
     and Israel’s mission was to be an evangelistic light to the world (Exod.
     19:5, 6).

      What is your own personal understanding of your covenantal
      relationship with God? That is, what has God promised you, and
      what has He asked of you in return for those promises?

     Tablets of the Covenant
        Although a covenant is based on promises, there are usually condi-
     tions to meet before the promises are fulfilled. The Abrahamic covenant
     involved the circumcision of all males who were born either to Abraham
     or his descendants. When Yahweh covenanted with Israel, He personally
     engraved the requirements for the relationship on tablets of stone (Deut.
     9:8–11). These requirements, preserved in the Ten Commandments, were
     to form the basis of God’s everlasting covenant with all humans.
        Because they detail certain terms of the covenant, the Ten
     Commandments are often termed the “tablets of the covenant” (Deut.
     9:9, NKJV). The Ten Commandments are not intended to be an obstacle
     course designed to make life hard for those who have entered into the
     covenant with God; instead, as an expression of God’s love, the com-
     mandments have been given for the benefit of those who have entered
     into a covenant relationship with their Lord.

In what ways do Jeremiah 31:31–34 and Hebrews 10:11–18 uphold the
     everlasting nature of God’s law in the New Covenant?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Under the Old Covenant at Mount Sinai, the Israelites and those who
     joined the community were obligated to demonstrate faithfulness to the
     covenant by keeping the Ten Commandments. When they violated a
     commandment, they were expected to offer an animal sacrifice if they
     wished to have their sins forgiven.
        Under the New Covenant at Mount Calvary, God’s people are still
     obligated to keep the Ten Commandments. However, when they sin
     they don’t have to offer continuous sacrifices, because Jesus is their
     full and complete sacrifice (Heb. 9:11–14). The New Covenant is so
     much better than the old because now, by faith, we claim the promises
     of forgiveness offered to us through the sacrifice of Jesus. “There is
     hope for us only as we come under the Abrahamic covenant, which
     is the covenant of grace by faith in Christ Jesus.”—Ellen G. White
     Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1077.

      What does it mean to have God’s law written in your heart? How
      does this differ from merely understanding God’s law as a code
      of obedience?

     The Covenant and the Gospel (Heb. 9:15–22)
       There were strong consequences for violating certain biblical cov-
     enants. Yahweh warned Abraham that any male who was not circum-
     cised would be cut off from the chosen (Gen. 17:14), and a litany of
     curses was directed toward those who refused to abide by the terms of
     the Sinai covenant (Deut. 27:11–26). Ultimately, those who violated
     the terms of the covenant would be punished with death (Ezek. 18:4).
     The same is true for the New Covenant: those who refuse to keep God’s
     law are also denied access to eternal life (Rom. 6:23).

Read Hebrews 9:15–28. In what ways is the gospel revealed in these
     verses?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Hebrews 9:15–28 repeats the gospel story as it proclaims the part
     that Christ plays in securing the promises for believers. Verse 15 points
     out that Jesus functions as the “mediator” of the New Covenant, who,
     through His death, offers eternal life to those who otherwise would face
     eternal destruction.
       In verses 16 and 17, some Bible translations switch from discussing
     “covenant” and introduce the term “will” instead, even though the same
     Greek word is used. This brings in the whole idea of death, the death
     of Jesus for us. When viewed in that context, the passage reminds the
     believer that without Christ the covenant requires the death of each sin-
     ner. However, the sinner can be covered and then cleansed by Christ’s
     shed blood and thus be among those who “eagerly wait” His return
     (Heb. 9:28, NKJV).
       “Then we shall know that our own righteousness is indeed as filthy
     rags, and that the blood of Christ alone can cleanse us from the defile-
     ment of sin, and renew our hearts in His own likeness.”—Ellen G.
     White, Steps to Christ, p. 29.

      God Himself, in the person of Jesus, bore in Himself the punish-
      ment for our sins in order to spare us that punishment, which we
      deserve. What does this tell us about the character of God, and
      why we can trust Him, no matter our circumstances?

     Covenant Benefits (Eph. 2:6)
       In many instances people can experience the promises of a covenant
     before all the terms are even met. For instance, a person purchasing a
     home has the opportunity to live in the home before it is paid for. Or
     a citizen enjoys the public services offered by the government before
     he has even started paying taxes. Those who enter into a covenant with
     God can also start to experience the benefits of the covenant before the
     promises are actualized in the future.
       Think, for instance, about the Ten Commandments, and how much
     pain and suffering people could avoid if they simply followed them.
     Who hasn’t personally experienced the heartache that comes from
     the violation of these commandments? Even worse, the suffering that
     comes isn’t always limited to the one who violates the law; often others,
     even those closest to the sinner, suffer, as well.

According to these texts, what other benefits can we find, even now,
     through being in a covenant relationship with Jesus?

     reports that those who accept Him have already “ ‘passed from
     death into life’ ” (John 5:24, NKJV). So confident is the believer
     in his or her salvation that although confined to this earth, he or
     she can claim to be sitting in heavenly places with Christ Jesus
     (Eph. 2:6).

      If someone were to ask you, “What does it mean to be sitting with
      Jesus in heaven now (as Ephesians 2:6 says),” what would you
      answer, and why?

Further Study: For more information on this week’s topic, read Ellen
     G. White, “The Covenant of Grace,” pp. 131–137, in God’s Amazing Grace.

        “This same covenant was renewed to Abraham in the promise, ‘In
     thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.’ Gen. 22:18. This
     promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood it, and he trusted in
     Christ for the forgiveness of sins. It was this faith that was accounted
     unto him for righteousness. The covenant with Abraham also main-
     tained the authority of God’s law. . . .
        “The Abrahamic covenant was ratified by the blood of Christ, and it is
     called the ‘second,’ or ‘new,’ covenant, because the blood by which it was
     sealed was shed after the blood of the first covenant. . . .
        “The covenant of grace is not a new truth, for it existed in the mind of
     God from all eternity. This is why it is called the everlasting covenant. . . .
        “There is hope for us only as we come under the Abrahamic cov-
     enant, which is the covenant of grace by faith in Christ Jesus.”—Ellen
     G. White, The Faith I Live By, p. 75.

Discussion Questions:
       What do Exodus 31:16 and Isaiah 56:4–6 suggest about the
      importance of the Sabbath to the covenant? See also Ezekiel 20.

       It is often thought that the Old Covenant, the one established
      with Abraham, was a covenant of works, in contrast to the New
      Covenant, which is of grace. Why is this idea wrong? What Bible
      verses can you find that prove it was always a covenant of grace?
      Why must it always have been by grace and never by works?

       Though Ephesians 1 doesn’t use the phrase “everlasting cov-
      enant,” in what way do these words help us to understand why the
      covenant has been called that?

       God promised that He would never again destroy the world by
      a flood, a promise symbolized by the rainbow. If, as some suggest,
      Noah’s flood were only local, what does that make of God’s prom-
      ise? Why is the idea that the Flood was not global a major assault
      on Bible truth? (After all, look at all the local floods that have
      happened since then. If Noah’s flood were only local, what would
      these other local floods do to God’s covenant promise?)

                                                     Story
They Need to Hear
   While sitting in class in his Papua New Guinea high school, young Willie
Siso noticed that he was having difficulty hearing. A doctor told him he had
inflammation in his ear. But Willie’s hearing continued to fail.
   Why is God allowing this? he wondered. As his hearing deteriorated, Willie
began learning sign language. He graduated from a teacher’s college and took
a job teaching in a middle school. In addition to his regular class, he taught
five hearing-impaired students of various ages.
   In 2011, Willie enrolled at Pacific Adventist University to study theology.
While teaching hearing-impaired children in a nearby school, he met Noah,
an assistant teacher who was a Seventh-day Adventist. Noah told Willie that
he didn’t attend church. “I can’t understand what is being said, and there’s no
one to interpret for me,” he said. Then Noah’s face lit up. “Since you can still
hear some, and you know sign language, let’s form a ministry for the hearing
impaired.”
   Willie and Noah began visiting hearing-impaired Adventists and invit-
ing them to meet for worship on the university campus. Willie can still hear
enough to interpret for the group of grateful believers.
   The members welcomed the hearing-impaired believers and are helping
with transportation to and from the campus outside the city. The group is
growing and now includes ten regular members plus visitors.
   When the church pastor invited Willie to preach for church, he agreed, sign-
ing his own sermon for his hearing-impaired friends who attended. The next
month Willie invited Noah to preach and the hearing-impaired group to lead
out in Sabbath School. Willie interpreted for the hearing congregation.
   “I have a burden for the hearing impaired,” Willie says. “I’d like to upload
sermons in Pidgin sign language so that the hearing impaired can watch and
be blessed.”
   Willie is teaching sign language to other students on the Pacific Adventist
University campus so that they can help reach out to the hearing impaired.
“Almost every pastor and most other workers come across hearing-impaired
people in their ministries,” he says. “If they can sign, they can minister to these
people.”
   Willie’s ministry continues to grow as the hearing-impaired members visit
different churches each Sabbath. “Now I realize that God is using my hearing
disability to open a new ministry for others in southern Papua New Guinea.
Jesus said, ‘ “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole
world as a testimony to all nations” ’ (Matt. 24:14, NIV). The hearing impaired
are part of our world; they need to hear too.”
   Our mission offerings support Pacific Adventist University, which serves
students from Papua New Guinea and across the South Pacific Division.
Thank you.
Willie Siso is a student at Pacific Adventist University in Papua New Guinea. He is
preparing to serve God and the hearing impaired as a pastor.

      The Apostles and the Law




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 3:31, 6:15, Acts 10:9–14,
      John 15:1–11, James 2:1–26, Heb. 3:7–19, Jude 5–7.

Memory Text: “Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment
      holy and just and good” (Romans 7:12, NKJV).



      W
                  ith so much evidence for the continued validity of God’s law,
                  why do so many Christians argue against it?
                     First, some (as we have seen) look at certain New
      Testament texts that condemn a false understanding of the law’s func-
      tion but conclude that the problem is with the law itself. As a result,
      they claim that the Ten Commandments are not obligatory for those
      under the new covenant.
         Second, others are so convinced that the Sabbath is not binding on
      Christians that, in order to justify this position, they claim that all the
      commandments have been crucified with Jesus on the cross.
         Third, some argue that the other nine commandments are in effect
      but that the fourth, the seventh-day Sabbath, has been superseded by
      Sunday, which is kept in honor of the resurrection of Jesus.
         Numerous problems exist with all these positions. This week we’ll
      look at the attitude of Christ’s apostles concerning the law, because
      surely if it were to have been nullified or modified after Christ’s death,
      the apostles would have known something about it.

     Paul and the Law
       Paul, it has been said, was the true founder of Christianity. That is wrong,
     of course. Though Paul contributed much to our theological understanding
     of Christian doctrine, including 13 of the 27 New Testament books, practi-
     cally all the teachings in his writings can be found elsewhere in Scripture.
     The main reason why some claim that Paul started a “new” religion is the
     misconception over his teaching about law and grace.

Look at the following texts: Romans 3:28; 6:14; 7:4; and Galatians
     3:24, 25. From a first glance, why isn’t it hard to see why some think
     that these verses nullify the law?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Read in isolation, these texts definitely give the impression that the
     law is no longer relevant for the Christian. However, all these verses
     belong to a broader context that we must see in order to understand
     what Paul is truly saying.

Examine the passages in which each of the above texts occurs, pay-
     ing special attention to Romans 3:31, 6:15, 7:7–12, and Galatians
     3:21. How do these verses, as well as the context as a whole, help us
     to better understand Paul’s point about the law?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        For those who don’t understand the concept of justification by faith,
     Paul may seem to be contradicting himself. In the same breath he
     claims that the Christian is not under the law; yet the same Christian is
     obligated to keep the law. The problem is solved when we remember
     that God demands righteousness from those who claim to be in rela-
     tionship with Him. The standard of righteousness is His law. However,
     when people measure up against His law, they fall short and are there-
     fore condemned by the law. If the law were the means to salvation, then
     none would have any hope of eternal life. The hope of the Christian
     is not found in the law but in Jesus Christ, who not only kept the law
     perfectly but through God’s miraculous power allows believers to share
     in His righteousness (Rom. 8:3, 4). The Christian can now serve the law
     of God with a free conscience because Christ has taken away the law’s
     condemnation (Rom. 7:25–8:2). The grace that comes through Christ
     does not release us from the law but rather compels us to obey it.

                                                                               89
              M onday June 9

     Peter and the Law (1 Pet. 2:9)
        Peter was one of Jesus’ closest apostles. Among the first selected,
     Peter was present at many of the major events in the ministry of Jesus.
     It was he who, at Caesarea Philippi, made the declaration that Jesus was
     the Messiah; and Peter followed his Savior to the house of Caiaphas on
     the night that Jesus was arrested and tried. And on the morning when
     the resurrected Jesus appeared to the disciples by the sea, it was Peter
     who received specific instructions regarding the ministry of Christ.
     When the first group of believers gathered on the day of Pentecost,
     Peter was the chief spokesperson. Certainly, if the law had been
     changed in any way, Peter would have known.

What does Acts 10:9–14 tell us about Peter’s adherence to the Jewish
     law after Jesus’ ascension? If Peter thought this way about laws
     concerning food, what can we imagine his view was on the perpetu-
     ity of the Ten Commandments?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Peter received his vision several years after the ascension of Jesus.
     As a result of the disciples’ preaching, thousands of Jews had already
     accepted Jesus as the Messiah. There is nothing in the biblical record
     to suggest that the content of the Christian message included instruc-
     tions to reject the law. In a powerful way, the incident in Acts 10 dem-
     onstrates that the earliest Christians fully identified with their Jewish
     roots.

Compare 1 Peter 2:9 with Exodus 19:6. What is the context of
     Exodus 19:6?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        When Peter referred to his audience as a “royal priesthood, a holy
     nation” (NKJV), they would have recalled instantly the story of the giving
     of the law at Sinai. As the heirs of Israel, they were expected to abide by
     the terms of the covenant made explicit in the law of God. So immedi-
     ately after reminding the people of their status, Peter urges them to live
     lives of righteousness (1 Pet. 2:11, 12). He also warns his audience to
     be wary of false teachers promoting a law-free gospel (2 Pet. 2:21, 3:2).

      Remember how badly Peter messed up; and yet, look at the grace
      extended to him. How can we learn (1) to extend that kind of grace
      to others and (2) to accept grace for ourselves when we mess up?

     John and the Law
       John is second to Paul in the number of books contributed to the New
     Testament. This is the same John who wrote the Gospel, three letters,
     and the book of Revelation. Like Peter, he was among the first disciples
     Jesus chose, and he also had a special relationship with Jesus. Because
     of his closeness to Jesus, he is often referred to as “John the Beloved.”
     Judging from the ending of his Gospel (John 21:25), John knew a lot of
     personal information about Jesus. Surely one who was as close to Jesus
     as John would have known if Jesus had set aside God’s law.

Read John 15:1–11 and 1 John 2:3–6. What do these verses together
     tell us about how we should relate to God’s “commands”?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Toward the end of His earthly life, Jesus could testify to His disciples
     that He had been faithful to His Father’s commandments, and, as a
     result, had “remained” in His Father’s love (John 15:10). Jesus did not
     see the commandments as negative obstacles to be dismissed or dis-
     carded; rather, He saw them as guidelines for a loving relationship with
     Him and with other people. When John, the beloved disciple, reminds
     Christians of their obligation to God, he uses the same language of love
     and unity that Jesus does in the Gospel. In fact, John understood that
     love has always been the essence of the law (for example, 2 John 6). A
     person cannot claim to be keeping the law if he or she is not involved
     in loving relationships with God and other people.
        “The law of God requires that we love our fellow men as we love
     ourselves. Then every power and action of the mind must be put forth
     to that end—to do the greatest amount of good. . . . How pleasing to
     the Giver for man to hold the royal gifts of the soul so that they shall
     tell with power upon others! They are the connecting link between God
     and man, and reveal the Spirit of Christ and the attributes of heaven.
     The power of holiness, seen but not boasted of, speaks more eloquently
     than the most able sermons. It speaks of God, and opens to men their
     duty more powerfully than mere words can do.”—Ellen G. White,
     Manuscript Releases, vol. 20, p. 138.

      What is your own experience with the link between law and love?
      That is, on a personal practical level, how is love expressed by
      obedience to God’s law?
      _______________________________________________________

                                                                            91

     James and the Law
       “Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are
     called? If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture,
     ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself,’ you do well; but if you
     show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as
     transgressors” (James 2:7–9, NKJV).

       There is only one book in the New Testament that is attributed to
     James. While the author does not stipulate which James he is, it is
     generally accepted that the letter comes from James, the brother of
     Jesus. Though perhaps at first skeptical about Jesus’ Messiahship (John
     7:5), James eventually rose to an influential leadership position in the
     New Testament church (Acts 15:13, Gal. 1:19). Again, if Jesus had
     intended to abrogate the divine law, His own brother certainly would
     have known.

Read James 2:1–26. What is the basic message of the chapter? Why
     would James summarize the law as he did in verses 7–9, only then
     immediately to say what he said about keeping all the command-
     ments? How do these verses show the link between love and obeying
     God’s law?

     _________________________________________________________

        Misunderstanding Paul’s teaching on the law, some argue that James
     and Paul are opposed to each other regarding the role of the law. The
     major point of contention is over the place of works in salvation. Paul
     declares that we are saved by grace through faith apart from works
     (Eph. 2:8, 9), while James emphasizes that “faith without works is
     dead” (James 2:26, NKJV). These statements are not contradictory;
     James is merely expressing in a forceful manner what Paul had said
     numerous times about grace not nullifying the law. Like Paul in
     Romans 13:9, James fully understands that the essence of God’s law is
     love (James 2:8). No one can truly claim to keep God’s commandments
     if he or she does not demonstrate practical acts of love.

     Jude and the Law
       Jude, one of the shortest books in the New Testament, is believed to
     have been written by another brother of Jesus. While the author refers
     to himself as a “slave” of Jesus Christ, he does admit to being the
     brother of James. Because Matthew gives James and Jude as names for
     two of Jesus’ four brothers (Matt. 13:55), the Jude (sometimes called
     Judas) of this brief epistle is generally accepted to be the Savior’s
     brother. As with all the other biblical writers we have studied, Jude
     would have known if Jesus had set the law aside.
       Although Jude makes reference to neither law nor commandments,
     his entire letter is about fidelity to God and the consequences of trans-
     gressing His law.

Read Jude 4. What is he saying here that is relevant to our whole
     discussion?
     _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The very mention of grace demands the existence of law, because
     grace would not be necessary if there were no sin (Rom. 5:18–6:15).
     What these false teachers were saying was so bad that Jude equated it
     with denying the Lord Himself.

How does Hebrews 3:7–19 help to shed light on Jude 5–7? How do these
     verses together show us the relationship between obedience and faith?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In his own diplomatic style, Jude reminds his audience about the expe-
     rience of the Israelites, who had been delivered from Egyptian bondage.
     God had demonstrated His strength to them and had even given them His
     law, but when they became unfaithful, they faced terrible consequences
     that came from being separated from Him. Jude makes it very clear that
     people can, indeed, fall away, and those who do will face judgment. Jude
     is as clear as is the rest of Scripture: all who claim to have faith must be
     willing to express that faith through an obedient life.

      Read the book of Jude. Amid all his strong warnings, what prom-
      ises can you discover there for yourself?

                                                                             93

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Law in the Christian Age,”
     Signs of the Times, August 5, 1886.

       “Why should the apostles teach repentance toward God?—Because
     the sinner is in trouble with the Father. He has transgressed the law; he
     must see his sin, and repent. What is his next work?—To look to Jesus,
     whose blood alone can cleanse from all sin. Faith in Christ is necessary;
     for there is no saving quality in law. The law condemns, but it cannot
     pardon the transgressor. The sinner must depend on the merits of the
     blood of Christ. ‘Let him take hold of my strength,’ says our merciful
     Redeemer, ‘that he may make peace with me, and he shall make peace
     with me.’ Our Lord declared that he would love most to whom most
     was forgiven; and he only will feel that he needs forgiveness who sees
     himself as he is, defiled by sin, a transgressor of God’s holy law. He
     who has the fullest conviction of the sacred claims of the law, will most
     clearly see the enormity of his offenses, and will feel that he is indeed
     forgiven much.”—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, August 5, 1886.

Discussion Questions:
       Carefully read the above statement by Ellen G. White. How
      does this excerpt shed light on the biblical teachings covered in
      this quarter? What does it mean that a sinner must “depend on
      the merits of the blood of Christ”?

       Dwell more on the warning in Jude 4. If the men are proclaim-
      ing the grace of God, they obviously are believers. Yet, Jude says
      that they are denying the Lord. What serious implications does
      this have for those who claim that God’s grace nullified the law?
      When people claim the law was done away with, what are they
      really trying to get rid of?

       How does the denial of the law, or even of one of the command-
      ments, play into Satan’s hands as he seeks to “overthrow” the law
      of God?

                                                    Story
Mohammad’s New School
   Mohammad looked at the old school building and wondered what
his parents had done to him. Mohammad and his parents live in
Zamboanga, a city in the southern Philippines.
   A friend had told Mohammad’s parents about the Seventh-day
Adventist school, and they went to inspect it. They found an old
building in serious need of repair. The school’s principal assured
them that the entire school would be replaced soon. But Mohammad’s
parents didn’t see the leaky metal roof or the holes in the screens.
They saw happy children who loved their teachers and teachers who
really cared for the children. They decided to send Mohammad to the
Adventist school.
   Reluctantly, Mohammad stepped into class wondering whether he
would make any friends there. Even before class started, several chil-
dren welcomed him. At lunchtime, some boys invited Mohammad to
eat with them and join their games at recess. Maybe his new school
wasn’t so bad after all! He discovered Pathfinders and learned to love
camping and mastering new skills such as knot tying.
   Near the end of the school year, Mohammad’s teacher announced
that when they returned from summer vacation they would have a
new school. The children gladly helped their teachers box up the
textbooks, clear out the closets, and empty the shelves. Then on the
first day of vacation, the students stood a distance away and watched
their old school building tumble down.
   When Mohammad returned after school break and saw the new
school, he was amazed. Students gladly helped teachers unpack
books and move in the new desks. Mohammad likes the new school,
but he now knows that the building isn’t as important as what hap-
pens inside the classroom. “In this school I learned to love God in a
new way,” he says. “My parents are glad, and so am I.”
   One thing made Mohammad sad, however. He would soon graduate
and go on to high school, and the new Adventist high school wasn’t
                                   finished yet. “I’ll miss the friends
                                   I’ve made here,” he says. “I’ll miss
                                   praying with them.”
                                      A recent Thirteenth Sabbath Of­­fering
                                   is helping build the high school sec-
                                   tion of Zamboanga Adventist School.
                                   Perhaps Mohammad can study there
                                   after all.

      Christ’s Church and the Law




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 2:16–3:7, Genesis 6,
      Genesis 12, Deut. 7:6–12, Gal. 3:6–16, Rev. 12:17, 14:6–12.

Memory Text: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are those
      who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus”
      (Revelation 14:12, NKJV).



      I
          n a relay race, a team usually consists of four runners. Team mem-
          bers may have competed against each other at another time, but
          now, as a part of the same team, they must learn to think as one. In
      the race itself, the length of the course is equally divided between the
      participants. One team member alone can race at any given time—the
      one who is holding the baton. The baton is skillfully passed from one
      team member to the next until the race is finished. In a sense, the baton
      is the only symbol of continuity among the members of the relay team.
         God’s church is something like a relay team. Starting with Adam in
      the garden, the baton has been passed through several phases of salva-
      tion history: from Noah to Abraham to Sinai to the New Testament
      church to the Reformation church, and now to those who proclaim the
      three angels’ messages.
         The symbol of continuity for God’s church is His law, which, after
      the Fall, must always be coupled with God’s saving grace. Together,
      both are the essence of the gospel.
         This week’s lesson traces the continuity of the law (and grace) in
      God’s church through the ages.

     From Adam to Noah
       In one sense, we can speak of a “church of Christ” only since the New
     Testament era, when believers first testified to the life, death, and res-
     urrection of Jesus. However, we can see “Christ’s church” in a broader
     context. The Greek term for “church” is ekklesia. Borrowed from the
     secular world, it refers to those who have been “called out.” In every
     generation God has “called out” a people to reflect His will by lives of
     faithfulness, trust, love, and obedience.

Read Genesis 2:16–3:7. What test was given to Adam and Eve? Why
     would such a test be needed for perfect beings?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In order to be able to love, Adam and Eve had to be created as mor-
     ally free agents. They had to have the ability and the freedom to do
     wrong, even if they had no valid reason to do so. The test at the tree
     was a moral test: In what way would they use their God-given moral
     freedom?
        We know the answer.
        At the center of morality is law, God’s law, which defines good and
     evil for us (note that the tree is called the “tree of the knowledge of
     good and evil”). What’s the purpose of a law that forbids lying, steal-
     ing, and killing if these beings were incapable of doing any of those
     things to begin with? The law itself would be meaningless in a universe
     of automatons—beings able to do only good. That’s not, however, how
     God chose to create us. He couldn’t—not if He wanted beings who
     could truly love.
        Though after the Fall, Adam and Eve were to “pass the baton” to
     the next generation, humanity’s moral spiral downward was quick and
     dirty. Of their first two sons, only Abel chose to join God’s church,
     while Cain became possessed by the spirit of covetousness, lying, mur-
     der, and parental disrespect. Things went from bad to worse until evil
     overshadowed the good, and by the time of the Flood only Noah and his
     family could truly claim to be members of Christ’s church.

      How many times in the past 24 hours have you made moral
      choices, using the freedom given to us from Eden? What were
      those choices, and how much were they in harmony with God’s
      moral law?

     From Noah to Abraham (Gen. 6:5–9)
       The world into which Noah was born was worse than any society that
     has ever existed, which means that it must have been pretty bad. With
     people living for almost a thousand years, it is not difficult to see how
     evil could become ingrained in society to the point that God became
     sorry that He ever created people to begin with!

Read Genesis 6 and then answer the following questions:

       1. How are we to understand the idea that God was “sorry” that
     He had created humanity? Why does this not mean that God had
     been unaware of what was going to happen? (See Deut. 31:15–17.)

       2. Ellen G. White wrote that the designations “sons of God” and
     “daughters of men” refer to faithful men marrying unfaithful
     women. What lessons, then, can we learn from Genesis 6 about the
     church’s interaction with the world?

       4. Look at the description of Noah in Genesis 6. What does the text
     say about him that helps us to understand the kind of man that he
     was, especially in such a corrupt world? At the same time, why did
     Noah need “grace” in the eyes of the Lord? What does this tell us
     about the relationship between faith and God’s law, even back then?

     From Abraham to Moses
       After the Flood, it was the responsibility of Noah and his sons to
     share God’s will with their descendants. Noah’s family knew that global
     destruction had come to the world as a result of humanity’s refusal to
     obey God’s law, and having experienced God’s grace, they could do
     something to help develop a more faithful generation. Unfortunately,
     not too long after the Flood, the inhabitants of the earth again rebelled
     (Gen. 11:1–9). “Many of them denied the existence of God and attrib-
     uted the Flood to the operation of natural causes. Others believed in a
     Supreme Being, and that it was He who had destroyed the antediluvian
     world; and their hearts, like that of Cain, rose up in rebellion against
     Him.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 119.

What do Genesis 12 and 15:1–6 tell us, as well, about how law and
     grace work together?
      _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        God called Abraham, a descendant of Shem, and made a covenant of
     blessing with him (Gen. 12:1–3). The Bible gives no criteria for God’s
     call of Abraham. He does not appear to have had the righteous profile
     of Noah. In fact, soon after the call he proved himself to be cowardly
     and deceptive (vss. 11–13), violating God’s law. Nevertheless, Abraham
     was a man of true faith, and by God’s grace this faith was credited to
     him as righteousness. Although he was not perfect, he was willing to
     listen to the voice of God, even if it meant trusting God for things that
     seem all but impossible from a human standpoint.
        Abraham was not alone among those who were willing to lis-
     ten to God’s voice and obey His commandments. Pharaoh, the two
     Abimelechs, and Joseph were well aware that God did not approve
     of adultery and lying. The second Abimelech even rebuked Isaac for
     exposing Abimelech’s people to temptation (Gen. 26:10). Although
     God had chosen Abraham for a specific task, there were people in
     many different nations who feared Him. In fact, after Abraham and
     his military alliance had defeated Chedorlaomer and his coalition,
     Abraham was blessed by King Melchizedek, who was a “priest of the
     Most High God” (Gen. 14:18, TEV). This is more evidence that knowl-
     edge of God existed in the world at that time, even before the work and
     ministry of Moses.

                                                                          99

      From Moses to Jesus
        Though ancient law codes found in Egypt and Mesopotamia also
      provide evidence for a widespread knowledge of the principles and
      precepts found in God’s law, none of them is complete. In fact, many of
      these codes also contain laws that promote idolatry and other practices
      that God later condemned. So, God chose a people to be the stewards
      of His true law. These people were the Hebrew nation, the descendants
      of Abraham and heirs to the covenant promise made to him many cen-
      turies earlier—a promise whose ultimate fulfillment was found only
      in Jesus.

Read Deuteronomy 7:6–12. How does this passage reveal the close
      relationship between law and grace?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         When God chose Israel to be the depository for His law, He knew
      that they were an imperfect people. Nonetheless, He entrusted them
      with the task of sharing His will with other imperfect people. The very
      designation “ ‘kingdom of priests and a holy nation’ ” (Exod. 19:6, NKJV)
      shows that Israel was to be God’s mediating priesthood for the entire
      world. Israel was the one chosen to bring the truth of God’s will to the
      confused nations. And, despite Israel’s mistakes, failures, and, at times,
      outright rebellion, it was still among these people that the Messiah
      came, lived, ministered, and died, fulfilling the covenant promise made
      to Abraham many centuries earlier.

Read Galatians 3:6–16. What does Paul write that helps to better
      clarify the true meaning of the covenant promise?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Though many in ancient Israel understood the single noun form of
      “seed” to mean Israel as a single corporate entity, Paul here presents
      Jesus Himself, as the true and complete fulfillment of the covenant
      promise. So, the gospel itself, with its clear emphasis on both law and
      grace, most fully manifests and reveals the covenant.

       Think about all the long ages that passed from the time Abraham
       first received the covenant promise to the time of Christ. What
       does this tell us about the need for patience when it comes to
       trusting God?

     From Jesus to the Remnant
        Since Eden, God’s church has always been filled with fallible people.
     The very institution that was supposed to be a witness to God’s righ-
     teousness was itself in need of that same righteousness. As “the baton”
     passed from generation to generation, no runner was worthy enough to
     cross the finish line. None who received the law was able to reach its
     level of righteousness. Humanity, it appeared, was trapped in a wheel
     of futility in its quest for God’s approval.
        However, when it seemed as if all hope was gone, God sent His Son
     “to receive the baton.” As the Second Adam, Jesus came to this earth
     without sin, and through constant devotion to His Father managed to
     maintain His obedience all the way to the Cross. With His resurrection,
     Jesus crossed the finish line, for He broke the chain of death. Now,
     through the power of the Spirit, the resurrected Christ shares His righ-
     teousness with every believer. This message, always the center of the
     covenant promise, was most clearly understood after Jesus completed
     His earthly ministry, and the New Testament church began.
        Unfortunately, the Christian church—even with all this light—proved
     itself at times less faithful to the covenant than was ancient Israel, and
     deep apostasy soon took over almost everywhere. The Reformation,
     beginning in the sixteenth century, started to reverse this trend, but even
     it faltered, and many false doctrines and teachings have remained in
     the Christian world, including (as we have seen) wrong views about the
     role and purpose of the law in the life of New Covenant Christianity.
     God would call out a remnant people to restore many lost truths.

Read Revelation 12:17 and 14:6–12. How do these verses reveal both
     law and grace in God’s final warning message to the world?

      As we have seen, keeping “the commandments of God” is God’s
      appointed way of manifesting true love. In what ways, though,
      might we be outwardly keeping these commandments but not
      really manifesting love as we should? Why can’t we really be
      keeping the commandments if we don’t show love?

Further Study: “The three angels of Revelation 14 represent the people
      who accept the light of God’s messages and go forth as His agents to
      sound the warning throughout the length and breadth of the earth. Christ
      declares to His followers: ‘Ye are the light of the world.’ Matthew 5:14.
      To every soul that accepts Jesus the cross of Calvary speaks: ‘Behold the
      worth of the soul: “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
      creature.” ’ Mark 16:15. Nothing is to be permitted to hinder this work. It
      is the all-important work for this time; it is to be far-reaching as eternity.
      The love that Jesus manifested for the souls of men in the sacrifice which
      He made for their redemption, will actuate all His followers.”—Ellen G.
      White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 455, 456.
         “The theme of greatest importance is the third angel’s message,
      embracing the messages of the first and second angels. All should
      understand the truths contained in these messages and demonstrate
      them in daily life, for this is essential to salvation. We shall have to
      study earnestly, prayerfully, in order to understand these grand truths;
      and our power to learn and comprehend will be taxed to the utmost.”
      —Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 196.

Discussion Questions:
        Revelation 12:17 describes the “remnant” as those who keep
       the commandments of God and hold the testimony of Jesus. With
       the presence of hundreds of other Sabbath keeping Christian
       churches around the globe, what is the specific purpose of
       Seventh-day Adventism? What are we proclaiming and teaching
       that these other churches aren’t, even those who might be keeping
       the seventh-day Sabbath?

        Read Romans 4:3, Galatians 3:6, and James 2:23, all in context.
       How do these verses help us understand salvation by faith?

        Notice that in the first angel’s message, which begins with the
       “everlasting gospel,” there is also a proclamation that the “hour of
       his judgment has come.” So, the gospel, the law, and judgment all
       appear together in the three angels’ messages. How do we under-
       stand the role of the law and grace in judgment? How do they all
       fit together?

Taking God at His Word
   Austin’s parents worked hard, but finances were difficult. The family
had other problems, too, and felt little peace in their home. Then they
met a Global Mission evangelist who shared the Bible with the family.
Although the family had been Christians for years, this man taught a
message they had never heard before. He visited the home and studied
with Austin’s mother. After the man left, she read the Bible passages for
herself to be sure that what the man taught was true. She could find no
error in the man’s teachings. Convinced, she asked to be baptized and
to become a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. A year later,
Austin’s father also joined the Adventist Church.
   “Our financial problems didn’t clear up,” Austin says. “But we had a
peace we had never known before. We realized that no matter how big
our problems are, God can carry us through.”
   The family moved to Mumbai, a large city in western India. Austin’s
father worked hard to support the family. Mother began tutoring neigh-
borhood children to earn extra money. Joyfully, she tithed her meager
earnings. Father worried that the family wouldn’t have enough money to
meet their needs if Mother tithed, but he saw that God blessed her faith,
and more students wanted her tutoring services. Today she has more than
100 students, and Father has begun tutoring now. And he gladly returns
God’s tithe and his offerings.
   When people ask the family why they don’t tutor on Saturday, the fam-
ily shares God’s love through His commandments. There is no Adventist
church in the area where the family lives, so they welcome those who
wish to worship to their home on Sabbath. About 15 people regularly
attend, ten of whom are baptized members.
   Austin’s parents have been strong examples of sharing God’s love with
others. His mother visits homes of those in need and shares what she can
along with God’s Word. Many people know the truth now because of her
ministry. Austin and his brother also are sharing God’s truth with teach-
ers and fellow students and inviting them to worship in their home. “It’s
a great privilege to have a part in spreading the everlasting gospel,” he
says. “I’m grateful for the faithfulness of that Global Mission evangelist
who first taught my parents God’s truth. It’s changed our lives forever.”
   Our mission offerings help support the work of Global Mission in the
most spiritually needy places in the world. Thank you for sharing your
mission offerings so that those like Austin’s family can respond to God’s
message of love.

Austin Navis and his parents share their faith in Mumbai, India.

      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:8, 9; Dan. 2:44; 1 Pet.
      2:11; 1 Cor. 6:9–11; Rev. 22:14, 15; 1 Cor. 15:26.

Memory Text: “ ‘But this is the covenant that I will make with the
      house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My law in
      their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and
      they shall be My people’ ” (Jeremiah 31:33, NKJV).



      I
          n 2011 Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, died. He was 56. Years
          earlier, after a bout with cancer, Jobs called death “the single best
          invention of life” because it forced us to achieve the best we could
      here. In other words, because our time is so limited, we must try to be
      as successful as we can now.
         Jobs, though, got it backward. What pushed him to seek a greater
      stake in this world, death (or at least the inevitability of it), should have
      been what revealed the futility of putting down roots too permanently
      here, in what’s always shallow ground. Sure, Jobs accomplished a lot,
      but in contrast to a million years or to eternity, what does it matter?
         Indeed, we have been promised that this world and all that’s in it will
      be destroyed, and God will establish a new and eternal world where sin
      and death (all the result of the violation of God’s law) will never exist.
         This week we’ll look at the question of God’s eternal kingdom and
      the role of the law in relation to it.

     The Kingdom of God
       When God created the first human beings, He gave them dominion
     over all things. Adam was to rule the world. However, through violating
     God’s law, he forfeited his right to earthly sovereignty, and ownership
     went to the archenemy, Satan. When the representatives from the other
     worlds gathered before God during the time of the patriarchs, it was
     Satan who appeared as the “delegate” from earth (Job 1:6).

Read Ephesians 2:2; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Matthew 4:8, 9. What do these
     verses tell us about Satan’s power in this world?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       What happened during the wilderness temptations is very revealing.
     Satan offered to give Jesus rulership over all the earthly kingdoms if
     Jesus would fall down and worship him (Matt. 4:8, 9; see also Luke
     4:5–7). Jesus came to take the world back from Satan, but He could do
     so only at the cost of His life. How strong, then, the temptation must
     have been when Satan stood there and offered to give the world to Him!
     However, in bowing to Satan, He would have fallen into the same trap
     as had Adam and, consequently, would also have been guilty of violat-
     ing His Father’s law. Had He done so, the plan of salvation would have
     been aborted, and we’d be dead in our sins.
       Of course, we know that Jesus stayed victorious, and, in His victory,
     we have the assurance and promise of our own, which is life in God’s
     everlasting kingdom, the one depicted in Daniel 2, when the stone cut
     out without hands destroys all kingdoms of this world. And then, after-
     ward, “ ‘the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be
     destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall
     break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand
     forever’ ” (Dan. 2:44, NKJV).

      All the kingdoms depicted in Daniel 2 did everything predicted
      about them, including the continued disunity in Europe, symbol-
      ized by the iron and clay in the toes of the statue. Why should
      these incredible facts help us trust in the promise of the last
      kingdom, the one that will “stand forever”?

      Citizens of the Kingdom
         In many nations, those who move there from other countries
      have to surrender all allegiances to their land of birth if they want
      citizenship in their new country. However, some countries allow a
      person to hold dual citizenship; that is, they can pledge allegiance
      to both places.
         There’s no such thing as dual citizenship, however, in the great
      controversy. We are on one side or the other. The kingdom of evil
      has been battling the kingdom of righteousness for millennia, and
      it is impossible for a person to be faithful to both at the same time.
      We all have to make a choice about whose kingdom will have our
      allegiance.

Read 1 Peter 2:11, Hebrews 11:13, Ephesians 2:12, Colossians 1:13,
      Deuteronomy 30:19, and Matthew 6:24. What do these texts tell us
      about the impossibility of “dual citizenship” in the great contro-
      versy between Christ and Satan? What role does keeping the law
      have in helping to show where our citizenship truly resides? See
      Rev. 14:12.

        Once people make a decision to follow Christ, they have chosen to
      turn their back on the devil’s kingdom. He or she is now part of another
      commonwealth, that of the Lord Jesus Christ, and as a result the person
      now obeys His rules, His law, His commandments, not those of the
      devil. The person’s obedience, however, isn’t universally appreciated—
      certainly not by the devil, who is anxious to get these people back, and
      often not by other people as well, who tend to distrust the “strangers
      and pilgrims” among them. Despite these obstacles, God has a people
      whose first allegiance is to Him, not to the “ruler of this world” (John
      12:31, NKJV).

       So often foreigners in a country stand out because they are dif-
       ferent. How should we, as Seventh-day Adventists, as “strangers
       and pilgrims here,” stand out, as well? Or do we?

     Faith and the Law
        The dominant theme in Scripture is simple: God is love. God’s love
     is most potently demonstrated in His grace. With His unlimited power,
     He could easily have wiped humanity from the face of the earth, but
     instead He chose to exercise patience and give all a chance to experi-
     ence the fullness of life in His eternal kingdom. Even more so, His love
     is revealed in the price that He Himself paid at the Cross.
        God’s love is also directly related to His justice. Having provided
     countless opportunities for people to choose their own destiny,
     the God of love will not force them into a kingdom that they have
     rejected. When the wicked stand before God’s throne in the judg-
     ment, they are condemned by their own testimony. No one who stands
     before the throne can truthfully say that he was unaware of God’s
     requirements. Whether through written or natural revelation, all have
     been exposed to the basic principles of the law of God (Rom. 1:19,
     20; 2:12–16).

Read 1 Corinthians 6:9–11 and Revelation 22:14, 15. Who gets into
     God’s kingdom, who stays out, and why? What role does God’s law
     play here? Also, notice the stark contrast between the two groups!

       What’s fascinating is that if you put 1 Corinthians 6:11 together with
     Revelation 22:14, you get faithful Christians who are justified in the
     name of the Lord Jesus Christ; that is, they are “justified by faith apart
     from the deeds of the law” (Rom. 3:28, NKJV); yet, they also keep that
     law.

      “It is no arbitrary decree on the part of God that excludes the
      wicked from heaven: they are shut out by their own unfitness for
      its companionship. The glory of God would be to them a consum-
      ing fire. They would welcome destruction, that they might be
      hidden from the face of Him who died to redeem them.”—Ellen
      G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 18. How do these words help us to
      understand better the painful topic about the fate of the lost?

      The Everlasting Kingdom
         God created a perfect world. Sin entered, and that perfect world
      became severely marred. The story of redemption tells us that Jesus
      entered human history so that, among other things, the original perfec-
      tion will be restored. The redeemed will live in a perfect world where
      love reigns supreme.
         As we have seen, love can exist only in a moral universe, only in a
      universe with moral beings, and to be moral they must also be free. This
      prompts the question: could evil arise again?

How do Daniel 7:27, John 3:16, and Revelation 21:4 help to answer the
      question about whether evil will arise again? What is the signifi-
      cance of the term everlasting?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         When God created the universe, there were conditions attached to its
      stability. This is most evident in Genesis 2:17, where Adam was warned
      that violation of God’s expressed command would result in death. The
      very mention of death indicates that the concept of eternity from a
      human perspective was conditional. Adam would have experienced
      eternal life only if he maintained loyalty to God.
         However, in the re-created earth, death will no longer be a reality,
      which means that we will live forever, a fulfillment of the many prom-
      ises of Scripture. Whether rebellion could occur is really a moot point.
      The fact is, it won’t.

Read Jeremiah 31:31–34. What principle do we see here that helps us
      to understand why evil won’t rise again?

         The Messianic kingdom will comprise people who maintained loyalty
      to God throughout their religious experience. In the face of persecution
      and personal struggles, they chose the path of obedience and demon-
      strated their willingness to live lives of divine service. God promises to
      inscribe His law in their hearts so that they will naturally do the things
      that are pleasing to Him. In the kingdom of Christ, sin is entirely van-
      quished, and righteousness reigns supreme.

     The Law in the Kingdom
        Of all the harsh consequences of sin, death has been the most per-
     sistent. Sin can be overcome, Satan can be resisted, but with just two
     known exceptions (Enoch, Elijah) out of billions, who has escaped the
     inevitability of death? “When it comes to death,” wrote an ancient phi-
     losopher, “we human beings all live in an unwalled city.”

What message is found in Revelation 20:14 and 1 Corinthians 15:26?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        With the power ascribed to death, it is no wonder that just before
     Christ establishes the Messianic kingdom on earth, He will first utterly
     destroy death.
        There is no question that death is related to sin, which means it’s
     related to God’s law, as well; because sin is violation of God’s law.
     Consequently, there can be no sin without the law. Although sin is
     dependent on the law, the law is independent of sin. That is, the law can
     exist without sin. In fact, it did for all the ages until Lucifer rebelled
     in heaven.
        “When Satan rebelled against the law of Jehovah, the thought that
     there was a law came to the angels almost as an awakening to some-
     thing unthought of. In their ministry the angels are not as servants, but
     as sons. There is perfect unity between them and their Creator.”—Ellen
     G. White, Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 109.
        With this in mind, the absence of death and sin in the kingdom of
     God does not require the absence of the law. Just as the law of grav-
     ity is necessary for the harmonious interaction between the physical
     elements of the universe, God’s moral law is needed to govern the
     righteous interaction between the saints. When God inscribes His law
     in the hearts of the redeemed, His sole purpose is to seal their decision
     to walk in the way of righteousness for eternity. Consequently, His law
     becomes the very essence of His kingdom. So we have every reason to
     believe that the principles of God’s moral law will exist in God’s eternal
     kingdom. The difference, of course, is that those principles will never
     be violated there as they have been here.


      Try to imagine the perfect environment of heaven: no fallen
      natures, no devil to tempt us, no sin, and no death. Now ask
      yourself: what things in your life and character would not fit very
      comfortably in such an environment?

                                                                          109

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “Without a Wedding Garment,”
      pp. 307–319, in Christ’s Object Lessons.

        “Satan had claimed that it was impossible for man to obey God’s
      commandments; and in our own strength it is true that we cannot obey
      them. But Christ came in the form of humanity, and by His perfect
      obedience He proved that humanity and divinity combined can obey
      every one of God’s precepts. . . .
        “The life of Christ on earth was a perfect expression of God’s law,
      and when those who claim to be children of God become Christlike
      in character, they will be obedient to God’s commandments. Then
      the Lord can trust them to be of the number who shall compose the
      family of heaven. Clothed in the glorious apparel of Christ’s righteous-
      ness, they have a place at the King’s feast. They have a right to join
      the blood-washed throng.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons,
      pp. 314, 315.

Discussion Questions:
        Read the Ellen G. White statement in Friday’s further study. In
       what ways are both law and grace revealed in it? Why is it crucial
       that we always understand them both together? What happens
       when these concepts are taught apart from each other?

        The introduction to this week’s lesson talked about the late
       Steve Jobs and his claim that the specter of death, our own death,
       should drive us to accomplish all that we can here. Though there’s
       some truth to that idea, in and of itself it’s not enough. It never
       solves the problem of death itself and what death does to the
       meaning of the lives that precede it. In fact, after Jobs’ death, the
       cover of the New Yorker magazine depicted Peter, iPad in hand,
       checking Steve Jobs in at the pearly gates. Though that might be
       cute, what lesson can we learn from the fact that there probably
       won’t be any iPads, or anything that Steve Jobs created here, in
       heaven?

        What things are on the earth now that will last forever? What
       won’t last past the final destruction of this world? Why is it crucial
       that we know the difference between them?

                                                    Story
A Place to Share
   When Stephanie found life difficult in her public school in Denmark, her
parents enrolled her in the local Seventh-day Adventist school. The family
wasn’t Adventist, but Stephanie quickly made friends and settled into her
new school.
   The school’s religious teachings in Bible class seemed strange, but
Stephanie’s new friends talked to her about their faith, and she began to
understand that the Adventist Church simply follows the Bible. Her friends
invited her to Sabbath School and offered to take her to spend the entire day
with them.
   Stephanie found worship on Sabbath refreshing and vibrant. When she
was 12, she gave her life to Christ. But her parents objected when she asked
to be baptized. They wanted her to join their traditional church. Reluctantly,
Stephanie attended her parents’ church catechism classes, but her heart
wasn’t in it.
   Stephanie was pleased when her parents allowed her to attend the
Adventist boarding high school. The school provided a stable faith environ-
ment, and her friends and teachers became her family. Finally, when she was
17, Stephanie convinced her mother to give her permission to be baptized.
“My friends and my teachers nurtured my faith and helped me grow strong.”
   Stephanie is now studying in a nearby university. She joined an Adventist
café church, a church plant focused on reaching young people. The café
church meets in the afternoon in the basement they share with a traditional
Adventist congregation. About thirty young people attend worship each
week. The youth-oriented congregation has formed small groups that meet
for Bible study and prayer. They also hold social meetings with refreshments
to attract community members. Anyone is invited.
   During the town’s yearly festival, the café church provides activities to
draw young people to their booth. “We serve homemade waffles, offer a
bouncing castle for some fun, and have short singing times during which
we invite visitors to come to the café church on Sabbath afternoon. And we
get many interests,” Stephanie adds.
   While interest in religion in postmodern and secular Denmark is fading,
outreach programs such as café churches and international church congre-
gations are drawing those wanting to know who God is.
   Our mission offerings help to fund Adventist schools such as the ones
Stephanie attended, where she met her Savior. Recent Thirteenth Sabbath
Offerings have helped support outreach in Denmark by providing less
traditional worship services such as the café church for young adults and
international churches that attract guest workers and international students
who come to the country seeking a vibrant worship experience. Thank you
for helping revive the Adventist Church in Denmark.
Stephanie Behrendt shares her faith in Denmark.

2014       Bible Study Guide for the Third Quarter
   During the third quarter guide of 2014, The Teachings of Jesus by Carlos
Steger, we will study some of Jesus’ main teachings as found in the Gospels.
Our Savior taught many things pertaining to our spiritual and practical lives.
He presented His teachings to different audiences, carefully adapting His
method to each person. Sometimes He preached a sermon; other times He dia-
logued with individuals or groups. Sometimes He spoke openly; other times
He concealed the meaning of His words. In each case, He taught truth about
God and salvation.
   When we open the Scriptures next quarter and read Jesus’ words, let us pic-
ture ourselves among His attentive listeners at the mountainside, by the sea, or
in the synagogue. Let us pray for spiritual discernment to understand His mes-
sage and to grasp His unfathomable love manifested on the cross. And as we
hear His voice calling us to follow Him, let us renew our commitment to walk
daily with Him by faith and in obedience. The more time we spend at His feet,
the more we will say, as did the two disciples of Emmaus: “ ‘Did not our heart
burn within us . . . while He opened the Scriptures to us?’ ” (Luke 24:32, NKJV).
