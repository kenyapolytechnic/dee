                Sabbath School Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Con-
                ference Administrative Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study

The Master of Discipleship

I       n the beginning God created a perfect, sinless world. Human beings enjoyed
        the privilege of honoring, worshiping, and following their Creator. Life should
        have continued thus for eternity.
   Christ’s sacrifice provided our only hope. Calvary’s redemption offers us freedom
and our only escape from insignificance and meaninglessness. Sinful humans are
offered liberty, forgiveness, and the opportunity for restoration to their original state.
   God beckons believers everywhere to become heralds of this matchless grace—ambas-
sadors who communicate this divine redemption to those enslaved by Satan, calling them to
follow, worship, and praise their Maker. Christ’s example of d­ isciple-making must become
the model that believers follow in answering the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19, 20).
   Therefore, the topic of this quarter is discipleship. Though the term has many
facets, in this study we will look at discipleship as the process by which we become
followers of Jesus and, as such, better soul winners.
   After all, Jesus is every Christian’s example, especially in the work of soul win-
ning. Is it illogical to suppose that the keys to effective evangelism are discovered
in popular psychology, mass-marketing techniques, and elaborate promotional
programs, rather than in following the simple example of Christ?
   How did Jesus attract His followers? What can we learn from Christ’s
example that would enable us to more effectively lead others to Him? How can
we fulfill the Great Commission?

   How did Jesus appeal to such diverse groups: the wealthy and the destitute, the
religious and the irreligious, the politically powerful and the powerless? How did Jesus
unlock callous hearts, inspire hope among outcasts, gently awaken the child’s tender
heart, and leap over ethnic and social barriers in order to make disciples? How did He
penetrate the fortresses of wealth and power, open the cocoons of spiritually arrogant
religious leaders, or revive hope among those fighting
terminal illnesses?
                                                              A comprehensive under-
   These are not merely discussion questions that stimu-
late intellectual interchange; rather, they are a crucial standing of discipleship is
area of study for Christians whose passionate desire is incomplete until it incor-
to follow Jesus’ example of guiding lost sheep to the porates a passionate desire
loving Shepherd.
                                                              to follow Jesus and, as a
   Paul also challenged believers to follow him as he
followed Christ. It is unthinkable that believers in the supernatural result, a pas-
twenty-first century should accept a lower standard sionate desire to lead oth-
than that which Paul established in the first century.        ers to Christ, as well.
   In the end, following Jesus vastly exceeds the limit-
ing view that discipleship equals methods for correcting
aberrant behaviors and habits, however important these changes are. A comprehensive
understanding of discipleship is incomplete until it incorporates a passionate desire to
follow Jesus and, as a supernatural result, a passionate desire to lead others to Christ,
as well.
   Or, as we have so eloquently been told: “No sooner does one come to Christ than
there is born in his heart a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he
has found in Jesus; the saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his heart.
If we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ and are filled with the joy of His
indwelling Spirit, we shall not be able to hold our peace. If we have tasted and seen that
the Lord is good we shall have something to tell. . . . There will be an intensity of desire
to follow in the path that Jesus trod.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, pp. 78, 79.
   Thus, our subject for this quarter.

 Miss prayer meeting?
If you missed the 7:00 prayer meeting in your church, you can still join the virtu-
al prayer chain of believers who are praying at 7 am and 7 pm, seven days a week,
  for the Holy Spirit’s presence in our families, leaders, churches, and communi-
 ties. By praying wherever you are, at any hour, on the hour, you will unite with
       thousands of others who are praying where they are around the world.


   “A chain of earnest praying believers should
 encircle the world . . .to pray for the Holy Spirit”
                        (Review and Herald, January 3, 1907).

      Disciples and                        Scripture



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 4:1–12, Matt. 12:3–8,
      Matt. 5:17–39, Luke 24:13–32, Acts 1:16–20.

Memory Text: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye
      have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me” (John 5:39).



      U
              sing a metal detector purchased from a rummage sale,
              Englishman Terry Herbert discovered gold-plated Anglo-
              Saxon weaponry and silver artifacts buried beneath a farmer’s
      field. The estimated monetary value of the find exceeded $5 million
      in U.S. dollars.
         Like someone seeking treasure in a field of dirt, rocks, and rubbish,
      we must be careful not to let things get in our way and make us miss
      the real treasure above: Jesus Christ. Searching for eternal riches,
      Pharisees and Sadducees alike “excavated” the ancient sacred writ-
      ings. Ironically, their treasure map, Scripture, had been so radically
      misread that they missed the point—Jesus—completely.
         Explicitly and implicitly Jesus incorporated Scripture into His
      disciple-making methodology. The ultimate “treasure quest” was rooted
      in the prophetic writings, which pointed to Him. Thus, to miss Jesus is
      to miss the mark. All this means, then, is that all our disciple-making
      endeavors must, ultimately, be about Jesus and that which He has done
      for us.

     Jesus and the Bible
      Because Jesus is the example for all believers, His level of commit-
     ment to Scripture becomes more than a matter of passing interest.

Read Luke 4:1–12 and 16–21. What do these passages suggest about
     Christ’s attitude toward the Bible?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The narrative of Christ’s wilderness temptations shows that, by quot-
     ing Scripture, Jesus rebuffed every satanic challenge and invitation. The
     Scripture scrolls were not likely available to Christ during this 40-day
     desert sojourn. This clearly indicates that Christ had committed sub-
     stantial portions of Scripture to memory. While the Scriptures quoted
     in the wilderness were taken from the writings of Moses, Jesus quotes
     elsewhere from the other parts of the Hebrew Scriptures (Matt. 21:42,
     22:44). Clearly, Christ had a widespread knowledge of Scripture.
        Notice, however, that Christ understands that the Scriptures are more
     than just a tool for overcoming temptation and achieving personal
     holiness. Jesus recognizes that Scripture points to Him. During the
     synagogue visit recorded in Luke 4:16–30, Jesus quotes Isaiah and
     then declares that this text points to Himself as the One anointed to
     release the oppressed and proclaim freedom. Jesus understood that He
     fulfilled Messianic prophecy. Thus, Jesus not only understood that the
     Bible pointed to Him, but early on in His ministry He used the Bible to
     point others to Him, as well.

      Though it’s important to know the Bible, that alone isn’t enough.
      Some of the biggest-name Bible scholars have not even been
      believing Christians. Thus, we need to ask ourselves, How can
      we make sure that our study and reading of the Bible help us to
      come to a better knowledge of Jesus and what He has done for
      us? That is, how can we make Bible study something that trans-
      forms our lives?

      The Authority of Scripture
Read the following texts. What do they tell us about the way in which
      Jesus viewed the Bible? Matt. 5:17–20, 12:3–8, 15:3–11, John 10:34–37,
      17:14–19, Luke 24:44.

         Whenever Christ debated with the religious authorities, He relied not
      on abstract philosophy, not even on personal authority, but on the teach-
      ings of Scripture. When determining right from wrong, Jesus based His
      argument on a scriptural bedrock. When opponents challenged Christ’s
      doctrinal purity, He directed them to specific passages within Scripture.
      When considering practical matters, Jesus referred listeners to divine
      revelation. Christ understood that His divinely ordained mission was to
      accomplish that which the ancient prophets had predicted.
         Contrast Christ’s exalted understanding of Scripture with the prevail-
      ing attitude often exhibited among even professed Christians today.
      Entire denominations have come to deem the Bible as interesting but,
      basically, unreliable historical manuscripts. Everything—the six-day
      Creation, the Exodus, even the bodily resurrection of Jesus (much less
      a literal Second Coming)—has been called into question, or even rele­
      gated to the status of myth.
         The implications for discipleship are clear. Why would anyone want
      to give his or her life to a cause based on nothing but myths? Instead,
      people burdened with real problems need a real Savior. Otherwise, the
      gospel becomes a tarnished treasure or, metaphorically, plastic coinage
      covered with simulated gold. From a distance, some might be fooled,
      but, upon closer examination, the plastic will suffer rejection. The only
      safe course is to follow Christ’s example of exalting, honoring, and obey-
      ing the Bible.

       Death is no myth, is it? Nor is it just a symbol. It is one of the
       harshest realities that we all face. Think through the implica-
       tions, then, of any view of the Bible that treats biblical teach-
       ings, such as the resurrection of Jesus or His second coming,
       as mere symbols or myths. Why must we, individually and as
       a church, never allow ourselves to get caught up in this satanic
       trap?

     Public Proclamation
        Jesus attracted people to Himself in various settings, including public
     ones. Scripture assumed a prominent role in Christ’s public proclama-
     tions. Direct quotations and scriptural allusions filled His sermons and
     public discourse.

Read Matthew 5:17–39. In what ways do these verses show how Christ
     utilized Scripture for public ministry?

       During Christ’s earthly sojourn, the ordinary Israelites’ relation-
     ship with Scripture was apparently highly legalistic. They looked to
     Scripture for regulations and ethical guidance. Upright behavior was
     considered the payment for eternal bliss. Jesus, however, overturned
     their legalistic notions and substituted a heart-based religion for a sys-
     tem of external controls.
       Christ-centered religion is rooted in a heart transformation that leads
     to ethical behavior. Ironically, some of the Pharisees had bypassed
     having a living relationship with God in their haste to achieve moral
     perfection. Jesus identified these shortcomings, and as a cure He beck-
     oned listeners to accept Him as Savior and Master. With Jesus as the
     internally controlling force, behavioral standards were not lowered but
     elevated. All one has to do is read the Sermon on the Mount to see just
     how elevated His moral standards were.
       “As something strange and new, these words fall upon the ears of the
     wondering multitude. Such teaching is contrary to all they have ever
     heard from priest or rabbi. They see in it nothing to flatter their pride
     or to feed their ambitious hopes. But there is about this new Teacher a
     power that holds them spellbound. The sweetness of divine love flows
     from His very presence as the fragrance from a flower. . . . All feel
     instinctively that here is One who reads the secrets of the soul, yet
     who comes near to them with tender compassion.”—Ellen G. White,
     Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 6.

      It’s easier than we think to be legalistic, judgmental, and con-
      demnatory, isn’t it? How can we protect ourselves from falling
      into these common practices?

     Personal Ministry
       Examples of Christ’s public ministry abound. Equally fascinating
     are Christ’s personal encounters, both with ordinary and elite members
     of society. These stories offer unique insights into the centrality of
     Scripture in Christ’s ministry.

Read John 13:18–20 and Luke 10:25–28, 24:13–32. What role did
     Scripture play in these passages? What purpose did Jesus have for
     quoting these particular verses? What resulted from these small
     group encounters with Scripture?

     _________________________________________________________

        Repeatedly, Christ quotes Scripture in conjunction with His calls to
     discipleship. This clearly implies that Jesus’ authority and credibility
     rested on Scripture, not merely on personal charisma. This is seen
     especially in the ways in which Jesus used the Scriptures as He worked
     with the two disciples who were on the road to Emmaus.
        “Beginning at Moses, the very Alpha of Bible history, Christ
     expounded in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. Had
     He first made Himself known to them, their hearts would have been
     satisfied. In the fullness of their joy they would have hungered for
     nothing more. But it was necessary for them to understand the witness
     borne to Him by the types and prophecies of the Old Testament. Upon
     these their faith must be established. Christ performed no miracle to
     convince them, but it was His first work to explain the Scriptures. They
     had looked upon His death as the destruction of all their hopes. Now
     He showed from the prophets that this was the very strongest evidence
     for their faith.
        “In teaching these disciples, Jesus showed the importance of the Old
     Testament as a witness to His mission.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire
     of Ages, pp. 796–799.

      Dwell on Luke 24:32, especially the phrase that their “heart[s]
      burn[ed] within.” What does that mean? When was the last time
      your heart burned within you over the truths that we have been
      given? If it hasn’t in a long time, might it be because your heart
      has grown cold? If so, how can you change?

     The Next Generation
       Without a doubt, as we have seen, Jesus places a heavy emphasis on
     the Bible. Never did He question the authority, veracity, or authenticity
     of a single Bible text. And yet, through the centuries and even today,
     many people do just that.

Read Matthew 12:15–21, Mark 1:1–3, Acts 1:16–20, 3:22–24, and
     Romans 10:10, 11. What do these texts tells us about the ways in
     which the earliest Christians viewed Scripture? What lessons can
     we take from them for ourselves and how we relate to the Bible?

     _________________________________________________________

       The earliest Christian writers continued the practice of using
     Scripture to authenticate the messiahship of Jesus of Nazareth. In
     effect, they were saying that Christianity was inextricably connected to
     God’s self-revelation through the Hebrew Scriptures.
       Jesus Himself had appealed to these sacred writings. Now Christ’s
     disciples were doing the same. Appeals to personal experience, miracles,
     and other witnesses for Christ were important and had their place; obvi-
     ously, however, nothing supplanted Scripture as the primary witness
     for Jesus.
       Christ’s earliest followers sought guidance from Scripture concern-
     ing the church’s mission, its everyday practices, and its spiritual disci-
     pline. Human speculation and guesswork were minimized; Scripture
     became preeminent. Prayerful consideration of God’s revelation was
     evident in church councils (see Acts 15). Scripture touched every facet
     of the life of the early church.
       How foolish would it be then for us, especially at the end of time, to
     have any other attitude toward the Bible?


      How can we all learn to make the Bible central to our faith and
      use it to point us to Jesus? What are practical ways in which we
      can allow the teaching of the Bible to truly impact how we live
      and how we relate to others?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Bible Teaching and Study,”
     pp. 190–192, in Education; “The Walk to Emmaus,” pp. 795–801, in
     The Desire of Ages; “Thessalonica,” pp. 221–230, in The Acts of the
     Apostles.

       “Christ in His ministry had opened the minds of His disciples to
     these prophecies. . . . Peter in preaching Christ had produced his evi-
     dence from the Old Testament. Stephen had pursued the same course.
     And Paul also in his ministry appealed to the scriptures foretelling the
     birth, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. By the
     inspired testimony of Moses and the prophets he clearly proved the
     identity of Jesus of Nazareth with the Messiah and showed that from
     the days of Adam it was the voice of Christ which had been speaking
     through patriarchs and prophets.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
     Apostles, pp. 221, 222.

Discussion Questions:
       What are some practical ways in which you can incorporate
      Scripture into your daily routine? How can you use the Bible in your
      personal witnessing?

       Why did Jesus emphasize scriptural interpretation rather than
      miracles and personal charisma? What happens if music, the health
      message, social functions, or anything else, replaces the Bible as
      being central to our faith?

       How dependent on Scripture must today’s Christians become?
      Evaluate the importance of Scripture in your church’s life regard-
      ing the establishment of priorities, the channeling of resources,
      and faithfulness to mission.

       Dwell on the fact that we have no indication in the Bible of any
      Bible writers ever calling into question the veracity or authenticity
      of any other texts. Why should that be so important to us, today, at
      a time when so many people, including many Bible scholars, seem
      to have made it their first priority to challenge the truth of the
      Bible at every level?

                                                    Story
Farmer Hildo’s Dream
   Farmer Hildo arrived in a sleepy town in central Brazil and thanked the
man who had given him a ride. He lifted his small bag of clothes and box
of herbal medicines from the cargo area of the truck and stepped to the side
of the dirt road. Hildo lived far from town and came a few times a year to
sell his herbal medicines door-to-door and to share his faith with those who
would listen.
   Farmer Hildo had become a Seventh-day Adventist several years earlier;
although there was no church nearby, he faithfully kept the Sabbath and
saved his tithe and offerings until he could attend a church.
   During his visits to town, Hildo had met 10 people who either were
Adventists or knew something about Adventists. He invited them to meet
with him whenever he was in town. One couple owned a cybercafé and
offered to meet there to watch Sabbath School and church programs on the
Internet. Hildo urged everyone he knew to come.
   The small group asked the mission office for a pastor to help them
organize and grow into a congregation. The closest pastor already had one
church and 13 companies, but he met with the believers. He helped them
organize evangelistic meetings and taught them how to visit people and
share God’s Word with them. The little congregation spent two weeks visit-
ing homes and inviting people to attend the meetings.
   Farmer Hildo was thrilled when 150 people attended the evangelistic
series and 33 were baptized. The pastor trained the members to follow up
on interests, and soon the group of believers could no longer fit in a home.
With the help of the mission, they rented a hall in which to meet.
   The new family of believers was a dream come true for Farmer Hildo,
who had worked and prayed and longed for a church for so long. When the
church became a reality, he said, “I’ve been praying for the church for 16
years.”
   Farmer Hildo didn’t live to see the little congregation worship in its
own church, but the believers are working hard to make his dream—and
theirs—a reality. Part of a recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is helping
                                         this congregation purchase or build
                                         their own simple worship center so
                                         they won’t have to move whenever
                                         the rent goes up. Thank you for
                                         helping Farmer Hildo’s dream of
                                         a church in this once-dark area to
                                         become a reality.

                                           Some members of the company Farmer
                                           Hildo helped establish in Ruberval, Brazil.

      Discipling Through
      Metaphor


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Sam. 12:1–7, Isa. 28:24–28,
      Matt. 7:24–27, 13:1–30, Luke 20:9–19.

Memory Text: “Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in par-
      ables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So
      was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: ‘I will open my
      mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the
      world’ ” (Matthew 13:34, 35, NIV).



      C
               hristianity is reasonable and logical. Intellect should be cul-
               tivated. Intellect alone, however, insufficiently expresses the
               complete human personality. Unlike robots, which are pro-
      grammed to process reason and logic, humans are capable of loving,
      feeling, hurting, crying, caring, laughing, and imagining. Thus, Jesus
      framed eternal truths in ways that went beyond mere intellect alone.
      Jesus spoke through concrete pictures drawn from everyday life in
      order to reach people where they were. Children and adults could
      understand deep truths delivered through parables wrapped in images
      and metaphors.
         Meanwhile, complex concepts such as justification, righteousness,
      and sanctification were easily grasped through the Master Storyteller’s
      art. In other words, concepts that are often difficult to grasp in ordinary
      language can be taught through symbols and metaphors.

     Old Testament Examples
Read 2 Samuel 12:1–7, Isaiah 28:24–28, Jeremiah 13:12–14, and Ezekiel
     15:1–7. How do these parables and allegories expand our under-
     standing of God’s relationship with humankind? Which objects or
     settings utilized by these prophets later appear in Christ’s parables?

        As we can see, Nathan tells a parable in order to disguise the real pur-
     pose of his visit. David implicates himself as the transgressor, thereby
     pronouncing his own sentence. Using a literary device (a parable),
     Nathan accomplishes something that otherwise might have produced
     confrontation and, perhaps, even execution (his own!).
        Isaiah’s poetic story draws from the agricultural background famil-
     iar to his listeners. Centuries later, Jesus would employ those same
     settings. Isaiah’s parable teaches about God’s unlimited mercy dur-
     ing times of punishment. The twelfth chapter of Hebrews likewise
     understands God’s punishments as tools for correction rather than
     weapons for vengeance. Divine punishments reflected their redemptive
     purposes; they were sufficient to encourage repentance, revival, and
     reformation. Nevertheless, when greater stubbornness and rebellion
     occurred, greater punishments followed.
        Jeremiah’s parable is a terrifying illustration of judgment. Whenever
     human beings frustrate God’s redemptive purpose, God eventually
     releases them to the consequences that they have chosen. Christ like-
     wise shares judgment parables with His listeners. Ezekiel uses a differ-
     ent symbol to convey a similar message.


      What is it about storytelling that makes it such a powerful way
      to express truth? What are some of your favorite stories, and why
      do you like them? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.

     Architectural Wisdom
Read Matthew 7:24–27. What do these verses contribute to our under-
     standing of Christian discipleship? Why do you think Jesus used
     this example from nature to teach such a crucial truth?

        Modern literate societies take literacy for granted. However, even
     today, numerous nonliterate societies exist. Throughout ancient his-
     tory, literacy was the exception rather than the rule. Ruling classes and
     literary specialists (scribes) obtained their power through their skill in
     reading. Thus, Jesus framed His messages within forms that everyday,
     nonliterate people could understand. (Obviously, literate listeners could
     also understand them.)
        Prior to Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press, manuscripts, in
     most places in the world, were handwritten—a time-consuming pro-
     cess. Relatively few could afford to obtain such valuable commodities.
     Therefore, oral communication through legends, parables, and similar
     devices became the standard for the conveyance of information.
        God offers salvation for the entire human race. Should it be surpris-
     ing, then, that Christ used forms of communication that could reach the
     greatest number of people? Oral tradition, transferred from generation
     to generation through simple stories, became the currency of redemp-
     tive thought.

Read Luke 14:27–33. What lessons can we glean from these stories? How
     do the metaphors here illuminate our understanding of discipleship?

        Building entails preparation. Cost estimates are developed long before
     actual construction commences. Discipleship likewise involves prepara-
     tion. Miraculous feedings, spectacular healings, and apparent success
     could lead prospective disciples to assume that following Jesus was easy.
     Jesus encouraged His listeners, however, to study the complete picture.
     Self-sacrifice, suffering, humiliation, and rejection constituted consider-
     able costs. Notice once again that Jesus chose to convey this message
     using metaphorical language when He could have just offered a checklist
     of specific drawbacks that His disciples might encounter.

     Agricultural Analogies
Read Matthew 13:1–30. What was Jesus teaching His audience about
     discipleship? What lessons can modern Christians derive from
     these metaphors?

       Christ’s parable of the sower is familiar to many readers. The setting
     for the story was commonplace for an agrarian society, something to
     which Jesus’ listeners could easily relate. The connection with disciple-
     ship is obvious. Essentially Jesus is challenging His listeners to evalu-
     ate their standing as disciples. Rather than confronting each individual
     specifically, He speaks through parables, inviting disciples to confront
     themselves. Looking into their soul’s mirror, they can evaluate their
     materialistic tendencies, review their capacity for perseverance, ana-
     lyze their worldly entanglements, and choose the lifestyle of uncom-
     promising discipleship.
       At the same time, true discipleship places judgment (condemnation)
     in the hands of the Master, not those of the disciple. Human discern-
     ment is incomplete, human knowledge partial. God alone possesses
     faultless understanding. Jesus warns, too, that satanic infiltration does
     happen. Disciples cannot surrender their judgment (discernment) to
     other professed believers because these believers may be weeds, not
     wheat. Both grow together until harvesttime.
       “In Christ’s parable teaching the same principle is seen as in His own
     mission to the world. That we might become acquainted with His divine
     character and life, Christ took our nature and dwelt among us. Divinity
     was revealed in humanity; the invisible glory in the visible human
     form. Men could learn of the unknown through the known; heavenly
     things were revealed through the earthly.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s
     Object Lessons, p. 17.

      In the parable of the sower, Jesus talked about the “deceitfulness
      of riches.” What was He talking about? How can “riches” deceive
      even those who don’t have them?

     The Revolutionary’s War
       Christ’s ministry was revolutionary but without common weapons.
     His tools were infinitely more powerful than were swords or knives.
     Life-changing words, frequently expressed through parables and meta-
     phors, became His not-so-secret weapons in the fight against evil.
       Christ’s tactics and strategies caught many leaders off guard; they
     were ill-equipped to counter the power of His appeal to the masses.
     Many of His parables contained messages that worked against the
     leaders. The religious leaders rightly saw that their influence would
     be largely curtailed wherever Christ’s message penetrated the people’s
     hearts.

Read Matthew 21:28–32 and Luke 14:16–24, 20:9–19. What powerful
     messages come through these parables? Though the parables were
     often directed to specific people, what principles here apply to us,
     no matter who we are?

       “The parable of the vineyard applies not alone to the Jewish nation. It
     has a lesson for us. The church in this generation has been endowed by
     God with great privileges and blessings, and He expects corresponding
     returns.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 296.
       No question, we have been greatly blessed by the Lord: redeemed
     by the blood of Christ, promised salvation based on His righteous-
     ness (not our own), given the assurance of eternal life, and offered
     the Holy Spirit—we have been provided with so much. It is easy,
     however, to forget all that we have, to take it for granted, or to even
     scoff at it. Like the vinedressers in the parable, we might not even
     realize the implications of that which we are doing. In the end, their
     ignorance didn’t excuse them on Judgment Day. It won’t excuse us,
     either.

      How often have you been deceived in the past about your own
      spiritual state? What have you learned from those experiences
      that could help you to avoid making the same mistakes again?

     Christ’s Creative Legacy
        After the record of Christ’s ministry is completed, the telling of
     parables seems to have disappeared from Scripture. What explains this
     phenomenon? Certainly, the largest remaining segment of the New
     Testament centers around Paul. Fourteen New Testament books have
     been attributed to Paul, and nearly half of Luke’s historical narrative
     in Acts revolves almost exclusively around Paul, as well. Though he
     didn’t use stories in the way that Jesus did, Paul still made considerable
     use of metaphors, similes, and other creative devices (see Rom. 7:1–6,
     1 Cor. 3:10–15, 2 Cor. 5:1–10). Though Paul was no storyteller, his
     presentations were neither boring nor without color. Stylistic differ-
     ences between Christ’s public discourse and Paul’s obviously exist, but
     both exhibit considerable expressive creativity.
        Other New Testament writers demonstrate a somewhat closer affin-
     ity to Christ’s use of parables. Jesus’ brother James wrote, “Suppose a
     man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring” (James 2:2, NIV)
     to begin a narrative lesson. Yet, neither Christ’s brother nor any other
     disciple utilized stories as extensively as did Christ. Simile and sym-
     bolism, however, are widespread. “He will pass away like a wild flower”
     (James 1:10, NIV). “Take ships as an example” (James 3:4, NIV). Peter’s
     vision (Acts 10) assumed symbolic form. Symbolic narratives shape
     significant portions of the book of Revelation. “When the dragon saw
     that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman” (Rev.
     12:13, NIV).

Select a couple of the following texts and identify the metaphors
     within them. What are the various messages contained within these
     verses? What imagery is used to convey the message? Acts 10:9–16,
     James 3:3–12, Rev. 12:7–17, 18:9–20, 19:11–16.

       However they are expressed, the principle remains the same: meta-
     phors, similes, parables, allegories, and other examples of creative
     language enable us to communicate in an understandable manner.
     Building upon the listener’s experiences, Christ and His disciples used
     comparisons and illustrations that stimulated an understanding of truth.
     We should, when appropriate, not be afraid to do the same.
                                                                           19

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Teaching in Parables,” pp. 17–27,
      in Christ’s Object Lessons.

         “Jesus desired to awaken inquiry. He sought to arouse the careless,
      and impress truth upon the heart. Parable teaching was popular, and
      commanded the respect and attention, not only of the Jews, but of the
      people of other nations. . . .
         “Again, Christ had truths to present which the people were unpre-
      pared to accept or even to understand. For this reason also He taught
      them in parables. By connecting His teaching with the scenes of life,
      experience, or nature, He secured their attention and impressed their
      hearts. Afterward, as they looked upon the objects that illustrated His
      lessons, they recalled the words of the divine Teacher. . . .
         “Jesus sought an avenue to every heart. By using a variety of illustra-
      tions, He not only presented truth in its different phases, but appealed
      to the different hearers.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons,
      pp. 20, 21.


Discussion Questions:
        In class, share your answer to Sunday’s question. What can you
       learn from each other’s stories?

        Jesus used images and metaphors from things with which His
       hearers were very familiar. What could you use from your own
       culture that could help convey spiritual truths?

        Though Jesus used metaphors from mostly agricultural set-
       tings, much of early Christianity was urban in nature. What
       “urban” images does one find in the writings of Paul or any of the
       other New Testament writers?

        Think through the elements that make a good story. What are
       they? How do they work? How can we learn to use these elements
       in our witness?

        Read Luke 16:19–31. What kind of story did Jesus use here?
       What lessons can we take from it about the use of fiction in the
       conveying of spiritual messages?

                                                    Story
Chipo’s Choice
   Chipo is ten years old and lives in southern Zambia. Her parents
didn’t practice any faith. But when her neighbors invited her to attend
church with them, she went. She loved learning about God and went to
church whenever she could.
   But Chipo’s father became angry when he learned that Chipo was
attending the Seventh-day Adventist Church. “Stay away from that
church,” he warned her. “Or I will punish you.” But Chipo loved Jesus
and wanted to worship Him. So when her father wasn’t home, she
would go to church. Her father found out and punished her harshly.
   But her father’s punishment didn’t keep Chipo from attending
church and learning more about Jesus, who loves her. Almost every
week, her father would punish her.
   “Why do you keep going to church when Father punishes you?”
Chipo’s sister asked.
   “God loves me, and I want to be His child,” Chipo explained. The
next Sabbath Chipo’s sister went to church with her. When their father
discovered that the girls had gone to church, he followed them and
chased them home and punished them. Chipo’s sister was afraid to
attend church when their father was home, but Chipo went.
   Chipo’s mother asked Chipo why she continued going to church
when her father punished her. “I’ve learned that Jesus loves me, and I
love Jesus!” she added. The next week her mother went to church with
Chipo. She wanted to see for herself what was so special. The pastor’s
sermon seemed to be just for her, and Chipo’s mother decided to attend
church again. When Chipo’s father returned home, her mother told her
husband what she had heard. She told him that she wanted to attend
church again and invited him to go with her. He refused, but he allowed
his wife and the girls to go. Chipo began praying that God would help
her father want to join the family at church.
   A few weeks later, Chipo’s mother again invited her husband to go
to church, and he went, though he didn’t seem happy. But after church
he apologized to Chipo and said he would attend church with the fam-
ily. A few months later, Chipo’s parents were baptized. Now instead of
chasing her from the church, Chipo’s father walks to church with her.
   “God helped me to be faithful, even when Father punished me,”
Chipo said. “God helped me bring my whole family to Jesus.”
   Our faithfulness to God in worship, in prayer, and in giving our mis-
sion offerings, makes a difference in the lives of others. Thank you for
giving to missions to reach others for Christ.

      Discipleship and                              Prayer



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Dan. 9:2–19; Matt. 14:22, 23;
      26:36; John 17:6–26; Heb. 2:17; 1 Pet. 4:7.

Memory Text: “ ‘I do not pray for these alone, but also for those
      who will believe in Me through their word; that they all may be one,
      as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in
      Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me’ ” (John 17:20, 21,
      NKJV).



      W
                hatever else we do in the work for souls, whatever outreach
                programs we create, we are to earnestly pray for those whom
                we are seeking to reach. This is central to what it means to
      be a Christian, even more so a disciple-maker. What powerful changes
      might occur if constant, fervent prayer was central to our methodology
      in seeking to make and keep disciples!
        “Let the workers grasp the promises of God, saying, ‘Thou hast
      promised, “Ask, and ye shall receive.” I must have this soul converted
      to Jesus Christ.’ Solicit prayer for the souls for whom you labor; pre­
      sent them before the church as objects for the supplication. . . . Select
      another and still another soul, daily seeking guidance from God, laying
      everything before Him in earnest prayer, and working in divine wis-
      dom.”—Ellen G. White, Medical Ministry, pp. 244, 245.

     Time-tested Compassion
       Frequently, prayer assumes a self-centered posture. Believers pre­
     sent their wish lists before God, hoping to get that which they ask for.
     Though, of course, we are told to set our petitions before God, some-
     times our motives are not pure. After all, are not our hearts corrupt,
     wicked, and deceitful? Might not our prayers, at times, simply reflect
     the sinfulness that lies within?
       Intercessory prayer, however, focuses on another person’s needs,
     thus removing the likelihood of selfish motivation. Throughout his-
     tory, intercessory prayers have represented the highest expressions of
     spiritual discourse. Untainted by the desire for personal gratification,
     these conversations demonstrate selflessness, compassion, and earnest
     longing for the salvation of others.

Read Daniel 9:2–19. What burdens Daniel throughout this prayer?
     What role does confession play within the prayer? Because of his
     advanced age, Daniel would not likely personally benefit from
     Jerusalem’s restoration. Therefore, what motivated this prayer?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Seventy years have passed since Jeremiah uttered the prophecy
     that Daniel now considers. After so many years, Daniel’s Jerusalem
     friends have likely already perished. Jerusalem’s restoration would
     not restore Daniel’s personal fortunes, either. Nothing in Daniel’s
     prayer suggests selfish concerns. The ancient prophet expressly
     implores God regarding the future of the exiled Jewish nation and
     the reputation of Jehovah Himself. Extended confession precedes his
     requests. In confession, Daniel includes himself among the disobedi-
     ent. The prophet is unwilling to presume his own innocence. Daniel
     himself takes responsibility while primarily pursuing restoration in
     order to benefit others.

      Think about your prayer life: what you pray for, why, and for
      whom. How much death to self is involved in it? How can you
      learn to be less self-centered in your prayer life? That is, how can
      your prayers, even the ones for yourself, be less selfish?

     Time for Prayer
       Think through what prayer really is: fallen, sinful beings, worthy
     of death, are able, instantly, to have direct communication with the
     Creator of the universe—our Holy God.
       Also, when God in Christ clothed Himself in human flesh, accepting
     humanity’s limitations, He, too, sensed the necessity of prayer. Though
     not standing before the Father in the same position that we as fallen
     sinners are, Jesus as a human still saw the necessity for prayer.

Read Matthew 14:22, 23; 26:36; Mark 1:35–37; and Luke 5:15, 16; 6:12,
     13. What characterized Jesus’ personal prayer life? Describe the
     circumstances that surrounded Jesus’ praying. What lessons can we
     glean from the particulars of Christ’s prayer life, such as the fre-
     quency, location, and timing?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Christ certainly modeled the prayer life that He enjoined on His dis-
     ciples. Mornings, evenings, after preaching, before preaching, whenever
     possible—Jesus prayed. Gardens, mountains, solitary places, wherever
     distractions subsided—Jesus prayed. Separated from the Father’s pres-
     ence spatially, Jesus united with the Father through prayer spiritually.
     Christ’s spiritual lifeblood came coursing through the spiritual artery
     of prayer. Should Christ’s modern followers—weakened by sinful
     tendencies, choked by worldly cares, frustrated by failures—settle for
     something less than Jesus’ prayer life?
        “Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that it
     is necessary in order to make known to God what we are, but in order
     to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but
     brings us up to Him.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 93.

      Read Mark 11:22–26, Luke 11:13, John 14:12–14. How are we to
      understand the promises written here about prayer? How have
      you experienced what Jesus said here? At the same time, how
      have you learned to cope when things you have prayed for haven’t
      happened the way that you had hoped?

     Timeless Teaching
        Prayer miraculously bonds finite souls with their infinite Creator.
     Prayer is spiritual adhesive. Bonded with the heavenly Father, believers
     transcend their earthly natures and sinful tendencies. This transforma-
     tion separates them from the world. Should Satan successfully recast
     prayer into a self-centered mold, thus robbing prayer of its potential
     for our transformation, we might be powerfully compromised and our
     witness stymied.

Read Matthew 6:7, 8; 7:7–11; 18:19, 20. What do these verses teach us
      about prayer?

     _________________________________________________________

        The sincere believer trusts in God’s ability to honor His promises.
     Never has anyone lodged a request that intimidates God. His authority
     is unlimited, His strength unmatched. God’s people approach heaven’s
     portals with trust in the Lord—that He will do what is best for us, even
     if we can’t see it at the time. Faith is not simply trusting in what we can
     see; true faith is trusting God when we can’t see the outcome that we
     want and anticipate (see Heb. 11:1–7). No doubt, as long as you serve
     the Lord, as long as you walk in faith, you will have to trust in God
     even when you don’t see things working out as you had hoped, or even
     prayed for. Even a quick reading of the Bible will show you that you
     will not be alone, either.

Read Matthew 6:9–15, 26:39. What do these verses teach?

     _________________________________________________________

       Trust should not be confused with arrogance or insolence. Boldly
     approaching God’s throne involves no sense of entitlement. The
     believer’s demeanor is characterized by boldness and humility. In
     Gethsemane, Christ plainly declared His preference but concluded,
     “ ‘Not My will, but Yours’ ” (Luke 22:42, NKJV). In addition to com-
     plete surrender, a forgiving spirit is another indication of humility. We
     ourselves, having been forgiven so much, must do the same to others.

      Are you angry with someone, finding it hard to forgive? Take it to
      the Lord in prayer. Pray for yourself that you will learn to forgive.
      Pray for that person. Over time, what do you think will happen?

     Timeless Compassion
        Christ was the embodiment of perfection; that is, all God’s perfec-
     tions were revealed in Him. Thus, was anyone ever more compassionate
     than Christ? Who possessed a stronger desire than Jesus to alleviate
     human distress?
        We, therefore, ask, What relationship did Christ’s compassion and
     intercession have with discipleship?

Read Luke 22:31, 32 and John 17:6–26 (see also Heb. 2:17). How did
     Jesus’ identification with humanity influence His intercessory
     prayers? What are the ultimate objectives of Christ’s intercessory
     prayers?

        Jesus could effectively intercede on His disciples’ behalf because He
     was actively engaged in their lives, thoroughly understood them, and
     passionately desired their good. Effective intercession today demands
     nothing less. The twenty-first century disciple-maker will discard
     time-consuming pursuits that interfere with his or her relationships
     with lost souls. Making money, achieving fame, even educational
     excellence must become subservient to the greater goal of the redemp-
     tion of the lost. This is an important truth that so easily slips from
     sight, because we are so often caught in the daily grind of living.
        Jesus invested Himself in the lives of His disciples. He visited their
     homes, became acquainted with their relatives, spent leisure time in
     their company, and worked alongside them. Nothing significant to
     their lives escaped His notice. Disciple-making today requires more
     than tract distribution and airtight biblical argumentation. Praying in
     a sympathetic consciousness of another’s distress, and with a passion-
     ate desire to alleviate that distress, is still the standard of intercessory
     prayer in effective disciple-making.
        Though it can sound quaint, there’s a lot of truth in the statement
     “People care little about what you know until they know how much you
     care.”

      Timeless Compassion Replicated
        The sincerest offering of praise is imitation. Christ’s earliest disciples
      imitated their Master’s prayer life. Naturally, they prayed for personal
      safety, for their daily necessities, and for individual spiritual guidance.
      Nevertheless, intercessory prayer became an important component of
      their discipleship.

Read Acts 1:13, 14; 1 Timothy 2:1–4; James 5:13–16; 1 John 5:16; Jude
     20–22; and 1 Peter 4:7. What role did prayer assume in the early
     church? What were some of the specific situations for which they
     prayed? What can we learn from these examples?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Constant prayer anchored the early church. Whenever Paul departed
      for missionary purposes, he was commissioned through prayer (Acts
      13:3, 14:23). Even their farewells were clothed in prayer (Acts 20:36,
      21:5) Frequently their prayers assumed the form of intercession. They
      prayed for government leaders, fellow believers, and, generally speak-
      ing, everyone! Paul interceded for the father of Publius, the chief
      official who suffered from dysentery. Even when he lay dying, Stephen
      interceded for his murderers. The centrality of prayer among the earli-
      est believers can hardly be overstated. Scripture says that prayer pleases
      God because He desires salvation for everyone and seeks the advance-
      ment of truth. Through prayer—combined with apostolic teaching, fer-
      vent preaching, miraculous wonders, and loving fellowship—the early
      church rapidly multiplied. Despite vigorous persecution, Christianity
      enveloped the empire. Thousands upon thousands accepted the gospel.
      Transformed lives burned as living lights from Caesar’s palace to points
      unknown.

       How much time do you spend in intercessory prayer? Think
       through your answer. Better yet, perhaps the question should be,
       How much more time should you spend in intercessory prayer?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “A Reformatory Movement,”
     p. 126, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9; “By Personal Efforts and
     Living Faith,” pp. 244, 245, in Medical Ministry.

        “He who does nothing but pray will soon cease to pray, or his prayers
     will become a formal routine. When men take themselves out of social
     life, away from the sphere of Christian duty and cross bearing; when
     they cease to work earnestly for the Master, who worked earnestly for
     them, they lose the subject matter of prayer and have no incentive to
     devotion. Their prayers become personal and selfish. They cannot pray
     in regard to the wants of humanity or the upbuilding of Christ’s king-
     dom, pleading for strength wherewith to work.”—Ellen G. White, Steps
     to Christ, p. 101.

Discussion Questions:
       Why does an absence of intercessory prayer stunt the growth
      of the church? Conversely, how does an active intercessory prayer
      life stimulate disciple-making activity? What are the keys to effec-
      tive intercessory prayer? How can the intercessor know what to
      pray about?

       What should members do on behalf of those for whom they
      pray that would go beyond their private petitions at home? How
      can members build relationships with the neighbors, relatives, and
      coworkers for whom they pray? Why should private prayers for
      others always be accompanied by sustained efforts to be friends
      with those same people?

       What steps should twenty-first-century Christians take to expe-
      rience dynamic prayer lives? What is the relationship between
      successful disciple-making and the encountering of God’s divine
      presence through prayer? Can prayer change those prayed for
      without first changing those who pray for them? How might the
      subject matter for prayer be altered by having passion for lost
      souls? What impact does personal holiness and prayer have on the
      would-be soul winner’s capacity for the sharing of truth?

       What specific things can believers do to expand their contacts
      with those who have not accepted Christ? What can Christians do
      to get beyond surface relationships with their peers so that they
      will know specific needs for which to pray?

Walking by Faith
   Rex lay in bed, unable to move his legs. The doctor’s words hung
heavy in the air. “You’ll never walk again,” he had said.
   What will happen to my family? Rex wondered. Rex knew that his own
stubbornness had put him where he was.
   Two years earlier, Rex’s uncle had offered to pay his daughters’ tuition
if Rex enrolled them in the Seventh-day Adventist school. Rex agreed.
Soon the girls asked to attend Sabbath School. His wife went with them,
but Rex said he had to work.
   Rex went to special meetings at church after work, and he became
convinced that what Adventists taught was the truth. But he resisted the
invitation to surrender his life to God. He smoked and he drank, and
he wasn’t sure he could quit. But he did agree to study the Bible with a
believer during his lunch hour.
   When Rex’s wife wanted to be baptized, Rex urged her to do so. “I
may follow one day,” he’d said.
   Then after months of studying the Bible, Rex agreed to be baptized.
He hoped that baptism would change him. But it didn’t. He was the same
man he had been before. He didn’t let God rule his life.
   Then the accident changed everything. Rex had tried to solve his
problems himself. Now he was helpless. The pastor and church members
visited Rex and encouraged him to trust God. Rex prayed for forgive-
ness, and again he surrendered his life to God. But this time, he meant it.
Rex asked God for healing and promised that no matter what, he would
put his faith in God and attend church as soon as he was able.
   During his months in bed, Rex spent hours praying and reading his
Bible. As he grew spiritually, he felt his body grow stronger. A year after
the accident, Rex took his first wobbly steps. Six months later, he could
walk without pain.
   Rex kept his promise and attended church with his family. He praised
God for every degree of healing. He found work. It didn’t pay as much
as his old job, but Rex found that even after returning tithe and offerings,
the money went further.
   “The accident that crippled me brought healing to my soul,” Rex says.
“I’m grateful that God used the Adventist school to help my family find
salvation in Jesus.”
   Our mission offerings support schools, medical clinics, and many
other outreach services in India and around the world. Thank you for
giving to missions.


Rex and his family live in southeastern India.

      Discipling                   Children



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 127:3–5; Deut. 6:6, 7;
      Luke 2:40–52; Matt. 18:1–6; 10–14; Mark 10:13–16.

Memory Text: “ ‘Do you hear what these children are saying?’
      they asked him. ‘Yes,’ replied Jesus, ‘have you never read, “From
      the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise”?’ ”
      (Matthew 21:16, NIV).



      I
          n our desire to preach to the world and to make disciples from every
          nation, we must not forget a whole class of people—children.
             Christian studies regarding children and youth differ about many
      things. Nevertheless, across denominational lines one thing seems con-
      sistent: the majority of Christians have committed their lives to Christ
      at a relatively young age. Fewer converts come from the older populace.
      Many churches apparently miss this important fact in their evangelistic
      planning, directing the greatest proportion of their resources toward the
      adult population. Christ’s earliest disciples also seem to have underes-
      timated the value of children’s ministry. Jesus rejected that attitude and
      made room for children, even giving them priority.
         Hence, we must do the same.

     The Hebrew Child’s Advantage
        Hebrew children enjoyed special treatment when compared with
     their ancient counterparts from surrounding nations. Child sacrifice
     as divine appeasement had permeated many cultures. Otherwise,
     children’s value was often measured by their economic contributions
     to society. Work productivity, not intrinsic worth, defined their rela-
     tionship with the adult world. It is painful to say that some of these
     attitudes, especially when it comes to economic worth, are found even
     in our present world. Truly, the day of wrath must come.
        Evidently Israel’s apostasy affected the population’s estimate of
     children. Manasseh’s dalliance with witchcraft and other national reli-
     gions induced the sacrificing of his sons (2 Chron. 33:6). Nevertheless,
     Manasseh’s reign was the exception rather than the rule; under more
     spiritual leadership, Israelites greatly valued their offspring.

Read Psalm 127:3–5; 128:3–6; Jeremiah 7:31; Deuteronomy 6:6, 7.
     What do these texts suggest about God’s estimate of children? How
     might a proper understanding of Scripture affect our relationships
     with children?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Education, birthright, and many other cultural practices clearly dem-
     onstrated how valuable children were in the ancient Hebrew culture.
     Not surprisingly, Christ expanded the already exalted position of chil-
     dren, as compared with surrounding cultures, to new dimensions. After
     all, children are human beings, and Christ’s death was for every person,
     whatever their age—a point we should never forget.


      It’s hard to believe that there are adults so corrupted, so evil,
      so degraded that they hurt children, sometimes even their own.
      How can we, in whatever situation we are in, do everything we
      can to love, protect, and nurture the children within our sphere
      of influence?

     Jesus’ Childhood
       Had Jesus bypassed childhood, arriving as a full-fledged adult on
     planet Earth, serious questions might be raised regarding His ability to
     identify with children. Christ, however, developed as all children must,
     skipping none of the developmental stages associated with growth and
     maturity. He understands teenage temptations. He underwent the frailties
     and insecurities of childhood. Christ encountered those challenges that,
     in their own sphere, all children face. His experiencing childhood was
     another crucial way in which our Savior revealed His true humanity.

Read Luke 2:40–52. What does this teach about Jesus’ childhood?

     _________________________________________________________

        “Among the Jews the twelfth year was the dividing line between
     childhood and youth. On completing this year a Hebrew boy was
     called a son of the law, and also a son of God. He was given special
     opportunities for religious instruction, and was expected to participate
     in the sacred feasts and observances. It was in accordance with this cus-
     tom that Jesus in His boyhood made the Passover visit to Jerusalem.”
     —Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 75.
        According to the texts, Jesus acquired wisdom. God bestowed grace
     on Him. From Christ’s boyhood temple encounter during the Passover
     visit, we can see that Jesus had deep scriptural wisdom. Rabbinical
     teachers were markedly impressed by Jesus’ questions and answers.
        God surely used multiple childhood experiences to shape that attrac-
     tively flawless character. Perhaps the discipline of learning carpentry
     skills, the attention of devoted parents, regular exposure to Scripture,
     and His interactions with Nazareth’s townspeople formed the founda-
     tion of His early upbringing. In the end, however remarkable a child
     Jesus was, He had still been—as we all have been—a child.


      “The child Jesus did not receive instruction in the synagogue
      schools. His mother was His first human teacher. From her lips
      and from the scrolls of the prophets, He learned of heavenly
      things. The very words which He Himself had spoken to Moses
      for Israel He was now taught at His mother’s knee.”—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, p. 70. Dwell on the incredible implica-
      tions of those words. What do they teach us about the humanity
      of Christ?

     Healing the Children
Read the following passages: Matthew 9:18–26, Mark 7:24–30, Luke
     9:37–43, John 4:46–54. Whose children were restored in these sto-
     ries? How are these children’s backgrounds similar? What differ-
     ences might you detect? What lessons can we learn from these texts
     that can help us today?

       In all these stories, one overwhelming similarity is that, in each
     case, a desperate parent came to Jesus, seeking help for a child. What
     parent cannot relate? What parent hasn’t felt pain, anguish, fear, and
     outright horror when a child was very sick, or even dying? For those
     who have been there, there’s nothing worse.
       And though Jesus Himself had not been a parent, He related enough
     to them in His humanity that He healed their children. In each case,
     the healing came. He turned no one away. Thus, His love, not just for
     the parents but for the children, came through clearly.
       Of course, this leads to a whole host of questions regarding cases
     when praying and pleading parents call out to Jesus and, yet, their
     children are not healed. There is, perhaps, no sadder experience than
     burying children. Death should be reserved for older generations. The
     unnatural order of parents mourning their children’s deaths makes
     the heart revolt. During these funerals, nearly every parent asks,
     “Shouldn’t it have been me?”
       Mourning physical death and observing spiritual decay may be
     equally painful. How many parents have agonized about children
     overwhelmed by drug addiction, by pornography, or adolescent indif-
     ference? Whatever the affliction, we must learn to trust in the Lord
     and His goodness and love, even when things do not turn out so hap-
     pily, as they did in the biblical stories listed above. Ellen G. White, a
     prophet, buried two children. Our world is a rough place. Our God,
     though, is a loving God, and that truth is what we must cling to, no
     matter what.

                                                                           33

     A Fearsome Warning
Analyze the following texts: Matthew 11:25, 26; 18:1–6, 10–14. What
     truths, not just about children but about faith in general, can we
     learn through these stories? Think about just how harsh Jesus’
     warning was here. Why should we tremble before it?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       There exists a unique genuineness within children that Jesus fre-
     quently appealed to when illustrating His kingdom. Their genuineness,
     humility, dependency, and innocence somehow capture the essence of
     Christian living. We should all long for that simplicity and trust in liv-
     ing out our faith.
       Modern disciple-makers need to learn another lesson: children need
     never leave their childlike dependency behind. Properly educated,
     children may carry their trusting innocence into adulthood. Certainly,
     as children mature and get older, they will question things, they will
     have struggles and doubts and unanswered questions, as we all do.
     But a childlike faith is never unfashionable. As parents, or as adults in
     general, we should do all that we can to instill in children a knowledge
     of God and His love, and nothing can do that more than by revealing
     that love to them through our lives, our kindness, our compassion, and
     our care. We can preach and sermonize all we want; in the end, as with
     adults, the best way to disciple children is to live out before them the
     love of God in our lives.
       In cold, fearsome, and stark contrast, criminal acts against children—
     especially during church-sponsored activities—can destroy a child’s
     confidence about the church and, usually, about the God of the church.
     What wrath must justly await those who perpetrate such actions and
     those who protect the perpetrators. Christ and His message awaken
     confidence and trust. How dare any human organization compromise
     that childlike faith through lack of vigilance?

      What is your church doing not only to nurture its children but to
      make sure that they are protected in every way possible? Think
      what it means when Jesus said their angels “do always behold the
      face of my Father which is in heaven” (Matt. 18:10). Why should
      that make anyone who hurts a child tremble?

     Suffer the Little Children
Read Mark 10:13–16. How does Christ’s acceptance of children facili-
     tate their acceptance of Him? How should His rebuke of the dis-
     ciples be understood? What must we take away from this account
     for ourselves and how we relate to children?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Surely Christ’s disciples were well intentioned, although ignorant.
     They attempted to protect His valuable time, preserving His energy for
     more “important” matters. How greatly they misunderstood what Jesus
     wanted them to know.
        Imagine being forsaken by gruff adults only to be embraced by the
     loving and caring personage of Jesus. No wonder children embraced
     Him. In this story, we have been left with an invaluable example regard-
     ing the ways in which children should be treated by those who profess
     to be disciple-makers.
        “In the children who were brought in contact with Him, Jesus saw
     the men and women who should be heirs of His grace and subjects of
     His kingdom, and some of whom would become martyrs for His sake.
     He knew that these children would listen to Him and accept Him as
     their Redeemer far more readily than would grown-up people, many
     of whom were the worldly wise and hardhearted. In His teaching He
     came down to their level. He, the Majesty of heaven, did not disdain
     to answer their questions, and simplify His important lessons to meet
     their childish understanding. He planted in their minds the seeds of
     truth, which in after years would spring up, and bear fruit unto eternal
     life.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 512–515.

      How often have we met adults who suffer through so much pain,
      so much turmoil, so much heartache over things that happened to
      them in their childhood? What should this tell us about how gently,
      carefully, prayerfully, and lovingly we should treat children?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Blessing the Children,”
     pp. 511–517; “The Temple Cleansed Again,” p. 592, in The Desire of
     Ages; “Baptism,” pp. 93–95, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6;
     “Bible Teaching and Study,” pp. 185, 186, in Education.

       “It is still true that children are the most susceptible to the teachings
     of the gospel; their hearts are open to divine influences, and strong to
     retain the lessons received. The little children may be Christians, having
     an experience in accordance with their years. They need to be educated
     in spiritual things, and parents should give them every advantage, that
     they may form characters after the similitude of the character of Christ.
       “Fathers and mothers should look upon their children as younger
     members of the Lord’s family, committed to them to educate for
     heaven. The lessons that we ourselves learn from Christ we should give
     to our children, as the young minds can receive them, little by little
     opening to them the beauty of the principles of heaven.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Desire of Ages, p. 515.


Discussion Questions:
       Why do you think it’s true that many who accept Christ do so
      when younger rather than when they are older? Skeptics could
      argue that it’s because they are too naive and ignorant to realize
      the silliness of what they are doing. On the other hand, could it be
      because they have yet to be so hardened and tainted with cynicism
      and skepticism as are many adults? That is, their innocence and
      openness make them more susceptible to the promptings of the
      Holy Spirit. Discuss.

       How can today’s church organize to become more Christlike
      in its appeal to children? What can each member personally do to
      be friendlier toward youth who may experiment with bizarre fash-
      ions, unusual musical tastes, and sometimes outlandish behavior?
      How can the church become more energetic, thus attracting active
      youth?

       What steps may members take to prepare themselves to
      respond to interested youth who desire baptism and a life-­changing
      commitment to Christ?

       Dwell more on the attributes of children that caused Jesus to
      say “Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall
      not enter into the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 18:3). What does that
      text mean? At the same time, what does that not mean?

Jonathan’s Wish
  Jonathan is a quiet boy with a shy smile. He lives in a small village
in southern Mexico.
  One day his neighbor, Tia Maria, invited Jonathan to go to Sabbath
School with her. Jonathan had never been to church before. His mother
said he could go, so he agreed.
  On Sabbath, Jonathan and Tia Maria walked to church. He liked
Sabbath School, especially the mission story about children from far-
away lands.
  When he returned home, Jonathan told his mother what he learned. He
told her the Bible stories and recited the Bible text. His mother listened
with interest. But when Jonathan asked her to go to church with him,
she said No. She said she had to work or take care of Jonathan’s baby
brother. Jonathan kept inviting her, but she kept saying No.
  “Mama, Jesus wants you to come to church, and I want you to come,”
Jonathan pleaded. “All the other children sit with their parents, but I
must sit alone.” Still his mother refused to go.
  When the pastor announced evangelistic meetings, Jonathan hurried
home to invite his mother to go with him. To his surprise, she agreed
to go. Every night Jonathan and his mother walked to the meetings
together. And when the pastor asked those who wanted to follow God
in baptism to stand, Jonathan stood. The pastor visited Jonathan’s
mother and explained that Jonathan wanted to be baptized. But his
mother said that he could not be baptized, because she was not a mem-
ber of the church.
  Jonathan was disappointed, but he was determined to follow Jesus.
He often talked to his mother about Jesus, pleading with her to give
her heart to God.
  She thought about how happy Jonathan was since he started attending
church. And he loved to read his Bible lesson and sing. She wanted the
same joy and decided to attend church with her son.
  On Sabbath, Jonathan was surprised when his mother said she was
going to church with him. They walked to the little church together.
Jonathan showed his mother to her class. And during church Jonathan
was glad that he didn’t have to sit alone.
  When the pastor announced an upcoming baptism, Jonathan again
asked his mother to let him be baptized. This time she said Yes. Then
she told the pastor that she wanted to be baptized too. Jonathan and his
mother were baptized together.
  Our mission offerings help introduce people such as Jonathan and his
mother to Jesus. Thank you for sharing God’s love through your mission
offerings.

      Discipling the                         Sick



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 53:4, Matt. 8:17, Mark
      2:1–12, Phil. 4:4–9, 1 John 3:20–22, John 11:37–44.

Memory Text: “Large crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the
      blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at his
      feet; and he healed them. The people were amazed when they saw
      the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the
      blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel” (Matthew 15:30,
      31, NIV).



      D
               uring His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to healing the sick
               than to preaching. His miracles testified to the truth of His
               words, that He came not to destroy, but to save. Wherever He
      went, the tidings of His mercy preceded Him. Where He had passed,
      the objects of His compassion were rejoicing in health and making
      trial of their new-found powers. Crowds were collecting around them
      to hear from their lips the works that the Lord had wrought. His voice
      was the first sound that many had ever heard, His name the first word
      they had ever spoken, His face the first they had ever looked upon. Why
      should they not love Jesus and sound His praise? As He passed through
      the towns and cities He was like a vital current, diffusing life and joy.”
      —Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, pp. 19, 20.

     The Healing Messiah
Read Isaiah 53:4, Matthew 8:17, John 9:1–3. In what way are we to
     understand these texts? What questions do they raise? What hope
     do they offer us?

     _________________________________________________________

        In antiquity, sickness was considered the result of sinful actions.
     (And even today, who hasn’t at times—even if only for a moment—
     wondered if illness, either one’s own or that of a loved one, wasn’t
     brought on as a punishment for sin?) In the book of Job, Job’s friends
     suggested that his misfortunes, which included personal illness,
     resulted from hidden faults; the implication was that somehow his
     sinfulness caused his predicament. Similarly, Christ’s disciples under-
     stood blindness as the punishment for someone’s sinfulness. This
     suggests that sickness required not diagnosis or medication but atone-
     ment. Matthew references Isaiah’s Messianic prophecy, stating that
     Christ fulfilled this prediction and that healing can be found in Him.
        Various ancient pagan traditions included healing deities; none,
     however, proposed that gods actually took the infirmities upon
     themselves. Isaiah foretold a Redeemer who would assume our sick-
     nesses and sinfulness. Other ancient traditions made provision for
     substitutionary atonement in order to benefit royalty. Substitutes were
     sacrificed in the king’s place in order to satisfy divine designs against
     a king, thus transferring evil’s punishment from one individual to
     another. Nowhere, however, were there traditions of kings dying as
     substitutes for their subjects.
        This, however, is exactly what Isaiah said, and what Matthew con-
     firmed: heaven’s Royalty suffering human sicknesses. Interestingly
     enough, the word translated as “griefs” in Isaiah 53:4 comes from a
     Hebrew word that means, basically, “sickness” or “disease.”
        Jesus recognized that His mission was both to preach deliverance
     and to heal the brokenhearted (Luke 4:17–19). He attracted many
     through the power that came from His love and character. Others fol-
     lowed Him because they admired His easily understood preaching.
     Still others became disciples because of how He treated the impover-
     ished. Many, however, followed Christ because He had touched and
     healed their brokenness.

      We all have our broken places. How can we learn to disciple oth-
      ers through sympathy in their own brokenness—a brokenness
      that we can understand so well because of our own?
                                                                           39

     Healing the Body
Study Mark 2:1–12. What can we learn regarding the connection
     between physical sickness and sinfulness? What lessons should we
     not take from this story, as well?

     _________________________________________________________

        Contrary to biblical doctrine, ancient Greek philosophy separated the
     spiritual (soul) and physical (body) dimensions of human existence.
     Believing that human souls were immortal, many Greeks devalued
     the importance of their bodies. Because bodies were temporal, pass-
     ing away with time, they were considered less valuable than was the
     enduring soul.
        In fact, in one of the most famous texts from antiquity, Plato depicts
     his teacher Socrates, who is about to face death, as waxing long and
     eloquently on how corrupt and evil the body is, and that at death his
     immortal soul will finally be free to do all the things that the body has
     hindered it from doing.
        The Bible, of course, teaches something radically different. Human
     bodies are the direct creation of God, who fearfully and wonder-
     fully made them (Ps. 139:14). Furthermore, bodies are not separate
     from souls. Body, mind, and spirit are merely differing aspects of
     human personality or existence, not independently existent entities.
     Consequently, whatever affects the body affects the mind and spirit—
     the other interrelated aspects of personhood. Thus, whenever Christ
     healed, He was not merely eradicating cancer or curing heart disease;
     He was transforming the physical, mental, and spiritual human expe-
     rience.
        Jesus healed more than just bodies. Christ always healed whole per-
     sons. His holistic approach recognized that physical health was insepa-
     rable from spiritual health. Through physical healing, He effected spiri-
     tual transformation. That was, to a great degree, the whole purpose.
     After all, why heal people who in the long run will die anyway and face
     eternal destruction at the end of time?

      Though sickness can result directly from sinful practices, so often
      people, even infants, get sick for no obvious reason other than
      that we are all victims of a fallen world. Why is it so important to
      keep this sad truth in mind when seeking to minister to anyone
      who is sick or who is agonizing over a sick loved one?

      Healing the Mind and Body
         Through physical healing and mental restoration, Jesus made disci-
      ples. Often Christ’s patients suffered both mental and physical diseases.
      Physical restoration itself was never the final objective. The ultimate
      goal was always discipleship. Healing could provide twenty, fifty, per-
      haps seventy-five additional quality years. Discipleship offered eternal
      life with Christ.
         In Luke 8:26–39, the demon-possessed man from the Gerasene region
      begged to accompany Jesus. Instead, Christ commissioned him to
      evangelize his family and townspeople. Having been so miraculously
      delivered, he could be a powerful witness for Jesus.

Study Matthew 6:19–34, 1 Peter 5:7, 2 Corinthians 4:7–10, Philippians
      4:4–9, 1 John 3:20–22. How might the principles taught in these
      verses relieve the anxiety, guilt, and shame that underlie many
      mental illnesses?

         Physical sickness is sometimes caused by mental stimuli. The rela-
      tionship between mind and body is well established by medical science.
      Anxiety predisposes some to stomach problems. Worry causes sleep
      disorders. Uncontrollable anger factors into heart disease. Teaching
      people about mental-health principles should highlight the importance
      of trusting God, naturally leading them toward personal spiritual com-
      mitment and full discipleship.
         “Each day has its burdens, its cares and perplexities; and when we
      meet how ready we are to talk of our difficulties and trials. So many
      borrowed troubles intrude, so many fears are indulged, such a weight of
      anxiety is expressed, that one might suppose we had no pitying, loving
      Saviour ready to hear all our requests and to be to us a present help in
      every time of need.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 121.


       Though a close walk with the Lord is no guarantee of good
       health, there’s no question that the peace of mind that comes
       from knowing the Lord can have a positive impact on us, even
       physically. What are some practical ways in which we can learn
       to take the principles taught in today’s lesson and apply them to
       ourselves, especially if we are prone toward worry?

      The Resurrection and the Life
In a world where death always has the final word, at least for now, what
      great hope is found in these verses? Luke 7:11–17, Mark 5:21–43,
      John 11:37–44.
      _________________________________________________________
      _________________________________________________________

        Politicians, entertainers, and athletes must necessarily offer some-
      thing to generate a following. Politicians utilize hypnotic rhetoric and
      incredible promises. Entertainers use their abilities to generate emotion
      and audience identification. Athletes amaze throngs with their physical
      skills. Envious onlookers follow, wishing they possessed such prowess.
        What does Jesus offer? Reduced unemployment? Fatter paychecks?
      Amazing ball-handling skills? Incredible vocal range? Tear-jerking
      performances? Instead, Jesus offers something no one else in the world
      can: eternal life in a new world. In contrast to that, what else matters?
        While television shopping networks insult our intelligence with their
      too-good-to-be-true offers, Jesus seemingly exceeds their excesses with
      His deal of a lifetime: eternal life priced for nothing with absolutely no
      shipping and handling charges! Skeptics would doubtless scoff about
      such an unprecedented offer. Competitors would manufacture cheap
      imitations (such as Satan’s immortal-soul concept). Potential buy-
      ers would cautiously investigate the claims. So, Jesus provided three
      known demonstrations to counter the skeptics, expose imitations, and
      satisfy genuine seekers. Jairus’s daughter, the widow’s son, and, finally,
      Lazarus proved that this too-good-to-be-true offer was authentic.
      Disease and accidents might initially prevail, but eternal life would ulti-
      mately conquer. Healing would not happen every time it was requested,
      but everlasting life was guaranteed to all who made Jesus their Savior.
        It’s the same with us today. As we know, many times the healing we
      want just simply does not come in the way that we want it. People lin-
      ger, even for years, from debilitating and painful diseases that, far from
      being healed, sometimes get worse. Others die from disease, despite
      anointing and prayer. We have no answers as to why, in some cases,
      healing comes now, and in others it doesn’t.
        What we do have, though, is something so much better than even
      a miraculous healing, and that is the promise of the resurrection to
      eternal life at the end of the age, when Jesus will come and “the saints
      of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom
      forever, even forever and ever” (Dan. 7:18, NKJV).

       Why is this promise—the promise of eternal life—so crucial and
       so important to us? Where would we be without it? What hope
       would you have for anything, anything at all, without it?

     Christ’s Healing Legacy
Review Acts 3:1–19, 5:12–16, 9:36–42, 20:7–10, 1 Corinthians 12:7–9,
     28–31, James 5:13–16. How should modern Christians evaluate
     the importance of healing ministry to the New Testament church?

        First-century disciples witnessed firsthand Christ’s promise of see-
     ing “greater things than these” fulfilled (John 1:50, compare John
     5:20, 14:12). Miraculous healings and resurrections attended the min-
     istries of early Christianity’s most prominent disciples: Peter and Paul.
     These events figured significantly in the early church’s growth. God’s
     eternal presence, signified by miraculous healing, influenced thou-
     sands of religious leaders to accept Christ. Their flocks often followed.
        Sometimes new disciples misunderstood the divine purpose. Simon
     attempted to purchase miraculous power, revealing self-centered moti-
     vations (Acts 8:9–25). Most, however, recognized that the significance
     of these miraculous wonders rested in the fact that they revealed God’s
     presence among them. These displays of divine power proved that God
     existed and that He was worthy of their praise.
        Although Christ had ascended to heaven, throngs still followed Him
     through the ministries of His disciples. They furthered the mission
     Jesus had started. They were fulfilling the vision Christ had shared.
        Clearly, health was an ongoing concern and a healing ministry an
     ongoing function of Christ’s church. Healing was listed among the
     spiritual gifts. Instructions for ministering God’s healing grace to
     those afflicted by sickness were recorded in Scripture. These gifts
     would benefit believers until Christ’s second coming, when His
     personal presence would render them unnecessary. Church history
     chronicles the dedication of believers to health ministry during many
     different time periods. Certainly, relieving human suffering was an
     important motivation. Others, however, recognized healing as the first
     step toward coming to know the complete gospel.
                                                                           43

Further Study: Read Luke 18:35–43; 13:10–17; 14:1–6; John 6:1,
     2; Mark 6:5–7, 6:54–56; 7:31–37; 8:22–26; Matthew 8:1–17; 12:15–23.
     Ellen G. White, “Our Example,” pp. 17–21; “Healing of the Soul,” pp.
     73–85, in The Ministry of Healing; “The Divine Plan in the Medical
     Missionary Work,” pp. 25–29, in Medical Ministry.

        “The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the body.
     He needed health of soul before he could appreciate health of body.
     Before the physical malady could be healed, Christ must bring relief
     to the mind, and cleanse the soul from sin. This lesson should not be
     overlooked. There are today thousands suffering from physical disease
     who, like the paralytic, are longing for the message, ‘Thy sins are for-
     given.’ The burden of sin, with its unrest and unsatisfied desires, is the
     foundation of their maladies. They can find no relief until they come
     to the Healer of the soul. The peace which He alone can impart would
     restore vigor to the mind and health to the body. . . .
        “In the home of the paralytic there was great rejoicing when he
     returned to his family, carrying with ease the couch upon which he had
     been slowly borne from their presence but a short time before. . . . Glad
     thanksgiving went up from that home, and God was glorified through
     His Son, who had restored hope to the hopeless and strength to the
     stricken one. This man and his family were ready to lay down their
     lives for Jesus.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, pp. 77, 79.


Discussion Questions:
       How can healing ministries open hearts and minds otherwise
      closed to the gospel? How can Christians guard themselves against
      the error of thinking that healing is an end in itself?

       How can churches that are not connected with hospitals par-
      ticipate in healing ministry? How can Christians involved with
      healing ministry avoid association in the public’s mind with so-
      called faith healers?

       What do we say to those potential disciples who, reading about
      the healings in the Bible, come to our churches or hospitals in
      search of a healing that does not happen? What answers do we
      have for them? What answers do we have for ourselves as we seek
      to understand these situations? What answers are found in the
      Bible that can help us at times like these?

Claiming God’s Promise
   Mama Nerea lay on her thin mattress in her humble home in west-
ern Kenya. Her family suspected that her suffering was the result of
witchcraft—a curse that someone had put on her. They visited several
witchdoctors, seeking to have the curse removed, but Mama Nerea
continued to languish. The illness had left her unable to stand or walk
and had taken her voice, as well. Even she was sure she would die.
   Mama Nerea’s life had been filled with trouble. Her husband had
gone to seek work in a nearby town, leaving her to care for her chil-
dren alone. Desperate to make money, she began brewing and selling
local beer. Soon she was addicted to her own brew. When her husband
returned from town, he drank with her.
   Then she became ill.
   One day as Mama Nerea lay on her bed, she saw three men surround
it. One man wore a white robe. He spoke her name and comforted her.
Then he told her that she would be saved the next day.
   “Koa kanye, koa kuom ng’a?” Mama Nerea asked. “Saved from what
and where?” The man in the white robe told her that the next day she
would meet two men who would lead her out of her bondage and pain
and into the light of Jesus. “You must never go back into the darkness
again,” he said.
   Mama Nerea nodded.
   Mama Nerea’s daughter was startled to hear her mother’s voice.
“Who are you talking to?” she asked her mother.
   “Jesus has visited me,” Mama Nerea said.
   The next day, two young men came to visit Mama Nerea. They told
her that God had told them to come and pray with her. The young men
were holding evangelistic meetings. They came regularly to pray with
Mama Nerea and her family.
   Soon after this, Mama Nerea’s daughter found her mother standing
in the door of the hut. Over the next few months, Mama Nerea’s health
returned, and she began visiting the small Seventh-day Adventist group
in their settlement. Her husband, Johana, stopped smoking and drink-
ing and gave his heart to the Lord.
   Mama Nerea and Johana became strong supporters of God’s work
and led many to Christ in their village. Recently, Johana died, and
Mama Nerea is getting old. But their testimony and their example
live on in the lives of many who have found Christ in a small town in
western Kenya.
   Our mission offerings help support the work of Global Mission pio-
neers and lay evangelists throughout the world.
Vicki Nakabayashi met Moses, the son of Mama Nerea, on a mission trip to Kenya.

      Discipling the “Ordinary”




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 2:21–28; Matt. 15:32–39;
      16:13–17; Luke 12:6, 7; 13:1–5; James 2:1–9.

Memory Text: “Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw
      Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they
      were fishers. And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will
      make you to become fishers of men. And straightway they forsook
      their nets, and followed him” (Mark 1:16–18).



      C
              hrist’s death was the great equalizer: it showed that we all are
              sinners in need of God’s grace. In light of the Cross, ethnic,
              political, economic, and social barriers crumble. Sometimes,
      though, in our soul winning, we forget that crucial truth, and we espe-
      cially seek to win those who might be deemed “honorable” or “great”
      in the eyes of the world.
        Not so with Jesus, who saw the meaninglessness and emptiness of
      worldly greatness and honor. In fact, in many cases, it was the most
      “successful” people—the favorably positioned Pharisees, the wealthy
      Sadducees, and the Roman aristocracy—who troubled Him the most.
      In contrast, the “ordinary” people—carpenters, fishermen, farmers,
      housewives, shepherds, soldiers, and servants—generally thronged and
      embraced Him.

     Humble Beginnings
Read Luke 2:21–28, Mark 6:2–4, Leviticus 12:8. What do these verses
     tell us about the economic class into which Jesus was born? How
     would that class have influenced His ministry?

     _________________________________________________________

        Joseph and Mary’s purification offering clearly indicated their eco-
     nomically poor background. This tradition sprang from the Mosaic
     legislation recorded in Leviticus 12:8, and it required that a lamb be
     brought for this offering. However, a compassionate exemption had
     been provided for impoverished people. Turtledoves or pigeons could
     be substituted because of humble circumstances. Thus, right from the
     start—from His birth in a stable to the offerings given by His parents—
     Jesus is portrayed as having assumed His humanity in the home of poor
     and “ordinary” people. In fact, archaeological evidence also seems to
     indicate that the town of Nazareth, where Jesus spent His childhood,
     was a relatively impoverished and unimportant town, as well. And
     though carpentry is an honorable trade, it certainly didn’t place Him
     among the “elite.”
        “The parents of Jesus were poor, and dependent upon their daily toil.
     He was familiar with poverty, self-denial, and privation. This experi-
     ence was a safeguard to Him. In His industrious life there were no idle
     moments to invite temptation. No aimless hours opened the way for
     corrupting associations. So far as possible, He closed the door to the
     tempter. Neither gain nor pleasure, applause nor censure, could induce
     Him to consent to a wrong act. He was wise to discern evil, and strong
     to resist it.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 72.

      The Creator of all that was made (see John 1:1–3) entered
      humanity, not just as a human being, an infant, which would
      have been astonishing enough, but by way of the home of a
      relatively impoverished family! How are we to respond to
      something so incredible? What is the only way to respond?

     Transforming the “Common”
Read John 2:1–11 and Matthew 15:32–39. How did Jesus use sim-
     ple, everyday desires and needs to make disciples and transform
     lives?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “Ordinary” people share natural physical, emotional, and social
     desires. They want physical nourishment, personal significance, and
     friendship. Jesus understood these characteristics, placing Himself in
     social situations that provided opportunities to reach people through
     these universal desires.
        Whether Jesus was changing water into unfermented wine from the
     fruit of the vine, or turning fishermen into preachers (Mark 1:16–18),
     He specialized in transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.
     Onlookers frequently questioned Jesus’ personal credentials (Mark
     6:3). They questioned the absence of ostentation. Because they longed
     for the extraordinary, they overlooked that which they considered to be
     ordinary and did so at what was potentially an eternal loss.
        So often Jesus sought people who were considered to be ordinary
     because, lacking self-sufficiency, they were prepared to trust God
     completely for their success. People who are enamored by their tal-
     ents, abilities, and accomplishments cannot often sense their need of
     something greater than themselves. What a horrible deception! Many
     among Christ’s contemporaries possessed superior academic training,
     social position, or personal wealth. Nevertheless, their names have
     long been forgotten. Remembered, however, are ordinary people—­
     farmers, fisher­men, carpenters, shepherds, potters, housewives, domes-
     tic ­servants—who were transformed into extraordinary witnesses for
     Christ.

      We all tend to be a little enamored by the very successful and
      the very rich, don’t we? How much of that attitude do you see in
      yourself? How can you learn to keep before yourself the value of
      all people, regardless of their status, fame, or wealth?

       In the New Testament, Peter stands out as one of the most influential

Read the following texts. How do they help us to understand how Peter

        Jesus, no doubt, spent a great deal of time with Peter, and Peter had
     many powerful experiences with Him. Though only an “ordinary”
     fisherman with plenty of faults, through his time with Jesus, Peter was
     radically converted—even after making some grievous errors, includ-
     ing denying Jesus three times, just as Jesus told him he would.
        Though many points emerge from the story of Peter, the moment he
     first caught a glimpse of who Jesus was, he was aware of his own faults
     and admitted them. Hence, through patience and forbearance, Jesus
     was able to turn Peter’s flawed character into someone who helped to
     change history.


      Why must we be so careful about making judgments about
      those whom we might not deem as “savable”? Why is that so
      easy to do?

     Heavenly Evaluation
       An evangelist once celebrated (perhaps bragged about) the atten-
     dance of quality upper-class people at his seminars. (One would
     hope he equally celebrated the attendance of the more “ordinary”
     types, as well.)
       With Christ, however, no class distinctions existed; no one was “ordi-
     nary”; everyone was an exception. Not surprisingly, Jesus reached the
     masses with commonplace illustrations and straightforward speech.
     Nothing about His manner suggested that anyone was excluded from
     His concern. Modern disciple-makers must likewise carefully guard
     against giving the impression that they regard some more highly than
     they do others in terms of outreach.

Read Luke 12:6, 7; 13:1–5; Matthew 6:25–30. What do these texts teach
      us about the worth of every person? Of course, it is easy for us to
      say that we believe this, but in what ways might we be guilty of
      harboring the kind of distinctions that the universality of the Cross
      has eradicated forever?

        The cheapest birds in the temple marketplace were sparrows. Pairs
     could be purchased for an assarion, the smallest, least valuable cop-
     per coin. Nonetheless, commonplace, insignificant sparrows were not
     forgotten in heaven.
        How much more is this the case with human beings, the ones for
     whom Christ died? Christ died for us, not for birds. The Cross proves,
     in ways that we cannot begin to fathom, the “infinite worth” (to borrow
     from a phrase that Ellen G. White used a lot) of every human being,
     regardless of his or her status in life—a status that is often nothing
     more than a human concoction based on concepts and attributes that
     are meaningless in heaven, or even contrary to the very principles of
     heaven itself.

       Ellen G. White wrote that “Christ would have died for one soul
       in order that that one might live through the eternal ages.”
       —Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 73. One soul! Dwell on
       the implications of this incredible concept. How should this
       influence the ways in which we view not only others but our-
       selves, as well?

     A Classless Society
       Perhaps the most socially attractive feature of primitive Christianity
     was the absence of class distinctions. Dividing walls had crumbled
     beneath the gospel’s weight. The common person triumphed through
     Christ. Christ transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary. Carpenters,
     tax collectors, stonecutters, queens, domestic servants, priests, Greeks,
     Romans, men, women, the wealthy, and the destitute all became equals
     within Christ’s kingdom of grace. In reality, the Christian community
     was to be a “classless society.”

What do each of the following texts teach about our common human-
     ity? Considering the cultural background of the time, and of the
     Bible writers themselves, why might it not have been so easy for
     them to grasp this crucial concept?

      the notion that God loves ordinary, everyday people enable the
      explosive expansion of primitive Christianity? At the same time,
      we need to ask ourselves, How well do we, individually and collec-
      tively, apply these principles to the ways in which we minister to
      the world? What kinds of things hold us back from doing better
      in this important area?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Lifework,” pp. 269, 270,
     in Education; and “Laboring for the Middle Class,” pp. 564–566, in
     Evangelism.

       “In this closing work of the gospel there is a vast field to be occu-
     pied; and, more than ever before, the work is to enlist helpers from the
     common people. Both the youth and those older in years will be called
     from the field, from the vineyard, and from the workshop, and sent
     forth by the Master to give His message. Many of these have had little
     opportunity for education; but Christ sees in them qualifications that
     will enable them to fulfill His purpose. If they put their hearts into the
     work, and continue to be learners, He will fit them to labor for Him.”
     —Ellen G. White, Education, pp. 269, 270.


Discussion Questions:
       Why was Jesus so effective in making disciples among the
      common people? Why was His message not as readily received
      among the wealthy and socially elite? How might Jesus’ humble
      upbringing have contributed to His effectiveness in reaching the
      hearts and minds of ordinary people? How effective in reaching
      the average person might Jesus have been if He had come as a
      royal prince or a wealthy landowner?

       Read 1 Corinthians 1:26–29 in class together. What are the
      key points? Read carefully where Paul wrote that God chose “the
      weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are
      mighty” (NKJV). What does that mean? How, in the context of
      being a Christian, are we to understand this fascinating idea? In
      what ways do these verses show just how twisted and perverted the
      ways of the world are? How can we make sure that we ourselves
      don’t get caught up in these corrupted ways?

       What can our Bible study groups do to become more user-
      friendly for ordinary people? How might that affect our choice
      of Bible translations? Why should disciple-makers concentrate on
      practical subjects rather than theoretical ones, especially when
      first reaching out to people who are hurting and in need of help?

Just in Time
   Megy groaned as another contraction tore through her body. She had
been in labor for 18 hours, and her baby hadn’t arrived yet. Four men
carried Megy on a stretcher toward the river several miles away, where
they hoped to meet a public vehicle that could take Megy to the govern-
ment clinic.
   Storm clouds gathered on the horizon and threatened heavy rain. If
the men couldn’t reach the river before the rains swelled it, they couldn’t
cross. Megy’s life and the life of her unborn baby hung in the balance.
   Megy and her husband live in a large village in eastern Papua New
Guinea. Most women give birth at home or in the simple birthing center
in the village. But the birth attendants aren’t equipped to handle compli-
cated births. If they can’t cross the rain-swollen river, women and their
infants often die en route to help.
   The men hurried on as large drops of water began pelting them. They
reached the river and carefully picked their way across the swirling
waters. Once on the other side, the men scrambled up the rocky shore
to the place where public vehicles stopped. Soon a vehicle came, and
Megy’s husband helped her into the back.
   The vehicle bumped along the rough road, drawing more groans from
Megy. Thirty minutes later, the driver stopped at the government clinic,
and Megy’s husband helped her down. Soon she was inside, where the
government nurse could help her safely deliver her child.
   The next day, Megy and her husband rode another public vehicle back
to their village with their new son. Megy survived because she made it
to the government clinic in time. Other women in her village weren’t so
fortunate. Megy yearned for the day when her own village would have
a decent clinic.
   Thousands of people who live in and around Megy’s village in Papua
New Guinea are rejoicing today because the Seventh-day Adventist
Church has built a government-certified clinic in their village. The vil-
lagers don’t know much about Adventists yet, but they do know that
Adventists care for them enough to meet their medical needs and teach
them how to live more healthful lives. The Adventist nurse at the clinic
has the equipment to deliver their babies and the medicines to treat their
illnesses.
   A recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is helping to build more clinics
in Papua New Guinea. The people are eager to hear about the God that
Adventists worship because they see God’s love through the Adventists
who care for them. Thank you for helping save lives and leading people
to Jesus in Papua New Guinea and around the world.

      Jesus and the Social
      Outcasts


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 21:28–32, John 8:1–11,
      Mark 5:1–20, John 4:5–32, Matt. 9:9–13.

Memory Text: “The woman then left her waterpot, went her way
      into the city, and said to the men, ‘Come, see a Man who told me all
      things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?’ ” (John 4:28–30,
      NKJV).



      A
               young woman—having come from an unbelievably sad and hor-
               rible background (which included two out-of-wedlock children
               by the time she was fifteen years old)—sat in prison, awaiting
      trial for having murdered a social worker who had come to take away
      her baby, the only person from whom she ever felt any love.
         Without a mother, father, husband, any relative, or even a friend, she
      faced the forbidding future alone. Through the visits of a pastor, how-
      ever, this hopeless young woman learned that—despite all the mistakes,
      despite the desperateness of the situation, and despite whatever loomed
      on the horizon—Christ loved and forgave her. No matter how society
      viewed this young girl, she knew, for herself, God’s eternal love. This
      social outcast discovered meaning and purpose in her Lord, whose love
      and acceptance transcended all societal norms and mores, even the
      “good” ones.

     Bottom Dwellers
        Societies establish hierarchies. Wealthy or well-educated people usu-
     ally acquire the highest positions.
        Good moral citizens, the “ordinary” people, normally occupy the
     middle rungs on the social ladder. That leaves the bottom dwellers,
     those such as prostitutes, substance abusers, criminals, the homeless,
     and others. During Christ’s time, that list also included lepers and tax
     collectors.

Read Matthew 21:28–32 and Luke 15:1–10. What do these passages
     teach regarding Christ’s attitude toward social outcasts?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        What happened that propelled the social outcasts ahead of the self-
     righteous? What did the bottom dwellers discover that the social elite
     often missed? Why was Jesus apparently more effective in reaching the
     bottom strata than He was with the upper echelons?
        Although hardened by sinful pleasures, and sometimes encased in
     self-constructed tough exteriors, the social outcasts were, and still
     are, easier to reach than the prideful, haughty, and self-righteous elite.
     Often, beneath the outcasts’ bravado lies emotional emptiness charac-
     terized by poor self-worth. Frequently, especially during the teenage
     years, such people openly rebel, frantically trying to establish a per-
     sonal identity to compensate for the insecurities felt within. That iden-
     tity is, purposefully, established in opposition to the wishes of whoever
     serves as the authority figure (often parents) for that person.
        Jesus wasted no effort damaging the outcasts’ already diminished
     sense of self-worth. Instead, He created a renewed sense of personal
     value. He established that foundation by consistently loving and accept-
     ing the outcasts, whose hearts were often melted by the warm and lov-
     ing receptions that they had received from Christ.

      What is your own attitude toward those whom your society
      deems to be social outcasts? Be honest: in a lot of cases, don’t you
      feel a certain sense of superiority? If so, dwell on the implications
      of those feelings.

      “In the Very Act”
Read John 8:1–11. What does this text teach us about Jesus and social
      outcasts?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Having refreshed Himself spiritually at His Mount of Olives retreat,
      Jesus returned to the temple. Crowds gathered. While Christ taught, the
      Pharisees dragged an adulterous woman before Him. They questioned
      Jesus regarding Moses’ legislation concerning adultery, which pre-
      scribed execution. Jesus recognized that this questioning was insincere.
      The purpose was entrapment, not truth-seeking. Capital (death penalty)
      jurisdiction had been withdrawn from Jewish courts. Jewish leader-
      ship reasoned that Christ’s patriotic Jewish following might be com-
      promised should He publicly reject stoning the woman. Conversely,
      should He endorse execution, their accusation would be that Christ had
      violated Roman authority.
         Caught amid the leaders’ political intrigue was this helpless and
      guilty woman. Unfamiliar with Jesus’ ministry, she could not have
      known His merciful nature. Ironically, He appears to pronounce her
      death sentence; however, He prefaced His statement with those unfor-
      gettable words, “He that is without sin . . .”
         Those words leveled the playing field. Sinless people might be
      authorized to mercilessly execute punishment. Yet, sinful people were,
      in a sense, obligated to be merciful. But, with the exception of Jesus,
      there were no sinless people present. Gradually the religious leaders
      dispersed, and this social outcast, guilty as she may have been, received
      grace.
         “In His act of pardoning this woman and encouraging her to live a
      better life, the character of Jesus shines forth in the beauty of perfect
      righteousness. While He does not palliate sin, nor lessen the sense of
      guilt, He seeks not to condemn, but to save. The world had for this err-
      ing woman only contempt and scorn; but Jesus speaks words of com-
      fort and hope.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 462.


       Though Ellen G. White does give more details about the intrigue
       regarding this woman, the woman, nevertheless, was an adulter-
       ess, caught “in the very act.” The scheming of the leaders didn’t
       change that fact. And yet, she was still forgiven. How do we learn
       to show grace, even to the guilty, while still not “palliating” sin?

     The Lowest of the Low
Read Mark 5:1–20. Compare this man’s situation with the plight of
     modern homeless people. Compare his description with that of
     mentally ill patients. What similarities and differences exist? How
     does modern society treat people who suffer from mental illness?
     What explains Christ’s admonition to publicize the event, though
     He consistently counsels others to maintain secrecy?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       From the perspective of many of us today, it’s hard to imagine someone
     in such a horrific state, living in a cemetery even. Though some argue
     that this man was merely insane, the text teaches otherwise. (Besides,
     how does that idea fit with what happened to the pigs?)
       A crucial point for us in this story is that no one, no matter how
     deranged—whether from demon possession, mental illness, drug use,
     whatever—is to be ignored. In some cases, professional help is needed
     and should be given when possible.
       As Christians, we must remember that Christ died for everyone, and
     even those whom we might deem to be beyond our help still deserve as
     much mercy and respect and kindness as possible. Besides, who are we
     to judge anyone to be a hopeless case, to be beyond the power of God?
     From our perspective, things can look bad, but from God’s perspective
     every human being is of infinite worth. Were it not for the Cross, all our
     cases would be hopeless, a point worth remembering as we confront
     very disturbed and damaged people.

      Dwell on some of the people you know who are truly in bad shape,
      whether mentally, spiritually, or physically, and for whatever rea-
      son. Try to view them in the way that you think our uncondition-
      ally loving God views them. Besides praying for them, what can
      you do, in any way, to minister to their needs and show them
      something of the love of God?

       1. What social conventions did Jesus break, and why? What

     was? What lessons can we draw from this about our own need for
     patience when it comes to the making of disciples?

     Publicans and Sinners
       It’s hard to imagine what our world would have been like had not sin
     intruded. The beauty of nature, even after millennia, still testifies to the
     majesty and power and goodness of God. Our sin-darkened minds can
     barely grasp what humanity and human relations would have been like
     had our world not fallen. One thing we can be sure of is that the class
     distinctions, prejudices, and cultural and ethnic boundaries that impact
     every society and culture would not exist.
       Sad to say, too, it’s hardly feasible that before Christ returns these
     boundaries are going to vanish. On the contrary, as our world gets
     worse, there is no doubt that these barriers will, as well. As Christians,
     however, we must do what we can in every way possible to seek to tran-
     scend these barriers that have caused so much heartache and suffering
     and pain in our world, especially to those whom society rejects as the
     greatest outcasts.

Read Matthew 9:9–13. In what way is the essence of true Christianity
     revealed here, not just in what Jesus said but in that which He did?
     Focus especially on His words, taken from the Old Testament: “ ‘I
     desire mercy and not sacrifice’ ” (Hosea 6:6, NKJV). Especially
     given the context, why must we be so careful that we do not become
     guilty of possessing the attitude that Jesus is so powerfully con-

       “The Pharisees beheld Christ sitting and eating with publicans and
     sinners. He was calm and self-possessed, kind, courteous, and friendly;
     and while they could not but admire the picture presented, it was so
     unlike their own course of action, they could not endure the sight. The
     haughty Pharisees exalted themselves, and disparaged those who had
     not been blessed with such privileges and light as they themselves
     had had. They hated and despised the publicans and sinners. Yet in the
     sight of God their guilt was the greater. Heaven’s light was flashing
     across their pathway, saying, ‘This is the way, walk ye in it’; but they
     had spurned the gift.”—Ellen G. White, The SDA Bible Commentary,
     vol. 5, p. 1088.

        “The one class that He would never countenance was those who
     stood apart in their self-esteem and looked down upon others. . . .
        “The fallen must be led to feel that it is not too late for them to be
     men. Christ honored man with His confidence and thus placed him on
     his honor. Even those who had fallen the lowest He treated with respect.
     It was a continual pain to Christ to be brought into contact with enmity,
     depravity, and impurity; but never did He utter one expression to show
     that His sensibilities were shocked or His refined tastes offended.
     Whatever the evil habits, the strong prejudices, or the overbearing
     passions of human beings, He met them all with pitying tenderness.
     As we partake of His Spirit, we shall regard all men as brethren, with
     similar temptations and trials, often falling and struggling to rise again,
     battling with discouragements and difficulties, craving sympathy and
     help. Then we shall meet them in such a way as not to discourage or
     repel them, but to awaken hope in their hearts.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Ministry of Healing, pp. 164, 165.

Discussion Questions:
       What personal attitudes might need to be changed in order
      for you to become an effective witness to social outcasts? What
      congregational practices should be altered to make your church
      more effective? How should modern Christians establish reason-
      able expectations when working for those who are deemed to be
      the hardest and most difficult cases?

       How did Jesus avoid both excusing sins and condemning sin-
      ners? In what ways did Christ utilize trust, encouragement, and
      confidence in reversing the downward spiral of social outcasts?
      Since social outcasts were generally suspicious of religious leaders,
      how did Christ make these potential disciples comfortable with
      Himself?

       What barriers stand between social outcasts and your church?
      How can those barriers be overturned?

                                                    Story
The Godfather’s Son
   Mitia [MEE-tyah] was the son of a crime syndicate godfather. His
father was rich and powerful, and Mitia admired him. Mitia quit school
and started his own criminal business with his father’s guidance. Soon
Mitia was enjoying the riches of crime, just as his father did.
   Then two of Mitia’s employees were arrested. They named Mitia,
and police went to arrest him. But someone warned Mitia, and he fled
before the police arrived. He hid in a neighboring country to wait until
it was safe to return home.
   While in hiding, someone gave Mitia some Christian literature. It
spoke of a life based on love, forgiveness, and obedience. Mitia won-
dered if such a life could be possible.
   The literature referred to the Bible, and Mitia searched for one. He
found one in a pile of old books in a market. Once he began reading,
he couldn’t put the Bible down. Who was this Jesus, whose life had
changed so many people—people like him? As he read, his former life
no longer appealed to him. He yearned for the peace, the hope, and the
love he saw in Jesus.
   Mitia wanted to tell his family what he had discovered. But as soon as
he arrived home, he was arrested. His two former employees had been
sentenced to death, and Mitia knew that he faced the same fate.
   In prison, Mitia found comfort in reading his Bible and sharing God’s
message of forgiveness with the other prisoners. To his surprise, he was
released from prison.
   Mitia remembered a Christian neighbor and went to ask her questions
about God that puzzled him. She recognized Mitia and had reason to
fear him, but she invited him into her home. Soon they were reading
Bible verses that answered Mitia’s questions. She invited him to join a
small group of Christians who worshiped in a house on Sabbath. Mitia
went and was amazed to realize that the Seventh-day Adventists taught
everything he had read in the Bible.
   When Mitia’s former friends invited him to party or take drugs, Mitia
responded, “I’m done with those things. I have a new life now centered
in God.” Indeed, God’s love so transformed Mitia’s life that many who
knew him listened as he told them that Jesus wants to be their Lord, as
well.
   Today, Mitia spends his time leading others to Jesus. One piece of
literature changed his life. Our mission offerings help provide literature
that can lead thousands like Mitia to God. Thank you for helping to tell
the world that God loves them.

      With the Rich and Famous




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Deut. 8:17, 18; Gen. 13:5, 6;
      John 3:1–15; Luke 19:1–10; Mark 4:18, 19; Matt. 19:16–26.

Memory Text: “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil,
      for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and
      pierced themselves through with many sorrows” (1 Timothy 6:10,
      NKJV).



      P
            eople,” it has been said, “spend money they don’t have, for things
            they don’t need, in order to impress people they don’t like.” How
            much truth that statement contains is debatable; what isn’t debat-
      able, however, is that money can have a powerful influence over all of
      us. Because personal financial habits comprehensively represent an
      individual’s values, money is actually a spiritual matter. No doubt that’s
      why the Bible spends a lot of time talking about it.
         Also, fame frequently accompanies wealth. Motion picture stars, out-
      standing athletes, and national politicians often possess both. Famous
      people exercise influence, which is one form of power. Jesus, however,
      was not impressed by anyone’s wealth or power. He simply sought to
      reach these wealthy people for the same reason that He tried to reach
      everyone else: He wanted them to have the kind of riches that money
      cannot buy.

     Richly Blessed
       As fallen human beings, we are subject to jealousy, especially toward
     those who have more money than we do (regardless of how much money
     we ourselves might have already). The Bible, however, does not uncon-
     ditionally disparage wealth or the wealthy. As with so much else in life,
     problems arise not from things themselves but from the way in which
     we relate to them.

What counsel regarding wealth does Scripture offer? Deut. 8:17, 18;
     Gen. 13:5, 6; 41:41–43; Job 1:1–3; Dan. 4:28–31. Why was it so
     important for Israel not to forget where its blessings came from?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        There is no question that people such as Abraham, Joseph, Mordecai,
     Esther, Hezekiah, Josiah, and Jehoshaphat were wealthy and spiritu-
     ally minded, as well. Nebuchadnezzar’s example, however, shows the
     danger that comes from making wealth an idol, which is so easy for
     anyone to do. Conversely, for ancient Israel, acknowledging God’s
     generosity in this supplying of wealth brought spiritual and material
     blessings. They were specifically warned not to forget from where
     those blessings came. (A good lesson for all of us, is it not?)
        In short, riches themselves do not indicate spiritual poverty or indif-
     ference. There have been some very pious and faithful rich people and
     some pretty nasty and evil ones, as well. Either way, we should not turn
     a desire for money into an obsession, nor should we despise those who
     are wealthy. They need salvation as much as everyone else does.

      What are your own attitudes toward the rich? It’s easy to be
      jealous, is it not? How can you learn to move beyond those feel-
      ings and to see wealthy individuals as we all are, as souls in need
      of a saving knowledge of Jesus?

     Nighttime Rendezvous
       Wealthy, well-positioned famous people did not intimidate Jesus.
     Christ neither resented nor revered the social elite. The Savior rec-
     ognized that financial prosperity could not supply peace, personal
     contentment, meaningful relationships, or deep-seated purpose. The
     wealthiest magnate could easily be lonelier, emptier, and angrier than
     the simplest, poorest, and most humble Christian believer.

Analyze Jesus’ interaction with Nicodemus (John 3:1–15). Which
     events probably stimulated Nicodemus’s interest in Jesus’ message?
     (Hint: review John 2:13–25.) What significance does the darkness
     play? What is Christ’s central message for Nicodemus?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Nicodemus had witnessed God’s power and authority as revealed
     through Jesus’ ministry and thus sought to meet with Him, but in secret.
     Jesus might have refused this secretive overture, but, unwilling that any
     should perish, He readily accepted this opportunity to bring Nicodemus
     another step closer to the kingdom. Nicodemus’s poverty was spiritual
     not material. Enriched with worldly goods and an elevated social posi-
     tion, he was, nonetheless, spiritually starving.
        Instinctively, Nicodemus rebelled against any suggestion that knowl-
     edgeable Israelites like himself should require conversion. Jesus, how-
     ever, persisted, presenting Nicodemus with the eternal choice between
     judgment and salvation. Fearing denunciation and ridicule, Nicodemus
     refused to accept Christ’s invitation. The interview had apparently
     failed. That spiritual seed, however, lay buried, slowly germinating
     beneath his heart’s soil.
        “After the Lord’s ascension, when the disciples were scattered by
     persecution, Nicodemus came boldly to the front. He employed his
     wealth in sustaining the infant church that the Jews had expected to
     be blotted out at the death of Christ. In the time of peril he who had
     been so cautious and questioning was firm as a rock, encouraging
     the faith of the disciples, and furnishing means to carry forward
     the work of the gospel. He was scorned and persecuted by those
     who had paid him reverence in other days. He became poor in this
     world’s goods; yet he faltered not in the faith which had its beginning in
     that night conference with Jesus.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
     p. 177.

     Rich and Infamous
       Respectability does not always accompany wealth. Though many do
     earn their wealth honestly through hard work, industriousness, and the
     blessings of God, others are outright crooks. Even worse, some make
     their money legally but immorally, for not everything immoral is ille-
     gal, as we all know so well.

Compare Matthew 9:10–13 with Luke 5:27–32, 19:1–10. What moti-
     vated the criticism that Jesus faced? What does His reaction to the
     criticism teach us about grace?

        Jericho, Zacchaeus’s residence, had become a significant commer-
     cial center and housed the Herodian palace. Because of its geographi-
     cal location, it maintained a customs gathering station. Zacchaeus
     could have easily enriched himself legally as the chief regional
     customs officer. The narrative, however, suggests that greed induced
     him to overstep legal boundaries. Zealous patriots despised even hon-
     est customs collectors, seeing them as tools of their Roman oppres-
     sors, but they greatly disdained dishonest ones such as Zacchaeus.
     Matthew (Levi) occupied a similar position in Capernaum, under
     Herod Antipas. Essentially having assumed the role of Roman gov-
     ernmental agents, they were viewed as traitors, or worse yet, thieving
     traitors.
        Nonetheless, Christ was not deterred. Defying social constraints,
     Jesus dined with them, drawing intense criticism from priests and com-
     moners alike. And, by Jesus’ interaction with them, these despised men
     were eventually won to the gospel. (For example, Matthew not only
     became one of the Twelve but also an author in the New Testament!)
        Again, we should be careful about the kind of spiritual judgments
     we make about people. Though not all sins are of the same magnitude,
     and some are certainly socially worse (and with good reason) than
     others, all of us are equal before God in that we are all in need of the
     righteousness of Christ.

      Think of some well-known but despised (and perhaps under-
      standably so) personage in your culture. Imagine what it would
      be like if you had a chance to witness to that person. Would you
      even want to? What would you say?
                                                                          67

     Gold-plated Message
Analyze the following passages: Mark 4:18, 19; Luke 1:51–53;
     6:22–25; 12:16–21; 16:13. What practical advice do these verses
     contain? What spiritual warnings are found here? How might
     these Scriptures be utilized by believers to make disciples among
     the wealthy?

     _________________________________________________________

        It has been said that we don’t own our things; our things own us. How
     easy it is to be consumed by material possessions; hence, Jesus warned
     above about “the deceitfulness of riches.”
        Think through just how easy it is for money, or the pursuit of it,
     to blind our spiritual priorities. How crucial that we keep this truth
     in mind as we seek to reach those whose wealth might have already
     blinded them.
        At the same time, we all need a reality check. Some people live as
     if the one question that they will be asked on Judgment Day is, How
     much money did you make?
        Christ reverses our misplaced priorities. While possessions are
     not forbidden, they must be placed in perspective. Material goods
     are God’s instruments designed to benefit humanity. They become
     blessings when shared rather than when hoarded. When hoarded, they
     become curses.
        Materialistic persons, whether rich or poor, are in danger of sacrific-
     ing their eternal well-being for temporal pleasures. Eternal satisfaction
     is exchanged for passing fancies that deteriorate and become outdated.
     Humans serve God or money, never both. Everyone, rich or poor, needs
     to be reminded: “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the
     whole world, and lose his own soul?” (Mark 8:36).

      This warning about materialism is important for all believers,
      not only for their own souls’ sakes but for outreach as well. After
      all, how can we warn the wealthy about the potential spiritual
      dangers contained by their wealth when we ourselves are caught
      up in the same thing?

     Terms of Endangerment
Study Matthew 19:16–26. What spiritual dangers are revealed in this
     passage? How might believers benefit today’s “rich young rulers”?

        He possessed credentials, qualifications, abundant material resources,
     unquestioned morality, and unlimited self-esteem! The youthful
     disciple-­candidate earnestly requested the Master’s formula for sal-
     vation. Should Christ have been flattered? “Finally we’re converting
     the upper classes!” Apparently no such exhilaration polluted Christ’s
     thinking. Had this petitioner expected commendation, he was sorely
     disappointed. Instead, Christ established the Ten Commandments as
     the minimum standard of obedience. Perhaps the young ruler had
     congratu­ lated himself. By his self-measurement, he surpassed the
     first hurdle. Christ, however, had elsewhere demanded righteousness
     that exceeded that which other religious leaders possessed. Would
     that standard be lowered to accommodate this candidate? Judas would
     have been ecstatic. Whoever handled public relations would have been
     overjoyed. Think what having wealthy supporters aboard could mean
     image-wise.
        Spiritual deficiencies, however, cannot be overlooked nor minimized,
     for the mission of Jesus is sacred. Compromise cannot be tolerated.
     Every selfish indulgence must be surrendered. Christ outlined the
     three-step process: sell your possessions, furnish the poverty-stricken,
     follow Me. This was spiritually dangerous territory. Although young,
     the would-be disciple had accumulated a sizable fortune. Luxurious
     houses, beautiful vineyards, productive fields, fashionable clothing,
     jewelry collections, servants, livestock, perhaps speedy customized
     chariots—all these might have flashed through his mind. God’s terms
     were inflexible. Neither bargaining nor negotiating could reduce the
     price: everything for Jesus; worldly greatness exchanged for heavenly
     treasure.
        “How many have come to Christ, ready to cast their interests in with
     his, and, like the rich young ruler, earnestly desiring to inherit eternal
     life! But when the cost is presented to them—when they are told that
     they must forsake all, houses and lands, wife and children, and count
     not their lives dear unto themselves—they go away sorrowful. They
     want the treasures of heaven, and the life that measures with the life
     of God, but they are not willing to give up their earthly treasures. They
     are not willing to surrender all to obtain the crown of life.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, April 19, 1898.
                                                                            69

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Nicodemus,” pp. 167–177;
     “Levi-Matthew,” pp. 272–280; “ ‘One Thing Thou Lackest,’ ” pp. 518–
     523; “Zacchaeus,” pp. 552–556, in The Desire of Ages; “Ministry to the
     Rich,” pp. 209–216, in The Ministry of Healing.

        “Much is said concerning our duty to the neglected poor; should not
     some attention be given to the neglected rich? Many look upon this
     class as hopeless, and they do little to open the eyes of those, who,
     blinded and dazed by the glitter of earthly glory, have lost eternity out
     of their reckoning. Thousands of wealthy men have gone to their graves
     unwarned. But indifferent as they may appear, many among the rich are
     soul-burdened. ‘He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
     nor he that loveth abundance with increase.’ He that says to fine gold,
     ‘Thou art my confidence,’ has ‘denied the God that is above.’ ‘None of
     them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom
     for him: (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
     forever).’ . . .
        “Riches and worldly honor cannot satisfy the soul. Many among the
     rich are longing for some divine assurance, some spiritual hope. Many
     long for something that will bring to an end the monotony of their aim-
     less lives. Many in official life feel their need of something which they
     have not. Few among them go to church; for they feel that they receive
     little benefit. The teaching they hear does not touch the heart. Shall we
     make no personal appeal to them?”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of
     Healing, p. 210.

Discussion Questions:
       Wealthy converts played important roles in financially sustain-
      ing the infant Christian movement. Though exceptions existed,
      sacrificial giving characterized the well-to-do believers. God’s
      kingdom consists of honest-hearted people from every social
      class. Christians should be neither intimidated nor enamored
      by wealthy people but should fearlessly proclaim God’s revela-
      tion that they may be saved. Understanding that we should never
      compromise theology and principle, what practical changes can
      your church make so that wealthy people will find it easier to
      find fellowship there? How is your church’s evangelistic strategy
      addressing the need to make disciples among the well-to-do? What
      specific things can your church realistically do to reach the rich?

       Look at the Bible verses that Ellen G. White used in the state-
      ment in Friday’s study. What is the essence of what they are say-
      ing? How can we help those who think that their happiness will be
      found in wealth and material possessions to realize that they are
      on the wrong track?

A Flame for Jesus
  Daniel Santay is a shining star for Jesus in Cambodia. He says, “Ever
since I can remember, I’ve loved Jesus.”
  Daniel’s father was the example that inspired the boy to share God’s
love with others. “When I was seven years old,” Daniel says, “I told
my dad I wanted to be like him and preach someday. He told me, ‘You
don’t have to wait. Start now; share Jesus with your friends now.’ ”
  Daniel accepted his father’s challenge and began sharing God’s
love with his friends. “I felt God’s power through the Holy Spirit
working in me,” Daniel said. “He is working in my heart and helping
me share my love for Jesus with other children.” Daniel began trav-
eling with his father and teaching the children while his dad taught
the adults.
  Then his father became ill. Before long, he was too sick to travel
or preach. He became too weak to work at his government job. One
day he gathered his family around him and told them he wasn’t going
to get well. He challenged them to stay close to God and to continue
sharing God’s love with everyone they met. He promised his family
that one day they would be together again when Jesus comes. They
would never have to say goodbye.
  Daniel’s father died when Daniel was just eight. “Some days I miss
him so much,” Daniel says. “But I have hope that I will see him soon
in heaven. Then I will tell him that I kept my promise to preach to
others.”
  Daniel and his three siblings and their mother continue sharing
their faith in Cambodia. His mother works hard to provide for the
children and keep them in a Seventh-day Adventist school.
  Daniel helps his mother around the house and enjoys reading. He
knows that God is calling him to be a pastor, just like his father. “I
want to keep telling others about Jesus,” he says, “to help them know
Christ.”
  Daniel remembers asking his father when Jesus will come again.
His father told him, “Jesus will come when everyone has had a
chance to hear God’s message of love through Jesus.” Daniel contin-
ues telling others that God loves them and that Jesus died for them.
He can’t wait until Jesus can come so he can see his father again, and
together they can meet their heavenly Father for the first time.
  Our mission offerings help support the Adventist school that
Daniel and his siblings attend; this is one way we can help share
God’s love in Cambodia and around the world.

Daniel Chotal Santay is helping people prepare for Jesus’ coming in his homeland,
Cambodia.

      Discipling the Powerful




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 13:1–7, Mark 2:23–28,
      Matt. 8:5–13, 26:57–68, 27:11–14, Acts 4:1–12.

Memory Text: “The word of God continued to spread; the num-
      ber of the disciples increased greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many
      of the priests became obedient to the faith” (Acts 6:7, NRSV).



      T
              he disciples were not endowed with the courage and fortitude
              of the martyrs until such grace was needed. Then the Saviour’s
              promise was fulfilled. When Peter and John testified before the
      Sanhedrin council, men ‘marveled; and they took knowledge of them,
      that they had been with Jesus.’ Acts 4:13. Of Stephen it is written that
      ‘all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as
      it had been the face of an angel’ [Acts 6:15]. Men ‘were not able to
      resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.’ [Acts 6:10]. And
      Paul, writing of his own trial at the court of the Caesars, says, ‘At my
      first defense no one took my part, but all forsook me. . . . But the Lord
      stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might
      be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was
      delivered out of the mouth of the lion.’ 2 Tim. 4:16, 17, R. V.”—Ellen
      G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 354, 355.

     Respecting Authority
       Over the long centuries, people have struggled to understand the
     role and function of government and how citizens should relate to it.
     What gives rulers the right to rule? What is the best form of govern-
     ment? Should people always obey their governments? If not, why not?
     These are just a few of a host of questions that we still wrestle with
     to this day.

Read Romans 13:1–7. What important message is in there for us?
     How, though, can these texts and the message they teach be abused?
     What examples do we have in history of that happening? How can
     we as a church learn from these mistakes, even in our own history,
     as well as from the mistakes of the Christian church in general?

       Oppression and brutality characterized the Roman Empire during
     Christ’s time. Roman legions terrorized and subjugated civilized nations,
     forcibly bringing them into the empire. Hundreds of thousands were
     dispossessed, imprisoned, and murdered. Puppet governments permit-
     ted by Rome were probably worse than Rome itself. Yet, interestingly
     enough, Jesus never advocated any kind of rebellion against this gov-
     ernment, or even the withholding of taxes from it (see Luke 20:25).
     Jesus’ singular act of civil disobedience—overturning the money­
     changers’ tables—demonstrated the revulsion He felt regarding priestly
     abuses. It was not against the Romans, per se.
       “The people of God will recognize human government as an ordi-
     nance of divine appointment and will teach obedience to it as a sacred
     duty within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the
     claims of God, the word of God must be recognized as above all human
     legislation. ‘Thus saith the Lord’ is not to be set aside for Thus saith
     the church or the state. The crown of Christ is to be uplifted above the
     diadems of earthly potentates.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
     Church, vol. 6, p. 402.
                                                                           73

     “Have You Not Read . . .?”
        Unfortunately, some of the most powerful and influential people with
     whom Jesus dealt were the religious leaders of His time, many of whom
     were openly hostile to Him.
        Yet, even in His encounters with them, Jesus always sought to be
     redemptive. He wasn’t seeking arguments; He was seeking the salva-
     tion of all people, even of those powerful and influential people who
     would eventually condemn Him to death.

Read Mark 2:23–28, 3:1–6, Matthew 12:1–16. How can we see, in these
     encounters, that Jesus—despite the overt hostility against Him—
     was trying to reach these men? What did He say and do that should
     have touched their hearts, were they not so closed?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       It’s interesting that, in dealing with these people, Jesus referred to the
     Scriptures and even sacred history, sources that should have touched
     the religious leaders. Jesus was appealing to what should have been
     common ground between them. For instance, He quoted the Bible when
     He talked about the importance of mercy over ritual. By so doing, He
     sought to bring the leaders to a deeper meaning of the law that they
     claimed to cherish and uphold so fervently and devoutly.
       In His discourse about pulling an animal out of a pit on the Sabbath
     day, Jesus then appealed to their most basic notions of decency and
     kindness, something that these men all should have related 10. The
     problem, however, was that their bitterness and hatred toward Jesus
     clouded even that.
       Finally, the miracles themselves should have spoken loudly to these
     influential leaders about the extraordinary Man among them.

      It’s easy, from our position today, to look back in wonder at the
      blindness and hardness of these men. How, though, can we make
      sure that we ourselves, when seeking to protect something that
      we don’t want to give up, don’t close ourselves to more light from
      God? Why is that easier to do than we might think?

     The Centurion
       While several of Christ’s encounters with powerful people ended
     acrimoniously, there were notable exceptions, such as with Nicodemus.
     Another constructive meeting involved a Roman centurion (ranking
     military officer).

Read Matthew 8:5–13 and Luke 7:1–10. What can we learn from these
     accounts about witnessing to people in power?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        When the centurion learned that Jesus was approaching, he dispatched
     several friends to dissuade Christ from coming. Deeply respecting Jewish
     worship and Jesus’ spirituality, he felt undeserving of Christ’s personal
     attention. Finally, just before Jesus arrived, he ventured to approach
     Him. He explained the situation, expressing faith that Christ’s declara-
     tion alone could restore the servant. Drawing on military experience, he
     understood authority. He obeyed his commanding officer, and his subor-
     dinates obeyed him. How amazing that this man of power and influence
     (and a Roman, as well!) could show such deep faith when many who had
     so many more spiritual advantages spurned Jesus.
        Honest self-examination is profitable here. We need to ask ourselves
     whether we have become complacent and are merely espousing correct
     doctrines instead of experiencing living faith. Have newer, lesser-equipped
     believers nevertheless expressed deeper faith than those raised within
     Christianity? Have our spiritual advantages become occasions for self-
     dependency? Have spiritual opportunities escaped unnoticed? Whenever
     we answer affirmatively, Christ is the answer. Anyone can enjoy the centu-
     rion’s experience. This story should encourage those evangelizing among
     people in powerful positions. How many twenty-first century centurions
     are there? May their faith inspire and strengthen ours.

      There is a power to a selflessness and self-abnegating ministry
      that can touch anyone of any rank or class. What of these traits
      do we manifest in our own lives and witness?

     Judgment Day
Read Matthew 26:57–68, 27:11–14, Luke 23:1–12, John 18:19–23,
     31–40, 19:8–12. What can we learn from Jesus’ witness to these pow-
     erful men?

        Within these final scenes of Jesus’ earthly sojourn, Christ’s follow-
     ers glimpse the painful price of unflinching faithfulness. From arrest
     until crucifixion, Christ bears witness before the most powerful in
     the land: monarchs, governors, priests. Person by person He studies
     those intoxicated with worldly authority. Apparently, they control Him.
     Soldiers shuffle Jesus between their courtrooms, their councils, their
     palaces, and their judgment halls, unaware that ultimately this is His
     world. Whatever judgment they pronounce against Christ is ultimately
     the judgment they pronounce against themselves.
        While Christ witnessed to make disciples, sometimes the outcome
     was vastly different from what He Himself would have wished. How
     Jesus would have rejoiced had Pilate, Caiaphas, Herod, and others
     surrendered their hearts and repented. Stubbornly, they refused His
     entreaties, callously bypassing their final invitation to salvation.
        Likewise, Christ’s twenty-first-century followers should recognize
     that while they witness to make disciples, the outcome often appears
     vastly different from what they would wish and pray for. Measurable
     success may not always attend their efforts. This should neither dis-
     courage them nor inhibit further witnessing. The genuine disciple
     is, like Christ Himself, faithful until death, not faithful until disap-
     pointed. Calling listeners to a decision separates wheat from chaff.
     The wheat is celebrated. The chaff is mourned. The harvest continues.
     Notwithstanding Christ’s apparently unsuccessful witness before these
     powerful men, something marvelous happened, for, according to Acts
     6:7, not only did the number of disciples multiply, but “a great many of
     the priests were obedient to the faith” (NKJV). God alone knows how
     many of those priests were there, listening and watching Jesus in those
     final hours.

The Early Explosion
   Christ’s earliest disciples energetically advanced the gospel through-
out the civilized world. Houses, synagogues, public stadiums, judgment
halls, and royal palaces became stages for kingdom proclamation.
Jesus, however, prophesied arrests, trials, and hostile royal audiences
for those disciples (Matt. 10:16–20). Unfortunately, those saturated
with earthly power were slowest to receive Christ.
   Read through as much of Acts 4:1–12; 13:5–12, 50; 23:1–6; 25:23–
26:28 as you can. Though one can get the idea that so many people
were instantly converted out of nowhere, that’s not what happened.
These dramatic results were the visible product of underlying circum-
stances. Seedtime precedes harvest. Christ had faithfully proclaimed
the gospel. Missionaries had witnessed throughout Judea. Early con-
verts no doubt helped to carry the message. When Christ personally
conquered death, confirming His message, thousands of fence-sitters
leaped into the kingdom. They had secretly followed Him. Their hearts
had responded to His invitations. Cultural factors, job security, and
family pressures had slowed their overt responses. Christ’s resurrection
destroyed the fence, forcing a decision.
   Then, of course, the apostle Paul entered the picture. His witness,
however, was not universally appreciated. Sometimes prominent men
and women persecuted and expelled him. He was stoned, flogged,
imprisoned, and otherwise mistreated—often at the instigation of pow-
erful people. Political motives were frequently the foundation for their
anti-Christian sentiments.
   Governor Felix imprisoned Paul in order to placate religious opposi-
tion to Paul. His successor, Festus, was more fair-minded but lacked
the political willpower to release Paul. During an official visit, King
Agrippa and his sister, Bernice (descendants of Herod’s dynasty),
requested an audience with Paul. Unfortunately, like their ancestors
before them, they rejected his invitation to salvation. Although facing
similar rejection and persecution, Christ’s twenty-first-century dis-
ciples must likewise persevere.

 How can disciple-makers working among worldly and religious
 authorities avoid the discouragement of frequent rejection?
 Whenever Christ’s followers labor for powerful people, who else
 might be affected by their witnessing?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Centurion,” pp. 315–318;
     “Before Annas and the Court of Caiaphas,” pp. 698–715; “In Pilate’s
     Judgment Hall,” pp. 723–740, in The Desire of Ages; “Ministry to
     the Rich,” pp. 209–216, in The Ministry of Healing; “Almost Thou
     Persuadest Me,” pp. 433–438, in The Acts of the Apostles.

       “It is by no casual, accidental touch that wealthy, world-loving,
     world-worshiping souls can be drawn to Christ. These persons are often
     the most difficult of access. Personal effort must be put forth for them
     by men and women imbued with the missionary spirit, those who will
     not fail or be discouraged.
       “Some are especially fitted to work for the higher classes.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 213.

Discussion Questions:
       Whenever Jesus witnessed to powerful people, others noticed.
      Some were in powerful positions, others not. Like Nicodemus
      and Joseph of Arimathea, many among the educated priestly
      class came to faith gradually. Some bystanders who witnessed
      Christ’s confrontations with religious leaders likewise believed.
      Volcanic turbulence usually lies hidden beneath the mountain’s
      crust. Visually gauging intensity is impossible. Accurately mea-
      suring activity requires special instruments. Similarly, the explo-
      sive potential of Jesus’ movement remained hidden during His
      earthly ministry. Following His resurrection, however, the king-
      dom erupted, evidenced by massive conversions, even among those
      in influential positions. The faithful planting was finally yielding
      its abundant harvest. What should these facts tell us about how
      important it is that we not get discouraged when our witness
      doesn’t appear as effective as we would like it to be, especially
      among the powerful elite?

       Ellen G. White wrote in the statement above that some were
      especially fitted for the work of reaching the powerful. What
      might some of those qualifications be? At the same time, why must
      we be careful to not limit those who we might think are not quali-
      fied?

God’s Surprising Answer
   I wanted to attend a university after high school, but I didn’t score
high enough on some of my exams to qualify for the public university.
So I decided to work parttime while I studied to retake the exams.
   My employers were Seventh-day Adventist Christians. They sug-
gested that I apply to study at Valley View University, the Adventist
university in Ghana. My father said that he’d heard good things about
the school, so I applied and was accepted.
   My roommates were fine Christian women. I saw the difference their
faith made in their lives, and I wanted to know what Adventists believe.
I asked lots of questions about the Bible, which they answered most
willingly.
   During the school’s Week of Spiritual Emphasis, I became convinced
that Adventists are not a cult; they are Bible-following Christians. I
asked to join the Adventist Church.
   My parents were disappointed to learn that I wanted to join the
Adventist Church and threatened to transfer me to the public university.
But I asked the pastor and my friends to pray that God would help me
to stay at Valley View. My father eventually agreed.
   However, the devil had other ways to cause trouble. My father lost
his job and couldn’t support me in school. Some members of my family
accused me of joining a cult and using witchcraft to make my father
lose his job. I couldn’t do anything but pray for them and for my future
at Valley View. I found part-time work and sold books during vacations
to pay my school bills. Friends, pastors, and the school faculty helped
me stay in school.
   When my father found another job, he again paid my school fees. He
even asked me to give up the scholarship I was receiving so that some-
one more needy could benefit from it.
   My whole family attended my graduation. I had a chance to introduce
them to people who had made a difference in my life. Dad was so glad
that the school had helped me complete my education when he couldn’t
help.
   My family doesn’t mock my faith now. They listen when I share my
beliefs with them. I pray that they will continue to grow in the knowl-
edge of God, as I did while at Valley View University.
   Your mission offerings help sustain and expand Valley View
University, which has a reputation for excellence in education and
faithfulness to God’s principles. Thank you.

      Discipling the Nations




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 56:6–8; Matt. 11:20–24;
      John 12:20–32; Rom. 15:12; Acts 1:7, 8.

Memory Text: “ ‘For My house shall be called a house of prayer
      for all nations’ ” (Isaiah 56:7, NKJV).



      C
              hrist’s message, from its inception, was destined for everyone
              everywhere. Early on, the gospel went worldwide, because it
              is universally applicable. Doubtless, this concept challenged
      the disciples’ thinking. Their initial reaction, for instance, to Christ’s
      conversing with the Samaritan woman illustrates this challenge. They
      thought that Jesus as the Messiah was merely the fulfillment of Jewish
      prophecies and hopes. Somehow they had missed or misinterpreted the
      prophets, especially Isaiah, whose message encompassed all peoples.
      Jesus, the Desire of all nations, was not to be limited to a single group.
      Salvation might be of the Jews, but it was for everyone. Christ’s fol-
      lowers would transcend national boundaries, international conflicts,
      language differences, and other difficulties, because He had established
      the pattern of cross-cultural evangelism.
        As Seventh-day Adventists, we especially see this call in Revelation
      14:6—“Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having
      the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to
      every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” (NKJV).

     The Prophets Foretold
        Ancient prophets foretold the conversion of non-Jewish people
     (Gentiles) to a scripturally based faith. Heathen deities, pagan wor-
     ship, and destructive lifestyles would be toppled by uncompromising
     submission to, and faith in, Jehovah. Israel’s enemies would stream into
     Jerusalem begging for admission, thirsting for spiritual knowledge.
     Israel’s commission was to broadcast God’s universal invitation to the
     surrounding nations.
        Unfortunately, Israel’s missionary passion was derailed by earthly
     concerns. The grand vision was buried beneath complacency. Christ’s
     coming resurrected that vision, at least for some.

Read Isaiah 56:6–8; Micah 4:1, 2; Jonah 3:7–10; 4:1. What do these
     verses teach about universal outreach, and about how limited some
     in Israel were in understanding it?

        Israel was to be the light of the nations. Seeing the wonderful advan-
     tages that the Israelites had, heathen nations would inquire about the
     Israelites’ monotheistic faith, and thus many of them would be con-
     verted to the true God.
        Unfortunately, that’s not how things generally turned out, as Israel
     became so inwardly focused that it lost sight of its larger purpose and,
     often, the God who had offered it so much.
        Modern Christians face a similar challenge. Will they sacrificially
     invest in furthering the gospel, or will they become inwardly focused,
     forgetting their larger purpose? It’s an easier trap to fall into than we
     realize.
        “In the name of the Lord let us lift up our voices in praise and thanks-
     giving for the results of work abroad.
        “And still our General, who never makes a mistake, says to us:
     ‘Advance. Enter new territory. Lift up the standard in every land.
     “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen
     upon thee.” ’
        “Our watchword is to be: Onward, ever onward. The angels of God
     will go before us to prepare the way. Our burden for the ‘regions
     beyond’ can never be laid down until the whole earth shall be light-
     ened with the glory of the Lord.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
     Church, vol. 6, pp. 28, 29.
                                                                             81

     Woe Unto Thee!
Read Matthew 11:20–24, Luke 4:25–30, 17:11–19, John 10:16. What
     crucial message comes from these texts? How can we take what is
     written here and apply it to ourselves, in our own time and context?
     What principle is revealed here that we have to be very careful
     about?

       Christ wanted His own people, those who had so many advantages,
     to wake up to what their true calling and purpose was as a people. He
     wanted them to see that salvation, even for the chosen nation, was not
     something that a person is born in10. It’s not passed on in the genes or
     by a birthright. It was something that requires a conscious choice to
     accept, a choice that even those who weren’t of Israel could, and did,
     make.
       Athletic coaches sometimes challenge their athletes by comparing
     them with competing schools or organizations. “If you’d practice as
     faithfully, energetically, and intensely as they do, you’d enjoy success.”
     The coach’s obvious motivation is to inspire, to build up desire rather
     than diminish it.
       In the same way, Jesus wanted His own people to share the fullness
     of salvation as some non-Jewish people were already doing. No doubt
     His words scandalized some because He preached something that they
     didn’t want to hear, however much these truths should have already
     been known and understood by them.
       Some people might indeed have many spiritual advantages that oth-
     ers don’t have, but those who have these advantages must realize that,
     whatever they have been given, they are all gifts from God, to be used
     for His glory and not their own.

      What about us? What about all the advantages that we, as a
      people, have been given by God? Why is it important, first, to
      recognize those advantages; then, second, humbly to realize the
      responsibilities that come with them?

     “We Would See Jesus”

     revealed in these verses?

       Jerusalem was buzzing with rumors. Christ’s triumphal entry had just
     occurred. Hosannas, though, were quickly replaced by questions. What
     was going to happen next? Would Jesus be crowned king?
       Among the crowd assembling for Passover were Greek worship-
     ers. Notice their words to Philip, “Sir, we would see Jesus.” In other
     words, they wanted to see Jesus. They wanted to be with Him. They
     wanted to learn from Him. What a testimony to the universal charac-
     ter of Christ and His message! How sad, too, that those who should
     have said the same thing were the very ones who wanted to be rid of
     Him.
       The Greeks probably approached Philip because he carried a Greek
     name. Coming from Bethsaida, a commercial fishing center—hence,
     a cultural melting pot—he probably spoke their language too. The text
     suggests that Jesus was not immediately present. Perhaps He worshiped
     nearby in places reserved for Jews.
       However, then joining His disciples and the Greek interviewers
     within the outer court, Jesus granted these men their wish. Notice
     what He said to them: “If any man,” meaning any man, woman, Jew, or
     Greek, wanted to follow Him, they could, but it would come at a cost.

What was that cost? How do we understand the meaning of this? See
     John 12:25.

        Then, with these foreigners still present, heaven thundered a con-
     firming message of judgment and conquest. That Voice was heard,
     Jesus said, not for Him but for them, Jew and Greek, that their faith
     could be strengthened. Christ’s words immediately affirmed that His
     death was to be for all the world.

                                                                        83

     Breaking Down Barriers
Read John 7:35, 8:48, Luke 10:27–37. In what way do these verses
     show why regional, ethnic, and other barriers should have no place
     among Christians as they seek to make disciples among all nations?

     _________________________________________________________

       Some of the leaders’ contempt for Jesus knew no bounds. Again, the
     terrible irony was that those who should have been in the forefront of
     receiving Him and His message were the very ones who fought against
     Him the hardest. Priests of Israel scorned the Son of God when those
     not of Israel accepted Him as the Messiah. What a powerful and sober-
     ing lesson is here for those who deem themselves (perhaps with some
     justification) spiritually advantaged!
       When condemning Christ, they not only labeled Him as having a
     devil, they made it worse by calling Him a Samaritan, as well. They
     even mocked Him for His witness among the Greeks, showing obvi-
     ously their contempt for those not of their own nation and faith. Israel’s
     leaders found it unthinkable that Jesus would consider teaching Greeks.
     Jesus countered this by emphasizing character above ethnic origin.
       How interesting, too, that He used the true story of a Samaritan in
     order to teach a powerful spiritual lesson about what it meant truly
     to fulfill God’s law. Religious leaders, doubtless restrained by their
     twisted understanding of Levitical law and defilement, had earlier
     bypassed the wounded man. The despised foreigner, a Samaritan, had
     conscientiously defied ethnic prejudice, saving the stranger’s life. What
     a stinging rebuke to all those who spurn and scorn someone in need
     only because the person is not of their own ethnic, social, or cultural
     background.

      Think of the last time you perhaps did not help someone in need.
      What justifications did you use not to help? Looking back now,
      what should you have done differently?

     The Great Commission
Read Romans 15:12; Acts 1:7, 8; John 11:52, 53; Matthew 28:19, 20.
     What’s the essential message here, and how does this message fit in
     so well with the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        God’s final work is incomplete until the eternal gospel expressed
     in the message of the three angels found in Revelation 14 has crossed
     every racial, ethnic, national, and geographical boundary. Without
     divulging the precise timing, Scripture unequivocally states that this
     gospel will reach around the world. God’s triumph and its proclama-
     tion are assured.
        The nations’ acceptance of that message is prophesied. This must
     happen, but who will offer themselves as God’s channels of grace?
     Who will join Christ in the overturning of the racial, ethnic, and
     language barriers that impede the gospel’s progress? Who will empty
     their wallets and pocketbooks? Who will sacrifice earthly comforts
     and family associations in order to advance heaven’s cause? These are
     the questions that we all must ask ourselves. What are we doing to
     reach out to others, whoever and wherever they are? How unfortunate
     that some believers allow racial stereotypes, cultural prejudices, and
     satanically designed social barriers to dissuade them from vigorous
     gospel proclamation when their fellow believers are scattered across
     the globe, willingly yielding their lives that the gospel might be
     preached.
        “Our missionary success has been fully proportionate to our self-
     denying, self-sacrificing effort. God alone can estimate the work
     accomplished as the gospel message has been proclaimed in clear,
     straight lines. New fields have been entered, and aggressive work has
     been done. The seeds of truth have been sown, the light has flashed
     upon many minds, bringing enlarged views of God and a more cor-
     rect estimate as to the character to be formed. Thousands have been
     brought to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. They have been
     imbued with the faith that works by love and purifies the soul.”
     —Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 28.




                                                                        85

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Great Commission,”
     pp. 25–34; “Pentecost,” pp. 35–46, in The Acts of the Apostles; “In the
     Outer Court,” pp. 621–626; “The Good Samaritan,” pp. 497–505, in
     The Desire of Ages.

       “A certain Samaritan, in his journey, came where the sufferer was,
     and when he saw him, he had compassion on him. He did not question
     whether the stranger was a Jew or a Gentile. . . .
       “Thus the question, ‘Who is my neighbor?’ is forever answered.
     Christ has shown that our neighbor does not mean merely one of the
     church or faith to which we belong. It has no reference to race, color,
     or class distinction. Our neighbor is every person who needs our help.
     Our neighbor is every soul who is wounded and bruised by the adver-
     sary. Our neighbor is everyone who is the property of God.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Desire of Ages, p. 503.

Discussion Questions:
       What does our financial support of the church’s worldwide
      mission indicate about our real commitment to the gospel com-
      mission? Why must our involvement reach beyond mere financial
      support? In what ways can funds presently allocated to church
      preservation be channeled into cross-cultural evangelism?

       “We are not to feel that the work of the gospel depends prin-
      cipally upon the minister. To every man God has given a work to
      do in connection with His kingdom. Everyone who professes the
      name of Christ is to be an earnest, disinterested worker, ready to
      defend the principles of righteousness. Every soul should take an
      active part in advancing the cause of God. Whatever our calling,
      as Christians we have a work to do in making Christ known to
      the world. We are to be missionaries, having for our chief aim the
      winning of souls to Christ.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
      Church, vol. 6, p. 427. In class, dwell on the meaning of what is
      written here and, as a class, ask what more you could do to help
      finish the work that we have been called to do.

       Dwell more on what Jesus said in John 12:25. What does it
      mean to “hate” our life “in this world”? In what ways are we to
      express this “hatred”?

A Louder Voice
   The Central Sofia Seventh-day Adventist Church in Bulgaria had
a vision to record Sabbath School lessons and sermons to upload on
the Internet for anyone to watch. They had purchased the camera and
other basic equipment to operate the studio, but they needed a few
more pieces of equipment. Where would they get the money to buy the
needed equipment? They prayed and they searched, but they hadn’t
been able to complete the studio.
   Then one Sabbath after vespers, a Bulgarian couple from abroad
found Lena and told her, “We’ve heard about your recording studio, and
we want to help you. What do you need?”
   Lena’s breath caught in her throat. This is it! she thought. God is
doing what He has promised. “We need an air conditioner to protect the
equipment from the heat,” she said.
   “Make a list of what you need,” the man said. Lena and the pastor
gave the man a list of equipment needed to complete the studio. The
cost was about $15,000 in U.S. dollars. As they gave the list to the
couple, the pastor said, “Choose what you’d like to help us with. Only
the air conditioner is urgent.”
   The man and his wife agreed to buy all the equipment, and soon the
Internet station was up and running.
   Word of the Adventist Internet site spread quickly, and people began
watching.
   An old woman called the church to say that her church in a small
Bulgarian village had only a handful of aging Adventists with no
pastor. They felt they had no option but to close the church. Then the
woman’s son brought a computer and set it up in the church so the mem-
bers could join the believers in Sofia via the live video feed through the
Internet. “Not only did the church not close,” the woman said, “but ten
new people are coming to church to watch the video worships.”
   A man reported that he is a sailor aboard a ship. He isn’t an Adventist,
but he was searching for an inspirational Web site on the ship’s com-
puter. The only Web site he could pick up was the Sofia church’s. None
of the 30 crew members are Adventist, but they like the programming
and watch regularly. “Now when we’re in port, I visit an Adventist
church and several other sailors come with me,” he said.
   In the three years that the Web site has been operating, the church
has seen ample evidence of how God can use such resources to reach
searching souls for Jesus. Our mission offerings help implement crea­
tive ministry around the world.

      Discipling Spiritual Leaders




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 6:12–16, John 16:7–14,
      Luke 6:20–49, Jer. 50:31, Isa. 57:15, Acts 1.

Memory Text: “Now it came to pass in those days that He went out
      to the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
      And when it was day, He called His disciples to Himself; and from
      them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles” (Luke 6:12, 13,
      NKJV).



      W
                 hile Jesus was ever active in making disciples, He recognized
                 that His earthly sojourn was short. Therefore He invested
                 Himself in the training of disciples to continue the work after
      He left. He was both their Master Teacher and their Master Trainer.
      While teaching and training are obviously related, teaching usually
      connotes the impartation of knowledge, whereas training suggests for-
      mation or qualification through practice and discipline.
         The disciples’ preparation for leadership certainly involved the
      receiving of knowledge, but spiritual growth was uppermost. They
      needed an experience in the things of God, of faith, of hardship, of
      sanctification, and of self-sacrifice, along with an intellectual under-
      standing of doctrine and theology. Knowledge alone was insufficient
      preparation for the rigorous challenges ahead. Jesus gave them both.

     Leadership Starts Here
       Christ’s earthly sojourn was relatively brief. Therefore, the training
     of disciple-makers was imperative. Whom should He select? How
     many should He choose? Jesus’ disciples doubtless numbered in the
     hundreds. Should everyone undergo mass education? Christ under-
     stood that leadership was cultivated effectively within small groups,
     not mass-produced through lectureships. Limited numbers would be
     chosen for Christ’s initial graduating class.

Study Luke 6:12–16. What did Jesus do before He chose His disciples,
     and why was this so important?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Choosing effectively required advanced wisdom. Jesus approached
     His heavenly Father through prayer to acquire this wisdom. Likewise,
     prayer should precede the selection of leadership candidates in twenty-
     first-century disciple-making. Since Christ apparently believed that
     He needed extensive prayer in order to obtain the wisdom required,
     how much more should today’s Christians petition for divine wisdom
     when choosing those charged with overseeing the progress of the Great
     Commission?
        Having chosen twelve, Jesus designated them apostles—His com-
     missioned representatives invested with spiritual authority. The larger
     group of disciples witnessed this ordaining or commissioning with no
     apparent jealousy or negative feelings. Later, Jesus would commis-
     sion a larger group of seventy-two and, perhaps, others not recorded
     within Scripture. The twelve apostles, however, retained the identity
     of those most closely associated with Jesus; they shouldered the larg-
     est responsibilities and, therefore, required the most extensive train-
     ing and commitment. This arrangement clearly implies intentional
     organizational structure among the earliest Christians. Christ spiritu-
     ally invested the leaders within that organization with capabilities and
     education commensurate to their assigned tasks.


      Think through the implications of how much time Jesus spent in
      prayer. What should this tell us about our own prayer lives? What
      does prayer do for you?

     Knowledge and Experience: Part 1
       Information was an irreplaceable component of Jesus’ message.
     Information alone cannot transform, but every transformation includes
     information. Certainly, concepts possess no inherent power for initiat-
     ing change; God’s Spirit, however, working through human hearts,
     constitutes the irreplaceable element necessary for conversion.


Read John 16:7–14. What is Jesus saying here that helps us to under-
     stand how limited intellectual knowledge is, in and of itself, in the
     understanding and experiencing of true Christianity?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Biblical knowledge coupled together with God’s Divine Spirit form
     the spiritual combination that transforms individuals and societies. The
     disciple-maker must strive for both of these in faith and study.
        Christianity highly regards intelligence, thinking, and imagination.
     The existence of reasoned thought throughout Scripture, the tremen-
     dous respect afforded teachers within Judaism, and the priceless atten-
     tion that scribes devoted to preserving ancient writings all testify to the
     importance of knowledge.
        Christianity is not an irrational faith. Nevertheless, certain elements
     within Christianity have elevated emotion, feeling, and experience
     above knowledge. This mind-set declares that what people believe
     is relatively unimportant because experience alone is meaningful.
     Obedience and adherence to specific truths are deemed relatively
     unimportant; emotion and religious excitement become the measuring
     stick for spiritual genuineness.
        Scripture’s very existence counters this mindless fascination with
     experience. Experience without knowledge becomes a supercharged
     missile without direction. Conversely, knowledge without experience
     becomes lifeless and oftentimes legalistic. True Christian leaders
     understood the need to cultivate both of these elements, not only in
     themselves but in those they disciple.

      Think through all the good reasons that you have for your faith.
      At the same time, what role has experience played? Why do we
      need both?

      _______________________________________________________

               T uesday March 11

      Knowledge and Experience: Part 2
Read Luke 6:20–49. In what ways are both knowledge and experience
      revealed in these texts? That is, how are they blended here in a way
      that shows why both are needed, not only in our own walk with the
      Lord but in disciple-making as well?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Spiritual knowledge is indispensable for spiritual transformation.
      Christ Himself was regarded as the Master Teacher. In open classrooms
      bordered by seashores, mountains, and God’s created wonders, Christ
      disseminated transformative knowledge. The Holy Spirit awakened
      previously seared consciences to accept these truths. Disciple-making
      is incomplete without experience, but experience must be directed by
      knowledge.
         Twenty-first-century disciple-makers must thoroughly acquaint
      themselves with Scripture, the source of authentic spiritual infor-
      mation. Likewise, they should disseminate doctrine and teachings
      without regard to popularity or convenience. God expects seasoned
      believers to withhold nothing, patiently guiding infant converts into
      an ever-expanding understanding and appreciation for the wonderful,
      life-changing truths of Christianity—especially the present truth of the
      three angels’ messages.

In the context of making disciples, what does Jesus say in Luke 6:39 that
      everyone who seeks to make disciples must keep in mind? How can
      we be sure that we are not like that which Jesus is warning about
      here?

        In the end, a combination of knowledge and experience that produces
      unselfish love will be the most potent force for any disciple-maker to
      possess.

     The Early Leaders
       It is of no small interest and importance that in choosing leaders,
     Jesus picked from among the humbler, less-educated class of people.
     Christ did not choose the learning or eloquence of the Sanhedrin.
     Passing by the self-righteous teachers, the Master Worker chose
     humble, unlearned men to proclaim the truths that were to move
     the world. These men He purposed to train and educate as the lead-
     ers of His church. They in turn were to educate others and send
     them out with the gospel message. “That they might have success
     in their work they were to be given the power of the Holy Spirit.
     Not by human might or human wisdom was the gospel to be pro-
     claimed, but by the power of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of
     the Apostles, p. 17.

What do the following texts tell us about why Christ chose the ones
     He did to lead His church, as opposed to those whom many might
     deem as having the qualities needed for leadership? Zeph. 2:3, Matt.
     11:29, Jer. 50:31, Isa. 57:15.

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       We must be careful, though, to not make wrong assumptions about
     why Jesus chose the ones that He did. Jesus was not against the edu-
     cated or learned class; He Himself displayed, at a young age (Luke
     2:46, 47), a great deal of knowledge. It’s just that so often those with
     the most education, wealth, or power aren’t ready to humble themselves
     in the way that people, especially leaders, need to in order for the Lord
     to be able to use them. This is not always the case, of course; the Lord
     did use such men (think of Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea; see also
     Acts 6:7). It just means that so often these types tend not to be open to
     the leading of the Holy Spirit.

      Read 1 Corinthians 9:19 and Philippians 2:3. What traits are
      expressed here, and why are these traits so crucial, not just for
      a leader but for anyone who professes the name of Christ? How
      can we learn to possess these traits in our own lives?

     What Jesus Left
        Future generations testify regarding the success of previous efforts.
     Whenever those efforts generate lasting results, the principles under-
     lying those accomplishments should be studied and replicated. Did
     Christ’s disciple-making methodology produce significant outcomes?
        Of course it did. It changed the world. None of us, in fact, would be
     reading this Bible study guide more than two thousand years later, were
     it not for Christ’s success in His training of the early church leaders.

Read Acts 1. What does this first chapter in the formation of the
     early church show us about the need for God-ordained leaders?
     What were they looking for in a leader? (See vs. 22.) What can
     we take away from this need for ourselves as we seek the right
     leaders?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Jesus established His kingdom and exemplified the principles that
     would perpetuate its growth. Pioneering the pathway through darkness
     to sunrise, Christ selected leaders whose weaknesses were overshad-
     owed by His strength because they completely depended upon Him.
     Although lightly esteemed by the religious leaders and academically
     deficient, they outshined the Pharisees where it counted: transpar-
     ency, humility, dependence, and authenticity. How crucial that all of
     us, whatever our positions in the church, display such characteristics.
     Over time, those who possessed a substantial formal education and an
     elevated social standing became part of the church.
        “As Christ’s representatives the apostles were to make a decided
     impression on the world. The fact that they were humble men would not
     diminish their influence, but increase it; for the minds of their hearers
     would be carried from them to the Saviour, who, though unseen, was
     still working with them. The wonderful teaching of the apostles, their
     words of courage and trust, would assure all that it was not in their own
     power that they worked, but in the power of Christ.”—Ellen G. White,
     The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 22, 23.

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The First Evangelists,” pp. 349–
     358; “The Last Journey From Galilee,” pp. 488–496; and “The Sermon
     on the Mount,” pp. 298–314, in The Desire of Ages. “The Training of
     the Twelve,” pp. 17–24; “The Great Commission,” pp. 25–34; and “The
     Seven Deacons,” pp. 87–96, in The Acts of the Apostles.

         “All over the field of Christ’s labor there were souls awakened to their
      need, and hungering and thirsting for truth. The time had come to send
      the tidings of His love to these longing hearts. To all these the disciples
      were to go as His representatives. The believers would be led to look
      upon them as divinely appointed teachers, and when the Saviour should
      thus be taken from them they would not be left without instructors.
         “On this first tour the disciples were to go only where Jesus had been
      before them, and had made friends. Their preparation for the journey was
      to be of the simplest kind. Nothing must be allowed to divert their minds
      from their great work, or in any way excite opposition and close the door
      for further labor.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 351.


Discussion Questions:
        In class, discuss your answer to Thursday’s final question. What
       can you learn from each other’s answers?

        Read Acts 6:1–6. Why does the incident here reveal one of the
       reasons as to why the church needs good leaders?

        Dwell more on this idea of a balance between experience and
       knowledge in the Christian life. Is it possible that different people
       will need different balances; that is, some people will put more of
       an emphasis on experience than they do on knowledge, while oth-
       ers will focus more on knowledge than they do experience? If so,
       how can we learn to be sensitive to these differences in our efforts
       to make disciples? How can we learn that perhaps what we need
       isn’t exactly what others will need? Also, look at this text: “For
       the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom” (1 Cor.
       1:22). How does this text reveal the differences between knowledge
       and experience?

Mission Possible
   Sister Xiang was riding on the train when a woman had a health emer-
gency. Another woman hurried to help the sick woman, praying over her
and crying, “You should believe in God.” The woman’s words remained
with Sister Xiang, even after she left the train.
   She searched for a Christian church and found a house church. There
she met Jesus and found a peace and a joy she’d never known. But the
house church was far from her home, so she organized a house church
closer to home and invited people to worship there. She became passion-
ate about sharing God’s love with others.
   Then she met some Seventh-day Adventists who showed her from
the Bible that the Sabbath was not Sunday, but Saturday. She read the
Bible texts again and again until she was convinced that the Sabbath was
indeed God’s holy day.
   Sister Xiang eagerly told her fellow believers and friends what she
had discovered. One by one, they joined her in worshiping on Sabbath.
Sister Xiang begged the Adventist church in the nearby city to send
them a teacher. The church sent a layman to study with them. They had
few Bibles and no hymnals, so they copied Bible texts and songs to use.
   The small group of believers quickly grew to more than the house could
hold. They divided and continued to grow. In three years, they established
five churches and several house churches, all led by Sister Xiang.
   The government ordered Sister Xiang to stop the religious meetings.
Day after day, Sister Xiang and another believer went to the government
office of religion and prayed silently for permission to worship together.
Finally, the governor allowed the Adventists to build a church.
   The believers in the area swarmed to help build the church, which was
completed in three months. Several daughter house churches continued
to meet. Within two years, the believers had built five more churches
with congregations from 50 to 500 people.
   Sister Xiang attended lay training classes held in the mother church
in the area. Today, with nine churches, nine house churches, and 800
members, she says that the greatest need continues to be for trained
lay leaders and lay evangelists to help reach the people in neighboring
communities and introduce them to Jesus. “It’s how we grow,” she says.
“They are hungry, but they don’t know that Jesus can fill their every
need. We must tell them.”
   Please pray for the believers in China and around the world; and con-
tinue giving your mission offerings that make mission outreach possible.


Xiang shares God’s love with people in northern China.

      The Harvest and the
      Harvesters


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: John 1:40–46, 4:28–30, Luke
      24:47–53, Acts 1:6–8, Matt. 9:36–38, Luke 15.

Memory Text: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much
      fruit; so shall ye be my disciples” (John 15:8).



      I
          n many respects this week’s study is a continuation of the previous
          lesson. Christ established spiritual leaders for the distinct purpose
          of proclaiming the kingdom of God. The principles and methodol-
      ogy that Jesus employed must remain the spiritual foundation for the
      Christian’s preparation today.
         In other words, modern leadership development theories must never
      supplant the foundation that Christ Himself laid. Whenever hype and
      publicity take precedence over spiritual growth, the results are shal-
      lowness and spiritual sterility. Whenever proselytizing displaces repen-
      tance, conversion, and spiritual transformation, the mission falters.
      Training leaders to conduct membership drives, media blitzes, and pub-
      lic relations campaigns instead of preparing them for spiritual warfare
      is courting disaster. True evangelism and disciple-making are centered
      around (1) the acknowledgment of our sinfulness, (2) genuine heartfelt
      contrition, (3) our unreserved spiritual surrender, and (4) the irrepress-
      ible compulsion to disseminate God’s divine message to others.

      Beggars’ Bread
        Nearing His earthly departure, Christ’s concern focused upon His
      disciples, whom He had selflessly served and deeply loved. They would
      not be abandoned. Although Jesus Himself had to return to heaven, the
      Holy Spirit was commissioned to supply the spiritual intimacy that the
      disciples had enjoyed in His presence. Christ’s instruction regarding
      the Spirit’s work was so valuable that John devotes several chapters
      to its preservation. One defining element was the Spirit’s testimony
      concerning Christ, even though the Spirit would not testify unaided.
      Accompanied by the Spirit, Christ’s disciples would likewise testify
      concerning Jesus’ ministry. God could have commissioned angels,
      unassisted by human beings, to broadcast the gospel. Instead, He
      elected to appoint sinful, erring, unpredictable humans for this sacred
      calling.

Read John 1:40–46; 4:28–30; 15:26, 27; 19:35, 36. What do these texts
      teach us about the ways in which the human and divine work
      together in the winning of souls?

         Evangelism has been defined as “beggars telling other beggars
      where to find bread.” Andrew certainly excelled here. The writings
      of his brother Peter were to be included in Scripture one day, Peter’s
      ministry was chronicled in Acts, and Christ included Peter among
      His three closest associates. Those honors never attended Andrew.
      Nevertheless, he received special recognition for following Christ’s
      simple instruction to lead people to Jesus.
         How many of God’s chosen vessels—prolific leaders in evange-
      lism, administration, and leadership—have been introduced to Christ
      by faithful disciples whose identities, humanly speaking, have long
      been forgotten? Although these people were not prominent them-
      selves, think how crippled God’s work might have been had they
      not faithfully witnessed about Jesus. Christ prepared His disciples
      for greater tasks by first offering simple assignments well within
      their reach. The Samaritan woman, Philip, and Andrew demonstrate
      the power of simple testimonies and heartfelt invitations. We all are
      called to do likewise.


                                                                          97

     When Jesus Urged Patience
Read Luke 24:47–53, Acts 1:6–8, 16:6–10. Why was waiting for the
     Spirit necessary? What was the Spirit’s role in the evangelistic out-
     reach of the primitive church? What encouragement might modern
     believers draw from Paul’s experience when facing frustration?
     What lessons regarding patience and waiting for God’s timing are
     suggested within these passages?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Through discourse and example, Jesus taught His disciples patience.
     Facing bigotry, ignorance, misunderstanding, and outright conspir-
     acy, Christ nonetheless patiently persevered. Such perseverance was
     anchored by Christ’s complete dependence upon God’s divine Spirit.
     Jesus understood that unless these disciples should likewise experi-
     ence this dependence, the kingdom’s advancement was seriously jeop-
     ardized. Conversely, should they learn this lesson at the outset, their
     future ministry would be destined for heavenly attainments. Therefore,
     His departing command was “Wait.”
       Christ desires that modern believers master that lesson also. Well-
     intentioned but self-confident Christians, when unwilling to patiently
     await the Spirit’s guidance, can embarrass themselves and God’s king-
     dom.
       The apostle Paul drafted ambitious plans for entering Bithynia; but
     even headstrong Paul was sensitive to God’s leading and accepted rather
     than resisted the Spirit’s interference. The apostle willingly received
     the Spirit’s directive that sent him to Macedonia instead. Numerous
     miracles attended his efforts there. Had Paul rushed headlong with his
     designs, the European mission might have stalled indefinitely.

      How can our anxious spirits be calmed to wait patiently for the
      Spirit’s leading? What practical things should modern believ-
      ers do in their attempts to cultivate such patience? What does
      patient, prayerful trust indicate regarding our relationship with
      God?

     Exercising Authority
Compare the following passages: Mark 6:7–13, Matt. 16:14–19, 18:17–
     20, 28:18–20, John 20:21–23. What do these verses tell us about the
     kind of authority that Jesus’ disciples had? What does this mean
     for us today?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       “Peter had expressed the truth which is the foundation of the church’s
     faith, and Jesus now honored him as the representative of the whole
     body of believers. He said, ‘I will give unto thee the keys of the king-
     dom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
     in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
     heaven.’
       “ ‘The keys of the kingdom of heaven’ are the words of Christ. All
     the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These words
     have power to open and to shut heaven. They declare the conditions
     upon which men are received or rejected. Thus the work of those who
     preach God’s word is a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.
     Theirs is a mission weighted with eternal results.”—Ellen G. White,
     The Desire of Ages, pp. 413, 414.
       As the Father commissioned Jesus, so Christ commissions His
     disciples. Through the Spirit, the Father invested Christ with divine
     power. Through the Spirit, Jesus likewise invests His disciples with
     divine power commensurate with their earthly assignments. No fol-
     lower should fear that Christ has shortchanged them. Every neces-
     sary skill, talent, capability, and strength has been supplied.
       Sometimes human leadership fails to recognize the principles
     involved. Whenever leaders assign tasks without extending com-
     mensurate power, failure is predictable. Often leaders’ insecurities
     surface through controlling behaviors that subjugate the thoughts,
     God-ordained creativity, and individuality of others. Thus emascu-
     lated, the subjugated disciple fails to be effective. Such behavior
     would look like a conductor attempting to play every instrument
     simultaneously instead of conducting a symphony.
       Jesus’ example speaks volumes here. If anyone ever possessed
     the right to withhold authority and dictate behavior, Christ certainly
     did. Instead, He invested others with authority, commissioned them
     to labor outside of His presence where His only influence would be
     His instruction and examples and sent them to minister and witness.

                                                                          99

      Laborers for the Harvest
        “But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
      on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep
      having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest
      truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the
      Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his har-
      vest” (Matt. 9:36–38). What important message can we take from
      these verses for ourselves, today, and for the task ahead of us?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         The spiritual harvest overflowed, but harvesters were scarce. The
      heart soil had been prepared, the spiritual seed had been planted;
      germination, plentiful moisture, and abundant sunshine spurred unbe-
      lievable growth. Ripened souls awaited harvesting, but where were
      the harvesters? Utilizing simple, easily understood word-pictures,
      Jesus sought to inspire contagious zeal.
         Sometimes Christians covet their fellowship with other believ-
      ers and cluster together, blindly bypassing worldly seekers who are
      ripened for harvest. Perhaps not realizing their divine accountability
      for perishing souls, they busy themselves with church engagements,
      civic responsibilities, building maintenance, and other worthwhile
      projects dedicated to preserving the status quo. These are doubtless
      good things. Well-intentioned members sometimes question the value
      of evangelism or express this sentiment: “Pastor, this evangelism stuff
      is all right, but don’t we need programs for people who are already
      in church?”
         This is a fair enough question, though one must also ask, “When
      did Jesus ever lament the shortage of grain preservers?” Instead,
      “more harvesters” was His prayerful plea.

       How can we find the right balance between ministering to the
       needs of those in the church and at the same time not neglecting
       outreach?

Lost and Found
   Through teaching and personal example, Jesus taught His disciples
to associate with sinners, even notorious ones such as prostitutes
and tax collectors. How else would they disciple the whole world?
His teaching often focused on these sinners. His characteri­zation of
them as “lost” demonstrates how merciful Christ was. He might have
characterized them as “rebellious” (they certainly were) or “depraved.”
Instead, He chose “lost.”
   Lost doesn’t carry the same negative connotations that are con-
tained in those other words. Rather than castigating fallen souls,
we should follow Christ’s example. Lost is a generous description,
because the responsibility is placed upon the finders. Disparaging
remarks drive lost people away. Neutral language conveys acceptance
and the possibility for relationship. We therefore must be careful not
only about the language we speak, but even about the words we think,
because our thoughts will greatly impact our attitudes toward others.
   Throughout the Gospels, Jesus encourages believers to become
finders. He wants us to love and to reach out to the lost, regardless of
the kind of people they are or the kind of lives they live.
   “This is the service that God has chosen—‘to loose the bands of
wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go
free, and that ye break every yoke, . . . and that thou hide not thyself
from thine own flesh.’ Isa. 58:6, 7. When you see yourselves as sin-
ners saved only by the love of your heavenly Father, you will have
tender pity for others who are suffering in sin. You will no longer
meet misery and repentance with jealousy and censure. When the
ice of selfishness is melted from your hearts, you will be in sym-
pathy with God, and will share His joy in the saving of the lost.”
—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 210, 211.


 Study Luke 15. What essential message comes through in all
 these parables? What should this message say to us about the
 way in which God views the lost and what our responsibility to
 them is?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Last Journey From
      Galilee,” pp. 488–496; “Who Is the Greatest?” pp. 436–440, in The
      Desire of Ages; “The Training of the Twelve,” pp. 17–24; “The Great
      Commission,” pp. 25–34; “Pentecost,” pp. 35–46; “The Gift of the
      Spirit,” pp. 47–56, in The Acts of the Apostles.

        “The disciples felt their spiritual need and cried to the Lord for the
      holy unction that was to fit them for the work of soul saving. They did
      not ask for a blessing for themselves merely. They were weighted with
      the burden of the salvation of souls. They realized that the gospel was
      to be carried to the world, and they claimed the power that Christ had
      promised.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 37.


Discussion Questions:
        What principles from Christ’s training methodology should
       modern teachers of disciple-making utilize? Imagine what such
       training would look like in your church.

        In Thursday’s study, we looked at the question of language
       and the way in which language is used. Think through the kind of
       words that we, as Seventh-day Adventists, often use. Though we
       might view the words in a certain way, think about how others who
       are not familiar with our terms might understand those words. In
       what ways might we need to be more careful about our choice of
       words, especially with those whom we are seeking to reach?

        Dwell more on the image we saw earlier about “beggars telling
       other beggars” where to get bread. How does this so accurately
       depict that which witnessing and outreach are all about? Why is it
       important that we do not forget that image and what it means?

        What about your local church? Is it more focused on itself and
       its own needs or on outreach? How can a focus on outreach help
       the church? Or, to express it another way, if your church were
       more focused on witnessing and outreach, might it be less con-
       cerned about its own needs? How might outreach itself solve those
       needs?

Don’t Be Ashamed
   “If you insist on joining another church, you will no longer live with
me,” my auntie told me firmly.
   After my parents died, my brother and I lived with our aunt. She had
sent us to a Seventh-dayAdventist school so we’d have a Christian educa-
tion. But she didn’t expect me to become an Adventist. I tried to explain
that I was following God’s command. But she said, “Not as long as you
live in my house!”
   When I told the Bible teacher what my aunt had said, he responded,
“Following Jesus must be your own decision.” I asked if I could be bap-
tized in secret so my aunt wouldn’t know, but he gently said, “Baptism
declares to the whole world your decision to follow Jesus. A secret bap-
tism means that you are ashamed of your faith.”
   He was right. I realized that I didn’t have to fear. That night I told
my aunt that I planned to be baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist
Church.
   My baptism was a joyful service. But when I returned home after
church, my aunt asked, “Were you baptized today?” I told her Yes, hop-
ing her heart had softened. “Then why did you come back here?” she
asked.
   On Monday I asked the school principal what to do. Exams were
coming up, and I needed to focus on doing well. The principal arranged
for me to stay in the dormitory at school so I could finish my year and
take the exams. But when school was over, I again had no place to live.
   I stayed with some friends for a few days while I looked for a solu-
tion. The pastor suggested that we talk to my aunt. But when the pastor
tried to talk to her, she wouldn’t listen. She blamed him for my situa-
tion. “Get out of my house! Both of you!” she shouted.
   The pastor and his wife invited me to live with them. What a bless-
                             ing! They have shown me so much about
                             God’s love. I’m so glad I decided to fol-
                             low Jesus and be baptized. While it was
                             difficult, it has been worth it. I pray that
                             Jesus will touch the lives of my aunt and
                             my brother and that they can find the same
                             happiness I have found.
                               I’m grateful for the Adventist school
                             where I learned to love and obey Jesus. Your
                             mission offerings make a difference every
                             day in thousands of lives. Thank you!

      The Cost of Discipleship




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 12:49–53; Deut. 21:15;
      1 Cor. 9:24–27; Matt. 18:8, 9; John 14:1–3; Heb. 11:32–12:4.

Memory Text: “Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that
      as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort”
      (2 Corinthians 1:7, ESV).



      T
              hroughout history, nameless millions willingly sacrificed their
              lives for Christ. They were imprisoned, tortured, even executed.
              Millions have foregone employment, suffered ridicule, endured
      expulsion from family, and persevered through religious persecution
      rather than forsake Christ. Only God knows the full extent of the suf-
      fering that His faithful ones have endured.
         Of course, Paul forewarned, “Indeed, all who desire to live a godly
      life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tim. 3:12, ESV). And Peter
      said, “For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered
      for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps”
      (1 Pet. 2:21, ESV).
         Despite the promises of the so-called “prosperity” preachers, luxuri-
      ous automobiles and financial gain are not automatic embellishments
      afforded to believers.
         In the end, we can be sure that whatever the cost of discipleship is,
      considering the ultimate reward, that cost is cheap enough.

     Calculating Cost: First Priority
Study Luke 12:49–53; 14:25, 26; Matthew 10:37. In what way are we
     to understand these strong words? What is Jesus telling us here?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Modern television newscasters would have concocted a prominent
     scandal from these words: “Today, celebrated religious leader Jesus
     of Nazareth advocated familial hatred during His afternoon address.
     Analysts are comparing these current pronouncements with previously
     released statements that promoted loving relationships with neighbors
     and enemies. Informed commentators wonder if this indicates recent
     policy shifts. Other unconfirmed quotations suggest selling everything
     and turning the proceeds over to the Jesus movement. Stay tuned for
     further developments.”
        A closer study of the Bible and the way in which the word hate is
     used helps to clarify what Jesus meant. Deuteronomy 21:15 contains
     Mosaic legislation regarding men with multiple wives. The King James
     Version, following the natural sense, translates thus: “one beloved and
     another hated,” concerning those wives. Moses’ point is that if the
     husband favors one wife above others, he cannot deprive those less
     favored. The New Revised Standard Version and Modern Language
     Bible change the terminology rendering beloved with loved and hated
     with disliked. The Tanakh (Jewish Bible) and the New American
     Standard Bible (Protestant) settle on loved and unloved. Clearly, the
     intended understanding was relative affection. Hatred in this context
     may indicate “loving less.” Matthew 10:37, the parallel passage, cer-
     tainly lends credibility to this suggestion.
        Jesus’ point is simple yet full of deep implications. Whenever family
     receives precedence and Christ becomes secondary, Jesus relinquishes
     lordship. Serving multiple masters is impossible. Christ certainly sup-
     ported strong family connections. Such connections, however, receive
     strength from unshakable foundations. That foundation means loving
     God unreservedly, first and foremost. God disallows every barrier, inter-
     ruption, or distraction. Discipleship exacts the supreme price: undivided
     loyalty to Christ.

      How do we, on a daily, practical level, put Christ before everyone,
      including family? What does it mean to do just that, and what
      could be some of the consequences?

      Bearing Our Cross
        “And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, can-
      not be my disciple” (Luke 14:27).

        Discipleship means accepting Christ as Savior and Lord. Following
      Jesus means that you are ready to undergo the same suffering that
      Christ did. Thus, we must be honest in the way in which we present
      our message. Certainly the glorious truths of righteousness by faith,
      Christ’s forgiveness, Jesus’ imminent return, heaven’s incomparable
      wonders, and God’s unmerited grace should be taught.
        But should believers desire to proclaim God’s complete message,
      they cannot overlook cross-bearing. Sadly, some believers erroneously
      think that preaching any message whereby human beings are called into
      action is legalistic. “Divine grace has accomplished all,” they proudly
      exclaim, “and the human race does nothing except receive it.” Jesus,
      however, disagrees.

Read Matthew 16:21–25; Luke 21:12–19; John 15:17–20; 16:1, 2.
      What should we take away from these texts about the cost of fol-
      lowing Jesus?

        Before baptism, every candidate should understand that Christ
      Himself has assigned him or her a cross, without which they abso-
      lutely cannot become His disciple. Does this dampen the joy of
      conversion? Would unrealistically promising them carefree lives
      somehow increase this joy? Conversion releases believers from the
      burdens of sin, not from the responsibilities of discipleship. By tak-
      ing the name of Christ and by publicly revealing that choice through
      baptism, every believer must be aware that discipleship comes with
      a cost. What, though, does this world offer that makes what Christ
      offers not worth it? Nothing.

       When was the last time that you took up your cross? What was
       the experience like? What did you learn from it that could help
       someone else struggling with a similar challenge?

     Disciplined Response
Analyze the following passages: Luke 14:31–33, 1 Cor. 9:24–27, Heb.
     12:1–4, 2 Pet. 1:5–11. What are these texts telling us about the life
     of a disciple? How have you experienced the reality of what the
     Bible tells us here?

     _________________________________________________________

        The cost of discipleship involves discipline. Every impulse, every
     imagination, every ambition, and every desire must be submitted to
     Christ. Every possession, physical or invisible, every talent and ability,
     and everything of value must be under Christ’s command. What we
     don’t surrender to Him can, and inevitably will, become an idol, with
     the potential to lead us astray.
        Christ indeed offers us the power to overcome our character defects.
     Every appetite, emotion, and intellectual inclination can be under the
     guidance of His Spirit.
        Notice the athletic example that Paul used in some of the texts for
     today. No athlete conspires to run slower, jump lower, or throw shorter.
     No believer should look backward either, especially when that which is
     at stake in the “race” is something that’s eternal, as opposed to whatever
     prize an earthly runner might win as a result of all his or her diligent
     effort and training.
        “The runners put aside every indulgence that would tend to weaken
     the physical powers, and by severe and continuous discipline trained
     their muscles to strength and endurance, that when the day of the con-
     test should arrive, they might put the heaviest tax upon their powers.
     How much more important that the Christian, whose eternal interests
     are at stake, bring appetite and passion under subjection to reason and
     the will of God! Never must he allow his attention to be diverted by
     amusements, luxuries, or ease. All his habits and passions must be
     brought under the strictest discipline. Reason, enlightened by the teach-
     ings of God’s word and guided by His Spirit, must hold the reins of
     control.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 311.
                                                                          107

      Comparing Costs
         Corporations explore the viability of proposed projects through cost-
      benefit analysis. Do specific proposals contain the ingredients neces-
      sary for bringing successful returns on investments? Does the benefit
      outweigh the outlay? Another frequently used measurement is durabil-
      ity. Does the proposal offer sustainable returns?
         The rewards of discipleship may likewise be measured through com-
      parison with the costs. Those costs may include emotional suffering,
      social rejection, physical torture, financial deprivation, imprisonment,
      and death itself. Everyone who undertakes discipleship should first
      consider carefully the investments involved.

What do the following texts tell us about some of the costs of disciple-
      ship? Matt. 18:8, 9; Luke 6:35; Phil. 2:3.

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

What do the following texts say about the benefits? Luke 18:28–30, John
      14:1–3, Rev. 22:1–5.

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        There is no question that the cost of following Jesus can be high, per-
      haps the costliest thing that anyone can do. Indeed, we should question
      the reality of our faith and our commitment if following Christ hasn’t
      cost a lot, maybe even everything.
        But one thing is sure: whatever we gain in this life, whatever we
      accomplish, whatever we make for ourselves, it is only temporary. It is
      something that will not last. It will vanish and vanish forever.
        In contrast, what we gain through Jesus—eternal life in a new heaven
      and new earth—is by far worth more than anything and everything that
      this world could ever offer us.

       Think through all the pleasures, all the joys and good things of
       this world here and now. What are they in comparison to eter-
       nity with Christ? How can we learn always to keep this contrast
       before us? Why is it important that we do so?

     A Better Resurrection
Read Hebrews 11:32–12:4. What do these verses say to you, personally,
     about the cost and the reward of discipleship?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        What a powerful concept this passage reveals, especially in the verse
     that says: “Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were
     tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better res-
     urrection” (Heb. 11:35, NKJV).
        In a sense, being both a disciple and disciple-maker can be boiled
     down to one thing: “a better resurrection.” We follow Christ because
     we have the promise, the hope, of redemption, of a new life in a new
     world, one without sin, suffering, and death. At the same time, because
     we have been given this hope, this promise—made certain by the life,
     death, resurrection, and high-priestly ministry of Jesus—we seek to
     point others to the same hope, the same promise. In the end, before
     the great controversy is over, we will either face the first or the second
     resurrection. We know, for sure, which is the better one. What else mat-
     ters other than not only being in that resurrection ourselves, but doing
     whatever we can to lead others to it, as well?
        The harvest has ripened; millions await the call to discipleship. We
     have been blessed not only with the gospel but the gospel in the context
     of the “present truth”—the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14,
     God’s last warning message to the world.
        What are we going to do with these truths that we love so much?
     Thus, we ask, Where are the reapers? Where are those willing to come
     alongside Christ and share the risks? Will you accept God’s invitation
     not to only be a disciple but to make disciples, regardless of the cost
     to yourself?

      Think through the implications of the first resurrection and of
      the second resurrection. In light of these options, what else mat-
      ters other than being in the better one and helping others to get
      there too?

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “In the Regions Beyond,” pp. 219,
      220; “Berea and Athens,” pp. 241, 242, in The Acts of the Apostles.

         “Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken
      up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring
      flames burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire.
      The day has come that shall burn as an oven. The elements melt with
      fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein are burned
      up. Malachi 4:1; 2 Peter 3:10. The earth’s surface seems one molten
      mass—a vast, seething lake of fire. It is the time of the judgment and
      perdition of ungodly men—‘the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the
      year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.’ Isaiah 34:8.
         “The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. Proverbs 11:31.
      They ‘shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up,
      saith the Lord of hosts.’ Malachi 4:1. Some are destroyed as in a
      moment, while others suffer many days. All are punished ‘according to
      their deeds.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 672, 673.

Discussion Question:
        Dietrich Bonhoeffer, whose Christian faith led to his death,
       wrote a famous book called The Cost of Discipleship (New York:
       Collier Books, 1963). Below are some quotes from the book. How
       do these fit in with what we have studied this week?
          “The old life is left behind, and completely surrendered. The
       disciple is dragged out of his relative security into a life of absolute
       insecurity (that is, in truth, into the absolute security and safety of
       the fellowship of Jesus).”—Pages 62, 63.
          “If we would follow Jesus we must take certain definite steps.
       The first step, which follows the call, cuts the disciple off from his
       previous existence.”—Pages 66, 67.
          “The cross is laid on every Christian. The first Christ-suffering
       which every man must experience is the call to abandon the
       attachments of this world. . . . When Christ calls a man, he bids
       him come and die.”—Page 99.

The Carpenter’s Tools:
An Allegory
   Some tools lived together in a carpenter’s shop. They were having
some problems getting along, and some complained that others were not
doing their share of work. They met to discuss their issues.
   The Hammer spoke first, for he served as the chairman. “Brother Drill,”
he began, “you and your family are so noisy. And you seem to spin in
circles, but go nowhere.”
   The Drill quickly spoke up. “It’s true that I go around in circles, and my
work makes noise. But at least I’m sharp. Pencil is small and often so dull
that he makes a bad impression. He needs to be sharpened a bit if he expects
to be of any use around here.”
   Pencil felt defensive and spoke up. “Yes,” he began, “I am a little blunt
at times, but it’s because I work hard at my job. At least I’m not rough like
Sandpaper here. It seems all he does is rub things the wrong way!”
   That remark made Sandpaper really angry. “Hey, what about Ruler here?
He measures others by his standards, as though he is the only one right
around here.”
   Ruler surveyed the group and said, “I’ll go if I have to, but then so must
the Screwdriver. He’s so annoying, always tightening here and loosening
there.”
   Screwdriver angrily spat out, “Fine with me! I’ll go, but Plane must go,
too. His work is superficial; there’s no depth to it!” he said.
   To this, Plane leveled his terse reply, “Saw’s cuts hurt. She divides instead
of unifies.”
   Saw rose up to answer these accusations when suddenly a noise at the
door stopped all conversation.
   The Carpenter walked in, ready to begin the day’s work. He put on His
tool belt and stepped to the workbench. He picked up the pencil and ruler.
Carefully he measured and marked the wood before him. He sawed along
the marks and then planed the cut edges of the wood to smooth the rough
edges. He hammered joints into place and drilled holes for screws to make
the piece sturdy. Then he sandpapered the wood to a silky smoothness. All
day long He worked, using first one tool and then another.
   At the end of the day, He gave a hearty blow and blew the dust from
the finished product. And then He said, “Beautiful! I couldn’t have done it
without my tools. Each one had an important role to play. No one tool could
have done all the jobs. They’re all important.”
   When we work together, going, praying, and giving, we are the Master’s
tools to finish His work.

2014    Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter
          Love rests on freedom, and freedom rests on law. Hence, the core of
       God’s government—the foundation of that government, a government
       of love—has to be His law. The attack on the law is an attack not just
       on Christ’s character but on the moral order of the creation itself.
          The topic for the second quarter 2014 is Christ and His Law, writ-
       ten by Keith Burton. We will study the law, especially the question
       of why so many Christians have fallen into the trap of denying the
       continued validity of the Ten Commandments and thus, unwittingly,
       have helped in the attempt to “overthrow” the law. The Bible, though,
       is clear: “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments”
       (1 John 5:3). The link between our loving God and keeping His com-
       mandments is stronger than we realize. We love God because we
       live in a universe where love can exist. And it can exist because the
       universe is moral, and that morality is based, at least for us as created
       beings, on God’s moral law, the topic of our study for second quarter.
